I am the founder of the YouTube channel \u201c360GameTV\u201d. I discovered my passion for video games very early in the 1980s and since then it is a part of my life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you do on YouTube?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn general, I focus on achievement- and trophyguides for the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, respectively. I upload these guides soon after, if not alongside, the release of certain games. The aim of these videos in particular is to help people getting the collectibles as well as the newest and hardest achievements or trophies in their beloved games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and how does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a crowd-funding platform that offers new opportunities for artists and creators of all sorts of content. It is in fact the easiest way for you to support me. After signing up on the website, you are able to donate an amount of money with which you feel comfortable. This donation is set on a monthly base. Your donated money will eventually be debited from your credit card or PayPal account.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou are able to cancel your support at any time. There are no contractual commitments.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, this is actually a fair question. Running a YouTube channel, of the size and amount of quality you will find on my channel, is almost a full-time job. However, I am not a full-time YouTuber. The only income I make from the channel is from advertising revenue. We all know that these revenues are not very high, due to ad blockers and other applications. This leads to the issue that nearly every big YouTuber relies on his fans.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFurthermore, it is extremely hard to get your hands on game samples distributed by the game publishers in Germany, hence I am forced to buy every game by myself, for which I want to create content. As you might guess, this is very expensive in the long run.\n\tYour support would eventually help me to further create guides on a high level of quality for the newest games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe goal for the future is to develop the channel in a more diverse way by including even more games. On a side note, your support would also help to ease the pressure of being the first to release a guide for a newly released game to get the needed clicks for the advertising revenue. Without this pressure, the quality of my videos would be even higher. It is basically a win-win situation for everyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother point is the new ad-revenue situation on YouTube. Let me tell you a little story on the background of this situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn March 2017, many big companies decided to withdrawal their advertisements from YouTube after finding out that said ads were shown before videos containing racist and/or terroristic content. This led to a massive drop of revenue (up to 90%), affecting many YouTube content creators. This event is commonly known as the \u201eadpocalypse\u201c.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI lost about 50% of revenue in the last months and in the beginning of August YouTube started to change their guidelines and with that, demonetizing videos that, according to their new guidelines, are not ad-friendly anymore. This led to the \u201eadpocalypse 2.0\u201c.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube demonetized more than 400 of my videos and counting. Based on this situation, it is nearly impossible to run a gaming/guide channel relying solely on the revenue from YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a YouTube content creator, I need all the help I can possibly get and I hope that some of you are willing and able to help me out in these hard times.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWill there be giveaway for Patreons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn all honesty,I don\u2019t think so. This is due to the situation of game samples in Germany and as long as this situation doesn\u2019t change, giveaways won\u2019t be a thing. Sorry!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWill your content stay free in the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAbsolutely!
