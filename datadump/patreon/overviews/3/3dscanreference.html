We\u0027ve been offered book deals, worked in top game titles, had our work recognized, even stolen by the biggest names in the industry, like Autodesk to promote their own software. We love being able to capture real life 3D objects for various projects in the VFX, Gaming, and 3d printing industries, and we would love to tap into some new ideas and funding while also continuing to provide amazing data. Join our exclusive community where we will\u00a0provide you with amazing data, and your subscriptions will pay for the time and equipment necessary to give you access to content you won\u0027t get anywhere else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank everyone for stopping by, thank our patrons for their subscriptions to our content, and hopefully you\u0027ll enjoy what you get out this Patreon account.
