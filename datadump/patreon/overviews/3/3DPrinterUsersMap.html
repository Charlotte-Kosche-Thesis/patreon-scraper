    "summary": "The map link is at the bottom of this description.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is setup to raise money for the use of Zeemaps since starting April 1, 2018 they have imposed a limit of 100 views to the map we created for 3d printer users to find each other for assistance and to help others out in their local community. In less than 2 days we had 100 views which maxed us out and we are now needing the help of the 3d printer community to contribute to keeping the map alive. The cost is $20 a month for unlimited views to the map. Any extra money will be put into more years (as in if we get $400 it will allow us to keep the map for 2 years).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started out with a map for just CR10 users but found that most 3d printers are in a way interchangeable with one another such as certain parts or filament. We found that opening the map up to all 3D printing groups would allow us to have a wider range of users and more support across the world. So far the support shown for the map has been overwhelming and myself included have benefited from the map (finding out there was someone 2 hours from me that had the parts I needed to get back to printing that same night). I hope the map grows and the support for it also increases, I am asking those that have put their name on the map and those who are thinking about it to please donate anything to reach our $200 goal. It can even be 1 dollar. With 24K active users in 1 CR10 group alone I don\u0027t see $20 a month being an issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.zeemaps.com/2910094A#\"\u003ehttps://www.zeemaps.com/2910094A\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
