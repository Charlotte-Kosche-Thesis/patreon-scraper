    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003e3ph\u003c/strong\u003e. I am a writer and artist who loves to create questions and frameworks inside which to explore and maybe even answer those questions. Everything I create has this type of framework, even when the question is \"how would these two characters fit together.\" For \u003cstrong\u003eWild Boys\u003c/strong\u003e in particular, those questions became \"What might a sustainable society that encouraged same-sex relations look like?\", \"What does a society need in order to function at its smoothest?\", and \"what are the consequences of those other two answers?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy other work, both written and drawn, tends to be derived from my fascination with the initial stages of love. What are the characters\u0027 ways in to each other\u0027s lives? Hearts? How are those avenues closed off? How do people change? What parts of people don\u0027t? Between fanfiction and some other original work, I like to show how dynamic we all are when facing the whims of fate and its impeccable timing. (For some examples of my work, you can find me at \u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/3phemeral\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eArchive of Our Own\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.y-gallery.net/user/3phemeral/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ey!Gallery\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon-submitted work will probably never be totally NSFW, but may edge in that direction. There will likely be full NSFW versions available elsewhere at \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eno additional cost\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eto anyone who wants to legally view them (and not available at all for anyone who wants to illegally view them). Contributing to my Patreon will only afford you sneak peeks at my work at specific points as I work on it, the heads-up when I\u0027m considering suggestions for what types of illustrations or fics to work on, and might even give you a more real-time glimpse into my process (depending on technological limitations and/or tipping level).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon \u003cstrong\u003edoes not exist as a subscription service,\u003c/strong\u003e it is purely a tipping service. If you want exclusive access to my creative drives, you may commission me outside this site. If your tips ever exceed certain milestones, then you all have my profound thanks! I will have been able to obtain some modicum of alleviation from my financial obligations, and potentially even been able to afford myself some luxury I otherwise would not be able to have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, please consider making your pledge per update your \u003cstrong\u003eintended monthly pledge amount divided by 5\u003c/strong\u003e. I plan to make a maximum of 5 Patreon-flagged/marked/charged updates per month and will \u003cstrong\u003eNEVER\u003c/strong\u003e go above that, so any extra work I get ambitious and make will not come back unexpectedly to your wallet. This way, both you and I can plan around what I do and don\u0027t make, and you get extra content when I\u0027m being prolific and extra money in your wallet when my inspiration runs a little dry!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThank you for sharing your abundances with me. I hope you enjoy the creative abundances I have to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e"
