    "summary": "Hey there Patrons. Thanks for visiting our fundraising page. We\u0027re Pete and Robbie, and we make 30 Minutes West, a podcast of stories exploring the modern relationship with the wilderness. It\u0027s a mix of environmental reporting, campfire storytelling, and wilderness misadventures, produced and curated with the goal of getting listeners to think about the natural world more honestly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support here literally makes the show possible, and we\u0027re on Patreon because it allows us to budget for each episode. When you think of a \"podcast\" you might think of a couple guys sitting around a microphone in their basement pontificating with medium authority on some topic, but this show\u0027s not like that at all. For one, we work in our kitchens. For two, we spend a lot of time\u2014huge amounts of time\u2014out in the world interviewing people more interesting than us. Then we cut down the audio, write and rewrite narration, edit that, design the sound of the episode and ask for feedback. Then we go through that whole process a few times and out pops a story. Each 30-minute show costs around $3,000 to produce in time and travel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe nice thing about funding a show like ours is that your money goes directly towards the stuff you hear. We\u0027re not paying office fees, a tech department, or floating any overhead. If we bring in more money, we make better stories.\u003cbr\u003e"
