Anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eFor quite some time now I have been making all kinds of videos about the cutest popstar or alltogether the best and most popular DIGITAL popstar \"Hatsune Miku\".\u003cbr\u003eBy making videos about her I want to share a bit of that love, the \"Miku magic\" with other people like you!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat videos exactly do I make?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell I could just tell you to go over to my YouTube channel to find out for yourself. But to sum it up, I mainly cover the Hatsune Miku video games (Project Diva series), live events of Hatsune Miku (like Magical Mirai and Miku Expo) and other mixed stuff all about the twin-tailed girl.\u003cbr\u003eCovering the Miku games, I make \"Top 10 lists\" about the hardest songs, best videos and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am lucky enough to be able to go to some Miku events myself and film my impressions of those and then upload what I call an \"event report\" about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my videos also feature \"real life\" scenes of myself in front of the camera, hopefully enriching the videos by some hopefully funny or interesting moments accompanying the topic of the video.\u003cbr\u003eWhy is this interesting? Because \u003cstrong\u003eHatsune Miku herself LIVES in my home\u003c/strong\u003e!!\u003cbr\u003eBetter find out yourself what I mean by that! ;-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yeah that is basically a good summary of what I do?\u003cbr\u003eI have many other ideas right now and your support will help me realise more of them.\u003cbr\u003eOf course it is nice to get to see people care about your work this way but I would also spend money on upgrading my equipment, like a new camera eventually, getting a new processor for my PC (rendering takes quite long and my editing software can barely handle my videos by now) and most importantly a better internet connection...uploading a 10 minutes long video takes me around 5 hours!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eIf you decide to support me, me AND MIKU will be very grateful and in addition, you can get some cool rewards. Check out what they are, too!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is finally all! I hope you will continue to enjoy my work!\u003cbr\u003eSan-Kyuu for reading!\u003cbr\u003e39dearMIKU"
