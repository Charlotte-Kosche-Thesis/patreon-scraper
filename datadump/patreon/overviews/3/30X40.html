Episodes are primarily focused on architecture and design topics. As an award-winning, practicing residential architect I review building products, architecture books, materials + systems, and provide design tutorials illustrated with current on-the-boards residential projects I\u0027m designing. I reveal the process and thinking behind the making of architecture and offer a behind-the-scenes looks at how I practice residential architecture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach finished video ranges from between 3 and 15 mins, but\u00a0takes between 4 and 5 hours\u003c/strong\u003e to research, compile, record, interview, edit, format, produce and share. As a sole-proprietor, these tasks all fall to me to complete. I really enjoy producing the videos and the creative energy it requires, but your support is much appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be a new video released every Wednesday, four videos per month.\u00a0I will only ever flag 4 episodes per month as Patreon paid events; any additional videos (such as the milestone goal viewer question videos) will be free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBy pledging and supporting, you become a more involved member of the subscriber audience\u003c/em\u003e and I look forward to hearing your suggestions for future topics and ways to improve the value of the content I produce. Many thanks + cheers...!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeed more details...?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow - precisely - does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach month I publish 4 YouTube videos to 30X40 Design\nWorkshop\u2019s channel. When I do, I share that video here and flag it as content\nthat you\u0027re supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs an example,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eif you pledge $1 per video and I publish\n4 videos (1 episode per week), you\u0027ll contribute $4 for that month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re concerned about going over a set dollar amount, you can set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment\ninfo. That way it works with any budget and there are no surprises at the end of the month. Don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content if you do choose to set a limit. You\u2019ll still continue to get the YouTube videos\neven if I publish additional content that exceed your maximum contribution\nlimit for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour support enables me to produce higher-quality free YouTube\ncontent. Being a patron means you\u2019re investing in my work, building something\nbigger that everyone can benefit from.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt takes an enormous investment of my time and personal\nresources to curate, record, edit, publish and share this weekly video content, all of which\nrequire money. Your support helps purchase recording equipment, software, and Internet access fees (I live on an island where cell phones provide our only Internet connection\u2026)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nI want to help, but I just can\u2019t afford this right now.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI completely understand. This is a\ncompletely voluntary campaign. If you can help, fantastic...thanks! Please don\u0027t become a patron if\nyou\u0027re struggling financially. I will continue to make these videos available\nfor free as a both a creative outlet and a way to help others learn about\narchitecture. \u003cbr\u003e"
