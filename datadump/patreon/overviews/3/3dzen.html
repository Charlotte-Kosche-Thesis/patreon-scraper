He did and then I started to put\nthem up for sale with the online stores Affect3D and Renderotica. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am using Daz Studio, Octane, C4D and Vray and continuously learning for as long as I do this, my main goal is to\nimprove and create better imagery and animations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e The desire to put more\nfocus into the creation of 3D and with your support, make it my full time work/job. Currently doing this as a business is not realistic; mainly due to\nthe piracy of image sets that are up on torrent sites within hours no matter\nhow much effort I spend trying to get them to stop or take down my content. So\nrather than download from them please support my efforts here and don\u0027t risk\ngoing to those sites at all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am hoping Patreon will allow me\nmore time to produce content through your patronage, learn more advanced\nskills, grow in popularity and get you more of what you want! If it works out\nthen quality and quantity will rise. In short, please make a donation, even a\n$1 a month can add up and help me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour part in all this?\u003c/strong\u003e Because of\nyour generosity I will be able to bring you more content for your viewing\npleasure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
