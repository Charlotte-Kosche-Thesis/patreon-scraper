    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, thank you for taking the time to read these words. That\u0027s incredibly kind of you, and deserving of massive high fives!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, producing content for the 3D Printing Nerd channel on YouTube isn\u0027t easy, and I don\u0027t take the responsibility lightly. More often than not, shooting the footage for videos doesn\u0027t happen until everyone else in the house is asleep - meaning most of the time I don\u0027t start shooting content until it\u0027s close to midnight. Sometimes I don\u0027t get to start until after midnight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, science has yet to discover time travel, and I\u0027ve yet to get a visit from The Doctor and ask permission to borrow the TARDIS. This means the morning still arrives on schedule, regardless of when I\u0027m able to wrap shooting the previous night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat schedule is extremely tough, but, I keep going for two very specific reasons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1). This is my passion. I absolutely love 3d printing, and how it\u0027s going to help shape the future. I\u0027m excited to watch as school curriculum adapts to this technology. I\u0027m excited when I see companies announce new products and new breakthroughs. I\u0027m excited to know that my children will grow up in a future where the wonders of this technology aren\u0027t even yet conceivable by us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2). People like what I do. My subscriber count is growing quickly on YouTube, and I get an incredible amount of positive comments. I\u0027m told my videos help, and teach, and provide a method for people to learn. I\u0027m told I have a good voice, and I\u0027m able to convey my thoughts on camera in a way that anyone can understand them. People I do not know end their conversations with me with a high five, and that warms my heart every time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds generated from this Patreon will be put right back into creating better content for this channel. I promise, in no way is contributing to my Patreon required. If you have a few spare dollars a month, and you personally feel the content I create is worth a few dollars a month TO YOU, then I appreciate the support. If my Patreon grows and find this is something many people use, I will start to explore Patreon-only content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, high five!"
