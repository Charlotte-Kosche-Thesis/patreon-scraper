My name is \u003cstrong\u003eDennis Huddleston\u003c/strong\u003e and I record ambient music under the alias \u003cstrong\u003e36 \u003c/strong\u003eand techno music under the alias \u003cstrong\u003eSYNE\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve been releasing music for over 10 years now, on quite a few popular ambient/electronic labels like \u003cem\u003eUltimae\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eMystic \u0026amp; Quantum\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eA Strangely Isolated Place\u003c/em\u003e, but I mostly focus on my own label, \u003cem\u003e3six Recordings\u003c/em\u003e, which is where the bulk of my discography is published.\u00a0You can hear my entire discography over at \u003ca href=\"https://3six.bandcamp.com/\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroducing the 36 Audio Diary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people don\u0027t realise that by the time a record is released, it is often years old and doesn\u0027t actually represent the artists current creative headspace. This doesn\u0027t take away from the actual quality of the music of course (a good record should always be timeless), but we\u0027re living in an age where it\u0027s perfectly possible to upload music the moment it\u0027s finished. If the music is good enough, why bother waiting? Who exactly does this benefit?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what drove me to the concept of a \u003cem\u003e36 Audio Diary\u003c/em\u003e. Free from manufacturing delays, free from label schedules, free from creating artwork, free from endlessly obsessing over track selections for an arbitrary 60 minute album format... It\u0027s my way to release new music whenever I feel I have something worth listening to, with nothing else getting in the way. There are no strict time limits for when tunes should be uploaded - I\u0027ll simply upload tunes I 100% believe in, the moment I feel they\u0027re ready. Patreon users can download them at full studio quality (in MP3, FLAC or 24bit WAV formats) and everyone who doesn\u0027t donate can simply stream them for free on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/3six/sets/audio-diary-patreon-series\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set the minimum donation price at \u003cem\u003e$1/month\u003c/em\u003e because I know these are trying times and I\u0027d like as many people as possible to be able to get involved. Anyone who donates more will of course have my eternal gratitude!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis Audio Diary will run for 12 months, starting from April 2018\u003c/em\u003e. Depending on the success of this project, I may consider extending it further. I won\u0027t be creating music for anything other than this project during this time-frame. The only music that will be released outside Patreon are upcoming music projects, which I already signed contracts for. These will be released as normal on all the usual platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and know that I appreciate every single one of you, whether you donate or not. I wouldn\u0027t have been able to keep making music this long without your kind support, so from the bottom of my heart, cheers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDennis / 36\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
