    "summary": "Hello gamers! Thanks for checking out our Patreon, and for listening to Three Moves Ahead. We\u0027ve been doing a weekly podcast about strategy games and wargames for over six years now, covering some of gaming\u0027s richest genres with expert discussion from critics and loads of great guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show has grown a great deal in the last few years, there are a lot more listeners now than there used to be, and some of the voices on the podcast have changed as well, but our commitment to informed debate and analysis has never wavered. Much like our love for Alpha Centauri.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few listeners have asked us how they could support us, and Patreon seems like the perfect answer. We also have some exciting plans for the future of Three Moves Ahead that go beyond the weekly podcast you already enjoy, but to get there we need a little help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PbkkOaj.png\" style=\"width: 650px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, we want to do a \"Paradox Special\" every month in addition to our four main shows. There\u0027s always a heavy demand for more Paradox shows, and a few of our panel are always in the middle of some new expansion or multiplayer debacle, so we always have a lot to say about how the Paradox lineup is evolving and changing. These are some of our most popular shows, but sometimes we also feel like we spend so much time covering our Paradox bases that we miss-out on other interesting games in in strategy and wargaming. This way, we get to give you the detailed Paradox-related analysis and griping we both love, but without taking the focus away from the rest of 3MA\u0027s strategic turf.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gj09lRg.png\" style=\"width: 645px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, we\u0027ve always thought we could do a great history book club if only we had the time and opportunity. A few of our best shows have been based as much around the books we\u0027re reading as the games we are playing. A monthly history book club podcast would be a great way to share and discuss some of our favorite historical works with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of that takes time to plan and organize. So does Three Moves Ahead, for that matter. While we love doing the show, the opportunity cost for each episode has gone up, especially since only Rob is still a full-time freelancer and critic. We\u0027re at a point where we need a little fan support to keep doing our best work, and to expand Three Moves Ahead in some of the ways we\u0027ve always wanted to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you are a regular listener and feel the podcast is worth something to you every month, please consider making a monthly contribution, and hopefully we\u0027ll pay it back with even more of the great shows and conversations you\u0027ve come to expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Me3jTE1.png\" style=\"width: 640px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Is anything changing with the podcast? I am suspicious of change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: No, except that hopefully we get a chance to devote a little more time and attention to it. But Three Moves Ahead will continue on as before. Free, every week, regardless of whether or not we hit any funding goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What do you need money for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: We need to exchange it for goods and services!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore seriously, there\u0027s more work that goes into each episode of 3MA than just the hour or so you listen to us talking. Strategy games require a lot of time, and it can be tough to keep up. That\u0027s especially true these days. Rob\u0027s freelance career doesn\u0027t involve as many strategy games as it used to. Bruce is a physician who takes time from his busy schedule to give us his unique perspective on strategy games, and Troy spends his days working full-time for Paradox and his evenings working for the show. \u00a0Michael is a shockingly over-qualified audio engineer who spends a few hours a week putting these episodes together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a little extra income from the podcast would just make everything a little bit easier, and run a little bit smoother.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWhy a special Paradox series of episodes? Isn\u0027t that special treatment for one developer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of our regular panelists are deeply interested in the Paradox games, so it is very easy to assemble a quorum for recording a Paradox show. However, these end up being review shows a lot of time, and don\u0027t always let us dig into some of the oddness that Paradox games present. They are a major developer that has focused on making a range of games that all pose very different questions. It would be nice to have a place to explore that. Download stats reveal that there is a huge interest in us talking about these games. (Rest assured that Troy will, as always, never have anything to do with the Paradox series, just as we never tell him when we play games without him.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the plus side, moving a lot of the Paradox stuff, like episodes on expansions, to a specialized series means we have much more room to talk about games that should be getting more attention on the main Three Moves Ahead show. This will lead to more variety, we hope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What does this mean for ads?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Honestly, this is something we\u0027ll have to feel out. Right now we get \u003cem\u003every \u003c/em\u003efew ad-buys that meet our criteria, so we don\u0027t feel like it\u0027s an issue really worth addressing right now. If we were running like 2-3 minutes of ads per episode, that\u0027d be a very different discussion. For now, we\u0027re comfortable kicking that can down the road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qVpLRib.png\" style=\"width: 636px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
