Originality, powerful motivation, and a can-do spirit make me think that McGucken is a top bet.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDr. E would go on to heal the blind with his NSF-funded, award-winning Ph.D. dissertation which also laid down the foundations of Light Time Dimension Theory. Over the years, LTD Theory added foundational *physical* postulates, principles, and equations en route to becoming numerous books, with this one forming the simple, illustrated introduction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this commonsense volume penned for the layman and advanced scientist alike, Dr. E\u0027s LTD Theory provides a unifying, foundational *physical* model underlying relativity, quantum mechanics, time and all its arrows and asymmetries, and the second law of thermodynamics. The detailed diagrams demonstrate that the great mysteries of quantum mechanical nonlocality, entanglement, and probability naturally arise from the very same principle that fosters relativity alongside light\u0027s constant velocity, the equivalence of mass and energy, and time dilation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne fine afternoon while Dr. E was lunching with J.A. Wheeler at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), a bespectacled gentleman joined them. Wheeler introduced the fellow as Ed Witten--one of the leading pioneers of string theory and inventor of M-theory. Dr. E had been contemplating pursuing string theory, but there were some finer details he could not wrap his head around. \"Great!\" Dr. E thought to himself, \"This guy can help me along my odyssey!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo halfway through lunch Dr. E asked Dr. Witten, \u201cWhat are string theory\u2019s postulates, principles, and equations?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWitten thought about it, smiled, and said, that well, it depended on who you asked, and well, it was a young theory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Dr. E followed up with, \u201cWhen do you think string theory might get postulates, principles, and equations?\u201d Ed stopped smiling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, instead of studying string theory, Dr. E pursued LTD Theory on that \u201croad less taken,\u201d healing the blind along the way with his award-winning dissertation titled Multiple Unit Artificial Retina Chipset to Aid the Visually Impaired and Enhanced CMOS Phototransistors. In the latter part of the dissertation, Dr. E placed the first iteration of LTD Theory, born of his days studying with the great PJE Peebles, Nobel Laureate Joseph Taylor, and J.A. Wheeler. Like Einstein and Feynman, they were all rugged, kind, intense men who valued hands-on physics and *physical* reality over mere math and mysticism--over spurious speculation and outlandish hype.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike string theory, inflation, multiverse mania, and LQG, LTD Theory is a *physical* theory in the spirit of Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and Einstein. At Princeton Dr. E learned to think of the geometry of spacetime as a physical entity which could bend, curve, and move. He learned to think of the photon as a real, physical entity described as probabilistic, spherically-symmetric wavefront expanding at velocity c. Dr. E learned to think of entanglement as a real, *physical* effect connecting distant entities in an instantaneous relationship, and he learned to think of the second law of thermodynamics not as a mere mathematical formula, but as a foundational, physical law governing the universe. And by thinking of these diverse phenomena in terms of *physical* pictures, Dr. E conceived of LTD Theory--the simple, physical model common to them all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do light, time, the quantum, and relativity all emerge from LTD Theory? Enjoy this epic odyssey as you realize the deeper, foundational, unifying, *physical* model! And too, the book is graced with Dr. E\u0027s fine art landscape photography offering a parallel *physical* celebration of light and time.",
