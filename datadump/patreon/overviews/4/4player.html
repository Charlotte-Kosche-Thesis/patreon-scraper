    "summary": "Greetings! For those of you who don\u0027t know who we are, we are \u003cstrong\u003e4Player Network\u003c/strong\u003e; a wacky group of friends based out of Austin Texas who have been broadcasting and podcasting about the gaming industry since 2007! We are comprised of \u003cstrong\u003eNick Henderson\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eBrad Simons\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eNolan Hedstrom\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eKris Guthridge\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eChris Davis\u003c/strong\u003e, and several other wonderful, part-time contributors across the globe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is 4Player?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4Player Network began eight years ago quite humbily: a podcast made in a living room before a live audience.  Since then we\u2019ve grown to incorporate a successful video game live stream, multiple podcast shows, on-the-ground coverage of big industry events like E3 and PAX and semi-regular video \u00a0production.  But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves here.  So what is 4Player Network?  Well, we like to \u00a0think of it in the form of three distinct pillars which we abide by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodcasts\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe bring you produced audio podcasts about games and entertainment every week starring our host Nick as well has Brad, Nolan and Kris who each bring unique perspectives and gaming habits to the table.  Each podcast is recorded live on our Twitch channel before hundreds of viewers for 2-3 hours per night as we discuss games both new and old, industry news that has appeared that week, address the community in our weekly Chatter of the Week challenge and wrap things up with our signature 4Player Minute.  It\u2019s the product we\u2019re most proud of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day on our Twitch channel we feature a live broadcast of games to entertain our\u00a0audience with.  We haven\u2019t missed a single broadcast night in over seven years and though the schedule varies week to week, we feature multiple personalities from the core 4Player team as well as some of intrepid contributors.  In the past we\u2019ve featured many great live events such as our Subscriber Nights, Terror Tuesday, InebriNATION, Cocktail Time as well as our legendary Project M marathons.  Our passion for gaming is unending and we do our best to bring our audience along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the nearly eight years of our existence, we\u2019ve grown from a modest gaming podcast\u00a0to a huge Twitch channel thanks in no small part to our exciting community of viewers and listeners.  We love these guys and they\u2019re the reason we do our best to keep going in front of a camera with controller in hand every night.  From Your Way Bradturday to Open Game Night, to Chatter of the Week to Community Game Night, we\u2019ve made interacting with and entertaining our audience our most important focus.  In fact, that\u2019s why where here on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, Why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the years since we started, we have recorded more than 400 podcasts, broadcasted our gaming exploits every single day on Twitch.tv (formerly Justin.tv) without fail, traveled to major industry events like E3 and PAX, and we have fostered a devoted community of like-minded people. This project has been a labor of love for us for years and it is something that we have always done while balancing day jobs and maintaining relationships. Why do we do it you ask? Quite simply, we just love what we do! With that said,\u00a0growth, consistency, and success comes with a price tag...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the enormous popularity of Twitch.tv, we have been challenged with finding new ways of engaging\u00a0the community and fostering growth. This project has been a labor of love for us for years. We have all committed to doing this on top of our day jobs and our relationships (at our own risk). In addition, most of our funding has gone only to site maintenance and occasional purchases needed to keep us going. For a long time we\u2019ve looked for a way to entertain you guys more while keeping it cost-effective as a lot of our major expenses (travel, major equipment purchases, etc.) have come from our own pockets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then, along came Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has provided us with an incredible opportunity (and challenge) to do just that!  Patreon provides us a potential revenue stream by which we can improve our broadcast setups, our production quality and provide more entertainment for our viewers and listeners than ever before.  We want to be better and Patreon can help us achieve that goal clearly, transparently and structurally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what about Twitch?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may be thinking \u003cem\u003e\u201chey, I support these guys as a Twitch subscriber, why are they doing a Patreon?  What\u2019s gonna happen to me?\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, nothing is going to change for our Twitch subscribers.  Twitch remains our primary means of entertaining you guys with our nightly broadcasts, live podcast recordings, epic events like Project M\u2026 \u00a0none of these would be possible without the kind folks at the biggest streaming service in the world.\u00a0With that said, there is a certain level of transparency and communication that Patreon brings to the table. If you are already a subscriber on Twitch, don\u0027t fret as you will continue to receive the same benefits that coincide with the $5 Tier here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike what you see?  Then please consider pledging today!  Still skeptical?  That\u2019s ok, we still love you. Why not check out our brand new website at 4PlayerNetwork.com, check out our live stream at 4pp.tv, visit our YouTube channel featuring over 80,000 subscribers or download one of our podcasts?  Go \u00a0there, make an informed decision and come back if you like what we do!  You\u2019ll be safe in knowing that \u003cbr\u003eyour pledge, no matter the size, will go to making our humble little broadcast setup even better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e"
