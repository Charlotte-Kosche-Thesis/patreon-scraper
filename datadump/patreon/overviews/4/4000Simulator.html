This is a free program for windows which recreates the visual presentation of the WeatherSTAR 4000-based Local Forecast segment that was seen on The Weather Channel during the 1990s, using actual current weather forecasts and observations for your location in the lower 48 United States.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project has a well established history of results. Initial work on the first version of the program began in 2001. Since that time, there have been three major releases, with each successive release leaps and bounds ahead of the previous iteration. I am continuing that tradition with my current work on the future version 4 of the program, written in C++/OpenGL, which aims to add cross platform support so the simulator can not only run on Windows, but Mac OSX and linux distros as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in seeing what this program is like and you\u0027re running the Windows Operating System, you can head over to the \u003ca href=\"http://www.taiganet.com/download\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edownload page\u003c/a\u003e to get a copy of the current public release, version 3, right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere have been hundreds, if not thousands of hours of work put into this project over the years, and that work continues with the current development efforts on v4.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support ongoing development or give something back for the enjoyment you\u0027ve had using this program over the years, feel free to make a contribution here on Patreon. Your support will help pay for the project\u0027s website hosting and domain name costs, as well as fund the purchase of necessary development tools and hardware.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease note: By proceeding, you understand that your donations do not entitle you to any right, title, or interest in or to the program and any related works. The program and all related work product shall remain the sole property of the creator and developer as it always has been.\u003c/em\u003e"
