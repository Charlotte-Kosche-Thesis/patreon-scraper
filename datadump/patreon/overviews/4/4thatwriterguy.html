    "summary": "Hello, everyone! I am R Joseph Maas and I\u0027m a writer. If you\u0027ve seen me around the conventions, you know you can call me RJ for short. For those of you whom I\u0027ve yet to meet, I\u0027ve been writing since I was seven years old. I\u0027ve been published in several anthologies in the last few years for my short stories, and I really enjoy my 100% submission to publication ratio. I like to consider that proof that what I write is entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is a compulsion for me. I can\u0027t stop myself. So, how can you help? When you choose to be a patron, I will give access to my stories as they are written. I want to build a community of readers where I can get feedback on my stories and make them better. I want to take my patrons on a journey. No trip ever taken with friends should be for the benefit of just one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you will be getting earliest access to the worlds I build as I build them. You will be helping to support me to create these worlds, to shape them. My greatest hope, and my reason for writing stories, is to share the beautiful, the thrilling, the horrifying, and the fantastic parts of my mind with people that want to read them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first project you can expect here is the novel form of the \u003cu\u003eTales of the God-Hand\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0graphic novel series. Other short stories will get peppered in on a regular basis. All of the content you can expect to get charged for will be a minimum of 1500 words. I want to guarantee that there is a good value in the content and that is why I am promising a minimum length. I also want to ensure you that you will be getting a clean copy. I have a close team of editors that are working behind the scenes with me to correct any mistakes before you see them. Of course, if I miss something, I expect to be chided. Seems fair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I have limited the reward tiers to ensure that we can both get the things we really want from each other, so the choice to give $1, $3, or even $5 per post is entirely up to you. I really want to build a fanbase for my writing, and I know if you have made it this far in to my introduction, you want to read it too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know your patronage is a sign of trust. I appreciate that. I won\u0027t forget it either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome, let me take you on a journey inside my mind. Help me to tell the tales that I have spent a lifetime creating. You won\u0027t regret it.\u003cbr\u003e"
