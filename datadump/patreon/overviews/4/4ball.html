    "summary": "Okay guys, as you know I have started to work on BIG projects, but in order to have time to work them I will need help in paying for my college education. As some of you guys know, my brother was killed on a car accident\u00a0 in 2016. He was my main help in paying for my college and sadly he cannot help me anymore. I\u0027m having troubles paying by myself so this patreon has been open to help pay for my education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCollege here in my country costs me 322 usd per a month during the semester so every dollar you guys can provide for support counts.  If this patron somehow results in a success, I can dedicate less time into running my store and A LOT more time in creating my animations and pictures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBTW, I\u0027m not going to put my finished pics or animations behind a paywall.  However the patreon will be the place where supporters can voice what they want to see and vote on the randomly chosen suggestions as a collective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain this is all going to my college tuition for animation courses. Please support and help me with this endeavor! I have the experience and with your support, I can put it to good use!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
