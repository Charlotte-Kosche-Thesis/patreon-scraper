Regardless of how many times I modified my CV and cover letter to suit the role, I still could get loads of the infamous \"Thank you for your application. We regret to inform you that...\" messages in my inbox. 400contacts reversed this and now it is quite the opposite. I have recently been on a marathon of interviews!

During the interview I used the advantage of weekly tips I learned from this app, most of the questions were from INTERVIEW quest which I was already prepared for the answers.\u00a0Despite it was my first interview in Sweden but nothing was new.

I already worked with Svensk direktreklam and afterward now started working in a restaurant as Kitchen Assistant. I don\u0027t mind at all as a starter. \u003cbr\u003eBut the important thing I learned is, it works when I reached them by phone and went there in person. Contacting the employers directly worked. I must replicate this learning for my upcoming hunt as well.\u00a0Thanks a lot, Andreas Wennberg for putting your effort.
