Here, you can subscribe to our weird and wonderful magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027re Heather McDaid \u0026amp; Laura Jones, two publishing professionals in the UK interested in tackling publishing with new eyes - bringing a mix of voices, stories and topics to you in a well-designed package. We hope you\u0027ll like to join us for the ride. \u003ca href=\"http://404ink.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e404ink.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are we doing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n404 Ink are starting by publishing a literary magazine twice a year, collecting a mix of English and Scottish Gaelic short stories, non-fiction and comics from multiple writers and offering some form of payment on top of the usual subscription, with a view to branching into books down the line. We\u0027re looking to do things a little differently, showcase a broad range of voices and topics, and offer well designed and, hopefully, surprising products.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eTo do all of this, we need support to help bring these voices to you. We not only want to create exciting products, we want to support those who submit even in the smallest way. As with everything, this requires a little money. In return for your support, we\u0027ll be giving you well-designed, exciting lit mags.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e404 Ink also want to know what you love and don\u0027t love about mags. We might even publish based on what \u003cem\u003eyou, \u003c/em\u003eour Patrons, want. We don\u0027t want to be gatekeepers, we want publishing to be a two-way street and what better way to create a collaborative community than through Patreon. (We really like Patreon, can you tell?)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eSign up as a 404 Patron and we will charge your pledged amount twice a year when the new issue of our lit mag is available. We plan for this to happen in November and May of each year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron you\u0027ll have access to super secret Patron-only posts and previews, as well as some more exciting plans afoot further down the line. You can tell us if they\u0027re good ideas or not...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not based in the UK but would like a print copy. Do you post internationally?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, we can post the magazine internationally, though we\u0027d ask you to pledge at the $20 level to help us cover postage costs. Being such a small operation we can\u0027t yet afford to cover postage and packaging outside of the UK. We hope you understand!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that\u0027s all she wrote.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor now.
