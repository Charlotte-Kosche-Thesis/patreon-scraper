    "summary": "Oh, hi! It\u0026#8217;s Tom Scharpling here! What\u0026#8217;s going on? Not a\nlot? Just browsing around the internet looking for places to throw your money?\nWELL HAVE I GOT A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Best Show has been going for a long time and it is the\nfunniest show out there! Anybody will tell you! It\u0026#8217;s the place where Scharpling\n\u0026amp; Wurster do our weekly laff-packed calls, it\u0026#8217;s the home of Gary the\nSquirrel and sound collages and celebrity guests and DogCember and a million\nother great things! You can hear it every Tuesday night live on the internet at\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.TheBestShow.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.TheBestShow.net\u003c/a\u003e and it is\navailable as a podcast the following morning! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe show has always been about the relationship between the\nlisteners and me and Jon Wurster and everyone else associated with the show. We\ndon\u0026#8217;t have the most listeners of any podcast. But when it comes to enthusiasm,\nI will put The Best Show up against anyone\u0026#8217;s podcast. NOBODY HAS BETTER\nLISTENERS THAN THE BEST SHOW!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Best Show is the most creatively satisfying and pure\nthing I have ever been involved in. I have worked hard to preserve it and keep\nit going on along my own terms. Reading ads made sense when we started the new\nversion of the show and I am grateful for the companies that supported us over\nthe last two years. But I think there is a more direct means of the show\nraising money, and it is by establishing a direct line between ME and YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDon\u0026#8217;t forget: we are rolling the dice with this! If we are\ndoing this, we are \u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e doing advertising! People asked for a direct way\nto support the show and now here it is! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd one thing to make clear: THE SHOW WILL STILL BE 100\nPERCENT FREE. THE ARCHIVES WILL BE 100 PERCENT FREE. We are \u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e going\nbehind a paywall or only providing portions of episodes! So I am asking you to\nhelp keep the show free!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe worked hard this past year to make The Best Show as vital\nand unique as it has ever been, and I would put what we did in 2016 against any\nother period of the show. I am insanely proud of what we are building every week.\nWe have places to go and things to do, so help us keep it going! Myself and Jon\nWurster have been doing the show without getting paid. IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD DO\nIF WE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY FROM THIS THING.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am providing different rewards for different support\nlevels! Exclusive content, a new sticker, a fancy pin, crap from the vault and\nmore! But what\u0026#8217;s important is that you do what you can to support the ongoing\nexistence of The Best Show. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for being a part of this!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTom Scharpling\u003cbr\u003e"
