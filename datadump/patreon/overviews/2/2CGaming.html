If you want more monsters, we\u0027ll release a packet of monsters every month.

It takes time, energy, and a whole lot of courage. But without a Dungeon Master, there is no game. We want to encourage veteran Dungeon Masters to keep their campaigns going and make it easier for a novice to take up the mantle themselves and run their first campaign. There\u0027s lot of good advice floating around on the internet about how to be a good DM, but there\u0027s a big gap between a published adventure and a completely custom campaign. We want to help you bridge that gap.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat Else Does 2CGaming Make?\u003c/h4\u003e\nLots of stuff!
