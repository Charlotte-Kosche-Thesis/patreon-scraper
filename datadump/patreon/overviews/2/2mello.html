    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI am Matthew Hopkins, music creator for the Internet\u003c/strong\u003e, known mostly under the name \"2 Mello\". Part of the reason I was given this nickname in high school was because I was calm and collected, but very quiet and standoffish (often to my own detriment). Though I still love this nickname, \u003cstrong\u003ein 2015, I did something that my previous self never would have: I left my day job \u003c/strong\u003eand decided to focus entirely on making music for a living. I want to make it as easy as possible for me to produce as much music for you as I can, and take all opportunities given to me to make 2 Mello a bigger and better name. To do this, I need to work harder than ever before; to show people what I can do and prove that I\u0027m worth supporting as a musician. I want to use Patreon as a method to receive some of that support, and give back, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will never stop making music. \u003c/strong\u003eThis Patreon is not a \"keep 2 Mello making music\" thing, it\u0027s more of a \"make it as easy as possible for 2 Mello to keep making music\" thing. Whether or not I receive support, this is my life\u0027s journey. That said, even a few dollars a month from a handful of lovely people can make so many differences in the way I will live my strictly-budgeted, week-to-week musician\u0027s life. Your money will pay for the cost of living and some food on rougher weeks, but it will also pay for gas to transport me to conventions, concerts and job opportunities, for merch production, for instruments, tech and software licenses to keep me current and innovative. I want as much money as possible received from this Patreon to go towards the music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn 2017, I began a podcast called The Sample Study.\u003c/strong\u003e I have incorporated the podcast into this Patreon as well, but\u00a0similar to the above statement, I do this podcast as a passion and the funding from Patreon will not determine whether it happens or not. However, it definitely helps, as I can do more and more with the podcast as my time frees up and there\u0027s less I have to do besides work on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, this Patreon is not at a level where I can be fully supported\u003c/strong\u003e, but I pay a good deal of bills with it, and it has been very important to me. My patrons basically get to hear everything I release early, sometimes months early.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Since this Patreon began, I have switched to a per-creation form of payment without bi-weekly remixes or monthly Patron Party events on a schedule. Instead, I deliver as much early content as possible while only making paid posts for finished remixes or remix albums. It often ends up being more content than my previous format delivered.\u003cbr\u003e"
