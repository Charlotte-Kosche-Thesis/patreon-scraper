And words, of course, are the most powerful drug used by mankind\u201d These timeless and beautiful words were spoken by one of my favorite authors, Rudyard Kipling in 1923, as he addressed the Royal College of Surgeons in London. I was born 51 years after he so eloquently spoke these words, that would become the summation of my life. I am a dealer in words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is L. Tommesa Mobley, but my friends call me TalibahAset. My love affair with the written word began at the ripe old age of 18 months. Simply put words; writing is my life. It is my craft. Writing is as natural to me as breathing, and I believe just as life-sustaining. I am a Writer. It is what I was born to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd why not, I mean think about how much words touch the lives of everyone on the planet. Words, literally create and shape everything. In song lyrics, magazines, books, love notes, conversation and everything in between, words are used to crush, to elevate, to pray. Words are personal. I do not believe there is another entity on Earth, as sufficient as words to inspire, to motivate, to express. As, Rudyard Kipling continued his speech, saying, \u201cNot only do words infect, egotize, narcotize, and paralyze, but they enter into and color the minutest cells of the brain\u2026\u201d Yes, words have an incredible power to shape what a people feel, think and do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlan Watts once, said \u201cThe Key to happiness is to find what you love and then figure out a way to get paid to do it\u201d That is exactly what I have done with my first and most powerful love, Words. I am a dealer in words and I seek to shape EVERYTHING. My mission in life is to constantly explore what I can do to influence the word in a positive way with ideas and words\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me fulfill this life\u2019s mission by becoming a patron with a pledge of $1 per month. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePeace, Power, and Prosperity\u003cbr\u003eTalibahAset (L.
