Known commonly to the local folk here as the PA Wilds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuilding a beard product company is no small task. It takes hard work and perseverance to make sure each and every one of the products remains consistent from one container to the next. I couldn\u0027t achieve my goals without your help so thank you for stopping in and checking out what I have in store.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I will be making 8 paid creations. How do I get $$? Through the tiers I made in the following section. The tiers I made are fun and interactive and allows my Patrons to save on 27 Beard Co. products\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider becoming a Fire Party Tier Member where the perks are above and beyond fantastic. Not your cup of tea? The Water Play Tier allows a fun way to get a nice discount.\u00a0 If not, I would love your $2 pledge at the Earth Down Tier. That helps me grow my business and gives those patrons an opportunity for some fun free gifts and great deals on 27 Beard Co. products.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will not be a \"paid patron\" post whether in video form or written form until both Fire Party and Water Play Tiers are full. The investment for Fire Party patrons will be $80/mo. The investment for Water Play will be $40/mo. The max for Earth Down will be $16/mo. Again, no paid posts will appear on my patron accounts until both Fire Party and Water Play Tiers are full. That\u0027s 75 patrons strong and I can\u0027t wait to see who joins in and believes in the success of 27 Beard Co.\u00a0 YOU GUYS ROCK!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be reaching out to my bearded brothers, sisters who love beards, friends/family of bearded gentlemen, and anyone who is curious to see how they can interact with the growth of my business, 27 Beard Co.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions please feel free to send me a message or email me and I will gladly answer them to the best of my ability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLloyd\u003cbr\u003ea.k.a.
