We\u2019re a married Korean/Canadian couple, and we currently live in Seoul, South Korea. We have a Youtube channel called \u003cstrong\u003e\u20182hearts1seoul\u2019\u003c/strong\u003e, and we make videos about traveling, daily life in Korea, food, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O3pLmJMbitM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon after we got married, we started uploading videos to share with Sarah\u2019s family and friends back in Canada, so they could see what our everyday life is like on the other side of the world.\u00a0We never really expected it, but over the last couple of years, our channel has been slowly growing, which has been motivating us to upload a video each week.We absolutely LOVE what we do, and of course we really want to continue to making videos, however the filming and editing process is \u003cem\u003eextremely time consuming\u003c/em\u003e, and it is really starting to interfere with our real life \u2018paying jobs\u2019. We honestly had no idea how much work went into creating videos until we started doing it ourselves, but we are really passionate about what we do, and we\u0027re always aiming to improve the quality of our videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people actually assume that we are \u0027full time Youtubers\u0027, but that is definitely NOT the case! Our channel is definitely nowhere near large enough to make a living from our videos, and we rarely do sponsored content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for our \u0027real life jobs\u0027, we are both freelancers, so our income is not always stable. We have turned down job opportunities in order to have the time that is necessary to keep filming and editing our videos, because we really don\u0027t want to give that up. Again, we LOVE what we do and we want to continue doing it, but realistically, we can\u2019t survive if we keep going on this way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Patreon contributions will go towards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eKeeping our Youtube channel going.\u003c/em\u003e These donations are buying us valuable\u00a0\u003cem\u003eTIME\u003c/em\u003e. Time we can dedicate to continue creating content. Filming and editing videos is a very time consuming process, and we spend 10-15 hours preparing, filming, editing, and subbing each video (but far more for traveling videos). Don\u0027t get us wrong, we absolutely LOVE doing it, but it\u0027s very difficult to juggle both this hobby and our real life jobs and still get by financially. Basically, contributions help us to free up time to work on our videos so we can continue to release one each week :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eFilming equipment:\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e**UPDATE**: Thanks to all of the support so far from our very generous Patreons, we were each able to upgrade our iPhones! WHY do we film with our iPhones rather than an actual camera? We do a lot of walking and biking, and filming with our iPhones allows us to be more mobile, since they\u2019re so light, easy to carry around, and they go everywhere with us anyway. Also, since we film with 2 phones, we get a lot more footage than if we had a single, larger camera. THANK YOU, all for making that possible! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTraveling.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u2019ve watched any videos on our channel, you\u0027ll know that we are particularly passionate about filming videos about travel, and just being out and about in general to show you around Seoul. Any contributions really help us out with transportation fees, as well as the cost to enter certain establishments (palaces, theme parks, etc.) and even to feed ourselves on the go :P \u003cbr\u003eThis is a bit of a stretch goal, but it would be amazing to be able to travel and film in cities/places in Korea \u003cem\u003eoutside\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eof Seoul\u003c/em\u003e, and it\u2019s definitely one of our goals to show our viewers other sides of Korea, because each city has its own fascinating vibe. We don\u0027t own a car, so any contributions would go towards transportation costs, such as car rental/train fare.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you all, for your consideration, your kindness, and your support! xoxo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
