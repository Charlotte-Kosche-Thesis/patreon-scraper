We hope we can have those out before the new year and that we can pick up a few more patrons to allow more frequent filming days in this truly beautiful province.\u003cbr\u003eWith the Sea to Sky episodes now out, we would love to do another part to this, as is mentioned in episode 5. This would see us head further north, where we explore the region between Squamish and Pemberton, a breathtaking area that also takes in the beauty of Whistler. To film this in all its winter glory would be truly special. Just a few more patrons could make this happen!",
