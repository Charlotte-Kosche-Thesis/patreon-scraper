    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e2018-04-11 Our Patreon is now live!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are the 2 Foreigners In Bollywood. This is the story of Johan and Hampus from Sweden and Pratap from India and how the three of us together are trying to make it in Bollywood.\u00a0It all began a little more than two years ago when we decided to leave Sweden behind, book a one way ticket to Mumbai and follow our dreams of becoming actors in Bollywood. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot has happened in two years and today we live in Mumbai and run one of the most popular Facebook- and Youtube channels in India. Basically we make comedy videos. One video per month to be more specific. The videos are about absurd phenomenon in Indian society which we observe and make comedy out of. It becomes even more absurd considering that we as foreigners are playing typical Indian characters speaking Hindi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn total we are a team of three people, Johan Bartoli, Hampus Bergqvist and Vidhan Pratap Singh. We met Pratap only a few weeks after moving to Mumbai and he quickly became our best friend and partner on this journey. We have no third party influencing us. There are no agents or production companies behind the scenes pulling any strings. Coming up with the ideas, writing the scripts, shooting, editing, publishing. We do everything ourselves and we plan to keep it that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking these videos is not easy. Quite the opposite, it requires our blood, sweat and tears. We travel to the deepest and most unreachable places of India, recruit local people as extras and negotiate with dons in various areas to be allowed to shoot. We created this Patreon in order to fund our future video production, stay independent and only focus on creating the most epic videos we possibly can come up with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the long run, making it in Bollywood is still our goal. We have been told over and over by people in the industry that we have no chance. That we as foreigners without connections in the industry will never be able to realize our dreams here. We know that it wont be easy but instead of going home, we see it as a challenge. It gives us motivation to push forward and work even harder. India is our new home and we are here to stay. At this moment, creating these videos and growing our online channels is the pathway we have chosen in order to build the fan following we need to take 2 Foreigners In Bollywood to the cinema screens of India in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe progress so far has been amazing. We have come a long way, but we still have a very long way to go. If you wanna support our journey and help fund our future video production, you can become a Patron! For $5 per month you will get access to the members only Patreon news feed, where we will be publishing behind the scenes material from the making of our videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you on the other side...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e// Johan, Hampus and Pratap\u003cbr\u003e"
