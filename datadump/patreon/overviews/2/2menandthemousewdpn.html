    "summary": "Hey there!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kevin Kessler, and I am the founder and owner of the White Dragon Podcast Network (WDPN for short!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this network in 2014 because of a passion for the medium of podcasting, and a love of creative outlets. We have a number of shows produced in house, most notable 2 Men and The Mouse: A Walt Disney World Podcast. We produce several other shows such as Mousellaneous DIScussions Disney talk show, The Geek WatchTower which monitors all the things that geeks watch, and The KevKess Cast Pop Culture Power Hour! These are the shows produced by the network itself. We have a number of third party shows as well which I invite you to check out!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page goes to benefit the shows listed above, those that I produce in house. The production costs have grown exponentially, and my equipment is beginning to falter with age. I could solve this problem in one of two ways: load the shows up with commercials, or look to you, the people whose lives this network has touched to help aid in the high cost of providing this entertainment outlet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have put off creating this page for a long time, as I hate asking anyone for money. But as the shows continue to grow and prosper, the costs have officially become too much to bear alone. As such, Mousellaneous DIScussions, Geek WatchTower, and KevKess Cast have all either gone on hiatus, or have severely decreased in production. Even 2 Men and The Mouse (which has a monthly audience of over 30k) has seen some outages due to server payments going unfulfilled, and we\u0027ve missed weeks. (Something I swore in the beginning never to do!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there you have it folks, I\u0027m turning to you and asking for help! No amount is too small, and we have some fun rewards to offer you all for helping out. To anyone that can find it in their heart to become a patron of 2 Men and The Mouse and the White Dragon Podcast Network, you have my undying love and thanks. As I said, no amount is too small. Even $1 a month goes a long way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much, from the bottom of my heart. You\u0027ve all helped make my dreams come true, and I hope that the superstars of the WDPN can continue to delight and entertain you for years to come!\u00a0"
