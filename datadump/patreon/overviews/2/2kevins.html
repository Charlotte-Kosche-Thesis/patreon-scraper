PATRONS HAVE BEEN CONTACTED VIA DM THRU PATREON.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we began the 2Kevins with Grace \u0026amp; Steel podcast (links at 2kevins.com) in August 2015, our only goal was to produce interesting audio based on the news of the day, guided by our extensive experience as reporters, editors and critics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike most everyone, we got caught up in the excitement of Donald Trump\u2019s triumph and the rise of the Alt-Right. We\u2019ve greatly enjoyed doing what we\u2019ve done. Now, we\u2019d like to expand our efforts, but we will need sustaining financial support to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both once made our living as writers. We intend to do that again. Therefore, our new goal is to write once more in long-form and make a modest living thereby, to produce work in conjunction with the podcast, taking advantage of the liberating opportunities now available via self-publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople on the Right love to complain that the Mainstream Media will not publish People Like Us. Well, we\u2019ve decided to do something about that, in deeds and not just words. So, beginning June 1, we will create our own platform. And with self-publishing, the patron\u2019s dollars go much further because the creators (that is to say \u201cUs\u201d) don\u2019t have to share them with agents and publishing houses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Plan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo enable this, we\u2019ve developed a detailed plan and sketched out four projects for Grace \u0026amp; Steel. Work has begun on all four, but we will need your ongoing support to help us bring those plans to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first project is the ebook publication of an existing work. Kevin Steel has already prepared a digital version of it. It will be annotated by Kevin Michael Grace, who will also contribute a new introduction. Steel will proofread and edit it. We estimate the time to complete Project #1 at two months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second project is a novel by Kevin Steel. The outline for this book is complete. Without giving too much away, it is in the thriller/mystery/detective genre and is inspired by recent, exciting political and economic events. Torn from today\u2019s headlines, one might say. The main protagonist is a vain and foolish journalist. As Grace annotates Project #1, Steel will begin writing Project #2; and once Grace has completed his annotation, he will begin editing the novel. We estimate that Project #2 will be wrapped up two months after the completion of Project #1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third project is another ebook publication of an existing work. We\u2019re committed to bring underappreciated works of the past to a wider audience. Kevin Steel is halfway through preparing a digital version of this text. Again, it will be annotated by Kevin Michael Grace, and he will write a new introduction. Steel will proofread and edit. Project #3 is a longer book than Project #1, so completion will likely take three to four months. Projects #1 to #3 will require seven to eight months\u2019 work in total, although this will likely change somewhat based on what we learn as we move forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fourth project is a non-fiction book by Kevin Michael Grace with the working title \u201cWhy the Music Died.\u201d An extensive 18-chapter outline for this has already been prepared by Kevin Steel after many conservations with Grace. If all goes well with Projects #1 to #3, and we\u2019ve established a stable revenue stream, it\u2019s conceivable Project #4 could be completed by June 1, 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a bonus to those who contribute to this Patreon, Kevin Michael Grace will recommence his website, The Ambler, and contribute several essays each week. You\u2019ve seen the work he\u2019s put in on his Twitter account, @KMGVictoria, and he\u2019ll now expand on that, in longer form, in the blog world. Should we find the support we seek, other publishing projects will follow, possibly including a book-length version of Grace\u2019s My 52 Favourite Films.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach work that we produce will include a limited print run for promotional purposes. Those who contribute $100 or more to this Patreon will receive signed copies of Projects #1 \u0026amp; #2. And other promotional items could follow. Like mugs. People love branded coffee mugs. Wouldn\u2019t you like to drink your beverages from a handsome container with our \u201cTwo hands rising above the rubble\u201d logo and the Hunter S. Thompson quote \u201cWhen the going gets weird, the weird turn pro\u201d on it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u201ctoo long, didn\u2019t read\u201d version of the above is that 2Kevins with Grace \u0026amp; Steel want to continue podcasting while creating substantially greater intellectual work in addition. And we very much want to maintain home \u0026amp; hearths while we do so. We need your help. Thank you, and God bless."
