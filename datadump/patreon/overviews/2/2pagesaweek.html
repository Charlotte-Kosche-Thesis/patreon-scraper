    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI am Robert j. Lee\u003c/strong\u003e, screenwriter and creator of Two Pages a Week. I currently live in Perth, Australia with my wife and daughter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Patreon is an online platform where people who like what I create can help me make a living with Two Pages a Week by pledging regular monthly payments in exchange for exclusive content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Two Pages a Week?\u003c/strong\u003e Back in 2012 I started a website where\u00a0every week I wrote a new short screenplay, usually two to three pages long, and then posted it online\u00a0where it is available to filmmakers and students for free. It was a huge success, many great short films were made and my scripts are now used in classrooms and colleges around the world. Unfortunately I wasn\u0027t making a living from it. Two Pages a Week took a huge time commitment and ultimately the pressures of finding paid writing work and being a stay at home dad got in the way and I had to leave the project behind. I had to give up doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m interested in creating a community of screenwriters and filmmakers and in sharing unique, exclusive content. Hopefully Patreon will help me achieve all that while also making a living and supporting my family doing what I love. Whether you\u0027re a fellow writer interested in the process of writing or a filmmaker looking for scripts to produce, there should be a reward tier for you, and through Patreon I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more time to writing better screenplays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a Two Pages a Week patron\u003c/strong\u003e you will gain access to early drafts, notes and inspiration for each script, collaboration, and most importantly Patrons will have access to \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive scripts!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I will write four new scripts, one of which will be posted free on the site and the rest will be available exclusively to patrons. There are several options with varying rewards so I hope you can find one that suits your budget."
