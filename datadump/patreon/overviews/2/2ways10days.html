This site is dedicated to providing fresh, entertaining content surrounding the NBA G League and its players, coaches, front office executives and even the referees. We aim to be the premier NBA G League website and will also provide breaking news among our stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamJ_NBAGL\"\u003eAdam Johnson\u003c/a\u003e has been covering the D/G League for 3-4 years and is one of the leading reporters around. He has written for Ridiculous Upside, Seadubscentral, Crabdribbles and was most recently Editor-in-Chief for D-League Digest. Adam is married with two children and lives in California where he also has a full-time job in the business sector.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdam is a media credentialed journalist with inside connections within the NBA G League that only a handful of people are privy to. His networking skills has allowed him to jump to the forefront of G League coverage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdam is also currently the sideline reporter for the Santa Cruz Warriors, G League affiliate of Golden State.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy you should be a Patreon for 2 Ways \u0026amp; 10 Days\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur main goal for launching this new website is not to make money. We both love this league and immensely enjoy telling the stories, both of success and failure, that drive the G League. We are just like these players and coaches who are striving to make it, and earn a larger opportunity to showcase their craft. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContributing to our Patreon will allow us to give back to others as well. Our hope is that we can pay other freelance writers and illustrators who want to submit their work for 2 Ways \u0026amp; 10 Days, so we can help their overall exposure and reach as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I spend long nights and early mornings around family time and other jobs to provide this content, so any contributions would help me tremendously. If I have enough people who help us out, I can use the funds to travel to major events each season, like the NBA G League Showcase which would allow us to publish in-depth interviews and player features we might not otherwise have access to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, you will be helping the little guys who are striving to bring these stellar stories to life. We are asking for just $1 a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your continuous support!\u003cbr\u003e"
