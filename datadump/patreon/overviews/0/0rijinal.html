We got her in July of 2016 and we couldn\u0027t love her more. We are still paying for lawyer fees and agency fees. I not only would love to help pay off these debts, but also be able to afford better equipment to bring you even better quality.\u003cbr\u003e I put out videos pretty frequently and have a great time doing so. I play on the New Eriador Server. \u00a0I also do some videos with my wife, Mrs. 0rijinal and hopefully one day with our little Baby 0rijinal. Your money will be appreciated more than you know and way more than I could ever express. Please help me on my journey to give my wife a gift that she has wanted ever since she was a kid herself. and bring you guys the best I can. I consider you guys like family and together I think that we make some magical things happen."
