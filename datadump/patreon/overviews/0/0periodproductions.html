    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT UPDATE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI was recently diagnosed with cancer and am being treated for it with chemotherapy. Because of this I am unable to maintain my normal video schedule on YouTube, although I am still trying to make most of my scheduled livestreams. During this time I still plan on maintaining the Patreon and getting all promised rewards out, so long as I am able to. I would also like to add that the Patreon is incredibly helpful at this time as I have medical bills coming in, and still have my usual expenses such as rent, electric, internet, and college loans.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHi guys I\u0027m George from Zero Period Productions, a YouTube\nchannel that focuses on gaming and comedy.  The channel was\noriginally imagined as a group effort, but quickly became more of a\n\u201cGeorge and sometimes friends\u201d type deal.  For the past few years\nI\u0027ve been managing the channel, creating regular content, and I\u0027ve always tried to improve as a creator.\u00a0 While I got my start on YouTube, I have since expanded into streaming on Twitch, with a schedule of 3 livestreams a week in addition to my YouTube video content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.zeroperiodproductions.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Twitch-Schedule.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDespite being partnered on YouTube, ad earnings aren\u0027t\nthe magical \u201cget rich quick scheme\u201d that some people seem to\nthink they are.  Without going into a whole lot of extremely boring\ndetails, some months are better for earnings than others, it also\ndepends on views, and if people are using adblock. With YouTube\u0027s more recent changes to their algorithms and the mass demonetization of videos, things can be unstable. Of course that\u0027s also the nature of working in an online space, and I\u0027ve tried to create more stable sources of income through working part time and becoming a Twitch Affiliate.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow of question I have for you is, will you help me\ncontinue to make videos?  I\u0027m not requiring anyone to join my Patreon, my\ncontent is free and will remain free, it\u0027s something that I firmly believe\nin.  However, by becoming a member you\u0027ll gain access to the Patron only feed\nwhere we can discuss videos, suggest mods and games that I can play,\nor even chat amongst yourselves.  Like I\u0027ve said, this is all\nentirely optional, I don\u0027t want to be one of those creators who keeps\ncontent behind a paywall.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat your contributions will go towards\n(highest priority)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo expenses\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 This\n\tcovers things that pertain to the channel.  New games to play,\n\tupgrades to my PC, new hardware and software, anything and\n\teverything that is needed to make videos and streams.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiving expenses\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 This is\n\tfor the more boring stuff in life.  Rent, electricity, and food so\n\tthat I don\u0027t die of hunger.  You know that game Don\u0027t Starve?  Well,\n\tdon\u0027t let me starve, please.  Oh, and those pesky college loan\n\tpayments...\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTravel / Convention expenses\u003c/strong\u003e\n\t\u2013 I\u0027ve attended conventions in the past, but have always been\n\tlimited by funds.  Turns out travel and hotel are kind of expensive.\n\t I\u0027d be able to attend more events aside from those in my immediate\n\tarea (New York Comic Con and PAX East), and see more of you fine\n\tfolks at conventions!  I\u0027ll always do meet-ups and hang-outs at\n\tconventions, just show up and we\u0027ll have some fun times!\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
