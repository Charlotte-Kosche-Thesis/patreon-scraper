This is something I am\u00a0\u003cem\u003every \u003c/em\u003epassionate about, and wish to pursuit a full-time career in the live-streaming and content creation industries. There is only one problem with this dream. My normal live streams and the YouTube videos are \u003cu\u003eNOT\u003c/u\u003e currently a source of income, and therefore, I cannot do these as often as I truly wish to. At the moment, my main sources of income are not enough to sustain me. I currently do work on the RockVille minecraft server, and I am a video editor for a friend of mine. While the video editing provides the basic necessities, at the time it is still not a comfortable way of living. Also, while working on these things are great, this comes at a cost of having fewer streams, having a terrible schedule when I do stream, and limiting my time with you guys. I want to change that, and as of today I\u0027m unveiling this Patreon Campaign to help reach that dream. With your support, I will be able to stream whenever I want for as long as I want, and I\u0027ll be able to produce YouTube videos on a regular basis. It\u0027s truly a win-win for all involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat does this mean for me, if I become a patron?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, as a patron, first know that you are helping to change my life. I think that fact alone, above all else, speaks volumes to who you are as a person, not to mention that you are helping someone achieve their dream. Secondly, for helping, you will gain rewards (listed to the right) for contributing, and over time, once I start reaching some of the goals I have outlined, I can begin to transition to a full time streaming schedule, and finally realize my dream of becoming partnered on Twitch and/or YouTube! This will guarantee increased streams and also allow me to increase the amount of YouTube videos I\u0027m currently producing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you decide this and what happens if you do not succeed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the constant growing of Twitch.TV, it has become immensely more difficult to succeed in the live streaming industry. With that, there are ever growing requirements in order for Twitch to even consider you as a partner to their website. In essence, I have failed on numerous occasions to become partnered on Twitch due to low numbers, which again is due to limited stream times. YouTube is also a very difficult platform these days to get recognized and have any sort of success early on. I think the creation of this page can be considered as an ongoing last resort to meet my goal of becoming a successful broadcaster and being able to live the life I have envisioned since first hearing about this industry. I love everything about what this type of career represents and I want to surround myself with that energy. One of the main reasons I got into this was to help others by spreading joy through my brand of entertainment. I would like to do some serious good in this world if I am afforded such an opportunity. I plan on doing many Charity streams during my tenure, and I really want to be able to make a difference. There is no set time frame for this goal to be met, which can be both positive and negative. But if you want something more concrete, just know that the sooner you decide to help, the sooner it could make the difference in whether this works out for me or not. If I ultimately do not succeed, and my back is absolutely against the wall, I would of course have to surrender to reality, and limit or possibly cancel streaming altogether, and focus on continuing my pursuit of what mostly would be a dead end job. I really don\u0027t want that, and I would certainly hope no one else would want that. I am eternally grateful for anyone who has considered being a patron."

I will host personal hangouts once or twice per month, and with these we will talk, watch movies, or play games together! I will also send you a RockStarTragedy T-shirt or other merch of your choice and I will give the option of having it autographed also. I will also send you a personal thank you letter! Finally, you will have priority consideration when I do collaboration videos!",
