    "summary": "I am a musician and a composer of songs. Music has been my joy and my passion all my life. Piano was my first instrument, followed by violin, voice and now guitar, ukelele and viola- and occasional drum tapping, beatboxing, triangle and thumb piano:-).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see music in colours (English UK spelling hurrah!), shapes, textures and when I create I feel like I\u0027m painting feelings and perceptions with sound. I love the creative process...I am most excited and thrilled in my life when I\u0027m in the flow of a creative musical output of some kind. I also feel that same thrill from sharing and expressing music with other people. Be that an audience or fellow musicians. Joyous expression in life feels so important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two avenues I\u0027m exploring. One is chamber anti-folk: strings and other orchestral instruments, plus drums, and is also a collaboration with other musicians in the UK and US (\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/roxy-rawson/sets/quenching-the-kill/s-jIjvx\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.\u0026lt;wbr\u0026gt;com/roxy-rawson/sets/quenching\u0026lt;wbr\u0026gt;-the-kill/s-jIjvx\u003c/a\u003e). The other is a pop writing venture with my producer friend in Paris (you can hear here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENte_AeX6YM).\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENte_AeX6YM).\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy recent situation was that I fell ill about five years ago, spent almost a two years bed bound, three years housebound...and my music career fell by the wayside. I am now feeling stronger and ready to release my debut album \u0027Quenching the Kill\u0027, which you can listen to\u00a0\u003ca\u003ehere\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eor in the link above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve not yet finished with my healthcare treatments, but I want to write and connect with an audience again...I feel most vital and alive when I am composing, performing, playing and connecting in a musical way with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am writing my second album from which I\u0027ll be showcasing songs on this platform as I compose them. I will be attempting to record at least one demo per month and I\u0027ll try as hard as I can with my home set up to create master worthy tracks too. I\u0027ll also share updates and progress on how the second album is coming along and record rehearsals and share initial pre mix masters to give you an idea of how things are coming together :-).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you will have access to a number of things I\u0027m happy to share with you. Thank you so much for your support and encouragement. I look forward to connecting with you!"

Last time, I laid down a guide vocal- as we like to record live (after rehearsing very well!), and then I recorded the best quality vocal takes I could muster, over the instrumental takes. I would like to do this at home to save on funds:-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther than that, any extra funds could go towards PR once my album is ready. Thank you for any support!!",
