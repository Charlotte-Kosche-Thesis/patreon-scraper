    "summary": "Hey, you! Welcome!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Irena, and I love stories. I love collecting them, I love telling them, I love writing them and playing with language, and I love drawing them and sharing them with the world!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows me to do just that. The monthly income I get from all my lovely patrons has directly gone into funding art supplies, artist alley table fees at conventions, project expenses for small comics, creation and publishing of Inktober collections (like my coloring book last year, and my comic project this year) and sustaining a work/life balance that enables me to create art on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see my writing \u003ca href=\"https://irenaspassova.wordpress.com/blog/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and I will link my story posts to Patrons as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what does being a Patron mean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo glad you asked! This is a monthly pledge, so, if you support me at the $5 level, every month you will send me $5 and you will get all of the lovely rewards listed in that tier. You can change your pledge level at any time, and they are processed at the start of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt every level of support, you get access to my Patreon feed. Here I post sketches, extra illustrations, comic visual development, and high resolution versions of my artwork. You also get a digital pdf copy of my Inktober collection once it is finalized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your end goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can click through my list of set goals on the left, but on a much broader scale: I want to create and tell my own stories full time. I need to be able to pay for business expenses, like my website, shipping rewards, pre-ordering books and prints, and traveling to conventions. I would also like to be able to hire someone as a project manager for books and webcomics, including managing my social media and convention schedule. I have discovered through the very long and stubborn way that I am not very good at the \"business\" side of this thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ideal situation is that this will start to pay my entire monthly expenses, letting me make art my full time job and getting to consistently put together and create stories and projects that people are interested in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo check out the reward tiers, look around on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reeberry.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/smile_nova/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e, and thanks for the support!\u003cbr\u003e"
