    "summary": "Hi there, my name is Robert Gray. I\u0027m passionate about tabletop game design, world building, social gaming, and collective storytelling. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve spent the last decade creating\u00a0a\ntactical tabletop fantasy role playing game, called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.realmofstrife.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRealm of Strife\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealm of Strife features tactical turn based combat, a dynamic class system, in depth\ncharacter customization and open ended role playing. But more than just a rule\nset, Realm of Strife is also a pre-built fantasy setting that provides a rich\nback drop for a limitless number of adventures or campaigns, capable of stretching over not just months but years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the best parts about Realm of Strife is that its\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003efree-to-play\u003c/strong\u003e. All of the necessary rules, information, and content is available on the\u00a0Realm of Strife website, downloadable and free of charge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course \u003cstrong\u003ethe\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003edown side of free\u003c/strong\u003e is that as a creator, designing and maintaining Realm of Strife\u00a0 actually costs me money. I\u0027m 36 years old, married with two beautiful little girls (that are already well on their way to being total geeks like their dad), and work a full time job to support my family. This limits the time and resources and I can put into creating games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining the Realm of Strife Patron\u0027s Guild you become part of an exclusive group of individuals that are dedicated to seeing development of this amazing game continue. Not only that, you also get to\u003cstrong\u003e be part of the world building experience,\u003c/strong\u003e forever leaving your mark on the Realm of Strife."
