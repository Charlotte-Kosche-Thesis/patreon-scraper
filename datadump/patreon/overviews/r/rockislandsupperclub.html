    "summary": "We are building a 501(c)(3) non-profit music venue for our community called the Rock Island Supper Club. We plan on raising most of the money needed to operate by taking monthly, and one-time tax-deductible donations, as well as grants; the rest will come from a bar with a very economical and straightforward menu we build for our members and guests. (There will most definitely be non-alcoholic drink choices as well.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we will provide to our community with the Rock Island Supper Club, is a place to practice, perform, and enjoy art. This space is focused on the happiness of each artist as equally as the consumer coming to the show. There will be music, art programs, poetry and writing workshops, dance, comedy, and film; all available to our community for free, or at an extremely reasonable price, all funded almost entirely by our communities tax-deductible donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the lights are on and our most pressing renovations are complete, our next goal will be to build our\u00a0bar, get our\u00a0liquor license as quickly as possible, and have Director compensation come exclusively from the bar. We want you to be confident that 100% of your donations are going towards art, and not in anyone\u0027s\u00a0pocket. You can find out more about Director compensation under our donation goals to\u00a0the left.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Supper Club will eventually be a membership-based\u00a0venue (just like any other supper club!), and we will make sure that any donation you make now will count towards your eventual membership. Membership will be as simple as paying $10 for the first show you go to for the month, and the rest of the shows\u00a0that month are free. We will be having a Grand Opening (TBA) once our bar is complete, and memberships will go into effect\u00a0at that time. Be on the lookout for a more detailed description of our Supper Club Membership as we fine tune the deets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe still need to raise money to send our tax-exempt paperwork to the I.R.S., but the entire form is filled out and ready to be sent. This means that if you check our non-profit status with the government, we won\u0027t be on the list just yet. Just know that as soon as we send it off and it gets approved, our tax-exempt status will go into effect from the date we incorporated (January 10th, 2018). this means you will still be able to write off your donations, as long as we (raise the money to) send our paperwork off in a timely fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will gladly write receipts for any of your donations, but know that it is unnecessary if you donate less $250 a year (about $20 a month) as an individual. If you would like to donate in person or want to donate a \u003cstrong\u003esignificant \u003c/strong\u003eamount of money, check our Facebook page for our fundraising events! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your love and support!\u003cbr\u003e"
