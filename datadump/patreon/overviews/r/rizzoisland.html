    "summary": "Here is the demo for the game:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://dreameater-games.itch.io/rizzo-demo-1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRizzo Island Demo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a project with two goals.\u003cbr\u003e1. Make a game dedicated to my late uncle Tom Rizzo\u0027s music\u003cbr\u003e2. Revamp the Dreamplaces Quake engine hardware code for Dreamcast so it is updated to the current codebase, has sound, and has demo support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBackground:\u003cbr\u003eMy Uncle Tom Rizzo died in 2016 and he left a lot of his music behind. While his music career wasn\u0027t as successful as he wanted it to be, I thought it would make great video game music for a game dedicated to him. I always liked the Dreamcast console, but was never good at coding. When I heard about the awesome guy Mankrip who ported the Quake engine to the Dreamcast, I was ecstatic! However, my joy was short lived as I realized that this port, while miraculous, wasn\u0027t able to bring my vision fully to life. I have been working for 1 year on the project with vanilla makaqu and it just can\u0027t give my true vision of the game. I then decided to switch development over to Dreamplaces, because it had more features, but that proved difficult as well. There are very few 3D indie games for the Dreamcast and I feel like if we improved upon this engine, we could make it much easier for people to make Dreamcast games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStyle:\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, the textures in the game are simplistic. This is on purpose because, lets face it, the Dreamcast, and certainly not the Dreamplaces Engine are not up to par with modern standards. That\u0027s why I decided to take a mininalist approach to the aesthetic instead of trying to make it look advanced as possible. It also allows for faster game development and the illusion of better rendering!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Project Requirements:\u003cbr\u003eI need a bit of funding to pay for the coders and the model makers. I can design every level, and have even made a demo level to test how far I could push the vanilla Makaqu engine, but it is not as crisp as I\u0027d like it to be. That is because it is using a software renderer instead of a hardware renderer, which could really help render the game better. I, again, decided to move development over to the Dreamplaces engine, for more features and better rendering, but it has its own problems. The most important thing I need right now is coders, so if you can help that would be great!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEngine Coder Requirements:\u003cbr\u003e-Experience with Kallistios Dreamcast Development Kit\u003cbr\u003e-Able to code in KGL and/or OpenGL\u003cbr\u003e-Have a Dreamcast that can be used for engine testing\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuakeC Coders:\u003cbr\u003e-Ability to code in triggers, functions, and models\u003cbr\u003e-Examples of code you have done or previously worked on projects\u003cbr\u003e-Ability to make .def files to use in GTKRadiant\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGodot Coders\u003cbr\u003e-Ability to code models into the game\u003cbr\u003e-Must know how to make triggers work\u003cbr\u003e-HUD Interface programming\u003cbr\u003e-Optional: Console optimization including PS Vita\u003cbr\u003e-Optional: PS4/PS Vita Console Development Kit experience\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGame Story:\u003cbr\u003eTom is flying over the ocean, looking for a great place to chill, when suddenly, WHOOPS!!! He\u0027s fallen out of his Psychedelevator! Now he needs to hop from island to island to get back to where it crashed to before it fell out!
