Just looking at my socials, it\u0027s obvious that I\u0027m an anime nerd, but my main love is all of Tolkien\u0027s works, as well as Harry Potter and Disney! When I\u0027m not cosplaying, you can usually catch me flailing around with my dance group Aquaria, gaming, binge watching shows and going on adventures.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been cosplaying since 2014, but I\u0027ve only started taking the art of it more seriously in recent years as I\u0027m now building my skills to start creating my own cosplays. It\u0027s a slow process, but thankfully I have a lot of lovely friends to help show me the way. I\u0027m hoping as time goes on, I\u0027ll be able to eventually make all of my own costumes and props!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2XonN3e.jpg\" style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center; width: 310px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u00a0(*\u00b4 \u02d8 `*).\uff61oO ( ? )\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve decided to create a Patreon to use as another social media platform to share all of my usual cosplay posts that you can see on Facebook and Instagram. I\u0027ve also created it for those of you that want to see even more from me! If you\u0027d like to help support me in my cosplay journey, you can receive tons of cool rewards in both physical and digital form as well as having involvement in the behind the scenes and decision making process! If you decide to become one of my Patrons, all of your money will go towards helping fund future cosplay, which includes: make up, wigs, contacts, fabric, cosplay equipment and tools etc. Your money will help me create more of what you want to see!\u00a0As time goes on, I\u0027ll be adding more tiers and options for you all, so keep a look out if you\u0027d like to receive more goodies and have even more involvement!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you choose to become one of my Patrons, I seriously can\u0027t thank you enough!
