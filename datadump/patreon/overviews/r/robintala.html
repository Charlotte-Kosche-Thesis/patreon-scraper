He has a real chance of winning, and even if he doesn\u2019t, the wider his message spreads the more attention these crucial issues get and the more catalyst will be created for a whole new generation of #DemSo (Democratic Socialist) #Berniecrats in this and the next election cycles. In order to actualize Bernie\u0027s Political Revolution it will take continued involvement and increasing engagement in the political process from people like you and me. It\u0027s crucial that we bridge the incredible crescendo of political awareness beyond Bernie\u0027s campaign to support of the next generation of progressive political leaders. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis kind of moment doesn\u2019t come around often. It\u2019s time to step up our game.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT:\u003c/strong\u003e I am organizing a network of artists, visionaries, entertainers \u0026amp; creators to produce impactful online vids to support the emerging wave of truly progressive politicians. The vids will feature the most compelling art/music that the internet underground has to offer. They will be culturally relevant and engage a wide spectrum of artists in bridging the gap between art and progressive politics. The vids will feature recognized and underground artists collaborating, showcasing their art and speaking to the issues with an aesthetic which is irresistible and will end with tangible calls to action. We will viral market these vids in strategic ways and galvanize the movement for a future to believe in. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis project starts with supporting Bernie to reach the Dem Nomination for POTUS but won\u0027t end there. We will continue to produce media past this election cycle in order to support the long game of Bernie\u0027s political revolution. \n\u003cem\u003eWhat up 2018 Midterms! We gotchu.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaybe you don\u2019t have the time or energy that you\u2019d like to put into Bernie\u2019s campaign? Pitch in for me to go full time and I will work to represent all of our voices.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you would like to collaborate or contribute: Art, Recording/Filming Services, Physical Spaces, Promotion/Marketing/Organizing Help or anything else, please fill out \n\u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/5CgPjz5yZU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTHIS FORM\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GGaNGGoG5M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHOW:\u003c/strong\u003e You pledge $1-100/month to support me to organize this project for all of us. I work for Bernie\u0027s minimum wage of $15/hour on this project (well below my normal rate for something like this, I\u0027ll essentially be working on part pay/part time donation).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis will enable me to step fully into a role that feels natural and timely, that of a crowdfunded independent artistic political organizer. I will serve as the focalizer, organizer, administrator and production manager of a new production company supporting a new wave of Democratic Socialist enthusiasts, activists and politicians. Some of my initial responsibilities will include: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n-\u00a0Outreach to Artists, Sound Stages, Recording Studios, Video Editors \u0026amp; Digital Content Creators.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Assembling and maintaining a database of the above people.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Working with them to create ideas for vids and begin shooting in the field.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Allocating budget for creative projects and marketing campaigns.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- And much more...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHO:\u003c/strong\u003e I am a 12 year veteran of the expansive west coast underground electronic music and hip hop cultures. I am a networker, bridge builder and cross pollinator. I have cultivated a unique and massive network of some of the most culturally relevant artists in the underground, and many of them want to support Bernie\u0027s campaign. Think about all the talented artists who support Bernie, they just need someone to organize them. I am uniquely positioned to coordinate this effort; to tap my network and create/produce/curate media which will propel the BERN thru the primaries and caucuses and to THE PRESIDENCY.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou are the artists of the world. You are urban dancers and napkin poets. You are touring musicians and amateur film makers. You are storytellers and magicians and graff writers and digital crafts(wo)men. You make this world beautiful and exciting and you see the potential for a better future. You want to contribute to this vision and you know that now is the time to step forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have the experience to organize and actualize this project.\u00a0I\u2019ve served as the Production Manager and Digital Implementation Director for a successful webseries, I\u0027ve been producing festivals \u0026amp; nightclub events for many years, I have an eye for aesthetic which has proved itself continuously as a graphic designer and digital artist, I\u0027m a DJ, Poet, Beat Boxer \u0026amp; Live Looper with my finger on the pulse of what is new and fresh in the global internet underground.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nExample: Here are two vids that I served as production manager for:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/41537279\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iF7bH1wQ_d4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eComing Soon: \u003c/strong\u003eProject\u00a0Timeline, Long Term Goals Breakdown, Budget Details.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e Why should I give money to you instead of directly to Bernie\u0027s Campaign?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e DO BOTH... and Bernie\u0027s official campaign is limited in the particular vibe and aesthetic of the content that they can put out. They will be judged and critiqued for it meticulously by the media and political machine. I believe it\u0027s important and powerful for independent artists to show their support directly. We are less limited in the aesthetic scope of our content by refraining from official affiliation with the campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e Isn\u0027t this a little late? The super important primaries are happening in just a few days?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e You\u0027re right that time is of the essence... and I do wish that I had started this project a bit earlier... but the key here is in the long game...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1. Bernie has said many times that he will be in this until convention, meaning no matter how well or badly he does in the primaries he will run his campaign until the Democratic National Convention this summer in order to keep the issues in the media. Also, his campaign is gathering momentum and it looks like he will still be a very viable candidate beyond Super Tuesday (March 1st when 10 states hold their primaries/caucuses). This project will be in full motion as soon as March and will support his campaign beginning just after Super Tuesday (or possibly before).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Bernie will need our support for the General Election WHEN he is the Democratic Candidate for President ;)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3. A massive part of this project is bridging the energy of Bernie\u0027s Political Revolution beyond Bernie\u0027s personal campaign. It is CRUCIAL that we begin throwing our support behind other political candidates who are running on a #DemSo platform on a local, state and national level. DEMSO.TV will not end with the 2016 Elections, we will go on to carry the momentum forward and help win both houses of congress back to the Democrats for a progressive agenda in the 2018 mid terms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0What if I just want to pledge for one or a couple of months?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eYou can edit your pledge whenever you want. So in a couple months in you could increase, decrease or cancel your pledge. I choose Patreon because to make this happen I need a sustained budget month after month. There is no one-time donation function on this site. If you only want to make a one time donation consider making a smaller monthly donation or else contact me personally to arrange a different kind of payment. I hope you will chose to sign on for a monthly contribution tho.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
