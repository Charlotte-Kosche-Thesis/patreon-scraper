    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eHi. I\u0027m River.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn late 2016, I created this page so I could turn my fiction into money. It seemed like the obvious thing to do, the thing every author would surely want to do. Patreon waved at me like a flyer in the breeze, stapled to a brightly-colored wall. I signed up, told all my friends and family, and took their pledges without a second thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere was a thrill that lasted for a few months, as I filled with the realization that I could get twenty dollars a week for doing a bare minimum. All I had to do was type up a few thoughts every week, and everyone was happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the months passed, I came to a realization: I really do enjoy writing. I really am good at it, or, if I\u0027m not, I have the right attitude to improve. I think I can make art, and, most importantly, I want to share it with people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWriting is work.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI admit that I initially made this page as an excuse to myself, so that I could fight the guilt I felt for doing nothing with my life. It took a year for me to learn to take myself seriously, to develop the faith that my writing was worth the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy time on Patreon has been a journey of self-discovery, during which I\u0027ve written and posted more than 60,000 words (circa Feb. 2018) in fiction, amateur journalism, and computer code. I want to do more of this, share it with more people. Your contribution is the encouragement I need to stick to the grindstone, the reminder that people care that I try my best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecial shout-outs to the people who pledged to my page in 2017, and stuck with me when I was putting out close to no creative work at all. Your faith is why I\u0027m ready to keep writing, trying new things, and sharing with new people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
