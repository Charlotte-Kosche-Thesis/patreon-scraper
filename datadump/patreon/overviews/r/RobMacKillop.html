    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eRob MacKillop\u003c/strong\u003e here. As many of you know, I play a number of string instruments, like guitars, lutes, ukuleles, etc. If I specialise at all it is in finding \u003cstrong\u003eobscure but great music\u003c/strong\u003e. As such, I get many comments about how people like to keep returning to my YouTube channel - they never quite know what\u0027s coming next.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA non-commercial musician\u0027s life can be a difficult one, and requires support beyond self financing of projects. \u003cstrong\u003eI create all of my output myself from home\u003c/strong\u003e, where I also teach music. I have private home students, and Skype or FaceTime students, and every now and then one of those students will ask me how they can support my work. Before I discovered Patreon, that was a difficult thing to organise. \u003cstrong\u003eBut here we are, on Patreon!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can support me by paying a little (or a lot of!) cash each time I upload a video to my YouTube channel.\u003c/strong\u003e The least you will be doing is helping keep me in strings! But you will also be helping to finance more professional recordings, or even help pay for an instrument. Although you will see me play a lot of instruments on my videos, the truth is that I have to sell them in order to buy another - so I can\u0027t keep them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease check out my GOAL (on the left)\u003c/strong\u003e - where I outline what your money will be contributing to this year, 2018.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can keep exploring old manuscripts and obscure publications, as well as providing free helpful videos for anyone interested in learning the music I play. \u003cstrong\u003eNearly everything I create is given away online for free\u003c/strong\u003e - that way it reaches many more people, and I\u0027m more interested in having people hear this wonderful, largely neglected or completely unknown music, than I am in making commercial recordings of stuff that everyone else seems to be doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, \u003cstrong\u003eplease consider becoming my patron via Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e. You can stop doing so at any time. You can also donate a very little amount - we all have demands on our money, and I know it will not be easy for some of you to donate regularly. I think over the last decade I have shown my commitment to my belief in researching and sharing good music, and I know that some of you would be happy to help me keep doing so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003eRob MacKillop\u003cbr\u003eEdinburgh\u003c/div\u003e"

     "description": "It is my intension to record a studio-quality album in September of this year, with my Frans Elferink \u003cstrong\u003eacoustic archtop guitar\u003c/strong\u003e. The album will showcase not just the magnificent instrument, but also some wonderful yet \u003cstrong\u003eneglected repertoire\u003c/strong\u003e. Some of the repertoire will be \u003cstrong\u003eclassical\u003c/strong\u003e-influenced, some \u003cstrong\u003ejazz\u003c/strong\u003e-influenced.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have booked CastleSound Studio near \u003cstrong\u003eEdinburgh\u003c/strong\u003e for late September. My intention is to have two output streams: \u003cstrong\u003edigital download\u003c/strong\u003e and also \u003cstrong\u003ehigh-quality 180g vinyl\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003evinyl\u003c/strong\u003e will be restricted to \u003cstrong\u003e200 copies\u003c/strong\u003e. The downloads will be available from all the usual outlets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough my videos over the last eight years, I have awakened many people\u0027s interest to the wonderful solo acoustic archtop guitar repertoire, played with a plectrum as opposed to fingerstyle. My intension is to showcase composed pieces from the 1930s to the present, with one or two arrangements.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon supporters will be granted pre-release and discounted sales of the vinyl album!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the UK last year, vinyl outsold CD sales. I love good-quality vinyl myself, and believe it is the best way to present the music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help me realise this project? Well, every time I upload a video to YouTube, you donate money through this site. That\u0027s it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny questions, just ask.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRob\u003c/strong\u003e",
