    "summary": "Hi everyone! First off, thanks for taking the time to read all this and check out my page! For those of you that know me, you know how passionate I am about comic books and illustration! For all the new viewers, nice to meet you! Looking forward to getting to know you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, the reason I\u0027m on Patreon is because, for a long time, I\u0027ve been looking for a way to fund my passion... creating Comic Books. Seems pretty easy, but for the past couple years my wife\u0027s been pretty sick. As I\u0027m writing this she\u0027s been out of work for 7 months. Things are tight, and I\u0027ve spent the last 7 months doing commissions to make ends meet. The entire time I\u0027ve been counting down the days til\u0027 I\u0027m done with commissions and can get back to creating new comics. BUT every time it gets close to time, bills pop up and I have to go back to the commission well and all my ideas end up sitting on the shelf just collecting dust.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I tripped over Patreon and thought, \u0027hey! I\u0027m going to try that out, maybe it\u0027s a way to make a little extra cash for bills, AND be able to create some new content!\u0027 So, It might be a slow start. My plan right now is to create a comic strip once a week for Sgt. Werewolf (as seen in Johnny Raygun Comics!). If I reach a couple goals, I\u0027ll be adding strips, maybe more frequent updates, maybe a 2nd or 3rd strip. I\u0027m not sure, I make things up as I go, but I CAN guarantee that I will update once a week, and I\u0027ll entertain you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for investing in me. I can\u0027t tell you how much your donations help my family!"

Werewolf!) I\u0027ll also be able to purchase a better set up for videos. This will also help with my Wife\u0027s medical bills and my stress level :-)",

Not sure exactly what yet, but you\u0027ll get more comic illustrations / videos than you can handle! This will also allow me to hire a colorist for Johnny Raygun!\u00a0",
