This Patreon page of mine is to help grow that community and give you all MORE! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOOOO...

AND MORE! \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBeing a freelance artist is tough, but with the patronage, I will be able to do more speed paints, give away more art and accessories, and create more content that I can give to you guys! \u003cem\u003eTHIS PAGE WILL BE GOING UNDER A LOT OF TRANSFORMATION AS I MAKE MORE CONTENT!\u003c/em\u003e From games you guys want me to play with you or check out, or even make fan art of it so I can make prints and accessories! You guys will help me develop more and more content that I can give \u003cem\u003eTO YOU!\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI wanna help, but...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDon\u0027t feel obligated! Times are rough for everyone. If you do become a patron but need to back out, you can change your amount, or cancel, at ANY TIME! Yes! Patreon allows for this! It\u0027s very easy! If you would prefer to just do a donation, you can check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/RinTheYordle\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etwitch.tv/RinTheYordle\u00a0\u003c/a\u003efor my donation page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor You:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon especially allows me to do on the spot mini tutorials for you that have expressed interest in learning. From 3D to 2D, Animation to Illustrations, I want to give you guys as much as I can to help you in the artist world, from information I know, to new information we can explore together! Got a question? ASK ME! I\u0027m also trying my hardest to run a discord server for your entertainment, along with coming to more conventions to see you! More products, more sketch give-aways, as much as I can muster!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what about your old content?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is NOT meant to hinder the content I currently make. I will still be doing commissions, playing games with you, going to conventions, and much, much more in the works. I will still make all of this content, even if the patreon is unsuccessful. This just helps even out the load of student loans, bills, and more that make it very hard for me to take extra time out of my day. It allows for more of everything, travel to see you guys at conventions, having an artist booth, and more importantly, GIVING MORE TO YOU WHO HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH TO ME! I have been begging for a way to give back to all the lovely people who have donated their time and money, and this will allow for all of that and more!! I have been doing this for over four years, and plan to do excessively more as the years go by with my growing community! I love all of you that have become friends to me, and am excited to meet anyone else who joins us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestions? Concerns? Critique?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThinking about being a patron but want something to change? LET ME KNOW! I am more than open to critique and changing offers as I grow! I am working on getting quality prints and key chains, as well as a ton of other content that I want to ADD to the rewards as I hit goals!! Feel free to e-mail me at rinidinger (at) gmail for any feed back, questions, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your time and for checking out this page! Please, have a wonderful day!\u003c/strong\u003e"
