    "summary": "Hello there! My name is Naveen and I run a tumblr blog called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/\"\u003eRandom Reasons to Live\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRR2L is a blog to help support people who are suffering with suicidal feelings and has been on-going for 2 years now. What the blog is is rather simple - 3 times a day (thanks to a queue), I post a seemingly random reason to keep living. These can range from things such as smelling the flowers in spring, to cuddling up with your pet. I also accept guest submissions and I offer advice to people who send in requests for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of this moment the blog has over 620 reasons listed on it, and 1,700+ posts in total. It just reached the 10k followers milestone a few weeks back, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least once a week I receive a message letting me know I\u0027ve helped someone - be it them, their friend, or a family member. People have been thanking me for my help and asking me how they can return it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, my family and I have been struggling for quite some time now. Both my husband and I are disabled and the disability check we get doesn\u0027t cover all of our bills on a monthly basis, leaving us to scramble to cover them all and no room to buy things such as toilet paper, or even pet food. We have three cats - one of which is an ESA - and one dog - who is a service dog in training. When we can\u0027t afford food for them, we use our food stamps to buy them meals instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to create this page in hopes of allowing people to have an easier way of helping us out. I\u0027m not going to include \u0027patreon only\u0027 content, as I feel that it isn\u0027t right to keep people who are suffering from as much help as they can get. But I will use this page to update people on our lives occasionally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking a look and please remember that I love you \u003cstrong\u003eand your life matters. Keep on living, please! You\u0027re very important.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
