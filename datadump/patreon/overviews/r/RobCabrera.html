    "summary": "Hi, there, Fellow Human. I\u0027m building a creative army, and I need your help. So, here\u0027s the thing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to put all of these amazing unpublished works of art and stories in my archive to use for the benefit of what I call the \u003cstrong\u003eSquirrel Army Initiative\u003c/strong\u003e. What is that?! Read on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI help develop a lot of young and talented people (who don\u0027t live near some big studio or go to a big fancy art school) who would benefit personally from working on projects I have in play. However, I also want to make sure that they are all\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003epaid\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e for their efforts because \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI believe that\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eno one in the creative field should work for free no matter how young and inexperienced they are.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s tough out there for young creatives. Young artists starting out struggle quite a bit because they get exploited with promises of \"exposure\" and other things that lead to them getting taken advantage of for absolutely no money by people who want something for nothing. (They always seem to have some \"business\" they want to get off the ground, or hide their exposure through \"art contests\".) I fell victim to those schemes very early on, too, and vowed that if I were ever in a position to help other young creatives avoid that, I would. I am and here we are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, I\u0027m already helping some young creatives make money, but I want to expand this so I can help many more that I see out there and just need a break that actually PAYS them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t need to buy equipment, or anything like that. My studio Creative Squirrels has that covered. And you\u0027ll notice the tiers aren\u0027t very expensive either (except that \"General\" one which, if you get that - WOW, thanks! That would help us finish a few projects a whole lot faster and put a lot of smiles on people\u0027s faces. Go you!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExpanding the \u003cstrong\u003eSquirrel Army Initiative\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is important to me because I want to be able to help launch the careers of the next generation of creatives by giving them their first paid gigs like others did for me when I was starting out. \u00a0I work with a lot of young artists who just need a chance, a bit of a confidence-building boost,\u00a0and want to help them rise to be all they can be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, please, help me help THEM! Thanks!"
