    "summary": "Hi! I\u2019m Elizabeth Hursh, also known as ryuredwings online, and I draw lots of comics and art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re reading this, it probably means you already support what I do, and that\u2019s really awesome if you do! Thank you for liking my work so much!!\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re reading this, and have never read or seen any of my stuff, well, that\u2019s okay too. You can scroll down below to see the projects I\u2019m working on, and take a gander at what I do. I promise you won\u2019t be bored!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe two comics I currently produce are Filly Queen Chrysalis, a fancomic for My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, and Abbey, my own original story with characters of my own creation.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m also working on bringing two more comics to life, one being another My Little Pony fancomic about Aorta Rose, a pony who\u2019s been turned into a vampire, and Otherworld, an original story I\u2019ve been polishing for years about a world just like ours but where the legendary monsters of the world are real and trying to live regular lives just like the rest of us among the human population. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with my comics, I also draw a lot of fan art, and original art on a weekly basis, depending on how much time I have. I range a lot, going from My Little Pony to Steven Universe to whatever video game I\u2019m having fun with at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, my art production came to a complete standstill about a year ago thanks to a weight-training injury that rendered me completely unable to draw at all. The injury left me in severe amounts of pain, with no solution except to rest and take increasing amounts of painkillers. Even with the medicine, my pain was only manageable enough for me to function like a normal human being, and drawing was completely out of the question. Just sitting at my computer to draw for three hours would leave me in pain for the next week. \u003cbr\u003eIn December 2015, I decided to start seeking alternative methods of managing my pain, and began to receive acupuncture treatments. So far, it\u2019s working beautifully! Not only am I able to draw again, my pain is almost completely gone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut more than a year without comic updates and art in general has been pretty rough. I\u2019m fighting just to make the minimum of what I need to contribute to my household and pay off my students loans. Some months what I make from commissions is enough, and sometimes it\u2019s not enough at all!\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m hoping that through a combined effort through Patreon, commissions, and Redbubble, I\u2019ll be able to create a steady income for myself again through my art. If it all adds up to what I need, I may even be able to focus my attention on making the comics that had been on the backburner for a long time, like Otherworld, a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, thank you to my friends and supporters for being so wonderful and helping me when I\u2019m in need! It\u2019s been amazing to receive help and encouragement from all of you!\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to help me out too, go ahead, and check out the rewards and my current projects below! You can get comic previews, early access to commission openings, sale codes, and free stuff when I\u2019m making prints for a convention! Pretty cool, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading!! I hope you have a fantastic day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"386\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RNLtJvs1EklVJdAoUS8NTs_m9MTbPunBm-muj8G81KR6tjWX79JCavsurujXAjFAKW78U8SdPMFs9Gfz004yP0eg-OiMLcXfLo8NSYdZxFk5-tYDQk_NMqffmfOeshj-nfk7AAf4\" style=\"\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fillyqueenchrysalis.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFilly Queen Chrysalis\u003c/a\u003e has been my longest running comic, starting in 2012, and is about Queen Chrysalis, a villain from My Little Pony, as a child. The comic focuses on her young life, and how she became the villain we see later on the show. The running thought behind every part of it is that villains aren\u2019t born, they\u2019re made, and people seem to be enjoying it a lot! Especially the comics where I get to have her make cute faces!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Aqhxt3d4VKA0rOLb7-M7bx9D1JvkuBvPsHNkKNL_2WjHp5u4TXT15WoYHWJLA7u2Ke40qe4HWwCSP4gkUBCISipmxP2mGzzxQOcwTSKJxfsn9Ir3DCdhBfBnL11x_hokBx4lUkO2\" style=\"\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://abbey-comic.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAbbey \u003c/a\u003eis a comic I\u2019ve been working on, on and off, for almost four years now. It wasn\u2019t until recently, where I\u2019ve become more confident in my artistic ability, that I\u2019ve decided to pursue bringing it to life. \u003cbr\u003eAbbey is about Abbey, a young cow-lion-bird creature who has no idea what she is, or where she comes from, and her adventures in trying to answer those two questions. As she travels with her friend Xie, a lost kirin trying to find his way back home in The East, they encounter friends and enemies all around their world. \u003cbr\u003eThe comic draws very heavily from mythology from all cultures, and I can\u2019t wait to explore and show the many wonderful creatures that people have created all across the world.\u003cbr\u003e"
