    "summary": "Hi my name is \u003ca href=\"http://www.redherringillustration.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJeffrey Johnson\u003c/a\u003e, and I love stories about daily life, love and adventure. Sometimes, they take the form of comic strips, sometimes illustrated stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://redherringjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/026_spekto_petrom2_web.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was in high school, I wanted nothing more than to be a muppeteer. I studied every book I could find, drew pictures, built\n several small puppets. Somewhere along the line though I realized that I\n enjoyed designing and making things more than I enjoyed performing. So I\n did the only sensible thing, and got a degree in printmaking.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe desire to tell stories with my artwork has remained a constant \ninspiration for me, and  has led me to Focus on storytelling, childhood \nmemories and a sense of adventure. These days I work mostly in pencil \nand paint instead of ink and presses, and while I\u2019ll probably never get \nto perform with Kermit, at least I can take comfort in the fact that my \nhouse is a lot like the Happiness Hotel\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFull of talking rats.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I noticed early on is that I\u0027m\nreally happiest when I\u0027m making things and sharing my skills and stories\nwith others. I want to encourage people to get out there in the world, to try new things and to empower them to\nget together with their family and friends and make those ideas reality. I\nwant to be able to do this regularly, online, for everyone to read for free.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, because I\u0027m a full-time freelance artist, crafter, and dad, I still need to take on a lot non-personal work each month to cover\nbills and expenses. This means that filling orders and making the things to\nfill my show displays with takes priority after work deadlines and I\u0027m able\nto spend less time writing new stories, developing new product,creating new illustrations, and working on\nnew tutorials and articles. So I\u0027m turning to Patreon as a means to help me dedicate \n\u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e time to producing free\ncontent to share with \n\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019re all winners here.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSo How\nDoes This Work, Exactly?\n\u003c/h2\u003e\nWhat a great question!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is an online platform where awesome folks like you can become patrons\nof the arts by directly supporting creators like us. It\u0027s sort of like a\nKickstarter, but think smaller amounts over a longer period of time. You pick\nan amount you\u0027d like to send us each month, and in return you gain access to \n\u003cstrong\u003esome really cool Patreon-exclusive content\u003c/strong\u003e\n(check the full list of perks below for details) and enjoy the benefit of our \u003cstrong\u003esuperb high-five skills\u003c/strong\u003e.\nYou can change or cancel your patronage at any time, and you\u0027ll only be charged\nonce a month at the amount you choose to give.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOther creators charge per update, why don\u2019t\nyou do that?\n\u003c/h2\u003e\nAnother great question!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m always working on \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e, and when I\u0027m able, a\nweek\u2019s worth of content might consist of a tutorial, collection of photos, new\nproduct announcements, Watercolor Wednesday post, and a comic. Needless to say\nit can be a little inconsistent, but my plan is to have new content up as\noften as I can. Those of you donating at the $2.00 a month level will get a\nfull Behind-the-scenes look at what\u2019s going on every week on various projects\nand goals.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery little bit of support I receive through Patreon is a\nreminder to set aside time for the projects I care about most. While I don\u2019t\nreally see it totally replacing my freelance work, knowing that there\u2019s\nsomebody out there is a heck of an incentive to keep on moving forward and\nworking on new projects to share with you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhatever you decide to donate, it will help me be able to\ncontinue to develop and deliver high quality stories, tutorials, and products,\nand I can\u2019t thank you enough for that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
