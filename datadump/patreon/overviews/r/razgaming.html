    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey there! I\u0027m Kyle, also known as Raz! I\u0027m a person that gets his hands dirty in a little bit of everything! Most of what I know is self-taught, from everything from graphic design, video editing, building quadcopters, and of course, designing video games. My experience in designing video games are, like my other hobbies, self taught.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow It All Started\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, I started dabbling in various available engines, such as CryEngine, Source, and Unreal Development Kit (UDK). I found UDK to be the best choice for the type of game I wanted to create. I dabbled in UDK for quite some time before Unreal Engine 4 came out. Once UE4 released, I subscribed to their montly subscription to gain access to their engine updates each month. I immediately fell in love and found it much more fluent and \"with the times\" over UDK. \u003cbr\u003eAnyway, fast forward a few years into the present, I have been working on an untitled game for quite some time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGame Storyline\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is this game, you ask? It\u0027s a first person, action-adventure tactical stealth operation in which the player engages in missions to complete their objectives.\u00a0You play as Diego Ortiz, a former United States Marine, who leads the player through the story of how he became an agent selected for high-risk operations across the globe. The player learns about Diego\u2019s past and how it plays a role into his present-day life. The main objective of the game is for the player to complete mission objectives set forth by his new employer, until one day, things hit a little too close to home\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore Game Information\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe player is rewarded based on their decisions and skill levels after each mission. The less noise made and alarms raised, the higher bonus and money the player is rewarded. Experience points (XP) that is rewarded can be spent on unlocking new perks such as moving faster while silent, the ability to tag enemies, and carrying larger ammo/gadget bags. Money is spent on buying and upgrading new weapons such as silenced weapons, sleeping darts, and tripwires. Essentially, everything that a player is rewarded can be used to enhance their abilities and gain more advantages in their favor.\u003cbr\u003eUpon starting a campaign storyline, the player receives very limited gear for the beginning chapters. As the player progresses, the more equipment will become available to them. Weapons and gadgets include pistols, submachine guns, throwing knives, tripwire, and dart guns, all which can be upgraded. It is completely up to the player how they want to play, whether they want to go in guns blazing or take a more silent approach, the decision is theirs to decide. As the game is catered to stealth, more XP and money get rewarded for those who manage to complete their objectives without raising any alarm, however, everyone needs to go on a rampage sometimes!\u003cbr\u003eDifferent difficulty levels also impact how the game is played. Easier difficulty levels allow the player to get away with more without impacting their post-mission report so much as a harder difficulty which takes away some features that players previously relied on (such as known guard locations and the ability to tag enemies).\u003cbr\u003eI plan on bringing the game to PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4, with more operating systems shortly after (Linux and Mac support). I am already accepted into Microsoft\u0027s ID@Xbox program and continually provide them up updates on the game\u0027s progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBusiness/Company Information\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a company and website created, however, it is being kept under wraps until it is trademarked. The name and website will be revealed as soon as all the paperwork is approved and good to go. \u003cbr\u003eWhat comes with passion, comes financial information. While this is a dedicated passion of mine (not just some one-off hobby), it is not exactly cheap. This is pretty much my job, with the exception of making money online with small jobs to pay for the bills. I am not looking for money to pay for those bills through Patreon, but rather money to help fund the development of \"Untitled Game\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinancial Breakdown\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money would be used for the legal and business side of things, voice acting, music composing, console devkits, porting to various OS\u0027s, ratings fees, localization, website upkeep,\u00a0among other aspects in game design and creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is to help fund the active development of \u0027Untitled Game #1\u0027. I plan on doing a Kickstarter down the road, but this is just to help push this project along a little bit in order to help create some killer content that can also serve to help trailers and other marketing content. I apologize the rewards aren\u0027t amazing, but I do want to save the epic awards for the Kickstarter. If you want to wait until then to pledge, that is perfectly fine! It\u0027s just easier to manage what backers get which major reward tier in 1 location. Thanks for your understanding!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for your time and patience in reading what I have presented here. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email razgamingtv@gmail.com\u00a0or my Twitter - @DBI_Kyle.\u003cbr\u003e"
