Her writing focuses on a wide range of philosophies - \u003cstrong\u003eBody Trust\u00ae, Health\nat Every Size\u00ae, Intuitive Eating, Fat Liberation, eating disorder recovery, and\nmore.\u003c/strong\u003e She seeks to share what she has experienced and continues to learn from her own\ndiscovery and journey with body liberation. Sarah definitely does not have all\nthe answers, but she\u2019s super excited to share what she has learned so\nfar. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEven while Sarah is fat,\nfemale, and queer, she recognizes that being a working-class, white, and cis\ngender woman has afforded her many privileges. She strives to listen and learn\nfrom experiences that differ from hers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe is in recovery from an eating\ndisorder after a life-long struggle. Her recovery is what led her to\nbecome a Certified Body Trust Advocate and to become an eating disorder\nrecovery coach. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSarah is \u003cstrong\u003econstantly wondering\u003c/strong\u003e how she\ncan contribute to healing, justice, and liberation in our world where there is\nconstant suffering through oppression. She loves working with people who are\nasking these same questions! These questions have been on her mind since she\nwas a kid and started volunteering at Hattie Larlham Foundation with children\nthat experienced severe physical and intellectual disabilities in Northeast\nOhio. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese questions only got stronger as\nshe recognized that her sexuality was different than that of those around her\nand rejected by her the religion she was raised with. When police brutality\nagainst people of color was called out in Cleveland while she was living there,\neven more questions came to the surface. As Sarah attended medical school, she\nsaw firsthand how often \u003cstrong\u003eweight and health are conflated\u003c/strong\u003e. She continues asking\nthese really fucking important questions about healing, justice, and\nliberation, because she does not think she\u0027ll ever be done learning.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSarah is an ice cream connoisseur, Grey\u2019s Anatomy expert, avid movie buff, and\nlover of all of her friends\u2019 pets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin the exclusive community by choosing your preferred reward level and let\u0027s move closer to \u003cstrong\u003ebody freedom together!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
