Marie, ON.  This period of time was profound for my own \nartistic development and for the community at large.  After the Arcadia \nProject closed in September of 2009, there has been an outgrowth of \ncreative projects frantically attempting to compensate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn Febuary of 2010, I acquired property to aid my level of production.  \u003ca href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fthemedicinefactory.wordpress.com%2F\u0026amp;t=ZGVlN2JkMjNhNDA5ZDE5NmU5Nzc4YWE0ZmY0MDY4MDZiOGI5ZGQ3OCxUbU4zdWpESg%3D%3D\"\u003eThe Medicine Factory studio\u003c/a\u003e\n which continues to operate independent of my  influence as the Galleria\n of Shops.
