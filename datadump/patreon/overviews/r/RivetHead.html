I have tried to design the rewards is an way that people can help support me and my channel and get some simple benefits for themselves too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing a small channel makes it difficult to afford some of the things that I would like to do for this community, and starting this Patreon will help me get these projects off the ground. As an added benefit, it will allow me to be less reliant on trying to make a living off of ad revenue alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start off with, I will be keeping the reward levels to a minimum.
