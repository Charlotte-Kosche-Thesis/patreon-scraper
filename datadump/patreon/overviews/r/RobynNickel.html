I\u0027m there so I can feed my addiction to the arts.

Well, just by hanging out, really. It\u0027s going to take me a while to get a handle on how to run this particular joint, but as it stands, I post near-daily on instagram with lo-res photos of all my projects and update my home website every two weeks or so. I\u0027d like to post 2-3 times a month here, probably on Thursdays, with character sheets, concept art, and eventually full pages of the aforementioned comics. You can contribute how much or as little as you want, and still eventually see the full product.
