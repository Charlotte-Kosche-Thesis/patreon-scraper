People often say that we are not what we do, but in my case, I am. I am an artist. What I do is the air that I breathe. It is my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the author and illustrator of both the Messenger Oracle and the Dreams of Gaia Tarot, and I am now working on the next deck. However, being a self-employed artist and author, it can be difficult to balance the creative and the business side that pays the bills and provides a safe place in which to create. For an artist to create, those bills need to be paid, or all our time goes into selling, and survival, instead of creating. This Patreon account has been created for those who want to help support my creative endeavours and play a key role in helping my next projects to manifest. Without support, the next deck could take years to create. With your support, I can focus my energies and time on painting and writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange, depending on your level of support, you will have access to information and extras that I share nowhere else. You will be the first to know what\u0027s happening in my life and creative space. You will also have the opportunity to be gifted with original artworks and other exclusive offerings as well as the pledge rewards.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe humans sometimes need to be reminded of the power, beauty, and magic that we can and do create with our hands and minds. Without art, our reality is a little less vibrant and colourful; art is one of the most positive and healing ways humanity both adds to and celebrates the beauty that already exists in the natural world. It is your choice to nurture and support artistic expression by supporting the artists who both create and inspire. Will you play a role in making magic happen?\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWith much love and gratitude \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note:\u003c/strong\u003e Pledge prints will only be sent via snail mail to patrons who are within Australia.

     "about": "Born in 1969, Australian alchemist artist and author, Ravynne Michele Phelan, a.k.a. Michele-lee Phelan, came to her artistic career in her early thirties after being diagnosed with depression, for which she was prescribed art and writing as a means of therapy and healing. This unusual prescription rekindled a lifelong childhood dream of becoming an artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDedicated to her craft, for the last fifteen years, Ravynne (pronounced Raven) has painted on an almost daily basis. Thousands of hours and hundreds of paintings later, many for publishers, self-published authors, and private commission, she now illustrates her own projects and creates divinatory tools for the purpose of helping others become self-aware, creative, expressive, and to reach their potential. She has developed a unique and recognisable style, and creates illustrations that are magical, powerful, and evocative; works of art that open the mind and touch the hearts of many. Her original paintings and prints hang on the walls of countless homes, in many different countries, all over the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring this time, Ravynne has also authored and illustrated the Dreams of Gaia Tarot, Messenger Oracle, and Dreams of Magic. She is also the illustrator of Mythic Oracle of the Ancient Greek Pantheon, written by Carisa Mellado, and is one of several artists who contributed illustrations for Oracle of the Dragonfae by Lucy Cavendish. \u003cbr\u003e",
