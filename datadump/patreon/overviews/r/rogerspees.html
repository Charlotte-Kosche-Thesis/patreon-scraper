Here on Patreon I intend to share live streamed pianoconcerts and other inspiration. You can feed me with new inspiration. That can be through stories, pictures, your artworks, or anything you want to share. Maybe you want to be able to cope with something in your life or want to transform a blockage. I can tune into that and play music that helps you with that. That\u0027s my work. And Because I want to share this with the world and open up the hearts of more and more people, I feel that Patreon is the way. Because that way people can also donate what they feel it is worth and I can keep on spreading my music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to share my music and inspiration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso when there are big solar events like eclipses or full moon etc. I can tune into that and play music that helps you cope with those energies. But ofcourse I also play music to fall asleep, or for your child. You just ask, and I will play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
