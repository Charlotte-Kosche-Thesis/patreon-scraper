Here\u0027s our story:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe formed in Los Angeles in 2013\u003c/strong\u003e when the country cover band that Jenny Pagliaro was singing in auditioned Angela Petrilli for a vacant guitar position. We immediately bonded over their desire to perform original material and similar tastes in music \u2013 from the classics like Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles and Bonnie Raitt; to more contemporary artists like Patty Griffin, Sheryl Crow and Miranda Lambert. It was a mutual love of singer-songwriter Ray LaMontagne and his song \u0027Roses and Cigarettes\u0027 that inspired the name of our band. \u003cem\u003e(Insert Question: \"Who\u0027s the Rose and who\u0027s the Cigarette here. We get that at EVERY show. Seriously. hahaha)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen we released our debut album in May of 2015\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ewe were eager to promote it by hitting the road and playing the songs live. \u003c/strong\u003eThose plans were put on hold in early July when Jenny was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer, and immediately began treatment. Jenny underwent two surgeries, 8 rounds of chemo and radiation only to have the cancer return again in September of 2016 \u2013 just prior to our west coast tour. The tour and shows went on, and upon returning to LA, Jenny once again entered another round of grueling treatment. Despite a Stage IV diagnosis, the new treatment has been effective and Jenny is finally seeing her health start to improve! She knows she won\u2019t ever be cured of the disease, but making music with Roses \u0026amp; Cigarettes is the best medicine of all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.rosesandcigarettes.com/#music\"\u003eSo what does our music sound like??\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eWe like to call it an eclectic blend of Roots, Rock, Americana with a little bit of folk, country and blues thrown in for good measure! During our time as a band we\u0027ve supported acts such as Jim Lauderdale, Luther Dickinson, Radney Foster, Elizabeth Cook, Billy Bob Thornton and the Boxmasters, The Record Company and Amanda Shires among others. Our music has been featured on KLOS FM and KCSN FM in Los Angeles and we work with folks from Fender Guitars, Martin Guitars and D\u2019Addario guitar strings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAt this moment,\u003c/strong\u003e we are finishing up a set of acoustic EPs with some fan favorites from our first album and a handful of new songs from our upcoming LP release!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe want to welcome you on board with us and join us on our music making journey!!!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ePeople like you help us create the art that is our life blood.
