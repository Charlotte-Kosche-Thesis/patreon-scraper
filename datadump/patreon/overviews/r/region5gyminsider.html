The Region 5 Gym Insider is the official media platform for the USA Junior Olympic Region 5 Gymnastics Community. The Region 5 Gym Insider is a media outlet created to showcase and promote our current Region 5 athletes (Elite and JO), as well as former athletes competing in college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will bring you an inside look to one of the most decorated and competitive regions in the country.\u00a0The Insider media brings you gymnastics competition videos and athlete interviews, as well as behind the scenes stories and special video series features profiling our athletes and coaches.\u00a0As you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. We want to take the Insider to the next level and provide more gym business or coaching technique/strategy videos or webinars to help our region continue to improve and stay at the cutting edge of the sport. \u003cbr\u003eAlong with new content, we are also looking to improve the quality of our competition livestreams, set up an internship program for those interested in media journalism careers, and create a podcast to open an avenue to discuss Region 5 related topics . By you joining our exclusive community, it allows us to focus on making the most valuable content for you that we possibly can, instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow Patreon works: \u003c/strong\u003eYou, as our\u00a0awesome Patron\u0027s, can helps us continue to promote the great sport of gymnastics with monthly contribution for the content we publish. We have several tiers in which to join our community and help us deliver more exciting content. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
