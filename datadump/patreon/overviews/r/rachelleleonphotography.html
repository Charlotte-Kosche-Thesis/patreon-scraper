    "summary": "In 2011, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Because of my brain lesions I developed poor memory and facial recognition, along with a myriad of other symptoms. I began to look at photos I had taken and I\u0027d write whatever came to mind. One emotion would lead to another and eventually I\u0027d remember something once long forgotten. Immediately I\u0027d leave the room I was in and envision the memory as if it were yesterday. No matter how many times I looked at the same photo, I\u0027d never get sick of that feeling. That feeling of appreciating something so fleeting is such a gift. The photos made me realize that my memories weren\u0027t gone. They were just deep within my soul and needed help to push through the darkness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a way, my disability brought light into my world. It enabled me to turn something dire into something beautiful. From pain I found purpose and it opened my eyes to the world of photography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in the surrounding town of Winthrop. I shortly attended the Museum of Fine Arts School, Boston for photography. While there I discovered my passion for the pen and earned a BFA in Professional Writing at Salem State University. While at Salem State I combined my photography and writing into a photo blog for my university e-zine, Red Skies. After moving to Maine I attended Southern Maine Community College, where I earned an AS in Marine Biology and Oceanography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether photographing nature, an object, or person my only hope is for others to be able to feel. I want my photography to be used as a tool to help the viewer remember his own personal memories; pieces to his story that may have been missing. Memories are precious and powerful and fleeting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my influences include Frida Kahlo, Alphonse Mucha, Sir John Tenniel, Lewis Carroll, Ansel Adams, Jerry Uelsmann, and Annie Leibovitz.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently reside in Gorham Maine with my husband, Max and our three cats, Ichabod, Pumpkin, and Moriarty, our frog, Deedle Doo, our turtle, Snoopy, and our two potbelly pigs, Barnabas Jayne and Igor Von Porkenstein.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help fund my Patreon so I can continue to create and contribute to the art community, as well as to our household since I can no longer work. Any contribution is very appreciated."
