    "summary": "Rutherford County Arts Council is a non-profit 501 (c) (3), community based organization, dedicated to cultural revitalization through the arts.  This goal is pursued through works of art produced by the Arts Council, particularly drama, and through support of and partnership with other organizations and individuals dedicated to the same purpose.  The participation of children in artistic projects, both in and out of the school setting, is especially encouraged and facilitated by the Arts Council, not only cultivating the full potential of the individual child, but, in the surest way, enriching, revitalizing, and building up our community and the larger culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRCAC\u0027s current drama program at Maple Street Theatre provides participants of all ages with the unique opportunity to take part in professionally produced and directed shows, free of charge, with no previous experience required. \u00a0The schedule features theatrical standards by Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Neil Simon, Agatha Christie, Anton Chekov, etc. as well as new theatrical works based on classic tales such as Beowulf, Aesop\u0027s Fables, and The Canterbury Tales. \u00a0The program is hugely beneficial to performers and audience alike, but it also represents a significant and ongoing expense. \u00a0The Maple Street Theatre productions will be regularly featured on Patreon as primary examples of the unique cultural experiences provided by the Arts Council which would be impossible without the generous support of patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Arts Council is entirely dependent on donations, gifts, and grants for its continued operation. \u00a0All donations are tax-deductible. \u00a0A monthly gift, no matter how small, has a large impact on our ability to maintain and expand our programs and offerings. \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
