    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u0027s up sluts, guess who just got out of prison!\u003c/h3\u003e(Be ready for numerous bad attempts at humour and references to dumb things you probably don\u0027t understand.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003eMy name is Emma, though on almost any form of Social Media you can find me under the name Rainydaysandtiramisu! (Yeah it\u0027s a mouthful I know, blame my ingenious middle school mind.) I haven\u0027t been cosplaying very long but it\u0027s quickly become a primary aspect of my life. I still have a lot to learn but I\u0027m slowly branching out and improving on numerous aspects such as; crafting, wig styling, prop making, sewing and general makeup transformations. My biggest concern when it comes to cosplay is to make myself and others happy. Being able to bring a smile to someone\u0027s face or inspire them to push themselves is what drives me. I hope that I can become someone worthy of the support and friends I have and I push myself to do the best I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to improve as quickly as possible but cosplay isn\u0027t a cheap hobby by any means, which is partially why I decided to create a Patreon in the first place. I\u0027ve struggled for a long time at asking and accepting help, but as it\u0027s become more accepted to seek out support I figured I would try. (Besides I need all the help I can get.)\u00a0 Another aspect of Patreon is that it acts as both a responsibility and as motivation, it\u0027s something that I know I can work hard for that\u0027s not just for myself, but for everyone who supports me. I want to be able to give my undivided attention and reward those who go the extra mile and Patreon gives me the ability to hear each of your individual voices. Lastly, I want to be a major part of the cosplay community, I want to meet more people, forge new friendships and continue to learn everything that I can, but most importantly Patreon to me is a way to let me become more involved with you guys and vice versa.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat can I expect from your Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003eAs a cosplayer my Patreon will consist primarily of cosplay content, whether this is through pictures, edits, tutorials or videos. Though the type of content I provide will also depend on you guys and what you each like since the main point of my Patreon is to allow me to hear each of your voices and create more content you\u0027d enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, the majority of my cosplay\u0027s are a mixture\u00a0of both video games and anime characters though I\u0027ve found myself sometimes wandering into other genres such as cartoon characters. The difficulty for each cosplay varies depending on the cosplay but I\u0027m always eager to try larger and grander projects as I try to expand my experience with prop making and makeup!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/ded5b755e8bafed12b95be0076184475/tumblr_oxs0webifO1rhiwclo1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love to do group or partner cosplay with friends or soon-to-be friends! I enjoy doing a lot of shippy pictures and I will definitely post them here on Patreon and,\u00a0depending on what you guys like, I might focus on some pairings more than others. If you have particular requests be sure to let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/5077cc259531d0b3aabe84e7b674438d/tumblr_oxs0webifO1rhiwclo2_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile prop making is something I\u0027ve become more interested in and an area in cosplay I definitely want to expand upon I\u0027m most familiar with the makeup side of cosplay. I enjoy trying numerous unique makeup looks and I am excited to expand into more complex and fantastical makeup transformations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/33591d0b32ec2ffd309b784e462fe3c0/tumblr_oxs0webifO1rhiwclo3_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere will my money be going?\u003c/h3\u003eAll Patreon support goes straight to cosplay, so if you\u0027re worried about your money going to just pampering me then don\u0027t worry! All money from my lovely patrons goes to buying cosplay materials such as fabric, wigs, props, ect. This money will also go to paying for con tickets and perhaps even some of it will be able to assist me in going to conventions a bit further from home!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t have the money to support you?\u003c/h3\u003eThat\u0027s totally fine and I completely understand! I don\u0027t have any expectations and I appreciate even a little, but I don\u0027t blame people for looking out for themselves first. I will of course still be posting to my other social media accounts, that won\u0027t stop! But pledging to be a Patron gets you special rewards, sneak peaks, and special content privileges among other things! Things will probably change and shift as I go along and learn more about Patreon and how it works but please be patient with me and hopefully we can enjoy this experience together!"
