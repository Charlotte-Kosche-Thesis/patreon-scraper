Thanks to social media connecting me with all of you, our community provided these families with belongings, homes, jobs and new friends. Then we did it all again with helping coordinate volunteers to respond to the Rena disaster off our own shore.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eI use social media to link people with information and resources, and to inspire us all to rise up and be leaders for bringing change and hope around us. \u00a0Through setting up social media pages and groups such as the Papamoa, Mount Maunganui, Greerton, Bethlehem, Whanau Ora, Rise Up Tauranga and Humans of Tauranga Facebook pages, \u00a0and NZ Sunrise \u0026amp; Sunset, \u00a0Papamoa Link, \u00a0BOP Cantabs and Mount Link Facebook groups, I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting so many people and learning about their amazing lives.
