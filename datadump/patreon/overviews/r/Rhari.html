It means a lot of time at my desk and in my \"office\". When not parked at the computer, my hobbies involve Parenting, Convention running, and Music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhat I\u0027d like to do with Patreon:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently Revamping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhat do you get for your pledges?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nArt! Lots and lots of art. This will include comics in progress, sketches, streams, Illustrations and Video Tutorials! You\u0027ll also get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n1. Early Access.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will be the first place I post my videos and comics. This includes sketches and ideas, things that will never make it to my public galleries. That\u0027s not to say this is a paywall, but you\u0027ll see the inner workings of my artwork, from the ground up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone also gets a monthly art pack. For the $1-$5 tiers you get a nicely packaged \"Month-Year Finished Work\" package which includes all the images ready for publishing on the web that month. \u003cbr\u003eFor anyone in the $10 tier and above, you get my full month\u0027s work. This includes my own personal work, sketches for clients and in-progress comic works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone gets access to the Showcase Saturday and Tutorial Tuesday videos before they go up on Youtube, as they are produced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n2. Input\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m working on comics you will have direct access to me and my stories. If you have a suggestion, I\u0027ll take the time to hear it and it could turn the tide for someone\u0027s plot, or adventure. You could literally end up saving a character (I\u0027m morbid, I like killing off secondary characters. \n\u003cem\u003eWon\u0027t somebody think of the characters!\u003c/em\u003e) You\u0027ll also be given the opportunity from time to time to have your characters APPEAR in my comics. I will let you know the kind of character I\u0027m looking for, and you\u0027ll be welcome to submit your characters for me to look over and choose from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom time to time I\u0027ll request a model or two for youtube, ads and other pieces of arts, especially if I think someone\u0027s character is suited for a specific piece I\u0027m working on. I\u0027ll reach out to people in the $5+ tiers to submit their characters for use. It\u0027ll be grand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n3. Streams and Chats\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to open up a Discord or Telegram chat for Patrons to join into! :D Streams are a rarity these days but I hope for them to make a come back! Patrons are given as much advance notice as I can give before I start a stream!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, and if there\u0027s interest, I would also like to host group and 1:1 lessons to cover the things that can\u0027t be generalized. Have a hybrid character you\u0027re struggling with? Need to know Just how that one expression is achieved? You can grab my time and work through it with me. (And yes, you\u0027ll likely get some art out of it too.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Printed Perks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce per month, I\u0027ll be creating a print or postcard of my choosing to my Patreon supporters in the \"Printed Perks\" tier. This will be a finished piece that is only available to $20+ supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also begin hosting a Patreon Request stream once per month when we hit the $300 milestone! (But you have to be pledging $5 or more to get in on that!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eIn Conclusion\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope this has answered everyone\u0027s questions and given you more of an idea of what I would like to do with this Patreon of mine.
