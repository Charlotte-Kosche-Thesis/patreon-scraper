    "summary": "Oh gracious, I didn\u0027t hear you come in. Welcome to my Patreon Page. I\u0027m Renald Lefebvre and I make videos on the Youtube. Why? Well... ever since a young age I was drawn to the fictional worlds in books and games. I tried my hand at writing novels and wasn\u0027t particularly skilled at it. At the same time my attentions began turning further from the page and closer to the screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began watching Youtube videos of people playing the games that I couldn\u0027t afford or couldn\u0027t find but often they didn\u0027t focus on the elements of the game that mattered most to me. And then most of the people who ran the channels I liked stopped creating. I wanted creators who presented the game as an emotional experience and an artistic work. People who would critique as they played and could properly express what it was that brought them to their conclusions. I didn\u0027t want someone to simply scream at FNAF jump scares, I wanted someone to tell me why they couldn\u0027t help themselves from getting frightened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(238, 236, 225);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219, 229, 241);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0am I making?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u00a0A Let\u0027s Play video every day where I play a series of mildly related games, say funny words, and employ over-dramatic voice acting. While being competent at playing the game and commenting on what works in it, what doesn\u0027t, and why. Oh, also, weekly game reviews on my Tumblr and Wordpress blogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0do I do these things?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI really love videogames. I love writing about them and playing them. I think they present a fantastic opportunity to have an interactive and emotional experience and I want to share that passion with others. I also like making jokes and saying the things that make people chuckle, so this is a great opportunity for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy\u003c/em\u003e do I need your support?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eBecause I don\u0027t see the need for ad supported creations any longer now that the people can directly support and help creators make things that they all like. Oh yeah, and I need to pay my bills and eat. It would also be nice get some editing software and other things I can use to improve the quality of my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0do you get?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eMy eternal gratitude... oh and more content. Streams, better video quality, more videos, more reviews, podcasts where I play table-top games with people, and some exclusive content as well. A direct say in the content that I create. Heck, the three dollar level comes with the promise of poems, or something similar, for those who give a little more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGeez. You finally got the end of my long Patreon spiel so, thanks. Thanks a lot for offering your support. Just taking the time to check all this out makes you a cool person.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
