    "summary": "Hello to those who have found their way onto my patreon page! I am ecstatic to see that you are at least considering supporting me. Currently I am trying to be a writer, but have not been able to completely figure out how to do so. I moonlight as a fanfiction writer and have had some success there, but I want to get into the review and original writing business! However, fanfiction is still one of my passions and I will still post various things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to utilize this patreon to springboard my own personal anime review site into being, letting it help to pay for the domain and what not. I also intend for it to help with various other projects that might arise in the future if it is a success, such as a podcast, or more dear to my heart, original novels. This is not an endeavor I take lightly, but I hope those of you who have come to this page have liked my work, either through fanfic, or something you have seen in my public posts! My anime reviews will be a mix of patron only and public posts, while the fanfiction (even ones that I will occasionally post incomplete here) will obviously remain free. This is more to allow me to update both things quicker along with keeping the domain for my review site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to be able to post at least 5 days a week just like a regular job! I don\u0027t want you to believe that I\u0027m only interested in taking your money just to make it rain, I\u0027m going to dedicate a lot of time and energy to both my posts and my fanfiction chapters. Later on I will also begin the journey of Original Novels which those of you who do support me will have access to!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do give me your support you\u0027ll be able to get access to my posts here, which will usually be Anime Reviews and previews to various content that I am producing, be it fanfiction or otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I think that\u0027s all for now, thank you for your patreon if you decide I\u0027m worth the time! I am forever indebted to you."

Whether that be writing in the fanfiction world, anime reviews, or original works I love everything about writing! Sadly my time to write is greatly constrained because of the dreaded bane of all adults, bills. I have a variety of bills that I must pay and that means more work and less time to write. I am hoping that this page will help me hone my craft and allow me to write more and give back to anyone who has enjoyed my writing! If you want to see some examples of my writing, you can find me at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/~redhathackersin\"\u003ehttps://www.fanfiction.net/~redhathackersin\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://animeotakureview.com/\"\u003ehttp://animeotakureview.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy my work!",
