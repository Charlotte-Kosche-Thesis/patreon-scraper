I\u2019m a Canadian, living in Ireland. I was educated as an Architect, developed skills in the realm of digital visual arts, stretched my brain within an independent ecological/social/economic think-tank, have built a house for myself and my family in an ecovillage, and I am a grower of vegetables.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days, I am trying to focus all of my time developing and managing the RED Garden Project, which I see as a citizen led research and development project, focused on helping people grow food for themselves and others. This project includes a series of 7 family sized vegetable gardens, each following a different methodology. It also includes a larger, intermediate scale growing project which I call the Black Plot, plus a lot of side projects that I am beginning to develop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also create videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the videos about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos describe aspects or methods of a particular garden, or they explore the differences and similarities between the gardens. Some focus on particular vegetables, pests or techniques. Some explore how growing your own food relates to the problems of the world, and others touch on the philosophical. My experiences, observations, successes, and more importantly my failures, are the dominant theme throughout all of the videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of videos are they?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am trying to explore the possibilities of the educational \u2018video essay\u2019 format (which is being pioneered by Nerdwriter and others). I generally stay away from the how-to, or video blog formats, which are quite common forms that many other growers use. For me, the essay type format consists of carefully scripted, illustrated and edited narratives to explore, explain and question. This format fits best with how I think, work and the nature of the RED Garden Project. Fundamentally, I\u0027m an enthusiast, an empiricist and a sceptical explorer, seeking to build skills and share whatever I can. I hope all of this comes through in my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do videos come out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to produce 3 or 4 videos a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money raised form Patreon is to pay myself to create the videos, which I script, film, and edit myself. These videos are free for anyone to view, and always will be, but without funding I will not be able to continue to spend the time producing videos to such a high standard. If I can get enough support, I can start to earn an income for all of the work that I do in the gardens, and to take on other projects and purchase better equipment. See my Goals for more detail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere else do I get money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI earn money from the sale of vegetables harvested from the gardens, selling direct to people within my community, and I feed people at monthly \u2018Soil to Plate\u2019 Feasts. I also earn money from occasional teaching gigs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RED Garden project does not have any corporate or institutional funding, and I want to keep it that way, as I want this project to maintain its independence and freedom. I am not comfortable with earning money from sponsorship or adds, and would much rather all my work is citizen funded. That is why I have started this Patreon Page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for even considering becoming a Patron, and any support you could give would help me to continue to produce these videos and further my explorations in growing food!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBruce\u003cbr\u003e"
