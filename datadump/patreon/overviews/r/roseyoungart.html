As you can see, I too am a creator, and back in the day, artists like me depended a great deal on the royalty class, and those with a great deal of excess to commission work and support them as artists. As the times have changed, we need new platforms like this one to support the arts as a collective (in small increments that add up to a living wage or more) and maintain the culture of creativity we all desire.\u003cbr\u003eSo I am here in this little corner of the internet and the world, with my curiosity, motivation and inspiration, creating art in my own unique way, and asking for your support. Together we will add a piece to this beautiful, cultural, creative puzzle. I hope you will join me on this adventure, and I look forward to sharing my creations, my words, and my inspiration with you. \u003cbr\u003eIn love and gratitude,\u003cbr\u003eRose Kelila Young\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
