I call myself a writer of songs and stories, which means I perform concerts, record albums, and write books. I\u0027ve been doing these things since I was a kid. I hope to do them until I die. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in, the patron. The relationship between artist and patron is as ancient as humanity, and I believe it is a sacred trust between two people with different callings in life who join together to create meaning for each other. Yet it is not a trust with walls or distance between us. We are joined by our passions, not divided by them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the price of a bottle of wine once a month, I\u0027ll give you everything I\u0027ve created plus an intimate connection to me (and I drink a LOT of wine too). CORRECTION: I USED to drink a lot of wine but these days every last dime is going into these projects! In return for your support, I\u0027ll play shows for you, jam with you, bring you into my creative world, and listen to your voice as an influence on my path.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current goals are to record my first studio album for a winter release date, and to help finance my first US tours in 2017 (\u003ca href=\"http://www.ryangregoryfloyd.com/tour\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecurrent dates here\u003c/a\u003e). I\u0027d also love to publish my second book, a historical adventure novel set in New Orleans in 1814. If you choose to honor me with your belief in my potential, I will do my utmost to honor your trust in every way I can.
