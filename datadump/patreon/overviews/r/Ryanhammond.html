    "summary": "I am excited to announce that I will be recording an EP (Exclusive Preview) music project to be released this fall.The EP will be called TRAGEDY TO TRIUMPH.\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up in a family of worshippers, to say I have always loved worship music would be an understatement. It\u2019s in my DNA. It\u2019s who I am. It\u2019s who God has called me to be and what He has gifted me to do. It is my passion. I am a worshipper!\u003cbr\u003eSince I was child, I have received many words from the Lord regarding worship and music. I\u2019ve been told that I would release music that would go around the world and recently I received a word that the time is now. Although I have had many opportunities in the secular music world, I knew that wasn\u2019t the plan God had for me. I have been praying into this for a very long time, and waiting for God to release me to move forward\u2014now is the time!\u003cbr\u003eGod has put the very best people in my path to turn this dream into reality. I will be recording, mixing and mastering at Soundhouse Studios (Jesus Culture, Bethel, Kari Jobe, Michael W. Smith, Simone Benoit). My songwriting and project manager is Lynniah Herron. Christian Camarena will be doing the media design.\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot more key people that will make my dream a reality\u2014YOU!\u003cbr\u003eAs with any recording project, everything comes with a price tag. The total cost for the entire project is $30,000. Would you considering partnering with me? Your gift matters! No matter the gift, big or small, you can be a part of bringing my music to the world. 100% of all monies raised will go to the project, including all production, recording, mixing and mastering costs, website and album design, promo and lyric videos, and ALBUM RELEASE CONCERT.\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a moment to prayerfully consider giving to this project. I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t leave empty handed. Depending on the size of your gift, you can pick from an assortment of reward packages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eALL DONORS WILL GET FREE ADMISSION TO THE ALBUM RELEASE CONCERT (Dates TBA)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDonate $25 or more and get a digital copy of the EP\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDonate $50 or more and get a signed hard copy of the EP\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDonate $100 or more and get a signed hard copy of the EP and a T-shirt\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDonate $500 or more and get 5 signed EPs, 2 T-shirts and I\u2019ll record a song of your choice and send it to you\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDonate $2500 or more and get 10 signed copies, PLUS I\u2019ll do a worship service at your church or sing at a special event (airfare/travel, accommodations, and meals not included) and backstage passes at my first show (Dates \u0026amp; Details TBA)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eEverything is falling into place so quickly and I know God is in this. The songwriting portion will be completed by the end of June and I will be in the studio in July, with expected EP release in early fall. Before I can get into the studio, I will need to have the funds together.\u003cbr\u003eI trust in God\u2019s perfect timing and I truly believe that together we can reach this goal.  Please partner with me and help me get the word out about this campaign.  Thank you in advance for your prayers, support and generosity. If my music or my life has touched you in any way, would you share this so others can also consider contributing?\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eRyan Hammond\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youcaring.com/external-link.htm?target=http-#--_--_-www.facebook.com-_-ryanjonhammond\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/ryanjonhammond\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIG: ryanjonhammond\u003cbr\u003e"
