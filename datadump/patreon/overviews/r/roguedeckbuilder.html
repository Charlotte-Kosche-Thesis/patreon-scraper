    "summary": "Are you one of those people who thinks outside the box or appreciates solving a problem through unconventional methods? Do you aspire towards creativity and ingenuity rather than just tried and tested results? If so, you have come to the right place! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHi there, my name is \u003cstrong\u003eKevin Crimin\u003c/strong\u003e, the founder of the popular youtube channel The Rogue Deckbuilder. You may be a fan of my content, or have seen my videos from the popular website Gatheringmagic.com. For over three years I have been aspiring towards and creating alternative decks and brews for Magic: the Gathering.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the MTG community, these decks are called \"\u003cstrong\u003erogue decks\u003c/strong\u003e\" hence the name \"\u003cstrong\u003eThe Rogue Deckbuilder.\u003c/strong\u003e\" But, I try to look past just being different or building wacky brews or unattainable combos (what we call \u0027magical christmas land\u0027). I endlessly strive for perfection through creativity; meaning the goal is always to create the most original yet competitive decks possible. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother thing that separates me from other \u003cstrong\u003eMTG\u003c/strong\u003e content producers is my independent voice and willingness to speak my mind - not only Magic: the Gathering news and content, but also issues surrounding the community as a whole. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor over three years this has been made possible by various sponsorships, ad revenue and other financial opportunities. However, recently the climate for these sources has been changing. With the constant dwindling of overall ad revenue per view and the more saturated and competitive nature of digital media, I can no longer rely on the old methods of not only maintaining but \u003cstrong\u003eGROWING\u003c/strong\u003e my vision for \u003cem\u003eMagic: the Gathering\u003c/em\u003e content and the \"rogue\" community.\u00a0 It becomes more complicated when opportunities have been stifled or even turned down at the expense of me keeping my freedom to maintain and voice my personal perspectives and opinions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am reaching out to you kindred spirits to help me achieve my vision of a vibrant and lasting community around the Rogue Deckbuilder.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn this page, you will find many current projects and series, as well as new ideas we have planned for the\u00a0 future. If you are a fan of any of these projects, or in general, believe in the vision, I would be more than grateful for your patronage! Your donations will directly go to funding these and other upcoming projects. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMarket Monday: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GosBqxAMJs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMarket Monday\u003c/strong\u003e is a weekly series where I give my advice on the Magic: the Gathering market. My goal for this series is to help the average player successfully manage their MTG collection and navigate through the volatile rotations and price spikes through smart trades and investments. My personal qualifications are that I have been involved with multiple local games stores throughout my \u0027career\u0027 in Magic: the Gathering as well as recovered from my own adversities having my original $8000 collection stolen. By savvy trades and collection management, I was able to turn an Avacyn Restored Event deck into a healthy and competitive MTG collection within a few short years with little cash investments. I want to show my viewers that it is very possible to follow suit and be successful in the often tumultuous and confusing MTG market. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\nThe Rogue Commander Spotlight Series:\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYRZCUuhW1Y\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/h4\u003e\nAlthough I consider myself more of a competitive player than a \"casual\" player, I do enjoy a good commander brew. As far as brewing is concerned, Commander is a treasure trove of creative synergies and fun interactions. All in all, it is probably my favorite format to sit down in front of the drawing board, get into that mad scientist mode and completely let loose! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, this series is incredibly time consuming and editing intensive. With your support, I can dedicate one day a week to brewing towards the next masterpiece. In the near future, I will allow Patrons to vote on an upcoming Commander that they are interested in me brewing around!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\nBrewer\u0027s Council\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy far the most common email or question I receive is for me to look at and critique a fan\u0027s brew. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to respond to every message I receive. For Patrons interested in the one on one direct line of communication with The Rogue Deckbuilder, I promise to give you my undivided attention for one inquiry per month. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons on the Brewer\u0027s Council will also have the opportunity to vote on upcoming brews or deck ideas! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\nTeam RDB!\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s right! The Rogue Deckbuilder is creating a team and you can be a part of it! Join \u003cem\u003eThe Filthy Rogues\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCrew\n Members will receive all of the benefits from the lower tiers, \nincluding voting on upcoming brews, purchasing rogue merchandise / gear \nat cost, and access to all other benefits of the patreon page! \n\u003cbr\u003e"
