    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eMy name is\nAmanda Leightner and I\u2019m the creator behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rochesterrising.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRochester Rising\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRochester\nRising is an online news site that amplifies stories of entrepreneurs in\nRochester, Minnesota. There are, of course, other online media platforms in\ntown. What differentiates Rochester Rising is that we are entrepreneur-centric,\nfocusing in on the person and how they built, and are building, their business\nin Rochester and the surrounding area. We produce several articles and one\npodcast each week and have started to dabble in some video content to tell\nthese stories and showcase the culture and diversity of the entrepreneurial\ncommunity in Rochester.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRochester Rising was \u003ca href=\"http://rochesterrising.org/main/2016/7/18/welcome-to-rochester-rising?rq=welcome\"\u003el\u003c/a\u003eaunched in July 2016 to fill a real\ngap in the community. We had innovation springing up all over Rochester, but no\none was really talking about it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are multiple reasons why\nthis is the perfect time to tell these stories. Foremost, they show that we do\nhave risk takers in this city. Rochester is perceived as a conservative,\nrisk-averse culture centered around one industry, with any innovation occurring\nin biotech or healthcare. Those of us engaged in the entrepreneurial community\nhere know that\u2019s not the full picture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDuring the past ~2 years that\nRochester Rising has existed, we\u2019ve told the stories of 134 different entrepreneurs,\nstartups, and innovation initiatives in Rochester and the surrounding\ncommunities. Many of these stories were in biotech and healthtech. However, we\u2019ve\nshared the journey of many other entrepreneurs, including those operating in\nretail, food and beverage, fitness, tech, and social entrepreneurship. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe feel that it\u2019s important to\ntell the stories of people taking risks, taking chances with no safety net,\ninnovating, creating, and not following the expected route. These stories are\nvaluable tools to inspire others, showcase the creativity that is already\noccurring here, and build up the entrepreneurial community piece by piece.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight now, we also have a unique\nopportunity in Rochester with Destination Medical Center, a $5.6B economic\ndevelopment initiative to make the city a global destination for health and\nwellness. Whatever occurs with these developments, they will cause\nunprecedented change to this city over the next couple decades. Right now, it\u2019s\na unique time to launch a business in this city and begin to gain the attention\nof talent looking to this area.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow is the exact time for\nsomething like Rochester Rising to exist to document and begin to record the\nrise of entrepreneurship in Rochester. We do have a small and young\nentrepreneurial community, but it\u2019s growing daily. We feel that it\u2019s essential\nto tell this story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRochester Rising has had steady\nimpact in the community. The articles, podcasts, and videos that we generate allow\npeople to see the faces and hear the voices of our local creators. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2018, we\u2019ve also begun launching some women-focused entrepreneurial events to connect and engage the entrepreneurial community, including our first\nbirthday party in July and several women-focused business events. We have also\nbegun to produce educational materials to help people understand and connect to\nthe community. This includes our \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://rochesterrising.org/roadmap\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRoadmap to the Rochester Entrepreneurial\nCommunity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u201d, which will be updated every year as well as self-published print and online magazines\u00a0to\nshare these stories in a different way. This past year we\u0027ve also launched an ongoing #Emerge series to showcase the faces and voices of Rochester\u0027s entrepreneurial community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis whole process has involved\nan immense amount of learning, failing, and growing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn November 2016 we launched a\nsustaining membership drive to do exactly that, help to make Rochester Rising a\nlasting part of the community to continue to tell these stories. Our sustaining\nmemberships are run through the crowdfunding platform \u003ca href=\"http://rochesterrising.org/become-a-patron/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. This method is a little bit different than\ncrowdfunding through Kickstarter or Indiegogo. Patreon campaigns are on-going,\nwhere patrons give a monthly contribution to fuel a creative project. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/RochesterRising\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, our sustaining members can give anything from $1 to $25\neach month and receive a mix of online-only and tangible rewards, like tote\nbags and mugs. If you\u2019re not ready or interested in a monthly contribution, \u003ca href=\"https://secure.squarespace.com/commerce/donate?donatePageId=582f35c64402435aa8dce970\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eone time donations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e are also highly\nappreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhy should you care? Why do we\nneed to run a crowdfunding campaign?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nForemost, you get some cool\nrewards for contributing to this campaign. There is no other way to score a\nRochester Rising mug. We also offer some heavily discounted advertising to\nsustaining members. If you read the stories regularly, watch the videos, and\nlisten in to the podcasts, hopefully you see the value in hacing something like\nthis continue in the city.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs many of you probably know,\nRochester Rising is one person, myself. I do all the\nwriting, recording, producing, social media management, business development,\nsales, and event management. Many of you readers are solo entrepreneurs and\nknow this struggle first hand. Sustaining memberships have been essential to\nallow me more time to create content, events, and community. They also reduce\nour dependency on advertising and sponsorship on this website and podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you think Rochester Rising is\nsomething that should continue to exist in this community, please consider\nbecoming a sustaining member.
