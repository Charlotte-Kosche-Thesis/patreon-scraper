    "summary": "How it works:\u003cbr\u003eEvery week a new installment in \u003cem\u003eMillard Fillmore, Master of Steam\u003c/em\u003e (a steampunk tale, dontcha know?) will zip your way for ... \u003cstrong\u003eFREE\u003c/strong\u003e! The serial story follows a wild variety of characters, ranging from disgraced\u00a0 former president Millard Fillmore trying to find a steamdog creation, Fulton, who can shed light on how the White House happened to blow up (yes, Millard was blamed). Millard has tracked Fulton to the air-pirate festooned Monument Valley Free Zone, riding a new creation, the steamhorse This Horse, who slowly is gaining sentience. Hunting Millard is his nemesis, Thurlow Weed. Millard and This Horse rescue 250-year-old Virginia Dare as she hunts for the meaning of CROATOAN and... lots, lots more adventure as the serial unwinds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf this isn\u0027t enough, and you are willing to show your appreciation for the free serial, every month will see a complete magazine containing a brand spanking new steampunk serial episode following air pirates Reggie Fairweather, Lady Amy and the nefarious Duchess with her Jade Unicorn Horn. And also in this $5 issue will be two new fantasy or sf short stories, crazy filler items for products you wish existed, readers\u0027 correspondence and pages ripped from journals written by sky pirates of the Golden West, as well as the chance to guide the course of the stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut wait! There\u0027s more. If you really want the full meal, the complete dinner, the big kahuna, a buffet beyond belief, the $5 issue has\u00a0the first chapter of a novel by a lot of different authors.

Martin, before his untimely death, and I have put a lot of work into this project already and will work even harder\u2013if you reward us. We\u0027re like mules. Dangle a carrot in front of us and we will keep pulling the cart through a weird and wondrous world. Or should that be like steammules?

Sign up today!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSteampunk was once described as \u201cNostalgia for a time that never was\u201d, It is a genre that started at the end of the last century and has succeeded in captivating the imaginations of millions of readers and viewers, not to mention artists and craftspeople, while still remaining delightfully nebulous. In a world where so much is rigidly defined Steampunk is only limited by the dreams and fantasies of the artisans and fans of the genre.\u003cbr\u003eIt is into this world that noted Science Fiction/Fantasy/western writer Robert E. Vardeman is launching MAJOR ARCANIUM GAZETTE, a Penny Dreadful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe MAGazine will be published initially in electric telegraphic form, eventually leading to a more traditional pulp format as time and resources allow. In its pages readers will be amazed by tales of the daring exploits of the SKY PIRATES OF THE GOLDEN WEST as well as other serialized wonders. Additionally the picayune\u2019s pages will feature technical articles regarding the care and operation of the aeronautical ephemera as well as a question and answer column concerning the operation of earlier models. There also will be advice columns of a more personal nature well as advertisements from purveyors of wares of interest of everyone in the aeronautical community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, won\u2019t you turn your imagination to eleven and join us in skies above the American West, where the sky is so blue you need goggles and anything is possible?\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
