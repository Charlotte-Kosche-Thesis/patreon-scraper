I wanted to share some news that nobody (least of all me)\nis happy about.

First of all, I have some writing contacts\n(including a few big ones), and I am working with them to find a suitable\nfantasy author who can take this project to completion. Secondly, I have\nstarted Book 6, and I also have a chapter outline of the whole story.
