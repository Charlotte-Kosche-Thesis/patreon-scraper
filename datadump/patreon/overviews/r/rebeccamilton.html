    "summary": "I\u0027m Rebecca, and to my astonishment I am a professional author publisher from the United Kingdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017 I self-published my debut novel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://rmmilton.wordpress.com/mundane-magic/\"\u003eMundane Magic\u003c/a\u003e, a story about a young woman who must fight through her anxiety disorder to stop a murderer - without becoming one herself. I have been overwhelmed by the love and support that I have received through its journey, and the wonderful reviews it has received.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now run\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rebecca-milton.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea blog\u003c/a\u003e where I post three times a week about writing, self-publishing, and mental health. I also share poetry and short stories there, and would very much like to expand this in the future to include more original works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on a second novel which will be the first in a trilogy. Currently referred to as \u003cem\u003eProtos\u003c/em\u003e, the novel follows a Seer, a reluctant heiress, and an Archmage from the Fae kingdoms as they investigate a potential threat to the British Empire. Set immediately post-Napoleon in 1815, the novels are within a world that is both familiar and unfamiliar all at once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWriting is my full time job, but it has a lot of running costs that are currently outside my means. I want to be able to develop my website further, to pay editors and artists, and to be able to publish more. Supporting me via Patreon, even if it\u0027s for just $1 a month, will directly enable me to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a member of a lot of communities that have shown me the importance and power of being an online content creator in this web-based age. It really is an exciting time to be making things on the internet, and I would love to do that with people in a much greater capacity than currently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this isn\u0027t just paying me to write - it\u0027s helping to contribute towards developing a community where we can talk about things like self-publishing and mental health and storytelling. I\u0027m excited about it, and I hope you are too.\u003cbr\u003e"
