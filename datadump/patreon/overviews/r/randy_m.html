    "summary": "I love drawing maps. And people. And places. Maybe a little writing. But mostly maps - adventure maps! And I love providing them for free, or at least at a very low fee. So, in order to do that I\u2019m looking for a little support by way of patronage. As such, you\u2019ll get all the perks that patronage brings along with the knowledge that you\u2019re helping to build a fantasy setting from the ground up (or down, depending on the map). It\u2019s fun to create original works and it\u2019s even better to share them, particularly with folks who have an eye for something different, nostalgic, and unique.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea behind it all is to build a fantasy world one dungeon delve or village at a time, with your help of course. And the world is growing!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was born and raised in the small city of Corner Brook in the island province of Newfoundland on Canada\u2019s east coast. And I live here, after some time in the \u2018big cities\u2019 of the mainland.  I have a degree in Political Science and History, but my training and background is in Graphic Design. I\u2019ve been a professional designer for over 17 years and an illustrator for much longer than that. I\u2019m currently the illustrator and author of Roan Studio\u2019s line of gaming supplements. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy first cavern delves started as a young teenager poring over the pages of an AD\u0026amp;D Dungeon Master Guide looking for inspiration and dungeon dressings for my painstakingly crafted blue graph-paper grid maps. And I haven\u2019t stopped mapping - creating lairs, tunnels, towns, villages and rpg-style illustrations ever since. As a Graphic Designer I\u2019ve worked on larger maps (roadmaps and tourism guidebooks) but they\u2019ve all had a common purpose - to get you from point A to point B. That\u2019s the definition of a map. And that\u2019s exactly what this Patreon is: a way of getting from the beginning to the end with a full color, original Banner Map to show for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSamples of some of my most recent work can be found at the following G+ page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/112489330434466935673/posts\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRandy M G+\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I hope I\u0027ve filled out the area with ample material for potential GMs to build upon, and Patrons with a visually appealing fantasy setting. That said, I\u0027d like to build upon the current map and explore the North - a land of even greater dangers and rewards. The Bay of Spirits will continue to be developed, with numerous ideas in the works, so no worries for folks who\u0027ve come to call this place \u0027home\u0027.
