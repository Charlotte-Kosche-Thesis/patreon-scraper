    "summary": "Hello! My name is Rex, commonly known as RexLAPro online!\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for visiting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create bass and guitar covers (among other instruments) on YouTube. I aspire to create arrangements and covers that are more than the \"average\" guitar cover you see on YouTube. Those videos are geared more towards playing the piece exactly how it\u0027s written within the song, with hardly any mixing if any. There are many covers like that on YouTube/NicoNico and I feel like it would be hard for me to stand out as a musician if I followed that same path. I strive to write my own arrangements of guitar and bass parts adding my own personal style to each piece. I put a tremendous amount of effort into my arrangements, constantly trying to \u0027one-up\u0027 myself as I go along.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows anyone that enjoys my covers to support me financially and will allow me to expand my resources and help create better and higher quality videos. \u003cbr\u003eEvery cent I receive from patrons will go directly to the productions of my videos! I will be able to buy better equipment, enabling me to create better content for you guys!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease do not feel like you have to donate. The content I release on my YouTube channel is 100% free. This patreon is only for people who want to support me in this way specifically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003eI earnestly appreciate any donation that is given.\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e"
