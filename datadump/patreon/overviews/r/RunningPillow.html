We are Martin and Jan Halamiceks, brothers behind Running Pillow, and we make indie games. And we are here, on Patreon, to ask for your support.\u003cbr\u003eOur father was a programmer and taught us the basics of programming in our early childhood and since then we can\u0027t stop making games.\u003cbr\u003eWe also played a lot of games back then and even learnt our first english words like \u0027damage\u0027, \u0027hitpoints\u0027 and \u0027fireball\u0027 from them:)\u003cbr\u003eThis combination inevitably led us to start making commercial games in 2007 and since then we\u0027ve shipped dozens of games on various platforms with various monetization models.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhy do you need my support?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nRunning\u00a0Pillow has been our full-time job since 2009 and we\u0027ve been able to do it only because of the generous support of our fans. Making fun games means a world to us. Despite the common sense, we both quit our well-paid jobs as programmers in big corporations to follow our dream... And now the contributions from our players are our sole source of income.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThroughout the years we\u0027ve tried various business models, but we came to conclusion that none of them suits us very well - they are all about the money. You, as a developer, are either restricted by publisher/investor or you have to take popular trends or your bills into the consideration. You are also pushed to spend more and more time on marketing, campaign ads and keyword hunting and it all quickly becomes a \"top100 list cram\". \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tAnd we do not like that.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe believe that the most enjoyable games come from developers independent of restrictions and business people influence, developers who have time for their precious games. And thus we are here, on Patreon, because we want to bring you this kind of games, free of charge.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eAren\u0027t you guys just another startup?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eThese days there are more fund rising campaigns and crowdfunding platforms than one can count. And there are so many projects which fail miserably, so many studios with very little experience and so many disappointed backers/early-adopters. We know that, but..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eDo not worry.

We\u0027ve shipped (not only done) dozens of games on various platforms, ranging from PC/Mac casual portals, Steam to mobile Google Play or Apple\u0027s iTunes.\u00a0And we will continue shipping games in years to come. No matter what. That\u0027s what we do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBesides, you can always cancel your pledge if you think we are not worthy;)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you fund us or not, thank you.
