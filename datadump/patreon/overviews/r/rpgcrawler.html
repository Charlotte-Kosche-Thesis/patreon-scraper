Now, I bring my decades of experience to bear making videos on the subject. I cover a variety of topics, from Let\u0027s Plays of classic and new computer RPGs, reviews of tabletop RPG products and video role-playing games, to commentary on various aspects of tabletop RPGs. Each week, I cover a different indie RPG, and put together a small news digest of interesting events and releases in both the video game and tabletop RPG worlds from the prior week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to invest more in my channel to improve its content, in both quality and scope. I\u0027ll be able to spend more time putting videos together, and I\u0027ll be able to purchase additional equipment to enhance my content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you kindly for considering supporting me.
