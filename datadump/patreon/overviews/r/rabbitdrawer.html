Maybe you\u0027ve seen one or two\npictures of mine around internet especially if you\u0027re from Russia.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m interested in the social aspect of my work. I love to draw and talk with people who keep their own identity and\nculture. And now I am working on a couple of projects to complete which I need\nyour help. What kind of projects? Let me show you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nAmerican Faces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat was first not obvious\nto me thing when I just came to America some time ago? Can you guess? It\u2019s that\nsuddenly I am white! The second thing was \u2013 I\u2019m a Russian white. It means that\nI\u2019m immigrant white \u2013 not in the same way as somebody who was born in the\nUnited States, but white. Thousands of different people from different countries\nwith different stories came to America and got their one \u201cmain\u201d word \u2013 White,\nBlack or Brown \u2013 and live with it. And we lose their uniqueness. We lost our\nspirits. We lost our uniqueness that makes America what it is. I\u2019m Russian, my\nwife is Uzbek, our roommate is Albanian but all of us are white. I want to and\nI\u2019m going to give faces and voices to Black, Brown or White.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I decided to start my\nAmerican Faces project. I already have stories and sketches and I\u2019m going to\nshow them to you as soon as possible. This project consists of portraits of different\npeople accompanied by their stories. It will be thousands of stories and\nportraits or other illustrations in case somebody doesn\u2019t want to be a face of his\nor her words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nI want to ask you\u003c/strong\u003e, if you\nhave your own story that you want to share with people, please, let me know. If\nyou read my speech and want to be a part of American Faces let me know too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition to American\nFaces I want to paint some portraits of immigrants and tell their stories which\ncan show you how foreign people saw the New York City and the United States their\nfirst time. What they thought about. What they expected and what they got. If\nyou have a story like that and don\u2019t mind becoming a part of my project, let me\nknow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd as a \u003cstrong\u003efinal part of my\nart life \u003c/strong\u003eI love to create some funny pictures and creatures for city walls and\nsurfaces. Some parts of New York are so boring. I want to make it alive. Because\nwhen you go back from your noisy crazy office day to your home night and see my\ncreatures I know you\u2019ll smile. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSo thank you for reading\nand giving me a couple minutes of your lives. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nGreat thank you if you decided\nto become my patron or part of my projects or both. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your support\nand help. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell your story with me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
