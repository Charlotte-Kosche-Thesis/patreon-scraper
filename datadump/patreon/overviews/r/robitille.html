    "summary": "I\u0027m Melissa Robitille. I\u0027m an author, editor, book formatter \u0026amp; cover designer. I write \"speculative fiction\" - science fiction, fantasy, horror \u0026amp; their sub-genres. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on three series right now.\u00a0My space opera (science fiction) saga, \u003cem\u003eSmuggler at Large\u003c/em\u003e, stretches from the dystopian near-future to the fringes of the galaxy 4,000 years from now. You\u0027ll find medical experimentation, cyborgs, serial killers, computers with the brains of dead geniuses, space station battles, Amazons, and more. My paranormal noir series, \u003cem\u003eMurphy\u0027s Law\u003c/em\u003e, \u00a0features Hanako Flanagan - a snarky, magicless PI in a city where everyone has magic. Life\u0027s not easy for a Murphy when even the heat runs on magic! \u00a0I also write what I call \u003cem\u003eMill City Stories\u003c/em\u003e, spin off stories from Murphy\u0027s Law - paranormal romance \u0026amp; paranormal action-adventure tales that follow characters from Murphy\u0027s Law down their own roads. \u00a0My alternate history series, \u003cem\u003eThe Arcane Line\u003c/em\u003e, follows a half-elf through the formation of the First Arcane Infantry during the American Revolutionary War and her service as a soldier, a spy, a federal law enforcement agent, and occasionally even a stateswoman on behalf of the US Government in their dealings with magic \u0026amp; magical creatures. You\u0027ll find dragons, elves, sword fights, artillery, stealth, feats of strength and bravery, and possibly the world\u0027s worst luck in romance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my series I\u0027m also writing \u003cem\u003eThin Spots, \u003c/em\u003ea YA Fantasy novel which may or may not turn into a series depending on how far this plot bunny makes me chase it! I\u0027m writing \u003cem\u003eOnly in Dreams\u003c/em\u003e, a stand-alone horror novel starring 12-year-old Trin Wallace - she\u0027s sold for medical experimentation, but when it gives her more power than she could dream of, will she, in turn, become a monster and take revenge? I\u0027m writing \u003cem\u003eThis Cold Desert\u003c/em\u003e, a fairly near-future dystopian novel about the after-effects of both global warming and nuclear winter - and what the environmental chaos wakes from deep within the earth and humanity\u0027s worst nightmares. I write short horror as well. \"After the Clowns\"\u00a0appeared in Fat Lip Press\u0027s \u003cem\u003eBlack Candy\u003c/em\u003e. \"Dark Meat\" is my Thanksgiving-themed contribution to the \u003cem\u003eHappy Holidays Horror Anthology\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0coming out in December.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow will your pledges help? First, they\u0027ll pay some bills \u0026amp; keep my head above water (always a nice thing), which will free me up to be writing instead of worrying about those bills. Second, I would have to take on less editing, formatting, and cover design in order to keep the bills paid, which would give me considerably more time to write. Third, if this goes spectacularly well I could advertise my work! I\u0027m a workaholic, to be honest, and most days I work 18 hours. I can\u0027t see myself as ever \"taking a break\"; I love what I do, and I would love to be able to do more of the parts of the work that I love. I\u0027d like to do a monthly podcast - which will probably contain random rants and meanderings through the thickets and hedgerows of my imagination."
