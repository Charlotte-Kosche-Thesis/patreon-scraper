I bring a sketchbook, paints and a pen wherever I go and I\u0027m usually able to squeeze in a sketch of whatever\u0027s in front of me. I also love to share the stories that come my way as I sketch, and all the things I\u0027ve picked up along the way that help to make a sketch look cool! I absolutely love seeing the penny drop in a sketcher\u0027s eyes as they suddenly \"get\" a solution to a problem that\u0027s been bugging them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and support, I\u0027ll be able to spend more time sketching my little world in Galway. I will share all my cunning tips and techniques with you - many of which I have kept to myself until now - and I\u0027ll even give a \"thank you\" in the form of prints and even originals to those who want to go the extra mile.\u003cbr\u003eI will post an illustrated story of Galway life, or a tutorial, once a week. Those of you who support me will get access to my innermost sketching secrets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your kind comments up until now. They mean so much.\u00a0",
