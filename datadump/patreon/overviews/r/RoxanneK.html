    "summary": "Hello beautiful people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading my Patreon page and for considering becoming my Patron. Every dollar helps.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will try to explain as well as I can and if you have questions after, you can email me at araweggandastorm@gmail.com to ask me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have 2 things I do in my life:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003etake care of a feral cat microsanctuary called Catlandia\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eorganize for North Carolina Farmed Animal Save\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThat\u0027s it. I have no other things that I do. But these two things are everything. So let me tell you about them, about my work, and about my plans and dreams.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzM58BwHrKA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H5V9rcHPl5M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI go to some of the worst places on earth. I bear witness to the suffering of farmed animals. I spend time with them, I cry with them, I document their plights in story, video, and photo. I advocate for them. I encourage others to share the stories that I tell.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OR5G30Fs5Xs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are some of the Wallace Pigs. If you follow my work on Facebook you know a lot about them. It is my hope that one day I can help rescue some of these cull sows and bring them to a safe place, maybe even a microsanctuary for cull sows. Maybe even Shaky Knees Farm Sanctuary, my dream of an NCSave sanctuary for farmed animals that will provide a soft home or even hospice for exhausted breeding sows. This is my biggest dream, in many ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1EK49mq1Gs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHmkVwsliMY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? Well, this is tough. I only have a certain amount of time, energy, and ability to work. I have to choose between a traditional job that does not help animals or doing this as best I can and not having a traditional income. I am choosing my work for animals, and I am hoping that maybe a lot of folks can chip in a small monthly amount, and fund my work so I can continue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of things I want to do, going forward, but I don\u0027t want to dump them all on you as it would be exhausting for you, I think. But let me tell you some of the things I will be working on this year:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eorganizing for North Carolina Farmed Animal Save (I recently received a fellowship for this so I am getting closer and closer to having what I need- looking to use Patreon to get us the rest of the way now)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003egetting improvements for the Wallace pigs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eattempting to gain freedom for some of the Wallace pigs (negotiations)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edocumenting the conditions of animals in transport to slaughter\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ewriting, submitting, and going to Raleigh to talk about a downed animal bill for the NCGA to consider\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003epartnering with environmental, social justice, and feminist orgs, groups, and people\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecreating a vision of The New North Carolina- a place where CAFOs and slaughterhouses are things of the past. A place where there is harmony, peace, and plenty. A place where we take care of one another- human and nonhuman alike.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003etaking care of the Catlandia kitties\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eimproving our cattery here\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edoing TNR and education about feral and community cats\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecaring for some feral and community cats in my area\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edreaming of getting a piece of land big enough to give the kitties lots of room to run and play, and for homing a small group of chickens one day, and, if possible, giving 6 culled breeding sows a real retirement and sanctuary-hospice- the dream that pushes me to do all I can every day\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eputting out #WaterForAnimals and encouraging others to do the same (see my FB page Water for Animals)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003erunning the #CAFOsHaveGotToGo campaign (see my FB page CAFOsHaveGotToGo)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eproducing some pretty sweet tshirt designs I have created, including a series of fact tees that turn the wearer into a walking billboard for the truth.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSo I will write at length, in time, about a lot of ongoing and future work. If you know me, you know about a lot of it already, I hope. If you don\u0027t know me, then I will work hard to show you who I am. If you will help me do what I need to do, I promise you I will be a force to be reckoned with for farmed animals and for feral and community cats in North Carolina, and I will keep you updated about the work. Thank you for reading this post and considering me. Peace to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "An income of this size will allow me to do a lot of the work I need to do. I will be able to decompress from the stress of poverty and become more of the strategic organizing genius (ahem!) I want to be. I\u0027ll be able to get to Raleigh regularly to talk to members of the NCGA, hire a sitter for the Catlandia kitties once in a while so I can travel within the state and maybe even to conferences and other events. EDIT: I recently got a fellowship for my Save work, so I am skewing this page a bit more towards the kitties. Food, litter, and medical care is expensive, so if we could boost our income by $600 or more dollars, we will be doing well. If we are lucky enough to go over that, we will be able to save for the farm, I think (though life continues to get more and more expensive, doesn\u0027t it? And surprises pop up all the time, many of them quite costly) I will stay in touch on these matters. Thank you.\u00a0",
