    "summary": "Evening, friends. I\u0027m Roy Tracy, rootless international scoundrel and writer of travel journalism. About ten years ago, I quit my whole life and went out on the road to see what there was to see. The years since have offered me more adventures, insights, hardships, and moments of profound beauty than I might have ever dreamed; and I\u0027m just now slowing my wheels enough to write it all down and share it with you. Using Patreon as an outlet for my writing allows me to make time for writing, knowing it will in some part subsidize my inexpensive-yet-uncertain lifestyle. Thank you so much for dropping by to see what I\u0027m up to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately I\u0027ve been in Europe with my incredible partner Anya Askew, real-life superhero and outlaw circus artist from the future. We\u0027ve been hanging with art scene celebrities, street-fighting anarchists, Viennese burlesque dancers, Pakistani weed dealers, luminaries of the Milan fashion scene, village folks and university students in the remote Irish wilderness, Amsterdam graffiti heads, old friends and new. We got caught up in a riot, failed to pick up prostitutes on the Reeperbahn, visited all sorts of sumptuous old cathedrals and palaces, developed a unified theory of stray cats, and wandered the streets for countless hours soaking up knowledge and experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got the next seven months or so of my life roughly mapped out, and they\u0027re a doozy. I\u0027ll be romping around on three continents, I\u0027ll be writing about it every single day, and you can join me for the ride right here on Patreon. A modest pledge of $2 a month gets you access to all our patron-only posts, around two per week, each one a lively new article about topics of interest to itinerant scoundrels and the people who love us. There are other rewards for higher levels of support, as well, which I hope will afford us a chance to know each other better. Meeting people like you who share the particular interests and outlook of the outsider caste is what I live for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlas, no introductory video will be possible, as I must keep my appearance and immediate location secret in order to pass unrecognized. Only thusly can I maintain my journalistic and personal objectivity in the face of the cruel and connected world at large. Some videos will be made available to patrons, however, in good time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat fun."
