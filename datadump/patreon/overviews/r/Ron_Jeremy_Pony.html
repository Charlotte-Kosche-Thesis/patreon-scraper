It\u0027s something I\u0027ve dreamed of for an exceptionally long time. \u00a0This patreon, along with my commissions, should go an exceptionally long way toward making that a reality.\u00a0 I want to continue to give my followers and fans more of what they\u0027ve come to expect from me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... \u00a0That leads me to my patreon page that you see here. \u00a0This is one of the ways I\u0027m trying to make it as an author. \u00a0Now, I\u0027m sure there are some questions that all of you are considering. \u00a0One of the main ones being, what am I going to get from my donations? \u00a0Well, please, check out the donation portion and find those answers. Also know that your donation will help keep me fed, pay for the wonders of electricity and water, and of course help pay for, wonders of wonders, a place to live."
