Though I am a Southern girl, don\u0027t let the smile fool you: there are a lot of dark and twisted thoughts that swim around in this noggin of mine. BUT: those dark and twisted thoughts lead me to create some pretty quirky and unique content that is sure to entertain and always make you think. My therapist tells me I\u0027m a philosopher and an existentialist- YES I HAVE A THERAPIST- SO DOES EVERY OTHER PERSON YOU PASS IN THE STREET- so my pieces usually explore human behaviours and/or societal trends and usually have some sort of dark comedic twist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome video content I\u0027ve created includes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VA2dPc7Nh0\"\u003eIntroducing Parker Dowd\u003c/a\u003e with \u003cstrong\u003eLewis Black\u003c/strong\u003e: a short film about a struggling actress who loses a role to her dog and must watch him skyrocket to celebrity as she descends into vengeful madness.
