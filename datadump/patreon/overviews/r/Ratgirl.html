I absolutely love designing things that don\u0027t necessarily have to confine themselves to rules of what is \"right or wrong\" to draw. If it is in my imagination, eventually it ends up on paper (virtual or otherwise).

But so many things are trying to scrape their way out of my head and into my art; including content for a full color hardcover artbook, tutorial and other art videos, parody/mashup ideas, comics, and more. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love creating custom art for others, but I\u0027ve sacrificed so much of what I want to produce on my own in order to take on client projects nonstop. Since I do this for a living, I have been so inundated with commission work (in order to pay my bills) that I never seem to have time for my own ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get pledges, even if a little bit from each Patreon Patron, the funds will help me focus more on the original projects that I\u0027ve been wanting to make rather than always taking on more custom work for people. For the record, I will never\u00a0\u003cem\u003epermanently\u003c/em\u003e shut down commission offers -- I have had some wonderful clients over 5 years time -- but your support will help me regain a healthier artistic balance to my life. More balance means more creations! In short you can help me work \u003cem\u003ehappier\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I become a Patron, do I get anything special for helping you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than the warm feelings that you helped an independent artist?... YES of course! :)\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will be able to: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eGain early access on new original art and other projects before its released for public viewing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet discounts on items at my webstore and on custom commissions when I open slots\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to exclusive content here that will only be viewable by Patreons\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd maybe even receive free stuff in your mailbox!

But, what is nice about this site is that you can set a MAXIMUM\u00a0monthly amount for your pledges.\u00a0If your pledges reach this cap you will not be charged for more patron-supported content from me for the rest of the month \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e you will still get the exclusive access and purchase discounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATED: I viewed your Milestones for this Patreon and see that you might release mature art? I thought you were a general audience business! Please explain?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been asked about this Milestone quite a bit and it has seemed to cause a bit of confusion, so I am happy to explain. I love running my public business as a PG-13 environment; doing so has created a family friendly atmosphere to my online pages much of the time, which is quite enjoyable. As an artist however, I do create art at times that doesn\u0027t fit into that public image. This is where my Patreon can help me express myself more fully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon page is a very exclusive part of my online business, and my patrons can ONLY be 18 years of age and older here. With that being said, as long as I reach or stay above my max Milestone of $400 per month (\u003cem\u003ewhich could be achieved, for example, by 40 patrons pledging $10\u003c/em\u003e) every patron would automatically gain exclusive online viewing access to my mature rated original works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eThese NSFW artworks would NOT be available for viewing at any of my public online pages.

If you want to become a Patron, check out the pledge levels below. If you can\u0027t help financially, please share this page with others! Either way, I truly appreciate it. :)\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
