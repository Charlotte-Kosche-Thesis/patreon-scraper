Our latest endeavors revealed that a Human God has been interfering with our work to save Tyria, and while we may have settled the noise for now, there\u0027s more in store on the Horizon. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSounds \u003cem\u003eheck-a\u003c/em\u003e neat, but why\u00a0Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon is an online service that allows people to pledge regular payments to the creators that they enjoy, through the form of monthly sponsorship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing in-depth, comprehensive, and informational content is incredibly time consuming, and although I do enjoy it immensely, it\u0027s something that I have to weigh into my free time. I put my best effort into each video that I produce in order to keep it informative, fun to watch, while also having longevity to them. Each video goes through writing/recording the script, recording relevant footage for the script, and piecing\u00a0it all together, just to put it simply. This process can easily take 10 hours for a finished product of just 5 minutes, and on top of the time I invest each week, I invest monetarily into the editing \u0026amp; recording software I use, as well as the music I use in each of my videos, and YouTube Ad Revenue currently isn\u0027t enough to cover even half of this regularly.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah okay sweet, that\u0027s great, but what do \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003edo?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGlad you asked!\u003cbr\u003eI provide the guides that I wish I had when I started playing. Just like in all MMO\u0027s, you need gold/in-game money to progress towards any sort of decent gear. My guides have a major focus on helping you build up your daily gold intake, most of these videos show methods of which I do, or have done myself! \u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to help you become the best you can be in Guild Wars 2.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point of these guides is to help you prepare your character to handle the more difficult sorts of content, such as Fractals of the Mist, Raids, or any sort of endgame PvE content.\u003cbr\u003eI also produce video guides for this sort of endgame content. Once you\u0027re geared to a point that you\u0027re ready to improve your play in PvE, you can check out my channel for guides on Fractals of the Mist, and eventually Raids!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s cool, but where does Patreon fit into this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon offers me a way to continue creating this content for the long run. Will this prevent me from posting to my channel? No, but what this can affect is how much time I can comfortably invest into producing such content, which allows me to post regularly, and more consistently.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAt the moment I post when I can, I have many other obligations in life that really take precedence over Guild Wars 2:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m the head photographer/videographer for a Mobile Homeless Ministry in my home town called 99 for the 1\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is work that I\u0027m incredibly passionate about - we\u0027re still a relatively new organization, and it takes a lot of our free time to help grow and spread awareness. Whenever I\u0027m not working, or playing GW2/editing a video for my channel, I\u0027m editing photos and videos for the ministry, which is nearly a full time job within itself between that and filling in for volunteering/driving/picking up donations when needed. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m also a Guitar Instructor\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s natural that teaching is something I\u0027m comfortable with, considering the videos I make are guides and tutorials! Music has always been a huge passion of mine and I love that I get the opportunity to pass that on to others.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m also the Founder of a guild in-game called Mistlocked [FotM]\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe guild focuses heavily on bridging the gap between meta map PvE experience, all the way to Endgame Fractal Challenge mode/Raids experience. There is honestly a lot of impatience and elitism in endgame PvE content, when directed someone not knowing mechanics, and people ragequitting a group because of it. This does not solve the issue, but only prolongs it, while also breeding unnecessary\u00a0\"toxicity\" within the game.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhile I understand not everyone has time to teach, it doesn\u0027t change the fact that it just needs to be done. \u003c/strong\u003eThe mission of this guild is to chip away at this mentality of elitism, and instead promote a community that allows room for mistakes without argument with the hopes of creating a more inviting endgame community.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI normally keep my life separate from my gaming life, but given that I\u0027m asking you as my viewers to consider a subscription, I wanted to give you some of my background and what I do when I\u0027m not running around in game with you guys. This is definitely not a get-rich-quick method for me and whatever you can pledge would be greatly appreciated and used towards making more guides!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat all makes sense.. but what do I get from this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you pledge...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll pledges will earn a shoutout in my Patreon Supporters video on my YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1/ month\u003c/strong\u003e, you are contributing to me so that I can continue my endeavors, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5/ month\u003c/strong\u003e, you will receive all previous bonuses, as well as access to the audio files, and the written scripts, of all my future video (without the music, so you can download it to your mobile device and listen to it like a podcast)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShould you pledge $10/month\u003c/strong\u003e, you will receive all previous bonuses, as well as a 1 on 1 training session with me in Fractals of the Mist!
