    "summary": "My name is Scottie Westfall, and for the past seven and half years, I\u0027ve been author of a blog that has gone by various names. \u00a0Its current incarnation is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://retrieverman.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCanis Lupus Hominis: \u00a0The Retriever, Dog, and Wildlife Blog\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write about my various passions on the blog: \u00a0golden retrievers, the history of dog breeds, the natural and unnatural history of dogs, the natural world all around me in West Virginia, and the importance of skepticism and rationalism in the modern world. I offer a critique of the modern dog world with insights from the modern understanding of population genetics. I often will produce pieces of literature and poetry that are elegies and reflections of the natural world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up near my paternal grandfather who was a true self-taught naturalist who possessed what he called a \"Ph.D. in the woods.\" From him I learned many things about dogs and wild creatures. He is one of the inspirations behind my writing. He also taught me more about telling a good story than any of my English professors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other two are two dogs that haunt my dreams even now. One was a working-type golden retriever, who was so clever and neurotically smart that she would have driven the average family crazy. The other was a fell beast, a mixture of boxer and golden retriever, and her predatory behavior would have made her a liability in virtually any civilized place. I spent the happiest times of my life wandering the West Virginia ridge-tops with these two dogs. They taught me much about what real dogs are. They aren\u0027t creatures that live entirely for humanity\u0027s caprice and vanity. They are very much their own creatures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your Patreon contributions, I hope to produce better quality content for the blog. My writing style is starting to mature, and I want to explore more of who I am on the blog. I also want to write more natural history fiction, such as\u003ca href=\"http://retrieverman.net/2015/02/10/the-story-of-a-river-bank/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e my story about a mink killing mallard on a West Virginia river bank\u003c/a\u003e. I want my writing to express more deeply my profound wonder at nature, as well as my love of dogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here to write the stories of a world where old fields and pastures have returned to the forest from which they were hewn. These are the stories of a land gone feral, of a land that I explore with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://retrieverman.net/2015/01/27/an-old-ridge-running-dog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea ridge-running yellow dog\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0It is a world more peaceful and more complete than urban landscape in which most of live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider funding me. I will greatly appreciate it. This blog is currently among the top pet blogs in the country, but I don\u0027t make enough money off it to match the countless hours I\u0027ve spent writing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps, and thank you for considering being my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
