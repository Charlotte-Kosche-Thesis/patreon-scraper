    "summary": "Okay, so...\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eLet me start again. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a writer for as long as I can\nremember. Writers write. Write what you know. In the seventh grade my\nfriends and I used to exchange floridly written paragraphs, scrawled\nin cursive on college lined notebook paper, giving each other\nfeedback and exchanging wisdom about our waxing poetic snippets. For\nages I told people I planned on being a writer when I grew up. I went\nto college as an English major with the intent of focusing on\ncreative writing. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI took a small detour into Theatre and\nIndie film acting. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I got married. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I had two kids. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSomewhere in there I completed my first\nnovel. A fun little ditty about the end of the world. (Still sitting\nin my filing cabinet waiting for edits and re-writes, if you must\nknow.) \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd then a year or so later I completed\nmy second novel. (It\u0027s on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ash-Book-One-Rising-Saga-ebook/dp/B01F4JXACG\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e in serial format. Go check it out.)\nThis book has since been picked up for paper-back release by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://littlemonsterpress.wixsite.com/publishing\"\u003eLittle Monster Press\u003c/a\u003e, coming soon. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut people need roofs and children\ngotta eat. So it is the return to the day job.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon originally as a\nmeans to motivate myself towards writing regularly. I have since\ndiscovered that I don\u0027t need motivation to write. I do that already\nin my free time. I have also discovered that if I do publish a short\nstory to Patreon, it is considered \u201cpublished\u201d and this takes it\nout of the running for a number of other publishing opportunities.\n(Such as my short stories which were picked up by these anthologies,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Monsters-TPQ-Anthology-Chris-Musgrave/dp/0995289018/\"\u003ehere\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tales-Our-Write-Side-Anthology/dp/1946382000/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Twisted-Horror-Anthology-Lindsey-Williams-ebook/dp/B01LX7DT8D/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.) \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I am now reformatting. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe ultimate goal, come heck or high\nwater, is to make my living as a creative writer in whatever form\nthat takes. Would I love to see my name on the shelf at Barnes and\nNoble? Why, yes. Thanks for asking. Mind you, I would remain\nperfectly happy being able to support myself and my family on\ncreative writing alone, regardless of fame level and there is a plan in place to do so. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut writing takes time, and it takes\ndedication. Squeezing my writing time in between my day job and\nfamily obligations will naturally slow down the progress. I\u0027m still\ngoing down that path, but perhaps not quite as quickly. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThen one day, light bulb.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs strongly as I feel that art and\ncreativity are vital to the health and well being of a society, there\nmust be others who feel so too, right? Now more than ever, I believe\nthe voice of the creatives must be heard. Creativity is activism.\nRepresentation matters. We are the media. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am pledging here, is to write\none monthly newsletter supported by Patreons. Just one a month.\nThat\u0027s all. This newsletter will give updates on my progress towards\nfull writer-freedom. The ultimate goal, of course, is to get to the\npoint where I can fully support myself and my family with writing\nincome. In the mean time... Patreon. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWill you help? \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor just $1 a month you can help me\nreach my goal. What do you get out of it? Check out the nifty list to\nthe right. This is the part where I have to be brave and honest and\nreal. Part of this is experiment, and part of this is necessity.\nLet\u0027s see what happens, shall we? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
