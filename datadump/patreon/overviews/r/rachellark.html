    "summary": "Hi! Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Rachel Lark, and I\u0027m a multi-instrumentalist and singer/songwriter who has made a name for herself amongst perverts, psychedelic party throwers, festival attendees, and college students. \u00a0I\u0027ve determined that mainstream radio success is highly unlikely for me. \u00a0My music is too weird, too disruptive to the patriarchy, and too sexually explicit. \u00a0That\u0027s why all of my success so far has come from badass weirdos like yourselves, supporting me with love, loyalty, and grassroots crowdfunding platforms!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly support is important.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Kickstarter makes sense when there\u0027s one big project that you want to work on, which is why it was great for raising funds for my first music video,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGx4OLuE_xU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWarm, Bloody and Tender\u003c/a\u003e and my latest show,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=670rt7FxjF0\"\u003eStudies Have Shown\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 But now I have \u003cem\u003emaaaaany\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0projects I want to work on, and working on them is a full-time job. \u00a0With monthly support I can rely on from my fans, I can budget and plan further in advance and get more creative work done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s what I want to do this year.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eRecord an album of my electronic music\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFilm several music videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGo to the legendary Edinburgh Festival\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo a National tour to the East Coast and back\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTour Europe\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecord an an educational concept album about the Middle East\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWork with a publicist to get my music noticed by bigger audiences\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite a musical\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo do these things, I need to pay rent. \u003c/strong\u003eThe reality of where I\u0027m at is that I actually think I can get many of these projects funded, either through my record label,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://notacult.media\"\u003enot a cult\u003c/a\u003e, or through grants or specific promotional targeting. What I need to fundraise right now is just the boring, monthly cost of keeping the Rachel Lark machine moving. That means rent, groceries, utilities, car payments... I know. This is SO not as exciting as reading about a music video, right? But look, the only way I\u0027m going to be able to continue to create this content, is if I get a reliable, monthly paycheck that makes daily life in SF possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf 400 of you contribute just $3 a month, all of the above becomes doable! That\u0027s something of a miracle, when you think about it. \u00a0Gone are the days when artists like me have to soften out the edges to fit into the mold of what the \"industry\" wants. \u00a0Now a small number of dedicated, like-minded people can actually sustain artists, without relying on the promise of \"mainstream success\" to suddenly create a salary for a working artist. \u00a0And unlike Kickstarter, this support will last, so that the projects that 2016 inspires will also come to fruition in 2017 and 2018 and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe perk? No perks! \u003c/strong\u003eThis is about support. \u00a0If you want to help and crowdfund my full-time artist paycheck, then you probably don\u0027t need to be convinced that it\u0027s a good idea through special behind-the-scenes footage or more e-mail blasts. \u00a0I\u0027m not going to send you anything extra because you\u0027ve become a patron. \u00a0Unorthodox? I know. I\u0027m just trying to be honest. With a short-term campaign like Kickstarter that\u0027s project-based I think that perks and rewards make sense, but what I\u0027m asking for this time around is for you to enter a relationship of trust where you support me financially and trust me to create whatever I feel I need to create at any given time. The pledge I make to you in return is that I will work tirelessly to create the most honest art I possibly can and that I will dedicate every day to bringing it to more and more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for reading!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I really appreciate you taking the time to check out this patreon page and my work. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
