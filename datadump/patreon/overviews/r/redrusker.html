But if you\u0027re here, you already know that! \u00a0Updates will occur several times a month, increasing with patron support. I appreciate a romantic and intimate story as much as the next person, but sometimes I want art to push my buttons and maybe change up what people knew about their fantasies beforehand -and that is what I aim to do! \u00a0Patrons will be pledging an amount per page or illustration, so you are only charged when fresh content is posted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does this work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been making comics for a little bit now -I\u0027ve always preferred that people pay what they want rather than make private content that has to be paid for to enjoy. \u00a0When you make a pledge, you\u0027re charged that amount for each update that I share, and you can put limits on the amount spent per month. \u00a0These will be small increments, typically no more than a buck or two a page -but it adds up and is enough to keep me going! \u00a0I\u0027ll also give source files and high resolution files to supporters. \u00a0Art will be shared in my public gallery at the same time it is on Patreon, so please don\u0027t feel like it\u0027s a necessity to pledge to get access to the comic if you otherwise wouldn\u0027t. \u00a0Just think of it as a donation jar!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTell me a little more about the rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs stated earlier, all big updates will be free and accessible without the use of Patreon, so this is really for getting your hands on some extra goodies! \u00a0Comics are lots of work, which means a lot of content gets re-drawn and scrapped -sometimes it\u0027s stuff you love but just can\u0027t use! \u00a0Patreon would be an outlet to share these extra sketches, and that\u0027s in addition to the aforementioned high resolution files and source files -for the folks that want to take a page apart and see what\u0027s in the framework. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s it! \u00a0The gist of it is, you can help donate to support a comic financially, but I\u0027d be just as pleased if you read it and enjoyed it alone -and perhaps shared it! \u00a0If you have questions, feel free to drop a comment on Patreon or even e-mail me at \u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e\n/*  */\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
