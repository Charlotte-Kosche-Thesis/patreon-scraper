I also enjoy mint chocolate chip ice cream and exploring topics of feminism, narrative theory, and relationships within comics. My creditials include: 4 years of doing a show called Fool\u0027s Gold, which was more in the vein of Nostalgia Critic, 3 years of doing Superhero Rundown where I looked at media and talked about superheroes within it, a MA in Cultural Sustainability, a MA in Digital Arts, and a LOT of comic book knowledge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an example of an old episode of Superhero Rundown:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cuPlIwDFyrE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s great! What do you do now?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad you\u0027re still here! I am going to be writing video essays on specific comic book characters like Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, and various others similar to both my Jessica Jones episode and my episode on Constantine. The show will begin in 2018 when Rap Critic and I go see Black Panther. See, I feel that comic books teach us a lot of our values and I intend to show you through feminist perspective, guests on the show, and overall evidence presented in the comics themselves. I am also currently working on a syllabus to make this kind of thing a class offered at universities, so I\u0027m pretty passionate about my beliefs in comic book heroes. I also update\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ravenalegria13.wix.com/superheroines\"\u003ethis website\u003c/a\u003e twice a year as a testament to how superheroines can help us and solidify our beliefs in society.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a podcast with Holly Christine called Late Night with Bisexuals where we discuss a lot of different topics including movies, politics, and swap stories. You can get it only on Soundcloud and Circle Plus, the website I run with Holly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps and you can get rewards for your contributions. As this takes off, I\u0027ll add more rewards. For as little as $1 a month you can see my episodes 3 days early, whether it be my Superhero Rundown show or my podcast Late Night with Bisexuals. If you contribute more, you get other perks like title card art, producer credits, a thank you on Twitter, or even requesting an episode of Superhero Rundown or picking a topic on Late Night with Bisexuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
