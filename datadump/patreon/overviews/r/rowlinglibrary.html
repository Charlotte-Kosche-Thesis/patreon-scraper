You now have the opportunity to support The Rowling Library financially, for a small monthly amount.. This works around the world and it is very easy to set up. In exchange for your support, the platform gives rewards. The project is presented to support the monthly magazine - but as the team that works on the website and the magazine is the same one, the support goes for both media: the monthly PDF you can download for free and the website you can visit everyday where we publish the latest exclusive news and last minute articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe at \u003cstrong\u003eThe Rowling Library\u003c/strong\u003e believe in journalism. We believe that J.K. Rowling\u2019s fans deserve better media to explore new ideas and get new information. Our focus it is to deliver the latest news and provide insightful articles with a different view. We love J.K. Rowling\u2019s works and we also agree with her personal views in almost everything (though it would not be a problem if we did not), but we are not acquiescent. From time to time, things occur in the Harry Potter world that we do not like, from the publishers, the film makers or even to Rowling herself - and we do not hesitate to say it. That sets us apart from other fansites because we are an independent media about J.K. Rowling and we plan to keep it this way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last years have been wonderful and your comments and feedback meant that we were right. The Harry Potter fandom is starting to look for a more serious place to exchange ideas. Your reaction to our articles and our projects (this magazine, mainly) are the proof that what we believe that what we are doing is the right thing. Our ability to gather exclusive news that spreads around the web and reaches important newspapers further cements our role as a serious website. We are not here to copy and paste press releases. We are here to do some research and bring relevant news to the fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs interesting as this may sound, we do not earn any money from this. Most of the staff are part-time students, part-time workers. This means that all we do to keep The Rowling Library running is done in our little free time just for the sake of it. We are not only investing our time, but also our money to pay for the web server. It is a pleasure to do this, but a little financial support would be very useful. It means we could drop some of the freelance work we do everyday, and spend more time with \u003cstrong\u003eThe Rowling Library\u003c/strong\u003e, both the website and the magazine. It also means we could pay illustrators, designers, and other collaborators to raise the bar and bring you better quality content. The possibilities are endless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe devote resources to write pieces that not every fan reads. We know that most people prefer reading news about the lastest movies that Harry Potter actors acted in. Many fans enjoy that, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. We want to make \u003cstrong\u003eThe Rowling Library\u003c/strong\u003e a valuable destination. But for that, we need your support. Just a tiny monthly donation would mean a lot to us. You can become a patron of \u003cstrong\u003eThe Rowling Library\u003c/strong\u003e now and help us develop and grow more each day.\u003cbr\u003e"
