We have almost one thousand videos, undertaking such tasks as: playing all the \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB03C1EE50686295B\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSonic games\u003c/a\u003e, playing all the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLipgnTt01UGUjDKNNZyPqHYlHB8XlgKpY\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMario games\u003c/a\u003e, dragging ourselves through the Silent Hill series, and more. Our goal is to continue making funny, interesting and well produced videos. And to be your buds. We just wanna be your buds!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been doing the crowdfunding thing for a little bit. We\u0027ve done some stuff right and we\u0027ve fucked up (GameWisp). Because of that, we\u0027re not quite at the funding level we once were. That\u0027s why, over the last few days, I\u0027ve reintroduced goals and rewards to the Patreon to get us back to making videos at the frequency we, and our viewers, want and expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we also want to do more. We want to expand the type of content we release (IE Let\u0027s Watch, the Run Button Podcast, How Are You Today?, etc), we want to go to more events, do live shows, we should probably have a website, etc. As the Patreon grows it will allow us to grow with it, and provide us with opportunities to try interesting new things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have the means, and if you\u0027ve watched and liked our show, or benefited from our hundreds of hours of games and jokes, we ask that you consider pledging to ensure not only continued content, but increased quality and quantity. \n\nWe will also continue to work (with the help of our patrons) to come up with fun, exciting and different rewards accessible to Patrons. We\u0027d like your help, and we want it to be worthwhile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour generosity has afforded us the opportunity to keep doing this thing we love, and more than anything we want to take Run Button to a place where it can be our full-time job.\u003cbr\u003e"
