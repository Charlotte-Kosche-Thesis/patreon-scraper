I regularly write short stories in the Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Action Adventure genres, and hope eventually to write a book. It\u0027s always been a dream of mine to become a writer full-time, and that is what I\u0027m hoping to work towards with the support of my patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work is currently published on my blog: \u003ca href=\"https://skiptothefirstpage.blogspot.co.uk/\"\u003ehttps://skiptothefirstpage.blogspot.co.uk/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI usually publish a short story every couple of months as well as blog posts about games, books, interesting life stories, and other\u00a0random subjects. The more patrons I have the more spare time I can devote to writing and the more content I can produce for you wonderful people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m never going to restrict my writing to only patrons as I don\u0027t want people to feel like they have to support me to enjoy my stories, but I will offer early access and sneak peaks to patrons in return for their generous donations. If you are eager for more there is another tier where you can be included in one of my stories, immortalized in fiction! I\u0027ve limited this to 10 patrons for the time being as I don\u0027t suddenly want 100 people waiting to be included in stories for years, there are only so many characters in a story and I\u0027d rather make you a main one. Please let me know if there is any other content you are interested in receiving from me and I\u0027ll be happy to add additioinal tiers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all the support and I hope you enjoy reading my stories!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoss"
