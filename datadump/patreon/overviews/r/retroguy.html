    "summary": "Hello folks, my name is Luke Kiedron, aka Retroguy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my life, I have been a passionate about fantasy, as a young\u00a0boy growing up in the 80s,\u00a0I lived for stories of knights, dragons and damsels in distress, I loved cartoons like Thundercats, Masters of the Universe, She-Ra and Transformers - regarding the latter, many of my happiest childhood memories were of playing with and constantly transforming my little robots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight, now if that didn\u0027t give you a severe case of brain rot from the\u00a0perhaps excessive\u00a0sugariness of it, I suppose you\u0027d like to know why I\u0027m here? Well, as you may have guessed, being born in the early 80s, I haven\u0027t been a kid for a long time, but the thoughts, fantasies and dreams I felt as a boy have never gone away. Realising that I was getting older, I wanted to see, just once, if I could take all those feelings, and turn them into something real, make my contribution to a world which provided me with so much pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis lead to me creating CelesSteel, an 80s style, potential future\u00a0franchise designed and developed with a similar feel to those action cartoons from days gone by. Based in the post apocalyptic world of Gaiamor, the story centres around a group of 13 heroes and heroines, each based upon a sign of the Western Zodiac, who were blessed with magical powers by the Star Gods, and tasked with saving their world from the forces of darkness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"729\" src=\"http://img12.deviantart.net/6dd0/i/2017/037/9/d/celessteel_images_by_scorpio_prime-day451l.png\" style=\"width: 742px; height: 528px;\" width=\"1024\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhilst initially conceived as a just videogame, which myself and my team have been developing for the past two years, it quickly became apparent to me the potential for these characters and their stories to expand and become so much more. To this end, we now have a full colour debut comic in the pipeline (due for release early 2018), ideas for action figures, posters, T-Shirts and, at a long shot, a possible animated feature. However, these are all lofty goals,\u00a0and I am well aware that the bar is set very high, and it\u00a0will take much time, effort and of course finances for myself and the team to achieve these goals\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, now you know why I have created this Patreon account. Anyone who wishes to help us, we would certainly appreciate your support financially, and by helping us to bring views to this page so that we might properly get this show on the road. Your financial support will eventually allow us\u00a0the additional funds we need to hire more staff, artists, writers, programmers, promoters, ever pushing the idea closer\u00a0to full fruition. CelesSteel is a fully fledged passion project, and anyone who buys into this passion with us will\u00a0see regular updates on both the game and comics progress, supporting artwork, character profiles, and any other miscellaneous snippets and curios we produce as we push to get this idea out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, there you have it - who I am, who we are, what this is, and where we want to take it. If I\u0027ve convinced you to support us, then join up and get pledging...and remember, whenever the darkness approaches...SHINE!"
