    "summary": "My name is Richard Walters and I make music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been releasing my songs since 2007 and during that time have cultivated a strong connection with my listeners and fans. Having put out my last two albums with the assistance of crowdfunding, I\u0027ve been lucky enough to feel the full support of my supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking music in the 21st century is undoubtedly a rockier career path than it was even ten years ago, but the boundless link between artist and audience is an incredible upside to this new industry model...the possibilities are truly endless.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that takes this connection further, allowing you to show your support, or patronage even, for my music on a monthly basis. For the price of a cup of coffee you will receive at least \u003cstrong\u003e2 NEW SONGS\u003c/strong\u003e in your inbox every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is exciting for two reasons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Although I write daily I finish rarely. Currently, I tend to complete one song a month, meaning lots of ideas get left behind. Your patronage will push me to get more new songs ready and dressed for the world. The recordings you receive will be WIP\u0027s (Works in Progress) made by me in my tiny studio, first drafts of tracks that may go further in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Your support will allow me to make more music for music\u0027s sake. This is my job, which means I don\u0027t always get to work on projects that necessarily fall in line with my creative vision.The financial contribution of my patrons will give me more time to spend writing and recording the songs I want to make.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI massively appreciate your support and input, I wouldn\u0027t be making music without it...I can\u0027t wait to share some more songs with you via Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
