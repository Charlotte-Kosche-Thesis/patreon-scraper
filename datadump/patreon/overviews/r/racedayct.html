    "summary": "Hi there. Thank you so much for visiting the RaceDayCT\nPatreon page, a place where you can help support the continued coverage of\nracing in New England through small financial pledges. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn May 2012, after 19 years as a sports reporter at the\nHartford Courant, I decided to leave the newspaper to launch\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://racedayct.com\"\u003eRaceDayCT.com\u003c/a\u003e. The\nwebsite has truly been a labor of love since day one. Over the years at The\nCourant I covered everything from college football to the NFL to Major League\nBaseball, but covering motorsports became my passion. And that passion still\nexists today. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver the last five years we have operated RaceDayCT\nprimarily through the support of some very loyal and amazing advertisers. As in\nmany aspects of publishing and media, changing economics have made for trying\ntimes in attracting new marketing partners. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnfortunately, the changing landscape of the media has\nalmost entirely left short track racing behind. In Connecticut, despite a\nthriving short track racing market, no daily newspapers currently offer any\nregular coverage of short track racing events in the state. Racing trade papers\nhave all but disappeared, and what\u2019s left don\u2019t have the means to offer any real\ntime coverage of short track racing in a timely manner. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt RaceDayCT we pride ourselves in being the only Southern New\nEngland based website focused solely on offering professionally produced short\ntrack racing coverage.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne thing we are not ready to do is make RaceDayCT a subscription based site or have pay-wall sections of exclusive \"pay-for-it\" content, which is the direction being\ntaken by many outlets covering short track racing across the country. And while\nwe\u2019ve strived to avoid going in the direction of subscription based journalism,\nover the years many loyal readers of RaceDayCT have asked how they could help\nindividually. Now we have the program that allows that to happen in Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon allows readers to make small monthly contributions\nthat support the ongoing coverage of short track racing. That supports comes with tiered reward programs for offering that support.\u00a0Thank you for reading this and if you have any further questions regarding the program feel free to E-Mail me at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:shawncourchesne@gmail.com\"\u003eshawncourchesne@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e. As always, we can\u0027t thank you enough for your loyalty in reading and supporting RaceDayCT.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
