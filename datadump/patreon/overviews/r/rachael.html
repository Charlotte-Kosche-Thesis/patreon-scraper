    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m Rachael Herron\u003c/strong\u003e, the bestselling author of more than twenty books which include mainstream\u00a0novels, lighter feminist romances, and one memoir. I\u0027ve got a pretty good handle on what it means to be a writer nowadays, and even though every single dang book tries to buck me, I\u0027m much better at hanging onto the writing reins than I used to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mostly write novels, but creative non-fiction has my heart. Essays. You know, those truth-telling real life pieces of writing that inspire you to do more, to \u003cem\u003ebe more\u003c/em\u003e.I haven\u0027t been able to carve out the time to write these in a while, apart from the odd \u003ca href=\"http://rachaelherron.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblog post\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://rachaelherron.com/subscribe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esubscriber email\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I frequently get reader emails that ask why I don\u0027t write more essays like those in my collection, \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Life-Stitches-Knitting-through-Laughter/dp/1452100535\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eA Life in Stitches\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I get emails that say I should write more about what it\u0027s like to be a Professional Maker, about how to find inspiration, about how to believe in yourself.\u00a0I \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e to teach classes on this, and I\u0027m glad I often get to do so. But not everyone can attend one of my classes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEssays are the way I can reach more people. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is that there aren\u0027t enough hours in the day (the maker\u0027s lament). Luckily, I get PAID to write novels. Yes, that\u0027s quite literally the dream come true. \u003cdel\u003eBut no, the books don\u0027t pay me enough to let me quit the day job, so I also work 56 hours a week at the fire station, answering 911. I\u0027m truly grateful that I have enough time in my life to do both that job and write the novels.\u00a0\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE! I quit the day job. Still not making QUITE enough to live on, but we have savings, and I\u0027m going to work my butt off to make this happen. For the first time in seventeen years, I have more time to write.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\u00a0\u003cem\u003eman\u003c/em\u003e, I still want to write these essays on creativity. I\u0027m not talking specifically about writing or knitting. Creativity is bigger than painting or choreography or singing. \u003cstrong\u003eA creative life takes as much crafting as the things we actually make. And essays about this life take time to write.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eReal\u003c/em\u003e time. Thoughtful time. And time is money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo right here, right now, I\u0027m putting out this patron jar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m asking for your support.\u003c/strong\u003e This is old-school patronage at its best. \u003cem\u003eYou are literally making it possible for me to create more. \u003c/em\u003eYou just pick a tip jar amount, and I\u0027ll reward you for your support with an essay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTO BE CLEAR: Every time I write and send out an essay, you get charged the amount you pledge. \u003c/strong\u003ePledge one dollar and after five essays, you\u0027ll have spent $5. It is not per month, just whenever I provide work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you go up the scale of patronage, you get extras. I\u0027ll send you texts! You\u0027ll get signed books! Pep-talk emails! Depending on the level of support you choose, I could even be your personal creativity coach!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is to write one essay every 4-6 weeks, as my schedule allows.\u003c/strong\u003e A patron at any level will get each essay as soon as they\u0027re done. When I have twelve, I\u0027ll bundle them into a collection. If this endeavor becomes both a thing I love and a thing YOU love, I might keep it going longer than twelve episodes, putting out multiple collections. We\u0027ll see. At any point, of course, you can stop putting money in the tip jar (or you can up your pledge! or lower it!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy first milestone goal (to the left) is $500. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eUPDATE: WE HIT THE MINIMUM GOAL! These essays will be written! MEEEP!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf the total amount pledged for each essay reaches this, it means that for every essay written, I\u0027ll be making about $25/hour, a good living wage. At that level, I can fulfill this Patreon (backers will be charged nothing unless I reach that milestone and start producing essays, which won\u0027t release more often than every four weeks). \u003cstrong\u003eYou will not be charged your pledge amount more than once every four to six weeks, as the essays are written and distributed. \u003c/strong\u003eMilestone Goals above the primary one will unlock other wondrous things, but really, I\u0027m not going to get ahead of myself. I frequently do that, and I\u0027m a trip-prone person, so I\u0027ll walk sedately along right here, trying not to get my hopes up (okay! They\u0027re up! But that\u0027s a nice thing, really).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt comes down to this: If you become my patron, you\u0027re helping me, as a writer, directly. \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027re supporting me in making something that will hopefully inspire \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e to become more creative in your own life. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much.\u003cbr\u003exo,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRachael\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNovember 30, 2017 - NEW PROJECT \u003c/strong\u003e- \u003c/em\u003eI\u0027m starting a new book called \u003cstrong\u003eREPLENISH: My Year of Refilling the Creative Well. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m going to do one new challenging thing a month, every month for a year, in the effort to find what fills a creative life best.
