Davis and I am one of the very first stand up comics to create comedy podcast and video content exclusively for the internet! I started in the mid 90\u0027s with comedy news shows, music, political comedy, character skits and rants, uploading them to web sites and mailing lists. It was quite a bit more difficult at that time without Youtube, Vine or other modern content sharing sites, but I loved doing it and I still love doing it now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfessionally, I\u0027m a stand up comic, writer, video maker and graphic designer. I guess I would say that my biggest passion is to give people a smile and to make them think. There are far too many chances in life to be thoughtless and sad. So we have to take every opportunity to be positive and use our brains. I believe this is the most valuable thing in life and I want to try to help inspire that in whatever I do.",

     "description": "First, let me just say that I think this amount of money per month is far to much to pay. If you do it, you\u0027re completely insane. But for this amount, you\u0027re going to get some crazy special treatment. Here\u0027s what you\u0027ll get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, you\u0027ll get everything that all the other patrons get except for one thing... I will not fly to your house for a weekend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead, for every year of this level of sponsorship, I will fly YOU to MY house where you will stay with me in beautiful Colorado Springs for one week. I will show you the sites, cook my favorite meals for you, show you where and how I work and I will teach you what I do. I\u0027ll train you how to speak in front of an audience and a camera, I\u0027ll show you how to produce and edit video, and by the end of the week, you and I together will write a rant that you\u0027re passionate about, you will go on camera and we will produce a 2-style rant FROM YOU that will go on my Youtube channel for everyone to see. And I promise, I\u0027ll make you look like a badass! It\u0027s basically a Ranting Gryphon Training Camp for a week. If we have time, we\u0027ll even do some collab video game LPs together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is only for one person. You would be \"the one\". I absolutely discourage you from taking this spot because it\u0027s too damned expensive. But if you do, this is what you\u0027ll get. (Limited to North America.)\u003cbr\u003e",
