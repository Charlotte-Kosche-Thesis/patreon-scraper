    "summary": "This patreon is dedicated to\u003cstrong\u003e Angela Marshall\u003c/strong\u003e and her daughter \u003cstrong\u003eViolet\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAngela has most recently been hit with a very uncommon virus known as the \u003cem\u003eWest Nile Virus\u003c/em\u003e. This is still such an unknown uncommon illness that there aren\u0027t any vaccines or specific anti-viral treatments available. \u00a0The only treatment is time and supportive treatment. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn Angela\u0027s situation, she has been hit with a more severe condition. Nerve damage has caused her paralysis like conditions from the waist down. \u00a0This took her down in the hospital for almost 29 days. During this time she had many tests, MRI\u0027s, blood work, PET scans and CT scans done. \u00a0For a moment because of the complexity of the case, doctors were debating and insisting there must be something more at play. Thankfully the doctors have concluded that there are no cancer cells present and that the \u003cem\u003eWest Nile Virus\u003c/em\u003e is the only positive affirmation they can confirm at this time. \u00a0Although there is still some space to explore within her diagnosis as the severity of the condition is still quite rare.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, Angela\u00a0has been transported to Arizona where she and Violet will be living with her mother Beth for an unknown time to get the support, love and care from her mother.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith the support of her Patrons, we are asking for a monthly contribution of whatever you can offer so we can get Angela into a \u003cstrong\u003ephysical therapy recovery program\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ethat can cover the necessities she will need to recover from this sudden threat. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith this plan she will be searching to find the best rehabilitation doctors in Arizona to help see her regularly move forward in her progress, get the therapy sessions she needs to bring life back into her legs and any additional alternative therapies that may be recommended for recovery. Because of the hands off approach of western medicine in regard to this virus she is exploring alternatives to repair the neural cell and nerve damage inflicted. Also greatly appreciated is knowledge, first hand experience and suggestions for ways to increase and maximize her healing and getting back on her feet. \u00a0We appreciate any offers during this time and will update on her progress through Patreon so you can followe her road to recovery. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease read below for Angela\u0027s own encounter: \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWell here goes it all. I am a little nervous to be so vulnerable but I could really benefit from some good thoughts and prayers and advice right now. Normally I keep my private affairs off of this thing but I need some fresh perspective.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eI was in the hospital for 23 days. 23 days away from my daughter in a room with very limited movements from the waist down. I have been confined to this bed while the doctors try and get to the bottom of what they refer to as an unsolved mystery. It started out for me as sciatic back pain and was pretty debilitating. But I could still fake the funk. I then went to a chiropractor who stretched my very tight and uneven hips out. From the visit it was a half an hour until I started just collapsing in random places. He opened my hips and all of the the sudden my legs felt like paper. I called him multiple times to discuss what was going on and he never returned the call.\u003cbr\u003eThus\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003efar the only conclusive positive result I have is West Nile Virus. This can in very rare cases cause paralysis to various parts of your body. Some doctors believe there is something else going on but most say this is just West Nile virus in extreme form. The severe lower limb paralysis and weakness has left me off my feet for over a month and a half. Unfortunately western medicine offers no cure or real assistance in recovery except for rehabilitation. It is a bit unnerving but I will take pride in researching and forging my own path back to ultimate health. For now I will stay focused on generally rebuilding my physical and emotional foundations as it seems they have dilapidated from beneath me. I look at this as an opportunity to improve all around. I refuse to call it a tragedy and believe that this may be the ultimate blessing in disguise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eI am moving home to Arizona so my Mama can take care of us through this transition. I look so forward to Sonoran desert sunsets and reconnecting with old friends.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0I am also looking forward to making physical progress and perhaps deep and necessary transformation that are a result of such a major life 180.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am blessed so far to have a network of angels whom I call friends. They are so wise, so funny, so dedicated, also extremely good looking and stylish and I am eternally grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis was as close a brush as I intend to have for a long time. I am pleased to be here and intend to make the most of each moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLots of love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease picture me upright and running with my little girl. Don\u0027t put too much thought into me in this current state as I have faith it is very temporary.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
