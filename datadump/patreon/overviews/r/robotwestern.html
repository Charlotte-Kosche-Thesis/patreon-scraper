My name Doug Hopkins and I am the Creator/Writer of ROBOT WESTERN: The Comic Book Series. \u00a0First and foremost let me thank you wholeheartedly for being here on my page, it is greatly appreciated. \u00a0Robot Western is a coming of age story about a young robot boy named Rusty, and his adventures throughout a sci-fi wild west frontier. I liken it to Star Wars meets Red Dead Redemption. I am so passionate about this creative work that I have been funding the project out of pocket since it began. Your generosity through Patreon, would provide me some relief of the time restrictions I am facing so I can focus on creating what I know to be a the greatest sci-fi wild west adventure unlike any other!"
