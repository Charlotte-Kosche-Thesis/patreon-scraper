I honestly just want you guys to like my music and if you like it enough you will be kind enough to support.\u003cbr\u003eThe main goal, just like many other, is to make a decent living on the pledges I receive through Patreon and on separate projects. However, with the help of all of you wonderful people I will give something in return. I don\u0027t have much to offer now except sharing my own skills, but in the future I hope I will be able to collab with some other Creator or Creators to make something extraordinary!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI always try to keep my tracks varied.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0This is kinda hard to explain. I have my style but I like to change it up a bit. For example, I try to never make something calming after something calming. Keeping it varied feels the best within me.\u003cbr\u003eUnless inspiration tell me otherwise. And a golden rule I have is to never go against inspiration \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBranching out.\u003c/strong\u003e Recently I have been caught by the Blender flu and developed a hobby for the software. So in the future I might share my creations. Maybe even animate a short movie and score it! I also have a strong hobby for reading and an equally strong desire to write so that is also in the spectrum of possibilities. Oh, I also like playing games, so that\u0027s also a possiblity.\u003cbr\u003eMan, being diverse is awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to collaborate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust message me and explain what kind of crazyness you have in mind!"

This opened up my ears and heart to the depths of music and ever since I have been pursuing to recreate the sounds in my dreams and the random melodies that pops up when I drink a glass of milk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe first thing\u003c/strong\u003e I did when I got my first keyboard was to figure out how to play the theme from the movie Braveheart or the little tune from the second Pok\u00e9mon movie. Memory is a bit fuzzy but it was good times.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA few years later I started high school and studied the basics of music. I had no idea that the mix of notes I had been playing in one hand before were called \u00a0\"chords\" and I was intrigued by this new information. During most of my high school time I tried to figure out how each chord sounded in all forms and thanks to this my ability to improvise and take out melodies with my ears grew stronger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwo years\u003c/strong\u003e after high school I got accepted into a college of sorts, the english language don\u0027t have a word for this type of school so its hard to explain. It was surrounded by nature about 50 kilometers from the nearest city and I loved it! I have never liked the sounds and the stressed, formal state of cities. This is the place where I have felt at home the most. Secluded from everything except music, art and about 170 schoolmates that I got to know closely thanks to the solitude and serenenity the place gave. This is also where I learned the basics of the classical orchestra. I took the information I felt was needed for my purposes and threw the rest out of the window. (Sorry Lars for being a terrible student!) I decided I wanted to create my own style, my own sound, even if its just a small change to someone elses.\u003cbr\u003eThe next year I studied music production at the same school and learned the basics of mixing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd here I am\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0a few years later at the age of 26. Still trying to smack a nail into the toe of music industry. I don\u0027t create to earn money. I simply see it as a plus. I am also part of \u003cem\u003eMateria Collective\u003c/em\u003e. A facebook group-turned-label that started as soon as the FF7 Remake was announced.
