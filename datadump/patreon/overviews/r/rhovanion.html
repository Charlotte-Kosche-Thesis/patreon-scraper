I\u0027m a writer, and although this is mostly a reach-out to my awesome fanfic readers -- shameless self-promotion -- I\u0027ve also \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KIL75Y4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epublished a novel\u003c/a\u003e. In my real life, I\u0027m a closed caption transcriber, a publicist, and a musician. I play trombone in a few bands around Oregon, and due to my long hair, I\u0027m known as the \"Rapunzel trombonist.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/3b49/f/2013/092/7/b/rapunzel_plays_the_blues_by_rhov-d6077aj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting is my passion. It got me out of bad times dealing with depression and severe social anxiety, and I have to admit, it\u0027s saved my life many times over. So I like to reach out to my readers. I know some of you are going through rough times, some of you manage to find solace in reading, or at least feel like you \"belong\" for the first time, thanks to the power of storytelling and a strong fandom who will support you. I\u0027m so happy and deeply honored to have been able to use this passion of mine to help others in their dark times.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, times got a little rough on me. My husband lost his job, his health insurance, we lost our apartment... so I need to reach out. I am most happy when I write, but real life gets in the way. I would love to churn out a chapter a week like I used to, but putting food on the table comes first.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can donate even a little, you are awesome! If money is tight, a simple message of encouragement can really boost me through a whole day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, and may your bright days be many.\u003cbr\u003e"
