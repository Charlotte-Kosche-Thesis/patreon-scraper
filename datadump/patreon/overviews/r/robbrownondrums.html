    "summary": "Choosing to leave a full time job and a regular paycheque to pursue a career as a working musician, as I have done back in 2012, is not an easy decision. But when you have a dream to do something with your life, you eventually get to the point where doing \u003cem\u003eanything\u003c/em\u003e else just doesn\u0027t make sense. As the profession has gotten harder over the years, there have also been more new and exciting opportunities popping up for musicians to diversify and venture into entrepreneurship. Patreon has presented a unique opportunity for musicians like me to to make a much more stable living, outside of and between the gigs and sessions, without have to consider taking up something outside of the field we love. It will also allow and encourage me to cater to you guys on a more personal level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, where will your money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis cool thing about it is that you\u0027ll be able to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003esee\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e where it\u0027s going. Production. I would really like to continually raise the visual and audible standard of my channel to match the quality of the content as well as compete with the top level drum channels on YouTube. That means better cameras and lighting, upgraded recording gear, professional video editing \u0026amp; graphics, etc. This is still a one-man operation and everything from concept to upload is done in-house with my own two hands, at least right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re reading this, you\u0027re most likely aware of my channel and its content. You probably now know how to tune all of your toms in under 10 minutes and\u00a0are well familiar with the term \u0027maximum thumpification\u0027. I\u0027ve been very excited about the recent and sudden growth of my channel since reintroducing it at the top of 2017, reaching 3.5 million views while maintaining a 98% like vs dislike ratio. These are the stats, YOUR feeback and engagement that has encouraged me to finally join Patreon. It simply means that you like, value and enjoy the content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can play a major role in helping me continue to realize my dream of sustaining a career as a working musician and in doing so, you can also help me to raise the production level of my content so I can continue to grow and step my quality game up as we move forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANKS TO YOU, for watching my videos over the years and hope you consider supporting me and the channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRob \u0027Beatdown\u0027 Brown /X\\"
