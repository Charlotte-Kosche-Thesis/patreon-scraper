    "summary": "I write across all genres, most of them dark and/or speculative in nature. My \u003cem\u003eRonin Trilogy\u003c/em\u003e is a historical fantasy set in 13th-century Japan. \u003cem\u003eRogues of the Black Fury\u003c/em\u003e is a gritty, military fantasy novel. \u003cem\u003eThe Wild Boys\u003c/em\u003e is a young-adult supernatural thriller.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDeath Wind\u003c/em\u003e, a Lovecraftian horror-western that I co-authored with Jim Pinto came out last September from WordFire Press.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these are monumentally kick-ass stories.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith my two Ronin Kickstarters, I successfully raised $5700-6000 each time to fund the publication of those novels. I was incredibly gratified, and the result was the completion of a series of which I\u2019m immensely proud. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon, however, is a whole new ballgame for creative projects. Unlike Kickstarter, where you pledge to support a project before it\u2019s finished, Patreon allows you to give a little tip to the creator after something is created. You get to become a patron of the arts and a supporter of the makers you love. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor you, Patreon represents a chance to be part of something much more personal than just buying a novel when it comes out. You become a trusted patron, in that old sense of the word, part of an elite group of superfans with backstage passes to the creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patreon supporter is a way for you to help our culture move from one that expects its creative people to entertain us for free, to one where we collectively value art and artists. The way that we support the artists, musicians, indie filmmakers, and yes, writers whom we love is to cross their palms with silver, as directly as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a quick video on what Patreon is.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u2019m here right now asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m launching into a new novel project, one that requires significant time and mental wherewithal. The novel is a Young Adult contemporary fantasy story about a boy, his extended family, and the really crappy hand he\u0027s been dealt. Your support will go a long way toward helping me write this novel and avoid the some financial pressures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe bottom line is this. I\u2019m a writer, and like all artists I need to eat, pay rent, and occasionally buy equipment. In my case, I use a laptop with several pricey software packages to produce stories, novels, screenplays, podcasts, book designs - all the creative work I do. Occasionally those tools need to be updated or replaced. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAny creative person\u2019s most valuable asset, however, is TIME. As this campaign grows and reaches toward its goals, I will be able to scale back other demands on my time, such as freelance projects, and devote more time to creating fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u2019s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor your patronage, you\u2019ll get to see the work before anyone else, you\u2019ll get some of my poetry (which no one has really seen), you\u2019ll get to take part in the activity feed, comment on what I\u2019m doing, and in new ways get involved with my creative process. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt higher reward levels, you\u0027ll get print copies of my books and anthologies, I\u2019ll critique your stories, and set up video hangouts where we can talk about writing, storytelling, whatever you like. At the highest levels, I\u2019ll even Tuckerize you into a story. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also have exclusive access to bits of wackiness as I conceive them, a rogue video or two, who knows? We\u0027re entering an unexplored realm. Anything could happen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAll you have to do to sign up is become a patron.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bearpawpublishing.com/images/GooH7_patreonscreencapture.mov\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClick here for a quick video on how to do it\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is good fiction worth?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIs it worth the cost of a latte to read a great short story, to lose yourself for a time in world that\u2019s not your own? What if the cost of one or two lattes a month could help keep me writing stories for years to come? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease support my campaign.
