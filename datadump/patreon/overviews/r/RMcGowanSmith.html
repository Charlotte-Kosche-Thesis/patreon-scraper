    "summary": "Hey everyone! My name is Ruairi McGowan-Smith, and I love making maps. I\u0027ve been producing fantasy and historical maps for five years now, both for my own pleasure and that of others. I\u0027ve recently found that the amount of time and effort put into making maps is difficult to balance with a demanding full-time job, so I\u0027m asking for your help. My experience is that people enjoy my creations, and I want to keep making maps to that kind of standard. My hope is that you can help make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the short term, I want to be able to continue creating high quality maps for everyone to enjoy, starting at once per fortnight and moving up to the rate of at least one per week. In the long term, I hope to transition into creative work full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a backlog of previous work sitting on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://daeres.deviantart.com/gallery/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edeviantART\u003c/a\u003e, if you want to take a look at the kind of map I make. New work will periodically appear there, so you don\u0027t have to support me if you don\u0027t want to, or can\u0027t afford to, but anything you can spare is enormously appreciated. It will all go towards paying bills, expenses, etc that will justify spending more time creating maps, along with keeping me in mango juice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage shows me your appreciation, and it also entitles you to a say over the sort of maps I produce. There are specific projects I produce maps for, but your inclusion in my creative output is part and parcel of what I\u0027m doing. Alternate histories, fantasy worlds, it\u0027s all fair game. In addition, Patrons will also gain access to additional versions (and rough drafts, if they so desire) of the maps I produce, along with additional creative context for those maps attached to particular projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become a Patron then don\u0027t feel obligated to donate more than you can afford, and don\u0027t worry if you can\u0027t become a Patron at all. If you want to support me without donations, then please tell other people about my page on Patreon, share my maps with other people, and credit my maps when you do. I appreciate anything and everything you can do to give me a hand!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to come to this page and read this. I hope we\u0027ll make awesome stuff together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
