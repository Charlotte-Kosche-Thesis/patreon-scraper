    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Shea Parker and I\u0027m trying to make board games easier to learn. Some people have trouble learning rules from manuals, some people prefer to be taught than to teach themselves, some people just don\u0027t have the time to figure it out. I\u0027m here to help all of them, and anyone else who wants to watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith RTFM I take a game that I think is worth playing, learn the rules back and forth, then make a video teaching you how to play it from set-up to victory. After which I make a few supplemental videos giving strategy tips, design comments, mechanical critique, or anything else I feel like spending a couple minutes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I\u0027ve taught Twilight Imperium (3rd and 4th edition), Dead of Winter, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, and Eldritch Horror. With this Patreon I\u0027m trying to teach more videos on a regular basis. If you join my team of Rules Lawyers you can help to increase the rate at which I can produce RTFM episodes, with the eventual goal of one per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at the different goals and reward tiers. Donations will be per video, so until we reach one of the highest goals, you will be charged less than once per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003eShea"
