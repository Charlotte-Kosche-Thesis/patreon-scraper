I\u0027m Rachel Ashton, a teacher and wanna-be writer with a dream of one day being able to live my life making a living with my favorite craft!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/projecttheirworld.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/pagebreakp-t.png?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tFind the website and story here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://projecttheirworld.wordpress.com\"\u003eProject: TheirWorld\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/projecttheirworld.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/pagebreakintention.png?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\" style=\"width: 349px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nOne thing to keep in mind about Project: TheirWorld is that it is, indeed, a project. While it is a web novel, for me, it\u0027s about more than just the story. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s an experiment. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s about me as an author learning more about how to write, edit, and construct a story. TheirWorld is not my \u0027dream novel\u0027 that must be perfect in every sense of the way; that one will come later. No; TheirWorld is a novel that has unlimited story and character potential as it goes forward and finds an audience of it\u0027s own. It\u0027s a testing ground for me as I learn my strengths and weaknesses as a writer, learn the ropes of social media and self advertisement, and serve as a way for me to develop the skill set needed to make something like this successful so that, as a writer and a teacher, I can share that skill set and experience with others. It\u0027s not something that\u0027s meant to be \u0027good\u0027 so much as \u0027enjoyed\u0027.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd if this project enables me to continue writing and allows me to start other projects once it is complete, than all the better.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/projecttheirworld.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/pagebreaktheplan.png?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\" style=\"width: 358px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nThe current plan for the TheirWorld web novel is a five book series, including the prequel story, currently titled \"Book Zero\", over the next 3-4 years. The current book, Tatterskin: Volume One - Secrets of the Dead, will only be released one chapter a week to ensure quality over quantity. Depending on how things go, I will go back to the two release/week schedule I had for the prequel story.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDuring this time I will also do my best to produce a half decent website and designs to go with it.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnything beyond this is entering stretch goal territory, as the future with school and work is hard to predict.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/projecttheirworld.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/pagebreakprogress.png?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\" style=\"width: 363px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nAs of March 2017, I have finished the first Project: TheirWorld book (unedited), now titled: The Tutorial.

There just wasn\u2019t enough time and energy left to devote to concentrating on a serious fantasy story with hundreds of characters addressing social, economic, and religious issues between getting used to my new job and wrapping my head around reality.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSometime in 2017 I discovered the wonderful world of Web Novels and Light Novel Translations. They were light, easy reading; the writing was rarely anything to write home about, but people loved them nevertheless and the concepts were usually quite simple and fun.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI got the crazy idea in my head that I, too, could do this. Far be this style of writing from my usual, heavy style; its light, fun, repetitive, and I don\u2019t need to worry so much about shoving my ideas and characters into a little bottle; I can just write all I want.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, with the encouragement of some good friends, the VRMMORPG story \u201cTheirWorld\u201d was born.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, as I expect of myself, my simple writing exercise got a little bit out of control. My experiences overseas played a big role in who my main character was, and watching what I see as my country imploding from overseas played a big role in what TheirWorld started to become and is still becoming. It evolved.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd it\u2019s still evolving.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/projecttheirworld.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/pagebreakthanks.png?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I don\u0027t expect much, I\u0027ll be leaving my job at the end of the next six months in order to return to school, and any support I can get to continue this project means that I can keep it going longer. If there is anyone who is willing to support this project, you are awesome, and I will continue to produce content as long as I can!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://projecttheirworld.wordpress.com/\"\u003eProject: TheirWorld\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
