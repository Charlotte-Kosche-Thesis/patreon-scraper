    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, let\u0027s be straight with one another. I want to make a kick-ass Sci-Fi universe, but can\u0027t do it on my own. Sure, I could write stories just for myself, but what fun is that? I want to create something with your help that could shake the realms of science fiction and create a totally new universe that was designed with the help of its readers. How many other universes do you know can be directly influenced by the readers? I want to create a place where you are entertained by awesome struggles between good and evil, wars fought with destructive piloted robots, and maybe throw in some other crazy goodies. My job as an author is to entertain you. Join with me to get awesome exclusive access that you can\u0027t get with universes like Star Wars, Halo, or Star Trek. Together we can make something that thousands upon thousands enjoy. Question is, are you ready to be part of something awesome?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Revelations? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRevelations is a brand new science fiction series that is set in the year 434 ANE (After Near Extinction) in a galaxy somewhere far away from Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, global warming and all sorts of problems plaguing Earth. Humanity has rebuilt many of what was lost after a powerful Artificial Intelligence tried to exterminate every living human. The Corre Republic has fractured from controlling all of explored space to a fraction of its once dictatorial power. The Prefect Major who fancies himself to be the emperor of the Republic has decided that everyone will once again follow the same flag, whether they want to or not. If all of humanity can be brought together again then the next great golden age will appear and all areas from science and medicine, to art and society will flourish. However, the 9 other nations that fought so hard for their freedom from the Republic are not about to give up their independence without a fight. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this set in an advanced timeline of Earth?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhile there are \"humans\" as the main race in this series it is not based on Earth. In fact, the planet Earth does not exist in the galaxy that Revelations and its history originate from. This means I as a writer can have far more freedom in writing, which can allow for some crazy fun stories since we don\u0027t necessarily have to operate in the same way of thinking that we could apply to our own planet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get out of supporting this project?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eLook, I get it. If you are putting money on the table you want to know what you are going to get in return. Honestly, you can purchase these stories on Amazon as they are released. But do you know what Amazon will never give you that Patreon does? Exclusive access to all sorts of crazy goodies like behind-the-scenes videos, live events with the author, the insane option to vote on future stories, and more! I want to offer perks at a value that adds more to you. I can\u0027t do this without you. I can write stories all day but I have a family to take care of. I am beyond grateful for each and every one of you out there helping me to create content that you love. What I want to make here is a community. Will you join with me to create something special that can be achieved nowhere else?"
