I\u0027m Rachel Ellyn, nice to meet you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently went to a psychic, Madam Ruth, who outlined all the questions you would ask me here on Patreon. So, let me give you the answers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuestion 1 - I write because I\u0027m blonde. At any one moment, there are tens of ten stories and characters bouncing around my head like ping-pong balls. So when I capture the story on page, those facts and characters relating to the tale quietly exit my noggin and I gain back memory space and processing power!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuestion 2 - Good question! Currently I have 5 stories in various stages of completeness. One is waiting on my illustrator to finish her part. One is being written. One is partially written, and two are being outlined. There are more stories waiting to be started in my trusty notebook, but in reference to the above Blonde mention, I only have so much processing power at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc8c12_a869e79a5ec8422c8c27b9b7e85e6e96~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_600,h_360,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cc8c12_a869e79a5ec8422c8c27b9b7e85e6e96~mv2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuestion 3 - I\u0027ve been seriously writing since 2010. I have 10 books published, all indie - #SupportIndie! #ILoveHashtags, don\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuestion 4 - NO!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously, thank you for reading my page. I truly would appreciate your patronage. Please check out my website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rachelellyn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erachelellyn.com\u003c/a\u003e to see all the books I have written to date.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI promise, with your support, to write the ride of your life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now Don, what else do we have for these nice folks?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell Rachel, if the above is not enough... LOL \u00a0Here\u0027s your \"official\" Bio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLife and loves after the career.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith degrees in Finance and Economics, Rachel found wonderful success in the business world, which took her I.T. and financial process consulting international. However, with her mind focused on business, and with the lack of training and mentoring in her personal life, marriage success eluded her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter foraging on a path of self-awareness and exploration with a determination to avoid repeating patterns again, she found the key to relationship bliss. Now, combining her passion for writing and storytelling with her skills, knowledge, and drive that led to her business acclaim, Rachel shares her off beat take on the world, and her findings where life, love, divorce, and children are concerned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRachel is determined to be a publicist\u0027s nightmare by writing in multiple genres including children\u0026#8217;s fiction, flash fiction, romance, and suspense/thriller.\u003cbr\u003eAfter multiple divorces, she is now happily married and lives in the Kansas City Metropolitan area enjoying the household noise of her soon-to-be empty nest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRachel Ellyn\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
