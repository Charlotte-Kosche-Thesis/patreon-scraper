I hope that you will come on this awesome journey with me - and I really mean as part of the journey, not just as a passenger. RhinoDroid started very quickly and inauspiciously as a project on Twitch TV but before long had developed a great head of steam. One of the greatest aspects of launching the comic so publicly through live-streaming has been the community involvement. The value-add to the comic has been enormous and I hope to really capture that aspect here at Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy background is as a graphic designer / creative director for the last 30-odd years mainly working in the field of advertising and marketing. While this has been great for getting reward for \u0027letting loose\u0027 the creative juices, I have never really been in control of my own destiny or projects. Well, not in a large, meaningful, on-going, fully creative way. I have thought and planned about doing something like this ever since I started working in the creative field and now finally I am in the best position to move forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you decide to join me with RhinoDroid and I hope that this is something we can all be proud of."
