    "summary": "Since 2004, I\u0027ve been developing the Ren\u0027Py Visual Novel Engine.  Ren\u0027Py is completely open source, free for commercial use, and runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Android, and iOS. Since its introduction, Ren\u0027Py has been used by storytellers and game makers all around the world to create over a thousand visual novels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until this point, I have shouldered the cost of development software and equipment myself. \u00a0However, keeping up with changing technology and standards can get pricey.  Rather than work longer hours to fund development-related expenses, I\u0027ve created this Patreon.  Now you can help free up my time so that I can put more work into Ren\u0027Py... and get some nice rewards in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what rewards can you get here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, the one reward you \u003cem\u003ewon\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e get from becoming a patron is software that\u0027s different from what I give away for free. I want to make the best version of Ren\u0027Py I can available to everyone in the world, even people who can\u0027t afford or don\u0027t have the ability to pay.  Ren\u0027Py is my gift to the world -- locking even small parts of it behind a paywall would be counterproductive to the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the rewards we \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e offering:\u003cbr\u003e    \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEvery patron gets access to exclusive posts that describe how to use Ren\u0027Py - both current and upcoming features. These posts are written at a tutorial level (versus the normative nature of the Ren\u0027Py documentation), and are checked by a visual novel creator to make sure they are understandable even to people who aren\u0027t professional programmers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatrons sponsoring at the $2 and up level get to be listed as sponsors on the Ren\u0027Py website and in the documentation for each release. At higher levels, this can include a sponsor banner for your game, organization, or studio on the Ren\u0027Py home page. Please read\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/11133822\"\u003ethis post\u003c/a\u003e for information about how to set up your sponsorship, and the fine print below.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt $10 and up, you get a collectable art postcard in the mail every month. These feature original art from visual novel creators in the Ren\u0027Py community.  The back of every postcard features a calendar you can use to track your progress toward your own development goals.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e        \u003cbr\u003eWhile I do most of the work when it comes to developing Ren\u0027Py, the engine is the product of a team of dozens of programmers, translators, and other helpful volunteers from countries all around the world. Now you can become part of our team by helping us continue to produce one of the world\u0027s best visual novel engines and make it available for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the fine print:\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSponsor links and banners update once a month. I reserve the right to reject sponsor links and logos that are in poor taste or spammy. Sponsor links and banners will be ordered first by the amount of support provided this month, then by the total amount of support provided, and then in a random order.\u003c/em\u003e"
