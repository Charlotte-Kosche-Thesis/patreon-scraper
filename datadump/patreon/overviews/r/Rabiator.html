    "summary": "Hello, all! I am Rabiator and I have been writing adult-only, sex-focused stories off and on for several years now. As of late I focus mainly on private, one-to-one commissions and those of you familiar with my work, on HentaiFoundry \u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/Rabiator/profile\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, will know that my pace is not the best, which is the main reason I\u0027m starting this patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to write more on a regular basis-at least one story a month, possibly two, in addition to my private commissions. My hope is that directly asking for the input of patrons, I can turn out stories perhaps not suited\u00a0 to more specific interests and cover a wider breadth of themes/fetishes/fandoms. My general work tends to invovle quite a bit of sizeplay and roughsex, and while that will certainly still appear, I\u0027d quite like to try a few other things as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersonally, I\u0027d also like to try new sources of ideas as well-its all well and good to write yet another Bleach story, because for people who like that sort of thing (like myself) you can never have enough. But I\u0027d also like to tackle those pairings/media that are ripe for smut but don\u0027t see a lot of work, for whatever reason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will be a per story payment situation, though I hope to put out at least one story a month, that may not always be possible. Barring certain extraordinary circumstances, i will not be doing more than two stories a month, so you can keep that in mind when deciding which reward tier you would like to pay for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. These stories (and any other stories I should happen to write) will be semi-paywalled before eventually being shared for all on my HF account.\u003cbr\u003e2. Stories will be determined by polls, to consist (hopefully) of two sources, one set of ideas from me, and one set of ideas from a set of patrons. If I only have time to write on story in a given month, it will be taken from the patron-poll, though both polls will appear fairly early in the month and close together.\u003cbr\u003e3. Poll ideas will be semi-recycled. Ideas that seem to receive very little interest will be scrapped, but ideas that receive a healthy share of votes without being number one will be given another chance in subsequent polls. If I like a particular idea from the patreon-submitted side of things, I\u0027ll include in my own group of submissions in following months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is all likely to change based on what kind of feedback I get from all of you, so let\u0027s get started!\u003cbr\u003e"
