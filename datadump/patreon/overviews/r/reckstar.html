We\u2019re making this comic because we love it, and will continue to do so for as long as we possibly can, even if we don\u2019t make a single red cent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re putting out the Patreon hat because, as fun and fulfilling as it is, making comics is hard work. It takes time and effort (did you notice Michelle is pulling TRIPLE duty on this book?) and those things are at a premium when you have a whole other job (or multiple jobs) keeping the roof over your head, as Michelle and I both do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, we want to make comics our full time job. That means making money off of our work.\u00a0But we don\u2019t want to deprive people of the port-in-a-storm free entertainment can be. I know free webcomics have helped me through more than my share of thin months (hell, they still do), and I know that when I\u2019m able, I like to give a little back to the projects and creators who kept my spirits up for nothing at all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, we\u2019ve created this Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u00a0\u003cem style=\"font-weight: inherit;\"\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0give?

You\u2019re reading this, which means you know our comic, and if you\u2019ve gotten this far into my ramblings, it probably means you\u00a0\u003cem style=\"font-weight: inherit;\"\u003elike\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0our comic, and just knowing that you\u2019re out there inspires us to continue creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReally -- I\u2019m really not kidding. We love each and every person who reads our comic. At the time of this writing, that\u0027s a relatively small number. But as more of you tune in, just know that you mean the world to us, just being there, and you don\u2019t need to give us anything in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGive only if you can, if you\u2019re inspired to. And if not, please continue to enjoy the comic, spread the word, and join us on our adventure. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e...Well, that was disgustingly sappy and now I\u2019m not sure I want to support you anymore.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u2019t be an asshole, hypothetical-question-asker."
