    "summary": "Just like the item our channel is named after, Rare Candy is evolving, but the one thing that has remained the same is our passion for covering the Pokemon TCG! Whether it\u0027s deck profiles, set reviews, tournament coverage, product openings, metagame discussions, or anything else Pokemon TCG related, we are committed to bringing it to you guys at the highest quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the beginning we\u0027ve had ambitious goals for the quality of Pokemon TCG content we want to bring to you. However, creating this content frequently at the quality bar we are striving for, and quite frankly that you guys deserve for all of the support you have given us, is requiring an increasing amount of resources. By joining our exclusive Candy Crew community by making a monthly pledge here on Patreon we think we have found a mutually beneficial way to make this a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my pledge going towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEquipment\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003e- With better camera equipment we can feel comfortable bringing you more live discussions instead having voice overs recorded over static imagery. We can create backdrops and other props for pack opening videos, recorded matches, etc. With better audio equipment we can ensure each of our team members can also record quality sounding content at all times. We can buy new video editing programs for more interesting effects. Etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTravel Expenses\u003c/strong\u003e -\u003c/em\u003e As competitive players we travel frequently and it can be very financially taxing to travel to every major tournament. Being able to make it to these tournaments allows us to provide coverage including tournament reports, recorded matches, and live social media updates to let you guys know any breaking news or unexpected decks and/or cards that may pop up at the events.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eProduct Openings\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - Product openings are easily the most expensive videos we make and we frequently pick up new packs and boxes even if we don\u0027t need the cards just to make sure we have content to bring you guys. By joining our exclusive community we can ensure we always can pick up the most recent product release to show you pull rates and whatever else the newest Pokemon TCG releases entail.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGiveaways \u0026amp; Contests\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003c/em\u003eWith the resources that we have we do product giveaways from time to time, but we want to expand both the size of the product being given away but also the frequency at which we do these contests. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTime\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003c/em\u003eThis is BY FAR the most important thing your money is going towards. Though we make a small amount of income via ad revenue we are still employed for 40+ hour weeks elsewhere. The ultimate goal is for at least one of the content creators at Rare Candy to be able to scale back how much they work their job and reinvest that time back into the channel and creating content at least 5 days a week for our loyal fans. More time not only means more videos, but more editing to bring you better production values, and more timely coverage to bring you the latest deck idea, set review, card discussion, etc. as soon as it\u0027s possible to do so. And most of all, it will allow us more time to interact more intimately with you guys in the community.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA variety of things actually!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eShoutouts in videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive deck lists \u0026amp; articles\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive merchandise\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeekly PTCGO code giveaways\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 on 1 deck advice\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrivate PTCGO matches\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAbility to pick videos for us to create\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFewer ads on our YouTube videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThis is something that will be evolving as time goes on as well, as we will be actively listening to the feedback of our Patrons to give rewards based on what our community wants to see happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust a huge thank you anyone who has ever watched one of our videos, picked up something from our online store, become one of our loyal patrons, or interacted with our brand in any way!
