    "summary": "\"Making it just for you\" , is what I have in mind when showing you how I create my projects. No high tech drawings or expensive equipment, just simple hand made drawings and tools nearly everybody can afford. I hope my work and approach to woodworking inspires you to start woodworking and make the things you dream of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for being a patreon, or considering becoming one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs as son of a carpenter i came into contact with woodworking as soon as I could walk. Growing up, I helped my dad with several small and big projects, from small cabinets and furniture to building an extention to our house. I learned a lot from my old man. \u003cbr\u003eA couple of years ago I was able to setup my own workshop and refound my passion for woodworking. As I saw many others on youtube using mainly powertools, I set my shop up based on a powertool workflow, but I find myself using more and more handtools. This hybrid approuch to woodworking suites me very well, using powertools for big, heavy or repetative work, and handtools for joinery, finishing and other lighter tasks. You don\u0027t need a lot of fancy powertools to make something. An old handplane, some chisels, a hand saw and a mallet are all you need to get started. \u003cbr\u003eI find working with wood very relaxing. Making something with your hands is very rewording. Starting with an idea, figuring out how to make it and than realy make it happen is an amazing experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why do I need your support? \u003cbr\u003eEach week for the last two years i have published a new video. I want to keep on doing this but that takes supplies, training, and most or all equipment (video, audio, tools)\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, your support would help me tremedously to dedicate more money to supplies and new tools, and enable me to further improve my video\u0027s and my projects for you to enjoy and learn from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKind regards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRob\u003cbr\u003e"
