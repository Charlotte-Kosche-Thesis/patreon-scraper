I moved on to Costume Design (both for myself and commissions for others) and became a Cosplayer because, being the geek that I am with love for so many different fandoms, it was the next logical step. I have stepped out into Alternative Modeling from time to time, but I will always be a Cosplayer first and foremost. I created this Patreon page to share some of my more risque modeling and cosplay photos. Also,\u00a0lets be honest, cosplay is expensive, lol. I have so many plans and so many skills I want to build, but I can\u0027t do any of that without your help. I have already mastered fabric manipulation. My next step is prop making and armor building. I welcome your support, as well as any tips or suggestions you may have. Bottom line is the more support I have (from you wonderful people) the more time and money I can put into making things, that means the more elaborate and awesome my designs will be and the more you will all enjoy seeing them. I cannot do this without you so thank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few things you may want to know. At any pledge amount (even $1) you will be entered in my monthly print giveaway once your lifetime pledge amount reaches $10. If you win the giveaway that amount will be deducted from your lifetime pledges and you will have to pledge another $10 to be eligible again. I will also have other giveaways that may have higher lifetime pledge requirement. The same will apply to those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some of my future plans:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTigra\u003c/strong\u003e Cosplay. I have been really interested in body paint lately. I have a few body painted characters I want to do, and access to an airbrush gun! Now all I need is supplies to practice airbrushing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/deathbattlefanon/images/4/4f/Tigra-Classic-iOS.png/revision/latest?cb=20160221190035\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDarth Talon\u003c/strong\u003e.
