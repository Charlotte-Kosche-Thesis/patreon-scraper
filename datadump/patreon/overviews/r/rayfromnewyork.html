    "summary": "Hello FB universe!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirstly, I want to thank each and everyone of you who like, comment, share, or just lurk, on the now probably thousands of articles, thought pieces, and videos I have posted over the last 4 years. \u003cbr\u003e\nIt means so much to me when people continue to encourage my posting when I see distant friends in real life and tell me that I have somehow become their primary news source.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn what started as a way for me to catalogue studies and statistics about racism in America for myself after experiencing several traumatic interactions back to back, such as being called \"Jar Jar Chinks\" on my first job as a Director of Photography on a feature or having background extras make chinky eyes at me on a later shoot that I even donated equipment and discounted my rate for, and a dozen more stories,\u00a0I am so glad to hear that these thought provoking pieces have enriched your lives as much as mine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I sit here recovering from the flu, I have been contemplating again and again that it still hasn\u0027t been enough, as evident by...well, nearly fucking everything outside.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have said again and again that most of these problems we have are largely a failure of the American imagination\u2026or rather lack thereof. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFilms, and its antecedents theatre and literature, do matter and have altered the course of history more often than any war or government.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe vast majority of projects that are made now largely adhere to certain ideas that are perpetuated by the wealthy, White-majority status quo, as the key decision-makers and green-lighters, and even when they do throw minorities or women (51% of the population)  a bone, it\u0027s always with a sort of half-heart and limp wrist. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe latest of these is the \"you-make-it-we-might-screen-it\" contests, where amateur filmmakers are expected to spend their own money to win a shot at a very limited number of seats and a nominal prize, like HBO\u0027s Project Greenlight or AAPI \u201cInitiative\". \u003cbr\u003e\nBehind the scenes in the selection process, it\u0027s as political as any other film festival programming team trying to maximize their slate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen it costs $10k+ in actual costs, or equivalent in donated time/equipment to pull off a short film, and with prizes often only half that value if there\u0027s one at all, this is all more for the benefit of the corporations than any individuals that choose to take part in these cattle calls.  \u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough I support writing competitions, because writing is free, it isn\u2019t difficult to accumulate $1000 in expenses when the average cost for submitting is $45-70.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s a very expensive lottery ticket for a less than 1% chance of success. It doesn\u2019t take being a mathematician to realize those are terrible odds, and it doesn\u2019t take being Warren Buffet to realize that continuing to place hope in that system is a bad decision. \u003cbr\u003eEven once a film is finished, the acceptance rate at top festivals is 0.74%, including the studio-backed low budget \"indie\" films. Where does that leave the rest of us? \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been fortunate to not be an aspiring amateur filmmaker now, and over the last 6 years, in what is shaping into an unexpectedly fulfilling career, I have had the great honor of working for and getting to know the ins-and-outs of some of the greatest artists and organizations in the world, from Jay Z and co. to Neil Patrick Harris to Wong Fu Productions to Time magazine; commercials for small businesses and blue chip multinational corporations; award-winning indie shorts, features, and web series; and on music videos for huge pop stars and up-and-comers alike.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe reality of the film business model outside the studio system is pretty stupid: find a rich benefactor whose ideals align closely to yours on an individual project they think will make them a profit, get a check, make the film, and then submit to film festivals who all have their own agendas and internal politics, and then wait a year or so, and then make that rich benefactor their money back by luring people with a two minute visual summary of your film. Repeat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have kept it a loose secret that my magnum opus of a feature screenplay The Bloody Angle, the biopic of New York Chinatown\u0027s Scarface/Don Corleone during the peak of Chinese Exclusion, made the second round of Sundance Screenwriter Lab/A3 Fellowship competition last year after 6 years of painstaking research and revision, and it has subsequently gone on to receive a positive review from Blacklist and on course to being featured in their top scripts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause of this, I\u0027ve had the opportunity to meet with several interested producers and financiers, both large and small, in Hollywood and in China.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMeeting with these colorful cast of characters, I\u0027ve heard jokes about sexual harassment waivers, had several bum leads, and heard a myriad horror stories about working with the tops of these media organizations. \u003cbr\u003e\nAs Aziz showed in \"Master of None\", the higher up you go, the more racist it seems to get. \u003cbr\u003e\nWhen even the top AAPI filmmakers like Justin Lin have trouble getting funds to create non-franchise projects, what is even the point of going through the mainstream routes? \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe more and more I reflect on what actions to take, again, I come to the conclusion that the only people I want to work for is you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlthough The Bloody Angle is a big dream of mine, I also know that it will cost $5-7 million dollars at minimum to properly execute, and I don\u0027t mind taking my time to reach the point when I can do that story justice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut....over the last years, I have written and read dozens of relatively easy to produce feature film, pilot, and short film scripts from some of the most talented people from NYU and elsewhere that not only deserve to be made- they NEED to be made. And seen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat is why I decided to start a Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar, Patreon is a platform that allows audiences to donate directly to their favorite content creators,  filling the gap of how new media artists can finance their work and the archaic traditional media business model that largely still has no idea how to work with them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlthough it currently largely caters to Youtube stars/channels, I prefer not to be on camera anymore and haven\u2019t been a comedian since realizing White people are mostly laughing at us and not with us, and I\u2019ve never had an interest in turning my Facebook feed into some sort of vlog or Young Turks show, and I have no interest in becoming the next Trevor Noah or other political pundit. My FB feed is how I choose to engage in the conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a producer, writer, and director, I am tired of watching clickbait and talking heads spinning their wheels.\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to see real content about the things we all seem to be interested in here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n It\u0027s time to be the change we want to see in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m tired of asking permission. The only people we need permission from are viewers like you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo me, narrative storytelling does a better job of exploring ideas and perspectives than these venues, and it\u0027s my dream to be able to create or facilitate telling these stories full-time, all the time, in addition to keeping you updated on all the wild and wacky things happening in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, that is why I am asking you to consider donating to my newly started Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAny contribution is  greatly appreciated to get the engines turning on projects large and small, whether it\u0027s $1 or $100. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n5% of all donations and 10% of donations over $1000 will go towards a different charitable organization at the end of each month, whether it is Planned Parenthood, ACLU, CAPE, Asian American Writers Workshop, the American Cancer Society, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nRegular donors will receive periodic gifts, whether it\u0027s a vintage or designer clothing item personally selected for you, rare film or science fiction memorabilia, books and film collections, subscriptions to film production services and cloud software, and other incentives that I think you may personally want from getting to know your tastes and needs. Stuff you might actually you might ACTUALLY want. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe rest of the money will go towards paying top actors (and their agents), cinematographers (and their agents), musicians, crew, and everything that goes into a film project. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt truly does take a village. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks you again for your readership over the years, and I\u0027ll keep posting if you keep reading! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
