We are appreciative that you have come to find out more about Rocket Punch and consider supporting our endeavors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you are unfamiliar with the concept, Patreon is a way for fans of any topic to come and support specific creators, and help them achieve their goals, while also nabbing some awesome rewards and exclusive content in the process! It also provides a direct feed between fans and creators on all of the work and effort that people put into their various projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut why does Rocket Punch have a Patreon page? Well, the content we create does not contain any ads, and while we do what we can to help support this project, opening a Patreon page allows fans who support our efforts to help keep the project running smoothly, allowing us more creative freedom, but it also allows fans to see our processes and get some sweet look from us in the process. There are a lot of costs that go into continuing to make this content, and we could not be more appreciative to our patrons that help us every month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what if I can\u0027t help support Rocket Punch on Patreon? Don\u0027t worry! You viewing and interacting with our content is the best support anyone can ever give to us! We don\u0027t want people to feel as though they have to support us on Patreon, but if you do feel like doing so, we have this avenue created to allow you to (plus you get a ton of exclusive stuff too for helping us!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are able to support us or not, we still want to say thank you for visiting our page, and hope that, at the least, you allow us to continue to make awesome geek and gaming content for you to consume.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAbout Us:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/565fe810e4b0b44fe6b82a0f/598a79156b8f5b013edd645b/59a36ddff7e0abd56a4b7a6a/1504420752612/IMG_0679.JPG?format=2500w\" style=\"width: 490px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDECEMBER 2015.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e A group of friends created an idea and joined forces.
