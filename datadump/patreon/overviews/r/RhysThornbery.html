    "summary": "Hello! And greetings to those who have decided to come and visit this page. If you\u2019re here there\u2019s a good chance you already know what it is I do. However, for those of you not yet aware, I\u2019ll introduce myself and explain what it is I do.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Rhys. At present I am an aspiring writer who is using Fanfiction to work on improving my craft. It is my hope that some day I\u2019ll be a skilled enough author to write original works all my own. In the mean time I hope to entertain people with stories in worlds they already know and love!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is my plan that at least once a month, barring circumstance outside my control, I will update a story over on \u003ca href=\"http://FanFiction.net\"\u003eFanFiction.net\u003c/a\u003e. If at all possible I will try to forewarn patrons should an up coming event be likely to interfere with my writing. I will try to post a poll every month, accessible only to patrons. This poll will be used as much as possible to determine what I write. At present one dollar (and thereby being a patron) is equivalent to one vote. If, in times to come I gather enough patrons I may shift this system somewhat so that those who donate more get more votes. Though I\u2019ll try to keep such a system fair, should things go that way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA warning however, sometimes a specific story, or idea will come up and latch onto my brain in such a way that no other works will be written. In these cases I will not put up a poll as I don\u2019t want you to feel you wasted your time voting. It is my hope that I may in the future come to be skilled enough I can write more than one story at a time thus negating this hurdle somewhat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt present I have a number of stories which are works in progress and thus dominating my imagination. Here they are with titles and tentative summaries:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInto The Black:\u003c/strong\u003e This story is a Harry Potter/Star Wars crossover. Something which prior to reading and writing fan fiction I would not have credited as being possible. In this work Harry Potter and his best friend Hermione Granger depart on an expedition through a magical portal, only to find themselves basically marooned in a Galaxy Far Far Away. To make matters more complicated they have arrived just in time to run afoul of Order 66 and the Rise of the Empire. Naturally their presence complicates a certain Evil Overlord\u2019s plans for the Galaxy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCradled In Crimson Arms:\u003c/strong\u003e Another HP/SW crossover. This one takes a notably different tact however. A former Sith Lady, by the name of Keira Kallig, finds her way (via the guidance of the Force) to Earth in search of a \u2018Chosen One\u2019. Upon arrival she stumbles across the attack in progress at Godric\u2019s Hollow and manages to save not only Harry but Lily as well. Effectively adopting both of them she takes up residence on Earth following the Force\u2019s guidance to prepare Harry for his destiny. What none of them can know at the time is that this destiny will ultimately have consequences far beyond the British Isles. Heck, beyond Earth in general!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Order:\u003c/strong\u003e A Harry Potter Fan Fic. Harry\u2019s relatives want nothing to do with him. Even more so than in canon. And, taking a leaf from the theatrical, deposit Harry on the doorstep of a church. Harry experiences a vastly different upbringing than in canon and his motives, whereabout and purpose are a mystery when he suddenly reappears at the beginning of 4th year. Which has a great number of strange consequences that ripple through the Wizarding world as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat Which Truly Matters:\u003c/strong\u003e A Harry Potter Fic. At the end of third year, Hermione Granger is accidentally infected by Remus Lupin with Lycanthropy. Naturally this life altering illness has a profound impact on the young witch, and her best friend too! Not only that her newly acquired ailment plunges Harry and Hermione into a side of the magical world they\u2019ve not yet seen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Witch, A Wizard And A Mechanic REWRITE:\u003c/strong\u003e Another Harry Potter Fic. This one was fairly well received in its original form by readers. Sadly, I found myself somewhat discontented with the direction I took with it. I am now in the process of planning out and writing up a new and improved version of this fic. As an introduction however, in the wake of the upheaval affecting Harry\u2019s life he and Hermione come to the conclusion that fleeing Britain might be in their best interests. This will lead them abroad, where they will find some things and people they did not ever expect to meet. Ultimately this should be a globe trotting adventure series.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow then, just a quick head\u2019s up. Polls will be open and valid precisely one week from when they are opened. This is to give me a greater period of time to write something in each month. I anticipate most chapters posted will be between 8-12 thousand words in length. However as my writing capabilities become more solid this estimate will likely rise.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo more matters. Hiatuses and potential future works. Hiatuses first I fear.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNumber 48 Rebirth:\u003c/strong\u003e This fic is NOT dead. It is however slated for rewrite. The problem, however, lies in the fact that at present other works and ideas are dominating my imagination preventing me from even getting any real planning done on this story. This will hopefully change as things progress.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for potential future works\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn \u003cstrong\u003eAS YET UNNAMED Lord of the Rings/ Hobbit Fic\u003c/strong\u003e: I am currently betwixt in between about whether or not this should be a crossover with Harry Potter. Regardless this story will be based more on the Movie canons than on the books as I feel more well acquainted with the movies and feel I could do them justice better. If such a story would interest you, feel free to drop me a line to discuss it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn \u003cstrong\u003eAS YET UNNAMED Warhammer 40K/Rogue Trader RPG Fic:\u003c/strong\u003e This fic has been nagging me at the edge of my mind for quite some time. I love the 40K universe in all its \u2018Grim Dark\u2019 grittiness. And would love to write up a story following the adventures, trials and tribulations of a young Rogue Trader newly entered into the Koronus Expanse. If such a story would interest you, feel free to drop me a line to discuss it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn \u003cstrong\u003eAS YET UNNAMED Fallout Fic:\u003c/strong\u003e I love the world of Fallout, which is at turns achingly poignant, grim and gritty, or goofy in the extreme. I was thinking of writing either a story which follows the Sole Survivor upon exiting Vault 111, or which deals with the aftermath of the in game events of Fallout 4. If such a story would interest you, feel free to drop me a line to discuss it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn \u003cstrong\u003eAS YET UNNAMED Harry Potter/Dragon Age Fic:\u003c/strong\u003e Basically similar in premise to \u2018Into The Black\u2019, however would involve Harry and \u2018potentially\u2019 Hermione being stranded in Thedas instead. If such a story would interest you, feel free to drop me a line to discuss it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Finally! An \u003cstrong\u003eAS YET UNNAMED Battlestar Galactica/Star Gate Fic:\u003c/strong\u003e Basically something tips off the Colonials about an upcoming attack by the Cylons and put the Colonies on a course to meeting the Tau\u2019ri of Earth. If such a story would interest you, feel free to drop me a line to discuss it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE NOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e A time may come in the future that the above listed potential works may be featured in a poll in which I will select which to begin working on. However, this will likely be after I\u2019ve finished at least one of the above works in progress.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also post general story ideas and concepts here on Patreon, this is in the hope of receiving feedback on such things from any who decide to show an interest. PMing me via Patreon should be more than sufficient means to contact me. If not, I may provide an alternate way to reach me in future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGOALS \u0026amp; Donations:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI will begin by saying, I do not and WILL NOT require donations as the price of ensuring I produce a chapter. As I feel this comes uncomfortably close to making money off of the fictional works created by others. It may not be illegal, but it feels a mite\u2026underhanded to me. So the, why am I asking for donations? Simply put I am asking for donations to help me free up time to follow my passion (writing) and the means by which to purchase the things in my life which make creativity flow more easily. Things like books, pieces of art, movies, video games etc. It will also relieve some of my financial and otherwise every day burdens. The more I have to focus on making ends meet the less I can focus on writing. Goals will be simple milestones to help keep track of this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion: Thank you for coming here. And if you\u2019ve decided to support my work, I can only offer my heartfelt thanks. Regardless I wish you all a fantastic 2018!\u003c/p\u003e"
