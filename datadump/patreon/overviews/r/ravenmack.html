    "summary": "There\u2019s no\nreal way to pigeonhole (what the fuck is a \u201cpigeon hole\u201d anyways?) what it is I\ndo as a creative person. I have called myself and been referred to by others as\na writer, an artist, a rapper, philosopher, poet, and all of that sort of morphed\ntogether in the current online bio I use where I say I am a mystic\npoet-philosopher. But all current online bios are complete bullshit for the\nmost part. What I am is something real, and always changing, and not really\nthat easy to find a pigeon hole and stuff it in there.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHistorically,\nI have been a non-traditional publisher, putting out my own zines, books,\nthrowing things up inside the internet in my long-running website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.rojonekku.com\"\u003ewww.rojonekku.com\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"http://www.ravenmack.com\"\u003ewww.ravenmack.com\u003c/a\u003e) in a constant and varied\nfrenzy of self-expression. I simultaneously love the immediate freedom of the\ndigital realm (and have been stabbing it with my writings since the early days\nof an internet) but also hate how unreal that digital realm feels sometimes. My\ninclination is to say \u201cfake\u201d but that\u2019s not really the proper term, so unreal\nworks better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat I do\nthrough Rojonekku Word Fighting Arts is my work, meaning it is what I love to\ndo. It is constantly evolving, and I\u2019ve never really been able to fully embrace\nmy work because there\u2019s always this notion of somehow a meritocracy exists and\nyou are supposed to be rewarded for your work if it is good, so long as it fits\nthe accepted pigeonholes of artistic tradition. The strange thing about that is\nthere is a longer tradition of artistic self-expression in whatever the fuck\nform that explodes out people\u2019s heart as than there is a tradition of getting\npaid for it. Even this constant notion I\u2019ve had that, if I am a writer I have\nto write a novel is kinda ridiculous, because novels are fairly young form of\nwriting in the grand scheme of things. But they fit the free market fetish\nsystem pretty well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnyways, fuck\nit all. I hate this fake ass meritocracy and fake ass system of having to seek\nvalidation for your artistic work by being accepted by traditional systems,\neven if those traditions brand themselves as progressive and non-traditional.\nFuck it all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the past\nfew years, I\u2019ve been going to a place called Dirtrock. I\u2019ve known it all my\nlife, actually grew up not far from it, but most of my youth was about\nsurvival, then escape once I hit 18, but in reconciling who I am as a complete\nperson, I\u2019ve had to go back there. So I\u2019ve been going to Dirtrock a lot. It\u2019s a\nfucked up place, but it\u2019s also beautiful. I am ill at ease saying this next\npart, but I am going to attempt to document Dirtrock.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nStreet/back\nroad cultural anthropology (or trash culture anthropology) is not easy, because\nthe academic/scientific side of things has this lie it tells itself that it has\nto be removed and observe with entirely unbiased objective mentality. This\nfeels impossible to me, but I also tend to think with my heart a lot more than\nmy brain, definitely more so lately as I reconcile the entirety of who I am.\nBut that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do, I guess, is document Dirtrock.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you choose\nto support whatever it is I am doing, thank you. If you have supported in the\npast, thank you. It is all very much appreciated. I know I\u2019m a chaotic mess of\ncreative explosions, but that\u2019s a direct result of the totality of who I am \u2013\nthe complete Raven Mack, working to be holistic as fuck without any fucks given\nfor those that would use any devil metrics to deny me validation as a human\nbeing manifesting the southern gothic futurism that is in my heart, and that my\neyes have seen, deeply. So if you step into this thing to see what it\u2019s about,\nWelcome to Dirtrock.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Raven Mack is an American mongrel mystic poet-philosopher of the Greater Appalachian tradition. He established the Rojonekku Word Fighting Arts academy in his native Southside Virginia, as a means of turning self-destructive recklessness into outwardly expressed word arts meant to empower the uncomfortable, but done so in a way that seems like nonsense gibberish, since devils can\u0027t understand it. Understanding the beast of a pyramid scheme of finance we all live under will never be satisfied, and that this particular form of \"marketing\" himself is ultimately depressing and compromising his true power as a writer, he still undertakes the activity as part of the kayfabe theater of chasing \"The American Dream.\" If you see him, holler at him; his best stories and poems are never written but told, in small circles, scattered like dandelion seeds, to hopefully grow in the cracks of the seven million walls civilization has built around us in every direction. Being they can\u0027t maintain all the walls, the Rojonekku way is to hope the dandelions take root in the cracks, like a middle finger wiggling back and forth, increasing the cracks, until this entire mess falls apart and down and decays back down to dust within freshly fertilized soil. Raven Mack also has dimples, and a beard, and a chip-toothed smile just for you. Yes, you. But not those fucking devils.",
