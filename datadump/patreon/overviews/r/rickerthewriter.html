You\u0027re most likely here thanks to the short stories/flash fiction I write on Reddit occasionally, so I think it\u0027s only fair I let you know a bit more about me and my passion for writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally from a small town in the San Bernardino mountains, I was originally inspired to become a writer thanks to my second grade teacher who bound together a short story I\u0027d written for class into a small book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than anything else, this ignited my passion for writing and publishing books. I spent the next twenty-odd years learning everything I could to become an author. My\u00a0greatest hope is to write something worth reading. The results of my efforts so far, are available on Amazon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not just a writer.
