Well quite frankly I don\u0027t! However, if you do like my videos and want me to make even more then with each pledge you help me to do so. If you cannot afford to pledge and yet still want to support me, then by continuing to watch my stuff you are doing so and I really do appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what videos are those?\u003c/strong\u003e Well I\u0027ve been making random DOTA2, videos for a while now but have recently started looking into casting. This includes my series \u003cstrong\u003eTales from the trench \u003c/strong\u003ewhich most of my viewers would know me from. I\u0027ve also casted the first \u003cstrong\u003emonthly all bots tournament\u003c/strong\u003e and I am super excited to cast Decembers one as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would i do with the money?\u003c/strong\u003e Well It allows me to focus more time on my videos, with your support I will also setup a regular live stream schedule for casting and playing Dota! Your support also allows me to take less hours at my job, its not fancy work but its part time around my university and allows me to pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had various other ideas for video series ideas from: My own hero guides, to coaching people and song parodies! But like with all things a matter of time constraints means that somethings never leave the concept stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you interested I am currently sitting at just over 5K MMR (Currently 5,200 but expect it to drop) and have been playing DOTA2 since \u003ca href=\"http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1183948\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e2011-12-08\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and if you decide to pledge then you are a true hero.\u003c/strong\u003e"
