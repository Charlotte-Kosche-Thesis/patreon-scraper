    "summary": "Hi, most of you will know me as the RC Tractor Guy from my YouTube channel which has been growing steadily over the last few months. I\u0027ve also been documenting my model making journey with the \u003ca href=\"http://rctractorguy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erctractorguy.com\u003c/a\u003e website since 2012. The RC Tractors website and my YouTube channel are all\u00a0about adding radio controlled functionality to static diecast models.\u00a0The models I convert can be farm or construction models and I try to add every function that the real machine has (if I can fit the electronics in). Most of the models require more functions than can be provided cheaply with standard RC components or the components are too big for 1:32 scale models so I try to design systems that anyone can make cheaply themselves. I base my designs on cheap, readily available Ardiuno boards so that with the minimum of effort anyone can learn to create detailed RC models. Here is an example of some of my creations, a radio controlled 1:32 scale John Deere 8360RT model with a Krampe Half-Pipe working alongside the Siku Control 32 models of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I37_SPSZA2o\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMoneydarragh Farm and Agri Contractors\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AuqzgKGGvTQ?list=PLUj9h6OpibZnKyv0s8QfPUQW-7omHJeZV\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI recently invested in a 3D printer which is making the builds a little simpler but it takes a lot of trial and error to get the models perfected. A benefit of being a patrons is you will have access to my perfected 3D printed files. I try to design them so that you need to do minimal modifications to your store bought model, in most cases just undo a few screws and bolt in the 3D printed parts. Here is an example of a Kane silage trailer conversion I\u0027ve been working on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjgdQe-rzwU?list=PLUj9h6OpibZlgHZY_KjUd1VS0peb2AJON\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m also working on designs for new PCBs and kits which can be used to build RC tractors. I\u0027m working on an RC controller using an NRF24L01 radio module, two joystick and four sliding potentiometers which should be able to control everything from a tractor with a round bale wrapper to a to an excavator. Here is an early prototype. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2l9xXlia88?list=PLUj9h6OpibZmahdcAS9H8yGvVSqcOjW4H\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA more challenging design I\u0027m working on is a controller design which will have two xbox joysticks and two sliding potentiometers to control the RC models we create. Finally I have an idea for an Arduino based board with inbuilt motor driver to fit inside these small scale models making the RC conversion process much easier.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePatronage breakdown\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you decide to become a patron then your donation will help to cover a lot of expenses associated with the website and the youtube channel but a simple way to look at it would be to think of the Youtube channel only. A $1 per month donation is spread over a minimum of 4 RC conversion videos per month so you are\u00a0spending maximum $0.25 per video. That\u0027s a total annual spend of $12 (~10 euro) for a minimum of 52 videos or more than 520 minutes of footage.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo I need to pay to see your videos now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo, you wont have to pay to see any of my content it will always be freely available to anyone who wants it. You can watch the videos, read the blog or website and use the forum all for free. This is simply an opportunity for those who find the content entertaining or informative to help support its creation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow will my donation help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour donation will primarily help with the expenses associated with hosting \n\u003ca href=\"http://rctractorguy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://rctractorguy.com/\u003c/a\u003e and the editing and uploading of at least one video per week to the RC Tractor Guy youtube channel.\u00a0\nWith increased funds I can invest in more expensive models for future videos for example see if a Wiking model can easily be converted without destroying the model or try to convert harvester models.\u00a0\nI can purchase a wider range of motors, servos or electronics to review for example boards designed to expand the functionality of control 32 models.\nI can purchase SIKU Control 32 models to disassemble and discuss adding additional LEDs or new features.\u00a0\nI can design and test PCBs for RC conversion as I will have the funds to order the components and tools to properly develop the boards. If this really took off I might even be able to get custom motors designed and manufactured which would fit into the models easily and have a choice of speeds and torques to your different models. In particular a dual motor set up which would mean we could imitate a differential and improve the turning circle of our models. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for watching\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThanks to all you guys who watch the videos and visit my website. I enjoy making the videos and running the website so with any luck I\u0027ll be able to do it for a long time to come. Hopefully I\u0027ll be talking to some of you on the forum so until then as always thanks for watching.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOisin"
