    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi there!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Jordynne, and I like to make jewellery, and stream on Twitch. Sometimes I even do both at the same time.\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, I recycle old jewellery into new jewellery, and use recycled materials as often as I can so they stay out of landfills. I am slowly working on becoming a no-waste household by reducing my garbage, Recycling what I can, and reusing what I can. Jewellery is one of those things that can be reused fairly easily, which is why I chose to start there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think everything has a story, and jewellery is no exception! If a piece of jewellery is broken and thrown out, it ends that story, but if a piece of jewellery gets broken and someone takes those pieces and repairs the jewellery or makes something new out of them, that story continues. I\u0027m just the semicolon. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI value transparency, and individuality, and try to showcase these values with everything I do. I don\u0027t want to be a business, putting up a front and not being myself in front of people. I\u0027d rather just be an \u003cem\u003eindividual\u003c/em\u003e who happens to make interesting things. I\u0027m not a corporation, and I won\u0027t act like one. I am human, and I have my own experiences, faults, and opinions, and you are welcome to \u003cem\u003eall of it\u003c/em\u003e. Most of my jewellery is one of a kind, save for a few pieces. It\u0027s \nsomething I value, and something I want to pass on to \nothers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I doing?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e-Well, I make jewellery. First and foremost, I make jewellery. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere am I getting my materials?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-I get my materials from old jewellery that was broken or unwanted, either in the big bags of jewellery from the thrift store or from pieces that were given to me by friends who had jewellery they didn\u0027t want anymore for whatever reason. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy isn\u0027t my jewellery 100% recycled if I value that so much?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-My jewellery isn\u0027t 100% recycled for a few reasons, the first and most important being hygiene. All of my earrings have brand new earring hooks, usually made of Iron and always nickel free. Also, stringing material can\u0027t really be recycled, for the most part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you watch me make jewellery?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-YES! I stream fairly regularily on Twitch, and I usually stream my jewellery making on Thursdays, sometimes Fridays. Feel free to drop in and say hi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading my profile, and if you\u0027ve got any questions, feel free to send me a message!"
