    "summary": "Hi, folks! I\u0027m a disabled Northern Tradition shaman, and something of a religious renunciate. I\u0027m also a writer and activist. To me, changing the world in as many ways as I can is more important than making money, and with a chronic illness I can\u0027t work a full-time job anyway. But I do work ... all the time. I\u0027ve put out 39 books (and counting!) and I try to get out at least one book a year, in many different genres. Some of you know me through Pagan religious work, some through my work with the kink and M/s communities, some through transgender and polyamory activism, some through my discussions of disability or even organic farming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the current 2014 Northeast Master and I\u0027m putting in a lot of time this year with my partner Joshua, traveling and educating on spiritual BDSM and power dynamic relationships, as well as polyamory, transgender issues, and of course Pagan stuff - astrology, shamanism, and polytheistic theology. I maintain websites with hundreds of shrines to my Gods, getting something like a hundred virtual candles and prayers a day. I make Pagan prayer beads for people who need help praying, I see clients for shamanic work from demographics that no one else will touch, I am an activist for everything I am and believe in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live on a little homestead with my poly family of disabled kinky queers, counseling and helping as many people as I can, given my limited time and spoons. I\u0027m worth supporting, because I\u0027ll keep doing this work anyway ... but I\u0027d like to be able to do it with just a little less financial panic, so please consider sending me a buck a month. I\u0027m a damn good investment ... watch my dust!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ravenkaldera.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.ravenkaldera.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.northernshamanism.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.northernshamanism.org/welcome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.northernshamanism.org/welcome.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.paganbdsm.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.paganbdsm.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
