    "summary": "Hey Guys, thanks for checking out our Patreon Page. \u00a0Revolving Door Productions is an independent film production company that is devoted to making great films and telling great stories. We would love you to join us on our journey and help us bring these films to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe plan to bring you some amazing films that you\u0027ll enjoy watching as much as we enjoy making them! We want you to love them so much that you need to share these films with all of your friends and family. But if you still feel that just isn\u0027t enough for you and that somehow you wish you could contribute more, then you\u0027re in luck! You could support us by becoming a patron of ours, which would be wonderful, but not expected. However if you do become a patron we promise to give you some extra goodies as a huge thank you for your support. Expect things like behind the scenes interviews, \u0027making of\u0027 videos, blooper reels, early access to our blogs, hi-res wallpapers and plenty of other fun and exclusive items of awesomeness that I am sure will pop up as we make our movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a lot of films planned for the future which is something we will never rush. A good script takes time and to film it at a standard we will be happy with also takes a lot of planning, but we are positive you will be happy with the end results.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for dropping by :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
