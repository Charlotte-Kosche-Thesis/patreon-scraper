    "summary": "I\u0027m James Sharp, a comic artist/painter/doodler from Vancouver, Canada. I like the history of poster design, moral uncertainty, and toast with at least three spreads.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been reading comics since I could read anything and wanting to make them for about as long. The first comic I ever tried to make was a super hero, I\u0027m pretty sure he had a black suit with a star on it and punched stuff; seven is a very direct age. There\u0027s been a lot of detours between here and there, but now I\u0027m back at it. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic I\u0027m making is Rashabar, an adventure set in an alternate history, mostly cause it seemed like a good cover for airships and art deco aesthetics. I\u0027d tell you all about it but Jesus, spoilers! I would get just roasted in the comments. But it\u0027s an adventure, and there\u0027s some mystery, and some strange, strange happenings. It\u0027s not meant to be too serious, we\u0027ll have to see about funny. It updates every month with 5 pages, more if I can swing it. I really hope you all come along for the ride.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work a few day jobs, and that\u0027s fine, but some day I\u0027d really love to be able to spend all my time getting the stories in my head out on to paper. This seems like a great way to start reaching for that, with all of your help. So thanks for swinging by and having a look and whether you support me here or not, I hope you pop over to Rashabar.com and give it a read. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJames"
