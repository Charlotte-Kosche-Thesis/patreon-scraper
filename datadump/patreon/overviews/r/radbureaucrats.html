    "summary": "Welcome to the Radical Bureaucrats Podcast and Op-Ed Column, where a bunch of young, policy nerds discuss in-depth about important public policy issues of the day, as well as a bit about the trending news that is rocking the political world on a near-constant basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\nformed the Radical Bureaucrats because we believed that those of us that had\npolicy expertise that also believed in a progressive vision for society failed\nto articulate that vision to a large portion of the populace in a meaningful\nway, which contributed to the election of elected officials that systematically deny reality, pander to bigots, and seek to funnel wealth to the top 1%. We believe we can address that problem by becoming a bridge between the\nwealth of policy knowledge that exists, and the needs and concerns of everyday Americans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe seek to build a sustainable, progressive movement by educating members of the public and mobilizing them to advocate and enact policies that benefit the many, not the few.\u003c/strong\u003e The Radical Bureaucrats Podcast is the very first step in that lofty process, and your support will provide the crucial foundation we need to see that vision to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo thank you for your commitment to a just, equitable, and progressive America.\u003c/strong\u003e We hope that you enjoy this journey as much as we do.
