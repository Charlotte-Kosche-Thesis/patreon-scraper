    "summary": "Thanks for dropping by.\u00a0I\u0027m Reanimated Boy (or Ben to you).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing songs for the last six years and saw some success when I had a couple of them released on CD compilations. I\u0027ve remixed electronic band Parralox and had my music featured on a documentary too. More recently I had the track Reanimated Boy played on BBC introducing in the UK. You can hear some of my music in the video above, skip to 4:24 to jump past me talking and hear the music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the idea of connecting with people through music and I\u0027d like to have you along for the ride. If you choose to support me through Patreon you\u0027ll have the opportunity to help me choose single releases, listen to songs in progress and lots more. What\u0027s more you only pay when I release something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked. Patreon is a site where you can support artists on an ongoing basis. If you\u0027ve never heard of it before don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s a reputable platform and transactions are handled safely and securely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe music industry is in a bit of a state right now. The transition from physical to digital releases has been complicated especially for the people who are actually making the music. It has become more and more difficult for artists to make a living doing what they love. For me Patreon offers stability, both financially and emotionally. Knowing that you are there fills me with that warm fizzy feeling you get when you see an old friend or eat cake (I like cake). It also really helps to know what return I\u0027m getting from the work I do, in fact it is incredibly helpful when considering things like new equipment I need to buy, how much artwork or videos will cost to produce and lots of other boring stuff that you probably don\u0027t need to hear. \u003cbr\u003eThink of it like this - you\u0027ve committed to buy my release in advance and in the process we get to know each other and you get some extra perks thrown in too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePayment\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere\u0027s how it works. You\u0027ll only get charged your pledge amount at the end of any month I release something. So for example, if I release a song on the 10th of March, you\u0027ll get billed your pledge amount at the end of March/beginning of April. My Patreon is set up so that you only pay when I release music and I\u0027m aiming to keep this to one release a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is the pledge\u00a0amount\u00a0in dollars?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site is based in the America so the amount shows in dollars by default. This will automatically be converted into your currency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that answers the important questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for stopping by and if you choose to pledge then THANK YOU so much! It really is appreciated and I look forward to getting to know you all and sharing my music with you. See you inside!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReanimated Boy\u003cbr\u003e"
