Just see us as that slightly annoying guy down the pub that read the whole article rather than the headline. Also there is banter. An insufferable amount of banter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time of writing we\u0027ve been cultivating this community for over 90 episodes (plus an earlier video series) and endured four years, two general elections, two referendums and a shit ton of leadership changes. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd we need your help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re not backed by advertising or a larger media company, and have sunk nearly \u00a31,000 into this podcast over the last few years.\u003c/strong\u003e Not to mention the time it takes to record, book guests, buy and replace equipment and edit, all on a weekly basis. In order for us to be able to keep this going, we need your help. By help we mean money. Give us money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you can afford or think is worth it, please pledge what you can. Check out the rewards available, from merchandise (MUGS!!!) to shoutouts to exclusive content, hopefully there\u0027s something that will tickle your pickle. We\u0027ll love you forever, be it $1 or $100. ($100/ episode is not currently an option, but marriage will probably be on the cards).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all the support over the past few years. We appreciate you no end and love making this podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
