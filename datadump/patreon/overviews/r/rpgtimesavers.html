Let\u0027s face it, there are many people and projects vying for your attention and the fact that you chose to check out my Patreon makes me feel good. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what\u0027s this all about? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor as long as I can remember I have wanted to create gaming content that reflected my ideas and, if possible, make a little income from my efforts. However, like many people with that dream, I always found the thought of making that decision scary, but the decision has finally been made. In the past, I have dabbled in RPG freelancing and while I enjoyed it, I didn\u0027t feel I had the creative control I really wanted. Thus I have decided to finally break out on my own and see where it leads me. I hope you are ready to take this journey with me! \n\nAt this point, I am starting from the ground up and building my creative vision with me at the helm and being able to have the creative control I felt I lacked in the past. While I have a lot of ideas, I also have a lot of learning to do. This is why I am inviting people to join me at the dawning of this project. It\u0027ll give you a chance to see my creative process and design ideas; while at the same time I hope to also inspire others to be equally as creative.\n\nI guess I have rambled on enough for now. Again, I want to say thanks for stopping by!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
