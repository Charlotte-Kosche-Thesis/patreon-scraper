    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, art party animals! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Thank you for being here! This page was started by myself, Artist Nickhole Arcade. My partner Brian and I have been focusing all of our energy on being mentally and physically healthy, active, and bringing positivity, creativity, and community to the areas around us.\u00a0WE are RANGA! Welcome you to our Patreon campaign!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the place to sign up to gain complimentary access to RANGA art classes, win original art, prints and support free community and family art events at RANGA like art workshops, Repair Cafe Olympia, Art party and Paint nights!!! Being a Patron is kinda like having a season ticket AND box seats to every thing RANGA offers. You gain complimentary access to classes, field trips, and workshops at RANGA, win cool art, and get to weigh in your opinions and make suggestions in our Patron-only FaceBook closed group!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what IS Patreon? If you\u0027re just showing up here for the first time....here\u0027s the lowdown:\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a paycheck for artists like me, directly from people like you, known as \"Patrons\".\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of Nickhole\u0027s art\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eand / or want to support us at RANGA in the creation of new mindful art/ community events/ videos/ writing/ performance-art and more random, unpredictable art-things, this is the place. As you can see, the list above is pretty varied...and who knows what\u0027s next...graphic novels? kids\u0027 books? comics? podcasts? I\u0027m open. Most importantly... ART!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlright, so here\u0027s more detail about how being a Patron works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thank you for checking this out! I appreciate your consideration and support of the arts and the next generation of artists! To win art here, the only requirement is that you are a pledging Patron. Here\u0027s how being a Patron works:\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatrons choose a $ amount to pledge per post, choose rewards, and set a monthly maximum when they decide to become a Patron.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThroughout the month, I\u0027ll post art things (like a painting, article, community art project or video that I made) to Patreon, as an official paid post.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll of the art I create for this campaign (unless otherwise noted) is entered into the raffle collection!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon keeps track of my posts and your pledges, and does all the math.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon charges Patrons one time per month for the total amount resulting from posts x pledges.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon deposits pledges to my PayPal minus their respective percentages.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI use this deposited money as needed each month, securing the building, supplies, more seating, tables, equipment, and covering the many details associated with production, publishing, Artparty! etc.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArtparty! is donated to the community in gratitude for all that the community has given us, and a spark of something we take with away with us from Artparty inspires more kindness, more creativity, and more love \u0026lt;3\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe drawings will be held live via Facebook EVERY FIRST FRIDAY OF THE MONTH!! Tune in to see what you won!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpon pledging, Patrons receive an invitation to join a closed FB group that is for Patrons of this campaign only. Patrons weigh in on opinion polls, suggest topics for weekly expression, and stay abreast of campaign direction\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach week we create new art things.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eArt Things are comprised of drawings, paintings, videos, community art projects, events and articles, and are usually posted 3-5x per week. I gravitate towards posting on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Sometimes I miss days, and sometimes I post ten things in a row, but no worries! I will post a maximum of 20 paid posts per month. \u00a0You can set your monthly limit, and it\u0027s very important to do this especially at hugher tiers, so that no one is over extended. \u00a0I work in many styles, including acrylic paint on canvas as well as watercolor and ink on paper. Always positively themed in one way or another and the painting sizes are roughly 5\"x7\"- 8\"x10\"- and larger as supplies vary. I am all over the place making different things everyday, but I will paint a lot of these from things that I\u0027ve already spent hours drawing. You can expect Nature, Buddhist imagery, mermaids, some pop culture icons, dot work, tattoo flash, and the rest will be a surprise! If you pledge twenty or more dollars you can even pick a topic for me to express!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e12+ times per year, I throw a Free, all-ages event called Art Party!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eArt party happens every First Friday at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://therangahouse.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe RANGA house\u003c/a\u003e. This is a special party where anyone regardless of income, age or ability can show up and make art. Artpartiers may come either empty-handed or with a piece in progress. Then, Artpartiers join to work individually on an art project of their choice, and use the workshop space and available supplies for free. I love to paint, and I enjoy helping people realize that they don\u0027t have to \"be an artist\" to enjoy the feeling or therapeutic benefits of doing something creative!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow your pledge helps:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI continue offering:\u003cbr\u003eFree Artparty monthly, higher quantities and quality art supplies to align with current funding, fresh swag, paintings for collectors, and a few surprises that are still top secret.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003eTo do this, I must humbly ask for your support. In return I will be able to continue sharing.That said, I really appreciate you reading this. Thank you for your love and support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow you win ORIGINAL ART ((updated!! please read!!))\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEVERY PATRON WINS EVERY MONTH!! Each patron gets ONE raffle ticket in the monthly First Friday art giveaway lottery to decide the order in which patrons will select their original art rewards. For example if you pledge $1 per post, you get one raffle ticket in the drawing. LIKEWISE, if you pledged a million dollars per post, you also get one ticket in the drawing! This is just an extra \"thank you\" for supporting art by tipping me pledges to do with what I will. You aren\u0027t buying raffle tickets. I\u0027m giving them to you to say thanks for supporting RANGA, Repair Cafe, Paint night and of course Art party!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I know I won?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust by being a patron, you are guaranteed to win original art, stickers, prints and more every month!\u00a0On the first Friday of each month at 11:11 am PST, I will draw EVERY Patron\u0027s name. Each Patron has their choice of Art that has been made as a result of this campaign! That means you choose the art! This is super fun for me and kinda like Vegas for you, except the $$$ is being used to help support the peripheral and substantial costs surrounding Artparty! Thank you for your generosity!! We started filming the lotteries starting in November!! You can find out that you won by watching the video!! ( I will also e-mail you congratulations and collect your shipping details, just in case you missed the good news!)"
