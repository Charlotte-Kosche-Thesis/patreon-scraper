    "summary": "Hello everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Remy, I am a 19 years old girl who loves singing, drawing and using her skills with \u003cstrong\u003edifferent languages\u003c/strong\u003e to write some lyrics for (mostly) video-game music related stuff.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 I launched my \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube \u003c/strong\u003echannel in which I started posting some covers of video-game music and some original lyrics to let ever more people enjoy this kind of hobbies that I always had.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/RemyFive05\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRemyFive\u003c/a\u003e used to be the \u003cstrong\u003emain channel\u003c/strong\u003e of my entire project, until \u003cem\u003eJune 2016\u003c/em\u003e, when I finally decided to start even my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MBtq9xaQfEAY58PTzw7Lw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esecond channel\u003c/a\u003e which is \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely\u003c/strong\u003e Touhou Project related. I always loved the Touhou series in particular, and I always wanted to be brave enough to start my own activity in the creative community of that fandom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always tried to make both my hobbies and my ordinary life and work match, and after acing a series of obstacles, I managed to create an ever-growing community of people who, professionally or amateurly, share with me (and with you) this great love for videogames, music and anime illustrations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil today, I always tried to do my best in order to offer to all my subscribers and followers good and pleasant contents, without asking for any kind of payment or financial support for it.\u003cbr\u003eDuring\u00a0the past, I also declined some sponsorship offers, which would have, on one hand, allow me to make my business more economically sustainable, and on the other one, would have forced me to bend my contents to the sponsor\u0027s economic needs. I refused any kind of similar support until now because, if I do what I do, it is in order to be free to create what suits best my sensibilities, my goals and my desires.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately, I am finding very hard to find the time to dedicate myself to my channels and to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://remyfive.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edeviantART page\u003c/a\u003e since I started working a lot in my private daily life in order to maintain myself on my own.\u00a0The \"finished work\" that you can see on my pages is only a small percentage of what is for real behind a video or an artwork: the study and preparation of them take away also weeks sometimes; writing certain kind of lyrics for videos is meticulous and not always immediate; recording, editing and post-production are hours and hours of my time being spent (happily, because I love doing it) without having to occupy that time in many other different ways. All those \"direct\" revenues from Youtube (ads) do not even cover this time so well spent, and this, slowly, is becoming a problem, also because\u003cstrong\u003e I can\u0027t monetize many of my contents\u003c/strong\u003e due to copyright issues that may begin doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is combined with the ever-increasing demand for new specific kind of contents and requests of artworks for private or public use. Until now, I have tried to make all your desires come true, but it is becoming more and more difficult every time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all these reasons, I decided to launch this Patreon, whose goal is clear:\u003cbr\u003eTo allow my web projects to be economically viable without having to give up on my freedom to express what I want, and also to provide you some services that today I could not give you except for an economic exchange: a better quality for both audio, video and artworks; and continuous microfinance on your part is the happiest road I can take to achieve this;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWARNING\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis idea is not an attempt to create Series A and Series B users! My contents will always be AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE. Anyone who can\u0027t donate won\u0027t receive something less than what I can offer today. I will not act in a logic of subtraction, but in one of expansion!\u003cbr\u003eEven the slightest effort will be rewarded with all the enthusiasm that I have, with all the excitement that I can put into this project that I want to bring to you and continue \u003cstrong\u003eONLY FOR YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e And if you can\u0027t donate, then please just help me by multiplying the share of my videos and contents so that other people can get in touch with this passion of mine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will support me :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
