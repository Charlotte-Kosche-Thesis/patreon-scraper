The stories have audience participation and interaction (I may ask fans to simply vote to decide what happens, or I might demand that they upload photos of cats to keep a character warm who would otherwise freeze). The subject of the story is different every time, but it\u0027s often funny, emotional, and sometimes dark. \u00a0Story Town series run for about a week (Monday through Friday) and \u00a0are PG-13 or lower.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStory Town needs your help, and I can\u0027t do it without you! Your subscription will allow me to devote more time to this unusual (and very time consuming) series. Every pledge at every level helps support Story Town. Think of your donation as a seed from which a painfully optimistic robot or disturbingly adorable panda-owl will grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a bonus, there is awesome and cool stuff for being a subscriber!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting at just $3 a month (the price of five gas station hot dogs, if you know where to go) you get behind the scenes content, sketches,\u00a0and additional art! For higher tiers of support, you can get awesome perks like membership in the Fan Club, exclusive comics, not-for-sale paintings and figures, and Red Rocket Farm store discounts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of fans like you,\u00a0Story Town is and always will be free. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
