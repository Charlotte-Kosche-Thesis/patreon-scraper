This will likely be a 3.5 year project and so much fun! \u00a0My recordings are me in my home studio to get the melodies down. \u00a0I will occasionally have guest musicians recording versions for special patron only recordings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you are new to Patreon here is the low down:\u003c/strong\u003e You are investing in the creative process and making it possible.. allowing me to have the funds to record and produce and the time to do the work. If you want me to keep doing this, invest in a cup of coffee or a glass of wine through Patreon :). \u00a0If you are interested in collaborating or hosting an event message me. My recordings are home studio raw because I want you to be part of the unfolding process from conception to full professionally mixed edit. \u00a0Hoping to get at least 3 albums worth of produced and studio recorded songs from the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll patrons will have early access \u00a0to hear a new original song inspired by the psalms each week. Some songs will be posted only to patrons. Early on I will post several to the public to generate interest. I envision a community being created and opportunities for live (and recorded) patron only conversation, bible study, and worship. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSend a message to this broken world that our diverse gifts, creativity, and authenticity are still valued and that a story of God\u0027s love will never be out of fashion.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease spread the word!
