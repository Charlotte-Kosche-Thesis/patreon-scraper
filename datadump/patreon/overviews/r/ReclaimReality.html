The bad news is that the task falls partially on Melinda, so she\u0027ll have to do her part to \"degauss\" parts of her brain, allowing the doctors to cleanse that area of the poison. To \"degauss\" these areas though, she\u0027ll have to defeat the things causing destruction throughout her brain. \u003cstrong\u003eW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eait, \u003cem\u003edestruction\u003c/em\u003e?

Things like the Frontal Lobe, Parietal Lobe, Temporal Lobe, Cerebellum, so on. \u003cstrong\u003eIn total, there\u0027s 9 separate areas the player can visit in their own brain, each with its own theme and multiple \"nodes\" in the brain to visit.\u003c/strong\u003e For example, the Frontal Lobe is a large, sprawling city full of life, whereas the Temporal Lobe is a quaint village in the forest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese areas were also picked to reflect the purpose of each portion of the brain (roughly); the Temporal Lobe, to use the same example, is where smells and sounds are processed, as well as long term memory, so a quaint village with a pie in the window and the birds chirping in the trees matches up with that just fine. (It, along with all the areas in the game also tie into Melinda\u0027s memories, but we won\u0027t say how just yet!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all that explained, let\u0027s get back to the point; each of these 9 areas is under attack by these machines hell-bent on destroying your brain. If they manage to get their way, then Melinda will suffer varying degrees of brain damage in each area. What does this mean for Melinda (and the player)?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, remember all that research? We found out what brain-based problems arise from having each part of said brain damaged, and then we picked the ones we could actually \u003cem\u003eincorporate into gameplay\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0for the game. So, for example, let\u0027s say you get damage to the Temporal Lobe. Well, now Melinda might have \"\u003cem\u003eProsopagnosia\"\u003c/em\u003e, which is an impairment in recognition of faces. This means that for as long as she has this (until you get it healed or it progresses to become even WORSE), \u003cstrong\u003eall the faces of characters you see in the game will be scrambled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnd that\u0027s just for starters; what happens if you let that damage to the Temporal Lobe get even worse? Well, then you might find yourself with \"\u003cem\u003eKl\u00fcver\u2013Bucy syndrome\u003c/em\u003e\", which isn\u0027t a fun time at all. Look that one up and you\u0027ll see what I mean; it, along with all the other conditions possible to have in the game for each area, are actual, real conditions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome other ones randomly picked off the list;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDeafness (all audio in the game will become muted, player will not receive text from people speaking)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDyslexia (all words on backgrounds and signs etc. will be reversed)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHallucinations (all backgrounds now have horrific alterations that blip in and out)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLack of ability to process facial emotions (all faces in-game are default faces)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCapgras Syndrome (all in-game characters seem like impostors to Melinda)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAgnosia (all tactile sensations become the same for Melinda)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConfabulation (making up memories/lying without conscious realization of it)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAnd so on. All of these will take place in real time, and will affect all conversations/environments/etc. within the game as well. If you get TOO messed up though, don\u0027t worry; we\u0027ll have a save and load feature just like any other Visual Novel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e============================================\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eFinally, the rewards!
