    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eThank you all for enjoying and interacting with our videos! We are so happy to have connected with so many awesome people around the country already!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis is a little bit about who we are, why we are doing this, and how we got to this point on the map.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI (Scott Pellegrino) was born and raised on Long Island in New York. Kayley Jaye is from Los Angeles, California. With us is our 9 year old rescue mutt; O.G. (Oscar the Grouch).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA WRECK:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI moved to Los Angeles with ambition and my Yamaha R1000 motorcycle in the summer of 2009. On July 28th, 2015, I was in a motorcycle wreck that broke my spine, right collar bone, left forearm and 5 ribs. I suffered a major head injury and was in a coma for 11 days. I had multiple surgeries, months of rehab, and continue to deal with the after affects of the injuries I sustained; including the 2 rods now fastened to my spine with the 12 screws that secure them to 6 of my vertebrae (T1-T6 fusion), the scar tissue and hardware used to rebuild the shattered bones in my left forearm, the two plates that put my collar bone back together, and the medical bills to take care of all these repercussions for the rest of my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut I\u0027m still here! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA split second, someone else\u2019s illegal left turn, and I almost died. My near death experience has given me clarity, has defined for me that living without happiness is not really living. Life is fleeting. And not in our control. I don\u0027t want to work another 14 hour day with the goal to make other people rich. I want joy. I want adventure. I want a Tiny House on Wheels to take me \u0026amp; Kayley to locations that are legendary and, more important, to locations that we haven\u0027t even heard of yet! Because I\u0027m still here, and the \u0027why\u0027 in that outcome is exciting and deserves to be explored!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA BUS CALLED NUMBER 93 aka ROLLWITHITBUS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI once traveled around California for half a year with a 31\u0027 travel trailer but decided a road trip this epic needed something bigger. I wanted a bus! So we did our research and discovered that The Skoolie Community is everywhere!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAN EPIC ROAD TRIP:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhen NUMBER 93 is fully converted, we roll with it to visit every state in the union, spending a minimum of 72 hours in each (including Alaska). Kayley and I have made a list of specific events and locations we have always wanted to experience, and it looks like hitting all 49 states will take us 11 to 12 months. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe want to immerse ourselves in the local flavor volunteering for community service and working alongside possible neighbors to experience the special qualities of each community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe\u0027ll be posting a VIDEO 4 days a week to our YouTube channel so our friends, family and YOU can follow along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut as all of YOU become part of our Roll With It Family, we are counting on YOU to invite, encourage, and suggest places we absolutely MUST visit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIs your town the coolest in your state?  In the country?  With a landscape and vibe that we\u2019ll never want to leave? Join the discussion on Facebook or YouTube. We\u2019re listening! Seriously! We will turn this bus around!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTHE VIDEOS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe started making videos and posting to YouTube.com/RollWithIt to document our bus to skoolie conversion and prepare for the road trio of a lifetime. We want to make sure we capture all the adventures, all the memories of meeting new people who we feel certain will become life-long friends and possibly even new neighbors! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe videos of our DIY, 2-person bus conversion have started--and the \u0027how to\u0027 part of the process is mostly comedic (though it was NOT intended to be!). But we\u0027re working side-by-side to get it done! Subscribe and check out our posts on the channel: youtube.com/rollwithit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eJoin us, comment on the YouTube.com/RollWithIt videos or @RollWithItBus on instagram or the Facebook (facebook.com/RollWithItBus) page! Just go ahead and talk to us. We\u0027d love to hear from you! We\u0027re looking to make new friends all over the country!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nPATREON LOVE:\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute any more to our wild adventures than simply watching our videos and interacting with us. We appreciate that alone. However, if you feel you can contribute a little something extra, it\u0027ll all go back into creating videos, keeping us on the road and buying OG a treat or two. Thanks so much for supporting us and being a part of our story!\u003cbr\u003e"
