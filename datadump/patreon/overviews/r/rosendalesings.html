    "summary": "Hi there, you must be new to my channel! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Brian and I go by the stage name of Rosendale. I am a singer and songwriter from San Francisco, California.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve stumbled across this page, you must be thinking about becoming a patron to my YouTube channel. In that case, \u003cstrong\u003elet me tell you a little bit about myself!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic has taken shape in various forms in my life;\u00a0I was the annoying kid who would never stop singing, the nerdy bandmate playing the clarinet, and the quirky a cappella singer with a passion for dance.\u00a0After college, music became a full-time hobby; I began posting videos regularly to YouTube, with content ranging from solo acoustic covers to large-scale a cappella collaborations. I love putting an acoustic spin on an EDM banger, vlogging about my music life, or coming up with my own original songs.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAll of my videos are self-produced through Logic and Final Cut Pro\u003c/strong\u003e, and I have a blast doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently pursuing music-making full-time, but it took me awhile to get there. \u003cstrong\u003eI used to be a tax accountant.\u003c/strong\u003e That\u0027s right! A tax accountant. \u00a0I worked anywhere from 60 to 70 hours a week, but every day, I would write and record songs in my closet or edit YouTube videos on the train ride home. One day I thought to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m living a very fulfilling life\u201d. \u003cstrong\u003eSo I decided to quit my job to make music. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since then, I\u2019ve been writing, recording, and filming all of the songs and videos you see on my channel. It\u0027s a ton of fun, but it\u0027s not always easy to support myself and improve my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where your support comes in - \u003cstrong\u003eevery dollar that you contribute on Patreon will be paying for either the production of my music videos, buying better recording and filming equipment, marketing and promotion, and more!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my ultimate goals is to promote awareness of Asian-American talent within the landscape of the American entertainment industry. I, or rather, we, need your help to challenge stereotypes and help Asian Americans get on TV, film, and on stage. Your contributions will help me create better content, and my hope is that my successes will \u003cstrong\u003einspire others to create videos and open doors for other musicians\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content will always be free for everyone, but if you want to help me create bigger and better videos, \u003cstrong\u003eplease become a Patron and pledge!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support, and I\u0027ll see you in my next video!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrian (Rosendale)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.rosendalemusic.com/\"\u003ehttps://www.rosendalemusic.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
