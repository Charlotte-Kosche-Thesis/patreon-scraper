    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHistoric food for the modern world\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoot was born from a deep love. A love for community has driven all \nmy work across many fields: as a cook, as a professor, a museum curator,\n and as an artist. Everyone eats, and connecting people with their food \nalso connects us to each other.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut it was my love for history and for cooking that gave me the keys \nto build community. These intertwined loves have followed me all my \nlife, popping up in unexpected places, and sending me on journeys of \nexpansion and discovery.\u003cbr\u003e\nMany people I talk to crave the same understanding: they want to feel\n connected to their food, they want to use it to connect to others, and \nthey want to use it to understand themselves and their own place in \nhistory. However, the prospect of diving in to the study of food history\n feels intimidating, and they often don\u2019t know where to start. How do \nyou research this stuff? What if you have trouble understanding the \nrecipes? What if you only barely know your way around the kitchen?\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to make the history of food feel approachable to everyone, \nfrom the novice who\u2019s rarely turned on the stove to the accomplished \ncook who is craving something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://rootkitchens.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/dsc_0586.jpg?w=1050\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal is to expand the community of food history to include you: \nwhether you\u2019re just looking for some new things to cook or looking for a\n starting point on a path to deeply understand your food, you\u2019re welcome\n in this community. Here is a space to build up your skills, to discover\n a new passion, and to, if you want, branch off on your own path of \nlearning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoot is more than just recipes. Root is also built on stories. Each \nweek, I send Root members some favorite historic recipes, modified to \nspeak to modern kitchens and modern ingredients. I use my knowledge as a\n researcher and a teacher to tell you about where they came from, and \nhow they connect to us in the modern world. The longer you\u2019re a part of \nthe Root community, the more those stories build upon themselves, \nhelping you see the food you make as a part of a larger interconnected \nand complex web of history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI use this same passion to inform my work with organizations and \ncreative professionals. I love the history of food, and recognize its \ncentrality in every aspect of our lives. If you want to see how to work \nwith me more closely on a project, you can go \u003ca href=\"https://root-kitchens.com/collaborate/\"\u003ehere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs root grows, the vision of community building grows too. Root\u2019s \nnext stages will include an online space for discussing recipes and food\n history with the rest of the community, classes, community dinners, \nfood history events, and more. Eventually, Root will reach even farther \nby bringing food education and creative engagement through art and \ncooking to underserved communities, sharing the healing power of food, \ncombined with art and storytelling, with the people who need it most. \n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s an exciting journey, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://rootkitchens.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/dsc_0479-e1521483399447.jpg?w=650\u0026amp;h=722\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
