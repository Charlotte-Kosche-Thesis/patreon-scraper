    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBrett Stuart, author of Remote Viewing: The Complete Guidebook and founder of Technical Intuition (previously Troika Group) is dedicated to the promotion and\napplication of the \u201cconsciousness hacking\u201d tool known as Remote Viewing, sometimes referred to as non-local perception. With nearly 10 years of experience developing and harnessing structured remote viewing techniques in real-world problem-solving situations, Brett has decided to begin sharing some of these experiences in his new podcast series - Stories from the Matrix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are seismic shifts occurring in the distribution and\ncost-efficiency of neurotechnology which will eventually democratize access to\nthe precise measurement of altered states of consciousness. This trend is very\nmuch akin to the personal computer revolution that occurred in the 1980s. I\nbelieve that with the commodification and consumerization of neurotechnology,\nmeasuring one\u0027s state of consciousness is going to be as effortless as wearing a\nFitbit. However, with this data comes large responsibility. The relatively\nfringe sub-culture of \"consciousness hacking\" in Silicon Valley\nempowers us with evidence that there continues to exist a high level of\ninterest in society to experiment with and achieve altered states of\nconsciousness.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Non-local perception?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNon-local perception has been unendingly studied and validated in\nlaboratory and operational environments, especially by the intelligence\ncommunity in both the U.S.A and the former Soviet Union. It continues to have\nits detractors, skeptics and charlatans who continue to deprive the field of\nany valid form of inquiry separate from dogma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the technology landscape continues to evolve, I believe that we are\nreaching an inflexion point as individuals continue to experiment with hacking\ntheir consciousness. With the coming of neurotech devices, I believe\nthat  the spirit of experimentation and\ninterest in altered states will only continue to accelerate. Much sooner rather\nthan later, natural intuitive and psi-based abilities will be measurable in\nhomes all over the world at tremendous speeds and scale. I believe it\u0027s important to ask, \"What can we do to accelerate the discovery of\nthese measurable altered states that can provide humanity with a view into our true nature?\" \u003cbr\u003e"
