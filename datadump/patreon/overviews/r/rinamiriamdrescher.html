Thank you so much for your interest in my Patreon campaign!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently started a shared creative space in the Hungerford Building named Studio Harpy: Artspace that I am running along with C.R. Jones. We are hoping that with it we can build a stronger sense of community for working Rochester area artists, and give up and coming artists an exciting new space to show their work. Join my Patreon community to find out more about how you can make an impact.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my paintings I typically depict people, animals, and elements of the natural world. I paint with both acrylic and oil. The Studio Harpy workspace provides significant ventilation for use of oil solvents.\u00a0I would like to expand my current projects into areas that are experimental and unfamiliar to me. I have been funding these experimental projects myself up to this point and appreciate the opportunity here on Patreon to reward those who can offer additional contributions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach of my projects will develop and grow in direct relation to the funding I am able to raise here for them. In return, I will send you some of the new and exciting artworks I\u0027m creating!\u263a\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you like what you see, please sign up for a rewards level and see to it that these projects develop further because you decided to take action and spur them along.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u261e \u261e \u261e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e"
