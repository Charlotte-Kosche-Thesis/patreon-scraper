Speaking out frankly about the good in \u0027occulture\u0027 as well as the bad and being practical where others often chose to be a little fantastical. \u00a0It has been about hand-crafting tools instead of buying or reselling items made under questionable conditions in massive factories. It has been, and will always be, about keeping myself centered on \u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e little sliver of \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e diagram. It\u0027s time to not only be the voice I wish I\u0027d heard, but to answer that call on a wider scale.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA small bump in the road to this goal is, as usual, fitting it all in. For over a decade I\u0027ve worked in a high-pressure field where personal time became more and more scarce, followed by a very serious \u0027career restructuring event\u0027 two years ago. This meant I had to take on additional jobs and\u00a0\u003cem\u003ethat \u003c/em\u003emeant a lot less creativity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhere do Patron Funds Go?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it says under \"Goals\", patrons will be helping me build and fund my workshop, a refuge where I can work and write without bothering or being bothered. This will cover repairs to the space itself, power/water, supplies and travel expenses. Having this space to work in means I can begin offering additional physical patron-perks, branching out into new areas of skill and creation, dipping a toe into audio and visual media like podcasts or tutorial videos (otherwise impossible in a noisy household) and offering \"Cycle Works\". Higher goals will allow me the time to focus more on what I provide here, as well as to purchase memberships to university libraries, cover fees associated with research materials, and purchase hard-to-find books - ultimately enriching what I bring to my patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike with any Patreon this is about the fine folks who like what I do helping me do it more. I\u0027m starting slow; this is no \u0027kickfunder\u0027 with high priced products to sell. \u00a0Items offered are not purchases and do not constitute a sale - they are gifts in return for valued and appreciated support. And, as is a standard disclaimer - no supernatural claims are being made about anything presented through this patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank all of you for your time, and for following along with my journey all these years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
