    "summary": "I write for me, because writing helps me. It gives me a desire to translate experience into words, and an awareness that it cannot be done. It gives me a way to organize my life around meaning and intention -- I spend my weeks listening around me and within me for what my next missive will contain. It gives me a way to connect to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write for you, because I hope reading helps you. I offer my writing as a gift. I mean it to contain reminders of things you had forgotten, inspirations for ways things might be otherwise,\u00a0invitations to things that lie quietly asleep within you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you experience my writing as a gift, I invite you to give back. If my words nourish you, please help me nourish myself. This platform is for money, which I\u0027ll use to buy things things like music and dance lessons, gastronomic adventures, and trips, and maybe occasionally to buy groceries and pay for rent. But I accept other gifts too! Email responses, in-person visits, cake, ice cream, art... I\u0027ll take it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you don\u0027t give me anything, know that I am deeply grateful for having you in my life. Thank you for reading, and for occasionally thinking about what I say, and for writing back. It means a great deal for me to have an audience of friends -- it means this thing that feels like wandering is meaningful not just for me, and that life itself can be an offering. And if you do choose to support me financially, thank you especially.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith great love,\u003cbr\u003eRafa\u003cbr\u003e"
