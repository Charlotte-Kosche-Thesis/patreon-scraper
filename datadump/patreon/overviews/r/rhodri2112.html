The main series of novels in this world center around the adventures of Edward Aethelredson. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be publishing at least two novels a year in this world, and you should support me if you want to find out the answers to those mysteries, the results of that intrigue, and watch great feats of magic and swordplay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I will provide for my followers are consistent updates and sneak peaks of the next book. You\u0027ll get working snippets throughout the process, at least one a month. You\u0027ll get behind-the-scenes looks at how I write, because you\u0027ll see the snippets evolve from the original to the finished version. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, when the books are released, you\u0027ll get at least the e-book version included. Higher tiers will get physical copies. Plus, I\u0027ll be providing goodies and swag periodically. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to all who decide that my work is worthy of supporting. I am looking forward to collaborating with you all into creating something we can all enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Rob is a reformed medieval academic who draws upon those\nskills and resources for his stories and settings. He has also been an IT\nprofessional, a cook, and a soda jerk. Originally from Houston, Texas, he\ndutifully followed his parents as they went from there to Hillsboro, Texas,\nthen to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and finally to Wichita, Kansas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlong the way, they discovered about the only way to keep\nRob quiet was to give him a book. Unfortunately for them, it turned out he\ncould read very quickly, so they had to give him lots of books. He latched onto\nthe Hardy Boys series first, then about anything else he could reach. Without\nbooks, either he or his parents probably would not have survived. Possibly\nboth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRob has traveled extensively. Most recently, in 2012, he\nwalked the majority of the Offa\u0027s Dyke Trail along the border of Wales and\nEngland. Many experiences on the trail shaped his writing. One might say the\nOffa\u0027s Dyke Trail led to Edward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHe decided to write professionally when he discovered he\nwas too educated for most jobs, and not quite educated enough for a few.\nFortunately, he had always written and had always wanted to emulate Forester,\nTolkien, Weber, Drake, Parker, Chandler, and Francis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow he can.",
