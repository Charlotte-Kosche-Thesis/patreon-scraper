    "summary": "Hello my friends! I\u2019m Rationality Rules, and this, is\nanother YouTuber on Patreon \u2013 Debunked\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJokes aside, I\u2019ve decided to try my luck on Patreon, to\nreally gauge whether there is a demand for the type of content that I create. I\nlove creating videos, and I\u2019m going to continue creating them no matter what;\nand of course, they\u2019ll always be free and you\u0027ll always have complete and full\naccess to them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut if you\u2019re feeling particularly generous, and you\u2019d like\nto see a dramatic increase in the quality and quantity of my videos, then\nhere\u2019s your chance to make it happen! And of course, in return, you\u2019ll receive exclusive and awesome goodies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo put it bluntly, I am convinced that the best way to\nincrease the quality and quantity of my content is simply though crowd funding.\u00a0While Google AdSense makes me a few coins per month, it\u0027s nowhere near what\u0027s needed for me to justify quitting my freelance work (let alone my job), and hence it all boils down to how much time I can justifiably dedicate to Rationality Rules.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that said, I currently work full time as a graphic designer,\nhave a family to enjoy, and have many other \u0027normal\u0027 commitments (and I like to play video games every now and then.. I can\u0027t lie!). However, due to these commitments I\u0027m currently only able to muster a maximum of 20 hours per week to spend on my channel (around .7 of a video). Patreon, however, has the potential to change this, as if there is truly is a demand for the type of content that I create then perhaps one day I\u0027ll be able to dedicate significantly more of my time to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt first your kind pledges will go towards a myriad of\nproducts and tools that\u2019ll improve the quality and quantity of my videos, such\nas new microphones, cameras, lights, backdrops, and indeed a new laptop\n(greatly needed!). It\u2019ll also pay for books, articles, access to peer-reviewed\npapers, and for philosophers and scientists to check over my scripts for any\nerrors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd should I ever reach the golden goal of $1,000 per video\nor more (dream on!), your money will officially employ me full time. I\u2019d quit my invested and stable career\nas a graphic designer and start living the dream (I\u2019d create considerably more\nvideos, including many new series). Oh, and 5% of your pledge will go to\nPatreon in exchange for their lovely service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to view my Patreon page,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Steve\u003cbr\u003e"
