    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page - I am always an artist - Always thinking about a design, sketching a composition for my next painting, studying cloud formations or how light falls on a persons face - data to commit to memory and from my mind\u0027s eye translate conjured images and dreams to canvas. Here I publish on patron only posts when any art work is being worked on or going up for sale, so you have first notice.\u00a0 Follow along with me as I work so you can see the process I use to go from idea to sketch, to choosing the size of the painting and medium, the support, assembling the colors and brushes I will need, and finally , my thoughts as I paint. I post about project paintings where you can follow the steps I take to finish a large painting. The posts are exclusive to patron view.\u00a0 Look over my shoulder, watch and come along on my journey. Posts that aren\u0027t project related are public and are about my artistic ideas, they include small works, exploring different mediums, techniques, subject matter, and then there\u0027s the glamorous side of being an artist - shows, triumphs, silly ideas, aspirations and broken easels. I post all completed artworks here first.\u00a0 I invite you to post comments, give criticisms, guide me and join in the conversations. Also, please check out my websites \u003cbr\u003eREIFSNYDERFineArt3.Etsy.com\u003cbr\u003eREIFSNYDERFineArt2.Etsy.com\u003cbr\u003eREIFSNYDERFineArt.Etsy.com\u003cbr\u003eHOW PATREON WORKS. Please choose your dollar amount to fund me OR you may choose one of the funding tiers and get a monthly print or original painting reward. You may choose a print or original of any painting I post here on Patreon.\u00a0 Once you become a patron you will have access to my Patron only posts.\u00a0 The funding will be charged on the 1st of every month - you may change the amount or cancel your gift at any time, but I hope you will continue to support me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

The materials that go into an artwork can be expensive, especially large works with the cost of canvas, paint, brushes and the time involved.\u00a0 Funding will allow me to turn my visions into art and allow you, my patrons to follow along with me as I create.\u00a0 It will also pay a few bills. A heartfelt THANK YOU to my supporters!\u003cbr\u003e",
