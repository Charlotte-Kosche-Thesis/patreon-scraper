Games like \u003cem\u003eMicrolite74\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eMicrolite78\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eMicrolite81\u003c/em\u003e -- and all of these games are available (at least in low art pdf form) for free.\u00a0 These games have proven very popular because they are easy to learn, play, and gamemaster. They are based on early versions of the world\u0027s most popular tabletop roleplaying game, filtered through modern unified rules systems and my 40 years of experience playing and gamemastering roleplaying games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started publishing my designs for something to do when my wife was diagnosed with oral cancer in 2008. While she made it through that, her health has never really improved -- she was diagnosed with MS last year after years of thinking her problems were caused by radiation damage to her neck from her six weeks of radiation treatments for her cancer. I continue to design and publish games because I enjoy it and because other people enjoy them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking for your support to continue to do so. My wife can no longer work which means I need to bring in more money while being available to care for her. Your support will make it possible for me to both continue to design and produce old school tabletop roleplaying games and continue to make most of the available for free.\u003cbr\u003e"
