    "summary": "I\u0027m a musician, writer and graphic artist. I play Guitar, (rhythm, lead and bottle neck slide) as well as Bass, Drums, Keys and Vocals. I also do graphic arts specifically pen and ink and paint.\u003cbr\u003eI am also a lover and performer of blues based music but I am also a lover of experimentation and I\u0027m seeking a way to express the vast array of musical styles percolating in my brain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I have 5 CDs in the marketplace (Amazon, iTunes, etc. I\u0027m even on Touchtunes jukeboxes across the US) My last CD \"Wonder Man\" made \u003cstrong\u003e#8 on the Billboard Blues Charts\u003c/strong\u003e and was nominated for \u003cstrong\u003eAlbum of the Year by Vintage Guitar Magazine\u003c/strong\u003e alongside Jeff Beck, Joe Bonamassa, David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Sonny Landreth.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I\u0027ve toured all over the US, Canada, Italy, S. Korea, Japan, Poland and the Czech Republic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Right now I spend so much of my time working on booking, touring, and marketing of live events to make the money to put out music that I end up doing much less musical output and spend far too much time trying to chase the money to make CDs and market them.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0My hope is to build a large enough subscriber base to make it possible to work on more creative output and do higher caliber shows at better venues so when I play out it\u0027s the best experience possible for the audience.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 To do that I\u0027m looking for people who wish to be on going patrons of my music and art. Since I now have my own studio and 30 years recording, mixing and mastering experience and am capable of playing all the instruments to create my music I\u0027ll be offering a song a month minimum output for subscribers. You\u0027ll be free to offer whatever you feel you can commit to per month as a donation. All I ask is that you commit to at least\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e6 months of patronage\u003c/strong\u003e as I build this. In return you will get at least one song of highly skilled playing and excellent fidelity music in various styles and genres. If I get extremely creative there will be multiple songs as well as some audio blog posts of me telling you where the song came from and what my inspirations or processes where getting to this final format. I\u0027ll also be asking for feedback from you on the songs as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 As a subscriber you will have access to music that no one else does and as you help me by reviewing the content we will help each other expand our musical horizons. I\u0027ll also be using your feedback to decide the songs that make the CD cuts which will be released to the general public at the end of each year as \"Rust-y-nation\" CDs.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0My long term goal is to be able to put out more music faster than ever before and once the subscriber base grows to a large enough size the extra money will be used to develop \"Rust-y-nation\" Touring shows so we can come to areas where we have subscribers and do a live performance of the songs you have helped make possible. This will also be a part of our current Spread Music Not Hate campaign. Which is our live concert streaming events. You can learn more about it at \u003ca href=\"http://www.spreadmusicnothate.org\"\u003ehttp://www.spreadmusicnothate.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 Please check out my past music and videos at my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.rustywrightband.com\"\u003ehttp://www.rustywrightband.com\u003c/a\u003e and if you feel I am worthy of your support I hope you will sign on as a patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eThere\u0027s no mandatory amount unless you want the extra offers of other rewards. \u003cbr\u003eGive what you feel I\u0027m worth. \u003cbr\u003eI place my value in your hands. But if you will give me a chance I will return your kindness in the form of amazing and interesting music both recorded and live.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time.\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Rusty Wright\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cW6xlqR.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\"Confused Prophet\" by Rusty Wright.
