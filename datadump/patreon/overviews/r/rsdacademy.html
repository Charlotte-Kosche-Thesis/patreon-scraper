    "summary": "There is a growing need for trained electronics technicians. Many industries, including computers, telecommunications, medicine and many more rely on electronics technicians to operate and maintain their equipment and infrastructure. The need is increasing as yesterday\u0027s generation of technicians retires to be replaced by the next generation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, opportunities to train in electronics technology are waning. Despite the need for more technicians, many schools have had trouble attracting students and have discontinued their electronics programs. Other schools, unable to meet strict government regulations have been shut down by the government. Yet others have shut down voluntarily. Companies and government agencies have a critical need for more electronics technicians and are having difficulty finding qualified people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I created RSD Academy (\u003ca href=\"http://rsdacademy.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ersdacademy.net\u003c/a\u003e). I developed these classes at a nationally accredited vocational school and now I\u0027m putting them online for free.\u00a0By providing free online education I don\u0027t have the problems that are forcing brick and mortar schools out of electronics or out of business altogether. I don\u0027t have to jump through government bureaucracy hoops and I don\u0027t have to choose between quality education and profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, free education is not free. Therefore, I am appealing to those who benefit--either students who benefit directly or businesses that benefit indirectly--to voluntarily donate to help me develop RSD Academy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are unable to donate you can still help. The textbooks and video lectures at RSD Academy are free for anyone to use. Students may use RSD Academy as an online course in electronics technology. Instructors at brick and mortar schools are also free to use the materials to supplement their curriculum. Whenever you watch a video lecture at RSD Academy (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOausWDNRDJikQ11gSLj7nA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esee RSD Academy on YouTube\u003c/a\u003e), assuming you aren\u0027t using a ad blocker, I receive advertising revenue. You can help by watching, giving my videos a thumbs-up and telling others about RSD Academy. So please help by donating or spreading the word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBob DuHamel\u003cbr\u003eRSD Academy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
