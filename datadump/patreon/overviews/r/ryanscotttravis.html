It was produced by the great and Grammy Award winning Mitch Dane. Though the release was independent, it was met with some great critical acclaim and has been a jumping board for many opportunities. Songs off the record have been used on TV shows such as Netflix\u0027s The Ranch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen not traveling back to Texas to play shows I am writing with some of the best folks here in Nashville and preparing for my next Full length record.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m no stranger to weird jobs; shoot, I was a trucker, a cedar clearer, hard ware store employee..a. But the idea of Patreon is that I would be able to pour all of my time and energy into my career as an artist and not have to pick up the slack with odd jobs anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for hanging in there with me. Can\u0027t wait to show what\u0027s cooking for the next record!\u003cbr\u003eRyan\u003cbr\u003e"
