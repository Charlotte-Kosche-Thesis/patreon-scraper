Whatever the case may be it is likely involved in Minecraft somehow, welcome and thank you for taking the time to read this forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you would like to support me in my creative endeavors. A few things you can look forwards to are.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Consistent output of my Youtube video series. Aiming for one a day at first, up to two series going at once meaning, two a day. \u003cbr\u003e-More of my art and models\u003cbr\u003e-Homecraft Mineware (a decorative and functional modular furnishing mod for minecraft)\u003cbr\u003e-Steam \u0026amp; Steel (a steampunk inspired tech and exploration mod with rich lore, and judicious use of multiblock objects)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are all things that I would like to achieve, but have found that life just cannot literally afford. Me the space and freedom to do these things without great stress and worry for myself. These are all things I would passionately chase to completion if I had the room to breathe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd thats where you come in. It doesn\u0027t matter if you came here to pledge a humbling sum, or just to add your name to the list of my supporters. It all helps, your support by name gives me the knowledge that people stand behind me, and that is motivating. Your money gives me the little bit of financial breathing room I need to kill off the crippling day to day stress, and that is motivating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo again thank you for the time you have taken to read this forward, and if you are staying around to pledge then I really hope I can do you proud.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Thank you\u003cbr\u003eRose Alexander.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
