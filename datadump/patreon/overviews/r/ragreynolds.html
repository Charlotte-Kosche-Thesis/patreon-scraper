    "summary": "You don\u0027t know? You damn sure should know. I am ragreynolds, and I am here on Patreon as a way to further my interaction with my audience whilst also receiving some help to create and publish my content across the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I create:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMost people will probably only know me from one or two places. However, I am very active in producing various types of content across numerous platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube videos vary quite drastically. I create comedy videos, vlogs, opinion/political videos, response videos, educational videos, and much more. I have playlists on my YouTube channel dedicated to each type of content I upload, this helps people find the content they are interested in without having to browse through the content that they have no interest in.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/ragreynolds\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e You can click here to see my main YouTube channel.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a newer channel where I post all sorts of entertainment content, including movie and TV reviews, gaming let\u0027s plays, and more.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9KybnxK7frCt2AbwThaW_g\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can click here to see my second/entertainment YouTube channel.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI occasionally write articles/blog posts on\u003ca href=\"http://ragreynolds.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u00a0my website\u003c/a\u003e covering various different subjects. I write reviews, satirical pieces, opinion pieces, and educational pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn early 2013, at the age of only 16, I published my first book. The book was titled \u0027The Epitome of Perfection: The Step-by-Step Guide To Being a Great Human Being\u0027 and is available on Amazon, iTunes, Waterstones, Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, and everywhere else that matters. The book is a blend of fiction, comedy, and biography. In late 2013 I began working on my second book, and I had it published in August 2017. The second book is called \u0027Medium Rare: A Guide To Fine Dining \u0026amp; Perfect Timing\u0027 and is available for purchase\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/ryan-ragreynolds/medium-rare-a-guide-to-fine-dining-perfect-timing/paperback/product-23293039.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I am currently working on some other written projects (mainly novels). You can see some of the early work on these projects by pledging and browsing through the locked Patron-only content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027On The Rag\u0027 is a podcast I host on both YouTube and iTunes. The show schedule is quite irregular and episode releases really just come down to when I have a guest booked that I find interesting enough to talk to. The show is very light hearted and aims to poke fun at anything and everything.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/on-the-rag/id1028883723?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Click here for iTunes\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx_Pte0WdDrTtlgifFtSehOsBp-ZgxXx4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Click here for YouTube\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your contributions help fund:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eContributions made via Patreon will largely go towards maintaining my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ragreynolds.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e and helping with software, video and audio equipment, video props, distribution costs, and advertisements for my content. All of this is so that I can make better content and do what I love to do as often as I can. On top of all that, your contributions also help fund giveaways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards Info\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCertain rewards are handed out after a certain amount of time. The description on the reward tier will list any time frames you need to know about. Just remember that Patreon charges Patrons on the 1st of each month, meaning that after you pledge, you should not expect to receive certain awards until after the first payment has been taken by Patreon. This is to ensure that I do not have people becoming a Patron on say the 5th of a month, grabbing all of their rewards, and then unpledging on the 30th of that same month, meaning that they would never have had to pay for any of the rewards they were given.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I have not personally messaged you about any rewards you are due, then please do not hesitate to message me yourself. I\u2019m a busy guy, so sometimes I might forget things, and as my support on Patreon grows, it will become harder for me to keep on top of everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne-off Donations\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027d like to make a one-off donation and not a regular pledge on Patreon, then you can make that donation via PayPal by clicking\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/ragreynolds\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatron directory:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ragreynolds/posts?tag=schedule\"\u003eWeekly video schedules\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ragreynolds/posts?tag=exclusive%20video\"\u003eExclusive videos\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ragreynolds/posts?tag=my%20video%20games\"\u003eMy video games\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ragreynolds/posts?tag=sneak%20peek\"\u003eSneak peeks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ragreynolds/posts?tag=discord\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscord\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
