I fill in for other projects, teach at Ladies Rock Camp, and I book and help backline shows.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re reading this, I need new drumsticks. I need stick wrap. At least one of my heads needs to be replaced. My cymbals are cracked. I\u0027ve run out of viable cymbal felts, or my kick beater pad is worn down. One of my stands has lost a wing nut. Maybe by this point it\u0027s bass strings I need. On that note, I need a new pickup. I need a new tuning peg. The duct tape is dry and cracking. That cable is dead. My beer is empty?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more sticks and strings and cables get used, the shorter they last. The shorter they last, the more expensive it gets to keep making music. I really haven\u0027t been able to keep up since most of my paycheck goes directly to bills, gas, stuff for work (you know, public school job), and groceries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel a lot better when I have fresh sticks and wrap at the very least. When I feel better, I play better. Music is the only therapy that works for me and I know that my projects bring at least some amount of joy to other people. I want to find ways to offer musical rewards for people who are kind enough to help me maintain the things I need to do what I do. Depending on how this goes, it may start helping my projects record, which means there will be more and more music to offer the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTell me how I can thank you for your support. You rock for helping me rock. Rock."
