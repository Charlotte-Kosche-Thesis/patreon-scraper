    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m a Romanian who aspires to be a writer. I like to take pictures, to draw and to study as much as possible about Japan. I write what I like, and I listen to music; I imagine all sorts of things, and I like to put them on paper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI heard of this website only recently (to my shame), and almost as soon as I was able to find myself in front of a laptop (preferably mine, of course), I looked it up, signed in and started uploading a bunch of stuff. It may seem little now, because I\u0027ve only just begun, but I\u0027ll do my best to post on each and every once a week, every month, just to expand my Creator page and give you all an idea of how I envision the world and how I express my feelings through art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may see occasionally that I also like to draw (I\u0027ll post a lot of drawings of mine as well). That\u0027s because, although I\u0027m not entirely good at it, I like to think that I could not do a better job at it, since I\u0027ve got the basics and since I\u0027ve known my feelings better than anyone in this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to write a lot of poetry, I write some of it now, occasionally, but I think I can fairly say my best asset is making up stories and writing them down. It\u0027s like i drug, an addiction from which I cannot turn away, especially since it\u0027s helped me go through various struggles in my life and made me fell stronger, more confident in myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePictures! I like to take pictures as well, although I can\u0027t say I\u0027m a professional photographer. With a decent camera and a good eye, at least, I think I can fairly say I\u0027m on the job quite handily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic\u0027s getting me inspired. All the time. 24/7. It\u0027s probably my second necessity after breathing, eating and sleeping. It doesn\u0027t matter where or how or why, music is something with which I could not handle writing as much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJapan, last but not least. The best thing that\u0027s ever happened to me was to studying it in college. After that, it might as well have turned into a long-term relationship. I\u0027m doing my very best to develop it and make it more and more a part of my life than it\u0027s already been. Officially, I\u0027m a Japanese speaker for almost five years now and I intend to add up to that number of years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, step right up and watch my art grow on this website. I\u0027m looking forward to meeting you all and answer all your curiosities and questions about what I write, how I write and why I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for giving me the opportunity to send the world bits and pieces from my own world.\u003cbr\u003e"
