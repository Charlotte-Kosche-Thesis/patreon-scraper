    "summary": "Hey guys, I\u0027m Retro\u2014artist and game developer.\u00a0I write about pixel art on my blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.retronator.com\"\u003eRetronator\u003c/a\u003e, and create educational content about drawing and games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor my Master\u0027s degree in Education, I\u0027ve been researching how video games work as a learning medium. I\u0027m now putting these ideas into practice with my game\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://pixelart.academy\"\u003ePixel Art Academy\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBadevS_ALQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been learning with video games\u2014and because of video games\u2014all my life.\u00a0Games made me curious about the world we live in, and I\u0027ve taught myself a crazy amount of skills connected with making games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow is a way-too-long visual summary of my creative life, if you wanted to get to know me better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*mrzEqXGuPd0b5Frp.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt all started with making games. First on the ZX Spectrum (I grew up in Europe where this computer was popular), and later on the PC. My older brother taught me coding, while I was learning how to draw on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*wUnAl0O59Ns2pavj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSoon enough drawing for video games grew into love of digital and traditional art in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*fOv4v_bs1aOUdO9p.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point I went on to study Computer Science. My college part-time job was writing for a video games magazine. Yeah, I played games for money, every teenager\u0027s dream job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2005 I wrote an article about drawing pixel art, and designed the isometric cover that most people know me for as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*2ibBpIbpD9QbFyuN.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually I got sick of writing about video games. I got frustrated that more and more games were about fighting and killing each other, while the games that focused on creativity dwindled in comparison.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI couldn\u0027t just continue to complain about it in my articles so I decided to return to making games. In 2007 I came up with the name Retronator for my game studio, because my pen-name at the magazine was Retro and retronator.com was the only available .com domain I could find.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*RdYreZCmOm2CnFb_.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately I didn\u0027t end up making my own games.\u00a0I was offered a game development position at a local company and it sounded too good to pass. It was my dream come true at the time, but I didn\u0027t know myself good enough to know that giving up my own ideas led down a dark path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI entered my late-twenties and the infamous quarter-life crisis finally hit me. I experienced big mood swings, from feeling invincible and working crazy amount of hours, to burning out and sinking into weeks of apathy when everything in life seemed grey. I started therapy for the first time. My creative output in 2010 went from minimal to non-existent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*k9SvDPuX4b9Py2of.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2011 was better. I went on a hiatus at my job, to focus on finishing college. I graduated in September with an MSc in Computer Science. I also realized I made a huge mistake and should have really gone to art school instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to make up for it and improve my art on my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe following year was formative. I started doing one portrait with pencils each week and then moved on to painting digitally. I turned my pixel art magazine cover into the Tribute poster, which got posted around the internet and my pixel art blog took off. I even made my first \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kjw1-wkKZI\"\u003emusic video\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*ZtDu0elmD7N_wdoz.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, at my job I was back to making mobile games. I hoped the company I worked for would earn enough money to fund my own games, but when the next game flopped, I needed to get out of the mobile space. I needed to get out of games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy complete surprise I got offered a designer position at the University of California, Berkeley, a move that would fulfill\u00a0my lifetime wish of living in the United States. I accepted and arrived to the US in March 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy job was to produce a textbook for my boss, and I soon started illustrating it as well. Berkeley was great for my art progress.\u00a0I started going to life drawing and finally got better at anatomy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iil7D3u.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life was a mixed bag of happy and depressed though. Yes, I was making art for a living, but I was also lonely and struggling with relationships. I re-entered therapy. I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kwifj6nnMQ\"\u003elearning gymnastics\u003c/a\u003e every day which was the only thing holding me together. When I do sports I forget about all life\u0027s problems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings kept getting worse through 2014. At my job I was moved from illustration into web development, a time for which I have little to show. Making art for myself became more and more of a struggle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vGn09Dz.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the end of 2014 I wanted to get out of my job. I didn\u0027t want to give up living in the US though, so my plan B was to apply to grad schools there. At the same time I\u00a0was diagnosed with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder\"\u003ebipolar type II disorder\u003c/a\u003e and started taking medication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMedication gave me the needed stability to do great work again.\u00a02015 has seen a resurgence in my art.\u00a0Life was finally peaceful and happy\u2014and more productive than ever. I got accepted to Stanford. I launched Pixel Art Academy on Kickstarter and started my\u00a0Master\u0027s degree in Education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lFdSY0V.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn school I took electives in digital art and explored conceptual fine art. I returned to traditional mediums and learned how to paint with watercolors and oils. I made up for not going to art school. For my Education subjects I did research on how adults learn in their free time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pnhCS0z.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy year at Stanford was the most productive and fulfilling in my life, thanks in big part to focusing it around Pixel Art Academy. My\u00a0coding efforts, however, went into data visualization at my research assistantship, which paid for college. It was worth it, even though I didn\u0027t get as much coding done for the game as I hoped. After I graduated, I quickly turned the tables around and started working on the game full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wElwbUo.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here we are. I\u0027m now working full-time on\u00a0Pixel Art Academy and Retronator Magazine\u2014a new dream come true. I\u0027m finally making my own game and writing about the art community that surrounds it. I owe it all to my Kickstarter backers and you, Patreon supporters. Thank you so much for making it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThat\u0027s been my journey so far.
