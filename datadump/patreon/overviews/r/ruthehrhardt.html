    "summary": "My name is Ruth and I am a midwife, mother, doula, author, teacher and fervent advocate for mothers, babies and those who care for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I do many many things to change the face of birth in m own country (South Africa) and the world. I attend births in all sorts of home settings - from mansions to apartments to back rooms to tin shacks - and all to women who want and trust that home is the safest and best place for them to birth. Some of these births are paid for, some are discounted, some are free. I try to serve those I can, if I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the single mother of four children - two boys and two girls - between the ages of 8 and 15. So that keeps me pretty busy too. My pregnancies, births, the care and love I received from my midwives, their sweet smell as babies and the lessons I have learned being their mother, have taught me the importance of love and protection towards mothers and their babies as they forge their new paths in this life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI entered the birth world as a doula, tentatively feeling my way into it initially in this capacity. I am glad I entered the birth world in this way - I learned to be with women in labour before I learned to monitor them - and that has had a huge affect on how I am as a midwife today. I have run some grassroots doula courses as part of the Compassionate Birth Project, here in South Africa and in Swaziland and I would like to do do more. The difference a calm, protective birth attendant can make to a woman\u0027s own trust and feeling of safety is immense and I would like to see every woman being able to access someone they feel safe with to protect them at this precious time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have written a book called The Basic Needs of a Woman in Labour, inspired by the wonderful Dr Michel Odent and Liliana Lammers, the doula he works with. I was lucky enough to go and attend their doula course some years back and have been inspired ever since. The book, initially intended as more of a simple brochure to be left lying around hospitals and birth centres for people to casually pick up and unconsciously absorb, has taken off ever since I decided to upload it on Amazon as a paperback as well as a Kindle download. It has been translated into and officially launched Italian. Current translations which are ready but awaiting publication, are Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. German, Sesotho, Tswana, Afrikaans, French, Arabic and Turkish are currently works in progress. Exciting! I am also working on some other books - one is a work of South African magic realist work of fiction based on my own family\u0027s history and which is currently with a publisher awaiting feedback. The other book is on sexual abuse triggers in pregnancy and birth and is still a work in progress but I will be presenting on this subject matter at the International Confederation of Midwives in Canada in 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI teach many things to many people. I work with mothers, babies, doulas and other passionate birthkeepers, midwives and medical students the world over. I teach skills from massage to neonatal resuscitation to midwifery skills to self care to meditation to listening...the list goes on. But primarily the the aim is to empower those working with labouring women to be the best possible caregivers they can be in themselves and true to the mothers they serve. I truly believe that how a woman is treated in her pregnancy impacts on the outcome, her sense of wellbeing, her bond to her baby, her sense of self. I would like to see uplifting gatherings for pregnant and new mothers, a safe space to share their fears and stories and to receive information, support and education, but mostly as a place to be loved and to laugh! For caregivers I would like to see self empowerment and upliftment through practical skills as well to get in touch with themselves as birth attendants who are witnesses to a great and sacred event. I would love to establish a simple traditional midwifery school here in South Africa, honouring the roots of where we come and marrying them with the new and evidence based care which more more and more is honouring gentle care and the bond between mother and baby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many hopes and dreams and schemes to change the face of birth in South Africa, Africa and the rest of the world, and my ideas sometimes keep me up at night but I feel I have the energy and the capacity to make them happen if I have the right kind of support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRuth\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Up to now, I have been offering this service for free but I am limited in this as costs of my time and equipment need to be covered. This fee would cover being able to attend one women for her birth in her home per month and would include all her pregnancy, birth, post birth care. It would also include her baby\u0027s registration and clinic card so that she can access her local clinic, creches and schools.",
