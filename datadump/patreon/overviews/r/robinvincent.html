    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Robin Vincent and I make videos about music technology, software, hardware and modular synths. I produce reviews, tutorials, monthly news roundups and I\u0027ve been sharing my journeys into using the Microsoft Surface Pro as a music platform and building a Eurorack modular synth. But if you\u0027re here then you probably know some of that already.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI produce under the name of Molten Music Technology, which is the umbrella that keeps all the stuff I do together. Making videos is the thing I like to do best. I like nothing better than getting under the skin of complicated music-making machinery and explaining it to the world. The way that the channel has grown and the conversations we have had in the comments, make me believe that you enjoy it too! But, it\u0027s also the thing that brings in the least amount of money for the effort I put in. So, I find myself in a position where I\u0027d love to keep on making videos, but I also need to pay the bills and I\u0027m trying to strike a balance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way that you can support me in making more of the content that you want to see. Becoming a Patron means that you\u0027ll be giving me some money every month in order to help me make these\u00a0videos. You could see it as a magazine subscription, or an opportunity to buy me a pint to thank me for something you\u0027ve found useful in my content. You can contribute anything from a dollar a month up to as much as you like. There will be different tiers or levels of contributions that will give you certain rewards. For instance, sign up for over $3 and you\u0027ll get early access to my videos before they go live on YouTube. I haven\u0027t exactly worked out anything beyind that yet but that\u0027s something we can talk about. And that\u0027s the point - becoming a Patron means you\u0027ll be joining my journey, connecting to my community and helping me curate the content of Molten Music Technology. So, have a look around, choose a tier and then go and make some tunes!"
