Since 2009, the RISK! team and I have been independently bringing out incredible episodes full of hilarious, moving, jaw-dropping stories week after week on a shoestring budget. From starting out putting the show together in my bedroom with an audience of 0, the show has now grown, mainly by word of mouth, to have millions of downloads per month, although it\u0027s still made in my bedroom, because I still can\u0027t afford to make a studio!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started RISK!, I was completely broke and desperate, but I knew that true storytelling was my true calling, and that people around the world would love hearing a podcast full of \ncompletely uncensored and courageously honest stories from famous writers and actors, and regular folks as well, that might be \nconsidered \u0027too much\u0027 for family-friendly radio. I went into debt to start the RISK! podcast, but just before things got to a breaking point, I was lucky enough to meet the key members of the RISK! team who would help me get the production aspects of RISK! organized and make it just barely sustainable as a small business while the world of podcasting grew slowly but surely into a small industry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, through sheer determination and dedication to the craft of putting out the kind of risky, daring, uncensored stories you won\u0027t hear anywhere else, we\u0027ve managed to scrape by, but after so many years, we\u0027d really love to start thriving with your help. It seems that our workload just continues to grow, which means we need to keep hiring people and paying them so we don\u0027t all burn out as the show picks up more and more steam. I started this with just one other person volunteering for me, and now we have a staff of 3 full time employees and more than 20 part time employees all around the USA! Putting out 52 episodes and putting on over 50 live shows per year and running a storytelling school takes a ton of work! And even though we don\u0027t have a big budget to pay our team members a lot, with that many people, just payroll alone gets really expensive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking RISK! saved my life and the lives of many of the people who work on our team. We are all so grateful to get to do something we love, care about and believe in for a living, and we want to keep doing it for as long as we can. And our fans write in daily to say that RISK! has made them feel more human, made them more empathetic and understanding towards people who are different, and sometimes even saved their lives and helped them stop wanting to commit suicide. We truly believe RISK! is making the world a better place. And besides all that, it\u0027s just a blast to listen to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith fan funding from Patreon, we\u0027ll be able to keep making RISK! and finding the best true stories from around the world to share with you every week. And we\u0027ll able to pay our staff what they deserve to make for their excellent work, not just the bare minimum. And maybe at some point I can even stop living paycheck to paycheck and have a bit of savings as I head into my FIFTIES. Imagine that! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, if you love RISK!, please consider becoming our patron on Patreon, even if it\u0027s just for $5 a month. If most of our fans donated even $5-10 per month, we\u0027d be totally set financially and could do so many more cool things for you. And no matter what you donate, you\u0027ll get some awesome rewards, and know that you\u0027re supporting a show that saves lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are you waiting for? Today\u0027s the day! Support RISK! on Patreon and get your friends to do it, too! Thanks everyone!\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eKevin and the RISK! Team\u003cbr\u003e"
