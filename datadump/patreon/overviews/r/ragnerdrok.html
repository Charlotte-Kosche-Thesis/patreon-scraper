Our podcast dreams started when Alex texted everyone and said, \"I want to be Internet famous.\" And Meyer said, \"Lets do it.\" Many meetings in Ed\u0027s basement followed, and eventually Rag-NERD-rok was born. We\u0027ve been releasing our podcast since 2011, featuring\u00a0fun and creative actual plays of many different roleplaying games. We post games in all genres and styles \u2014 sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, horror, drama and more. We post a podcast every week for our listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe each have years of roleplaying experience, and we use that to bring you unique characters, engaging stories and our unique brand of humor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we\u0027re turning to our fans to help us make the podcast even better. Patreon will help us cover the costs of hosting the site, which will then give us the room we need to grow as a content producer. We can purchase better equipment, record more games and do some of the things we\u0027ve only dreamed of doing since we first conceptualized our podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to learn more about us, you can visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ragnerdrok.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e to check out our episodes, and stay up to date with us on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ragnerdrok\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ragnerdrok\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love our listeners, and we love what we do.
