I\u0027m a writer by passion, a student by profession, and a herpetologist by desire and I\u0027m extremely grateful that you\u0027re taking a visit to my patreon. I take a lot of pride in what I write, the art that I create, and the way that I speak.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e That you consider me good enough to donate your hard earned money to, is something that I just can\u0027t comprehend. Time is money right? Well then not only are you giving me your time, reading, watching, and listening, but you\u0027re also donating hard earned money. Even more of your precious time that you\u0027re giving up because you think my content is worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t accept advertisements in my content, sponsors, and provide all of my content free of charge because I love doing what I do. Because I think it should be accessible to anyone who wants to view it, regardless of their finances. If you\u0027d like to donate it\u0027s amazing because I\u0027ll be able to devote more time to my projects and produce them more frequently and with better quality. If you don\u0027t or if you aren\u0027t in a position to donate that\u0027s great too because you\u0027re still taking that valuable time out of your day to see my work. You like it enough to take the time that\u0027s even more valuable and you\u0027re placing it with me. Either way, thank you so much and I can\u0027t wait to get to work on the next project for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the Best and Much Love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-Elijah\u003c/em\u003e"
