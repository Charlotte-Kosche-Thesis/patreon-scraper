My name is Manouchehr and I am a martial artist, researcher and writer living in Germany. For the last several years, I have been publishing books, articles and producing videos about my passions: Iranian historical weapons, Iranian culture, Persian craftsmanship, and Martial arts. Many historical artifacts from different eras of Iranian history are true works of art, and I want to share them with the world.\u00a0You can find more information about what I do below; for more information about me, you can visit my page at \u003ca href=\"http://www.moshtaghkhorasani.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.moshtaghkhorasani.\u0026lt;wbr\u0026gt;com/\u0026lt;/wbr\u0026gt;\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, I thank you for your interest and welcome you to my page.\u003cbr\u003eKind regards\u003cbr\u003eDr. Manouchehr Moshtagh Khorasani\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this campaign about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor most part, my publications and videos are freely available online. I believe historical research should be available to anyone who wishes to know about it, as sharing knowledge is the best way people and cultures can come to understand each other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately research carries its own costs which have to be paid. Instead of making my work available only against payment, I have instead turned to crowdfunding to help offset some of the costs. By supporting this campaign and contributing a few dollars a month, you will be helping me carry out further research and continue producing quality content. Better funding will allow me to dedicate more time and resources to this work, which will result in better content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApart from my gratitude for your kind support, as a patron you will also have access to the patron-only feed, where you will have early access to some videos and previews of things I am working on. In addition, I will be happy to field any questions, either in a question and answer video, or a video in its own right where the question requires a longer answer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMartial Arts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an avid fighter and have been practicing martial arts since my early childhood.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hold a blackbelt 2nd dan in fullcontact Karate, blackbelt 4th dan in Kungfu Toa and blackbelt 2nd dan in Kungfu Nam Wah Pai.

The martial arts of Razmafzar comprises 722 techniques of armed and unarmored combat on foot plus riding, lance combat on horseback, wrestling on horseback and horse archery. These techniques are documented in my book, Persian Archery and Swordsmanship: Historical Martial Arts of Iran, with video demonstrations on my YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI fought endurance tests with weapons - 12 rounds in Prague (Czech Republic), 30 rounds in Bologna (Italy), 50 rounds in Hamburg (Germany) and 70 rounds in Malta.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make instructional videos on historical Persian martial arts, arms and armor in museums, swordsmanship and archery events and fights in the area of historical fighting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResearch and Publications\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a researcher in the analysis of historical arms and armor and have written six books, five of which have already been published, and two of which won awards\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy book Arms and Armor from Iran: The Bronze Age to the End of the Qajar Period (published 2006) features a detailed analysis of Iranian arms and armor from prehistoric times to the end of the Qajar rule in Iran.

Next to each entry, which is written in its phonetic alphabet, the same term in the original script is provided as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also the author of the book Antique Oriental and Arab Weapons and Armour: The Streshinskiy Collection (published 2010).
