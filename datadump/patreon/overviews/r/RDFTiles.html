Since you have taken the time to check us out here on Patreon, we\u0027d like to tell you little more about ourselves, why we are on Patreon, and how you can help make this shop into a place for everyone to come for practical, diverse, and original gaming materials. The shop is open and can be accessed at \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/RDFTiles\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/RDFTiles\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhat is Ryu\u0027s Dragon Forged Tiles?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRDFT is a one-man production team with a little help from some friends, creating hand-made table top gaming tiles and accessories that are more affordable than your usual branded terrain tile. We keep the regular day gamer in mind with each product we make, and realize people want quality and usability, but not spending a paycheck each time they are looking for something new. This means each tile and accessory is a unique one of a kind item that was made especially with the realistic and detail oriented table top gamer on our radar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to keep costs down and also to keep our goal of being environmentally-friendly, try as much as possible to use re-purposed materials, recycled materials, locally found products, and make items by hand, which leaves a much smaller foot-print than larger machine produced items. This all translates into each item being completely different, more affordable, and made with all the hard work and care that someone can muster, especially for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRDFT is also all about transparency and authenticity. We enjoy sharing all production details and \"behind the scenes\" information we can, in order for the buyer to see exactly how these tiles and accessories came into being, and the work and efforts made to create each item just for gamers like you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect to see from our Patreon page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe chose Patreon as the most user friendly source to gain support and provide back to our patrons in a viable and practical way. You can expect exclusive sneak-peeks to our upcoming products and behind the scenes information on how our products are made and handled. You\u0027ll also be able to provide input to us to help create the products you are looking for in your campaigns.

By joining us here, you can help us reach our goals and create exciting and new original terrains and accessories, that you\u0027ll have first dibs on.
