     "about": "Ray Stinnett \u003cbr\u003eSinger, songwriter, rock guitarist; Ray Stinnett grew up in the shadow of the Memphis rock n roll music scene of the 50\u2019s. By the early 60\u2019s Memphis was under the influence of different musical cultures coming together in an amalgam of sound and rhythm. Ray was also becoming part of that scene, playing in clubs and studios around town and seeking his place as a professional musician and performer. In 1963 Ray married Sandra and thus began a lifelong relationship. Later in that same year, Ray became a founding member and original guitarist of Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs of \u201cWooly Bully\u201d fame (Billboard #1 record of the year 1965). By mid 1966 Ray was writing more songs and doing his own thing in the combo, \u201c1st Century\u201d (Capitol records release in 1967). After returning to Memphis from the SF Bay area at the end of the Summer of Love (1967), inspired by the 60\u2019s personal liberation and awareness movement, Ray \u0026amp; Sandra began writing songs that express life\u2019s broader and deeper experiences. They soon became acquainted with new friends and players and formed a working relationship with Booker T. Jones. Booker produced two albums on Ray. The first, (never before but soon to be released legendary album) titled \u201cSun Tree at Pepper West\u201d (1969) and the second, as executive producer for A\u0026amp;M Records in 1971. The album was not released and all rights of ownership went to Ray. The record went unreleased until 2012 when \u201cA Fire Somewhere\u201d with original artwork, gate-fold LP\u2019s and CD\u2019s with new 40 pg. booklets were finally pressed and released worldwide by Light in the Attic records. The album has received considerable acclaim in prominent newspaper and Record Collector Magazine reviews and best of 2012 reissue list, plus a Shindig Magazine feature article/interview and popular Internet \u0026amp; FM radio interviews.\u003cbr\u003eAvailable for the very first time, A Fire Somewhere is the previously unreleased 1971 solo album from this former member of Sam the Sham \u0026amp; the Pharaohs. The songs contained the fried country twang and boogie-woogie grooves of his hometown and of his youth, but were also threaded through with the new Psychedelia: shreds of distorted guitar, experimental jams and acoustic renditions. Art is a reflection of life,\u0027\u0027 says Ray of the making of A Fire Somewhere, \u0027\u0027and my life was full of reflection at this time.\u0027\u0027 And it\u2019s perhaps exactly that fact which kept this incredible record unreleased for all these years. LITA\u003cbr\u003eRay\u2019s AxeGrinder MusicZine www.axemanmusic.net is an interactive online magazine and journal of Ray\u2019s music history and his current musical journey, including insightful articles, news and interesting stories plus links to videos, music, interviews and more. \u003cbr\u003eRay and Sandra have been keeping the musical dream alive for decades, writing, recording and playing the music that has always been a major important factor in their lives. Ray\u2019s performance ensemble is presented as \u201cTime Warp\u201d; the music (more to be released soon) spans a lifetime but has waited for this moment to be heard by audiences now! Ray Stinnett\u2019s \u201cTime Warp\u201d brings the past, present and future together for a performance that will \u2026\u201dtake you there\u201d!\u003cbr\u003e",
