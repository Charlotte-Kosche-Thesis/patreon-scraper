Do you have a favorite Pokemon you want to see in action or use to beat down your friends? Well, I am a YouTube content creator who specializes in making competitive Pokemon move sets, guides, and battle videos for Pokemon in almost every tier, so whether you are someone who likes dominating with powerful Pokemon and mega evolutions or someone who just wants use their favorite Pokemon regardless of how good they might be, you have come to the right place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my 7 years of making videos on YouTube, a lot has changed in both my life and the world of Pokemon that it makes it increasingly more difficult to cover everything I would want to talk about and you would want to see. As a result, I started this page as a way to not only provide more incentive for myself to upload more frequently, but also to get a better idea as to what my subscribers would like to see from me such as specific Pokemon move sets, more frequent, battle uploads, general competitive guides, live streaming, or many others. This way, those who support my content can make sure they are being recognized and heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should I Become a Patreon Supporter?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patreon supporter, you get to have input in what I upload and be recognized for your support to my YouTube channel.
