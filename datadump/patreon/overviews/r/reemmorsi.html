    "summary": "My name is Reem Morsi. I am a writer/director originally from Egypt and based in Toronto/Canada. My story began from growing up in a small city south of the mediterranean, Alexandria, in a conservative religious family, to becoming a professional scuba diver, to working in human rights \u0026amp; child \u0026amp; women protection, to becoming a filmmaker to tell the stories I have witnessed. I worked in many peace \u0026amp; war zones at the United Nations and many human rights organizations. I have seen stories I want to tell. I have seen racism, stereotyping and gender role boxes which I broke by becoming my own person, not a check mark to satisfy someone\u0027s definition of my identity, whether in the culture I came from, or the culture where I live (Canada). My films defy stereotypes. I wrote and directed many award winning/nominated short films the reflect my life. I am now writing my first feature film \"BOOTLEG\" about women\u0027s sexual rights in a very conservative culture in the Middle East. Its a big risk as I am challenging cultural norms, like the characters in my feature script. By supporting me, I will have the ability to continue to write articles, stories and scripts and make films that offer a new vision and a new voice. Changing the existing narrative to change the world. Specifically: By supporting me, I will make my first feature film \"Bootleg\" and change mentalities, narratives and perspectives."
