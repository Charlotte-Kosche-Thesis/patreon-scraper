    "summary": "Greetings,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am Damian Frost. Welcome to my\nPatreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealmStriders will be a multimedia platform. Primary focus will be on writing. In different genre\u0027s. To a lesser extent, I will be making games. Lastly, I also wish to pursue creating, Audio Visual Stories (AVS). These will be a mix of graphic novels/comics (possibly a different style) and stories. With the thematic accompaniment of music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt is my goal to strive for quality over quantity. I aim to formulate engaging characters, fascinating worlds, and compelling stories. On top of that, I wish to avoid using cliche concepts, as well as write tightly and coherently to avoid as many plot holes as possible (all would be great, but I am only human).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, in the vein of quality, I create stories in the hopes that they can be interesting, engaging, engrossing. I want them to be\nsomething I can come back to, after writing them. Something I can\nsavor and enjoy. Many times. Not just once or twice. Which in turn means, they will be stories all of you\nshould be able to dive into and get lost in, as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, achieving the coveted\nescapism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eImportant Note\u003c/em\u003e: By supporting this channel, please\nrealize your money is going to go primarily to the writing and the\nAVS. Those are what I wish to pursue the most. For each game, I will likely\nhave to create a Kickstarter. To fully fund the production of each one. However, I\u0027m making mention here\nbecause your support will inevitably help in there creation, as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAVS Note\u003c/em\u003e: Head to my Youtube channel to view four example AVS videos I created. The art is basic, at the moment, but the writing is what you can expect from my other content. The music is fairly spot on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm0sCA-TA7FzYyc3Wvei4jQ\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm0sCA-TA7FzYyc3W...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the text of AVS videos and or publically available stories, head to my Deviant Art page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://realmstriders.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttps://realmstriders.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read\nand or listen to the intro video. If you choose to support, even more\nthanks. If not, perhaps you might consider at least making mention of\nRealmStriders to a friend or two. \nThe power of word of mouth, cannot be underestimated.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOnce more, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease Schedule\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be releasing a new story, once a month. On the 5th of every month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy? Patreon charges on the 1st of the month, but in the link below, Patreon says it can take up to 5 full days (at times) to collect all payments. Thus I have decided to schedule my releases once Patreon is done collecting payments. Plus, from one 5th of the month to another, is still a full month. So the wait between each story is no different than if I released a story on the 1st of a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002832126-When-Are-My-Patrons-Charged-When-Do-Payments-Get-Processed-\"\u003ehttps://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1150...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
