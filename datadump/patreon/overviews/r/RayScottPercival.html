I embrace the flourishing of the individual within rules allowing of the greatest equal and compatible liberty for others to do likewise as the paramount value. Together with the humble, optimistic and self-critical ethos of critical rationalism - \u201cyou may be right and I may be wrong, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth\u201d - it is this liberty that \u00a0enabled human beings to pull themselves up from grim levels of poverty hardly within our capacity to imagine. There are still millions of people living in wretched and oppressive conditions, but we have made stumbling, step-by-step, improvement. And we can and ought to continue indefinitely to improve the lot of humankind. There is still much work to be done.
