I\u0027ve been writing songs and playing guitar since I was 11 years old. It was January 2006 when I hit the road full time and started singing songs all over the US and beyond. I have made 5 records and 2 Eps. It has been, and continues to be one hell of a ride. Now that I have two little boys to run after, I can\u0027t be out on the road like I used to be. It is not fair of me to ask my wild boys to sit in car seats all day and then get out and be good house guests. It\u0027s hard enough to get them to sit at the table. They need baths, bedtimes and a sandbox. Therefore, I am learning how to sleep in the same bed every night, keep my kitchen clean and to not drive for hours every day witnessing the world fly by in all it\u0027s golden glory. I am learning how to maintain my artist self, while balancing my most important role, motherhood. I am still working on it...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo here is where this project comes in: touring was my way of making a living - a somewhat small one, but a living nonetheless. I plan to continue creating and sharing music for the rest of my days and I would like to invite you to continue listening. Thanks to the internet and Patreon we can be more connected than ever. I will use this site as the primary stage for my art at this stage in my life and I would be honored to see you in the audience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019d like to be a part of my artistic living, please sign up at any level. Your participation will make this whole thing way more fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s how it works: you sign up over there down below, and choose how much patronage you would like to give per piece of art I release on the site. You can set a monthly cap, so no matter how much you pledge per release and how prolific I am per month, your contribution never exceeds your monthly cap. Contributions are all collected at the same time, at the end of the month, so you\u2019ll only see one charge per month no matter how much activity there is. Meanwhile, your support will help me care for my family and have time to continue contributing music into the world. The content here is not necessarily exclusive, however this is where it will appear first. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey say you can\u2019t have anything unless you ask for it. Well, I am asking for a show of hands. If you\u2019d like to be a part of this, please sign up at any level. I appreciate your support so deeply.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, check out my other small business...\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.folkpotions.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFOLK POTIONS\u003c/a\u003e.

     "about": "As the second daughter of a country music historian and a Jewish poet, Americana musician and songwriter Raina Rose revels in sharing  with you her beautifully twisted, yet refreshingly optimistic perspective on the world. Her unique voice and exceptional guitar playing transcend age, gender, generation, and even catch the ears of  those who aren\u0027t typically into acoustic guitar-driven songwriting. With a naturalist\u0027s eye, an artist\u0027s pen, and a lion\u0027s attack, Raina  lays everything she has on the line; she makes you feel as if she\u0027s your best friend whispering a honeysuckle-sweet secret in your ear, warmly inviting you into a joyfully intimate and darkly candid conversation. It\u0027s that ability to forge her own path in the world of music that sets Raina apart from her contemporaries, and her \u201cno holds barred, lay it on the line\u201d brand of Americana that secures Raina\u2019s place in music history as more than a mere footnote or a passing trend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn in Reagan-era Los Angeles, Raina moved to Portland, OR with her  family in 1988. Growing up in a house alive with \u201860s pop and good ole\u0027 fashioned country music, Raina was given a guitar at age eleven and sent around the corner for lessons. By the time she hit high school\u2014attending the same school as Elliott Smith and Matt Groening\u2014Raina more often than not shined classes to write heart-wrenching teenage love songs in Portland\u0027s lush, green public parks. Upon graduating, Raina moved to the Oregon coast and taught environmental science to youngsters while basking in the majestic silence of 500 acres of ancient forest and foggy beachfront. It was the blissful solitude of this Thoreau-ian lifestyle that made Raina realize she wanted to make music for people, to sing for a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the rain-soaked earth and woodsmoke still dancing in Raina\u2019s heart and wafting into each of her songs, Raina returned to Portland to record The Gypsy Moths (2003), a collaboration between Raina and her longtime best friend, Meredith Cushing. The band was a series of  hilarious mishaps and beautiful harmonies; but time always marches on, and sometimes bands don\u0027t. In 2006, Raina released her first solo  record, Despite the Weight of Crushing Gravity, a stunning debut produced by Jim Brunberg at Portland-based Mississippi Studios. The album received rave reviews and quickly propelled Raina into demand on the US touring circuit. Raina\u0027s 2007 sophomore effort, The Prophet, The Panhandler, and The Moon, is a lovely, lilting, country-esque record, complete with fiddle \u0026amp; accordion and featuring such master musicians as guitarist Tony Furtado and bassist Will Amend. Its release came hot off the heels of Raina\u2019s earning finalist honors in the 2007 Kerrville Folk Festival new folk competition. Her third album, End of Endless False Starts, released in 2009 and produced by Los Angeles based songwriting savant, John Elliott, was yet another critically acclaimed collection of original songs, selected as one of Performing Songwriter magazine\u2019s \u201cTop 12 DIY picks.\u201d In 2010, Raina released her 5th album, When May Came. Recorded live and with a full band over four sweltering September days in Austin, TX, the album was a journey into uncharted realms of creativity\u2014and the result was an incredibly soulful and lyrically potent collection of songs that reviewers have celebrated. Redefine Magazine declared that the album \u201cwill surprise you with its cohesion and simplicity. Between her big voice, with its unusual blend of twang and jazziness, and her whimsical sense of storytelling, Rose is definitely not just another boring indie folk songstress.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 Raina and her bass player husband Andrew Pressman made a record at Church House Studios in East Austin. They ran a kickstarter campaign that garnered 645 backers and $20,000 in pres-sales to make their most recent and most mature, intimate record to date, CALDERA. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The former Portlander has been turning heads for several years now,  with her clear, almost delicate voice and storyteller\u2019s soul. With a new album coming out in February, a rapidly growing pile of accolades and a seemingly endless tour on the books, it won\u2019t be long before she\u2019s no longer our little secret.\" -- Barbara Mitchell, The Oregonian\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Raina Rose is a vocal and guitar powerhouse.\"\u003cbr\u003e-- Jeff Rosenberg, Willamette Week\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
