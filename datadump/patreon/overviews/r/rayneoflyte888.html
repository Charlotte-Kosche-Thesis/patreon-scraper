    "summary": "Since starting this channel back in 2008 at the age of 15 years old, I have learned so much about the world and it\u0027s secrets. I am now 25 years old. Some of you remember videos that I had on this channel many years back, however, they were eventually removed from Youtube. In the beginning, I was releasing videos that revolved more around various conspiracy theories, and hope to continue to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Some of the most mind-blowing and informative pieces of literature ever documented in the history of man, is what I refer to as \"The Hidden Books of the Bible\". Not only is this information extremely important for both believers and non-believers to take into account; but I also believe that it helps bridge the gaps between atheism, skepticism, and theism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My mission is to provide an audio narration of as many Biblical Books as possible. But not just Biblical Books, many other books within different genres.\u00a0I will add that reading these books and making videos is quite a daunting and stressful task, more-so than you would think. Not only do I have to read the book as clear and fluently as possible word for word, but the books are often hard to read due to the (Hebrew --\u0026gt; English) translation which results in numerous retakes of a chapter simply because I messed up a single word. Which causes a hindrance in the flow of my reading. Not to mention the video cuts \u0026amp; editing. Some nights I will go sleepless. But all in all, I never give up and I\u0027ll never stop pushing out these videos for you guys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your donation to \"RayneofLyte Productions\" is greatly appreciated and ensures an ongoing flow of successful audio narration uploads. These extra funds will provide for better equipment, and perhaps a better setup for content creation. Thank-you kindly!\u003cbr\u003e"
