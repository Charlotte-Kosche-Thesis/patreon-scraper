    "summary": "My goal in creating a Patreon account is to accomplish putting together an exhibit of my art to be displayed at a local coffee shop. \u00a0Today I scheduled a confirmed date with my local Starbucks here on Fairview RD. Simsonville, SC. \u00a0I will be showing my own original art for the entire month of September, 2017! \u00a0I\u0027m super excited to get started and ready to throw up all at the same time, LOL! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, we\u0027re confirmed and on the calendar and I would love to have you on board for the duration of the show! Of course there are many more ideas and goals to come however, for me, I need to focus on one strongly set goal at a time, accomplish it, and then move on to setting and knocking down the next goal. \u00a0Until pretty soon you look back at all that demolition and say, whoooooaaa! \u00a0my patrons and I really accomplished a lot this month, or this quarter, or this year or whatever, you get the idea :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe contributions are strictly on a per-creation based and for this community, that means $1 gets you access to all the posts for the life of the project, through the end of the event on September 30, 2017. \u00a0I hope you will join me in the process and the journey and join my community to #BecomeAFlower. \u00a0If you are looking for a physical reward, then the $30 per-creation level may be for you. All Flowers at that level get all the rewards of the previous level however, they will also receive a portfolio of prints from the #StarbucksArtShow. \u00a0All prints will be 5\" x 7\" in size or larger. \u00a0We\u0027ll decide specific sizes for each one as I complete the pieces and make the final choices as to what to display and what to leave out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you in advance for your consideration and would love to know your thoughts on this type of platform for a Patreon Community.\u003cbr\u003eBig Hugs!!\u003cbr\u003eakaReeah.\u003cbr\u003e"
