We believe that creative expression is a method of exploring the deep truths and complexities of life, it\u2019s also a means with which to see ourselves through the colorful mirror of art, openness and love. This, in direct opposition with the cold reflection we\u2019re shown from the fear-based business of mass-culture-appeal media in an attempt to keep us depleted, exhausted and under the spell of faux-happiness through over consumption, buying, watching and numbing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to create a space here for expression, for being truly awake and alive, and for our and your creativity to be sparked -- for the music to raze the maze of homogeneity and raise a spiritual awakening through art -- one real, intimate and creative moment at a time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThrough Patreon we want to create, share, connect, and do it all over again. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon project is going to be a living, breathing, ever-changing experiment and you\u2019re an integral part of it.
