    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m the Rambling Rubbisher (folks call me Rub for short), and I write on-line reviews about public garbage receptacles. People always ask, \u201cWhat\"? My on-line reviews, besides their unfocused self-deprecating worthlessness (a.k.a. rambling rubbish), also grant me the ability to justify traveling the country, riding my bicycle, and picking up garbage (a.k.a. rambling rubbishing). See what I did there?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt can absurdly be called a travel-blog centered around publicly available garbage bins and bicycle culture, but I\u0027ll leave that up to you. Maybe someday, there will be practical and informative aspects to the reviews. For now, it\u0027ll be generic observations at best. At worst it will slide into acerbic dissertations of social commentary and possibly dark brooding humor. But maybe not. The Rub is upbeat. The Rub ain\u0027t a hater. Seriously though, the Rub\u0027s cerebral outputs might not be suitable for all audience members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn summation, if you like my reviews or you like the idea that old Rub is out there cleaning up the world, hook me up on patreon.com. Your patronage will help me make trips and upgrade equipment. Who knows, your city could be next! Thank you so much, and as is printed on my business card, \u201cEvery little bit helps.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethe Rambling Rubbisher\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. If you see me out there in your city, give a thumbs up, and think of something nice you can do for somebody else. Then keep doing the latter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.P.S. Hello there. My name is Craig, and I live in Eugene, Oregon. This rubbisher persona writing reviews nonsense is my sincere attempt to monetize a peculiar activity of mine. Over the last four years, I have cycled thousands of miles around Eugene, Oregon picking up trash with a grabber stick. I have averaged about one bicycle basket every day, if not more. The reviews are content that I am creating because it needed to be something to fit the criteria. I have no clue where this is going to end up, but I can tell you the pictures of baskets of garbage are not going to stop. It is a blessing and a curse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Rub said above, your patronage will help me make trips and upgrade equipment. However, I have other designs that will certainly manifest if this continues in a positive direction. From developing real world technical solutions for waste management to outreach and education. This endeavor can certainly end up in interesting places. This is the part where I say, stay tuned.  Even if you don\u0027t believe me, I\u0027m at least out there picking up trash. That has to be worth a dollar per month donation, yes? :)\u003cbr\u003e"
