    "summary": "HI THERE! I commend you for making it this far. My name\u0027s rob, and I draw comics. I\u0027ve been publishing them online and in print for over 15 years, creating everything from guilty-pleasure \u0027shoujo-manga\u0027-esque dramedies to NSFW short stories to free verse involving a guy who likes to eat hearts. Crazy, right? You betcha.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComics, and art in general, are my life. At any given time, I am working on a story--in fact, I currently have three different web comics online, and I have a handful more waiting in the wings. Unfortunately, the real world likes to step in and take precious creative time away from me in the form of a physically-demanding day job and general adult responsibilities (adulthood, amirite?). And because of that, I don\u0027t get to update as frequently as I\u0027d like. I\u0027ve had to take a rather long hiatus from updating, and I\u0027m trying to get back into the swing of things. I\u0027m currently working on a comic called \"The San Diego Conquest\" (posted previously on here as \u0027The Big Con\u0027), and would love more than anything to post more on here as well. I started this Patreon account last year in the hopes of being able to ease off on the day job and devote more time to my passion, creating stuff for you fabulous people. While I realize at this point in my life that comics cannot be my full-time job, I\u0027d love to keep up with it as a \u0027fun-time\u0027 job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned in the video, I\u0027ve set this up as sort of a tip jar for now, but in the future I\u0027d like to potentially use the money to fund printed versions of Project O and The Heart Collector, and reprints of older comics like Ganbare! Shimura-san. It will also help cover daily expenses while I heal from an upcoming (October 2016) surgery. My web comics will always be free to view up on Tapastic and SmackJeeves, and there is absolutely no obligation to donate, but if you can spare a buck or two every month, it\u0027ll help me get one step closer to being able to do comics more often, and in return, you\u0027ll get super-awesome exclusive content that nobody else will get the chance to see. I guarantee that all proceeds will go towards financing my artistic endeavors and living expenses while I heal. Check out the goals and rewards to see more of why becoming my Patron might be a spiffy idea!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re new to my work, check out these nifty links to my current comics and art portfolio!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://robinalan.daportfolio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eart portfolio\u003c/a\u003e (includes portraits, samples of past comic work, and commission info)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/THC/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Heart Collector\u003c/a\u003e (short horror story written in the form of free-verse, soon to be posted for download here!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/Project-O/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eProject O\u003c/a\u003e (retro-future series that takes place in an alternate version of the 1960s.
