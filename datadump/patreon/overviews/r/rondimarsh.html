    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello Partreon Supports who love music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you help me share my album \"The Pink Room\" through supporting a \nradio and PR promotion campaign? Credible campaigns cost $3,000 to $4,000. Can \nyou help get the exposure I feel my work deserves? I have seen my record\n to completion. It has been a long 4\n year journey of arranging, recording, editing, mixing, mastering and \ndesigning but I need your support to give this project wings with a \nradio and PR campaign. If I raise money beyond that the support will go to help cover the expenses that went in the initial recording of the album or will go towards a video creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The Pink Room\" album liner notes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere is nothing more joyful and bittersweet\nthan falling in and out of love. One day you\u2019re seeing the stars, the next\nyou\u2019re cursing the darkness. Rondi Marsh\u2019s \u201cPink Album\u201d is the soundtrack for\nmodern love and the full range of emotions that it stirs in our hearts and\nminds. Graceful, poised, and enchanting, Rondi delivers a rousing and\nfirst-rate performance, breathing new life into vintage, classy tunes that will\nmake you hear them afresh and anew. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cFlamingo,\u201d the famed jazz standard, begins\nwith a gentle and colorful flute solo by Wouter Kellerman, giving way to\nRondi\u2019s lush voice that fills each register with gravity and heart. Though she\nsings about a flamingo flying like a plane, it\u2019s truly her voice that soars\nabove the rest. \u201cMisty\u201d is an upbeat rendition of the 1954 composition by\nErroll Garner in which Rondi and the violin have a thoughtful musical\ninterchange. \u201cBoy on a Dolphin\u201d is originally from the 1957 romantic film Greece in which\nthe statue of a Greek boy is featured prominently. On this song, Rondi sings\npoignantly about how love is an article of belief, which can turn even\ninanimate objects into those deserving our attention. \u201cSlow Hot Wind\u201d and \u201cSlap\nThat Bass\u201d are two standards that feature Rondi\u2019s breadth, both musically and\nstylistically, as she doesn\u2019t just sing these songs but inhabits them, infusing\nthem with personal experience and emotional depth.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can\u2019t but help tap your foot to the vivid\n\u201cMambo Italiano\u201d or sway to the sensual \u201cAngel Eyes.\u201d Yet it is \u201cBlack Denim\nTrousers and Motorcycle Boots\u201d that will have you grinning from ear-to-ear. A\nduet with \u201cWanz,\u201d the rendition is exquisite with the forward-pulsing rhythms,\nas if you can hear the traffic bustling down the expressway \u2013 next stop love\n(or heartbreak)! \u201cWalk On Over\u201d is Rondi\u2019s original composition, a well-crafted\nblues, with rich harmonies and a \u201cgypsy jazz\u201d aesthetic that she describes as a\n\u201cflirtatious fun song.\u201d That it is, and the unfolding story makes you listen\nintently, curious as to whether the hide-and-seek of romance will reveal itself\nin full. \u201cLast Call\u201d is an appropriate ending track as Rondi sings about that\nlonely feeling that absorbs and inflicts us all, as we wait on someone we love\nor wish to love. It\u2019s a tasteful and refined song that paints an affecting and\nnostalgic feeling.\u003cbr\u003e\nGorgeous and grand, beautiful and bittersweet,\nThe Pink Room will envelop you with Rondi\u2019s sophisticated mind and supersized\nheart. A dazzling and brilliant production.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eKabir Sehgal\u003cbr\u003e\nNew York Times bestselling author\u003cbr\u003e\nMulti-Grammy Award Winner\u003cbr\u003eDear Patreon supporter.\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eSo what has been going on so far with these recordings? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe single I released of \"Black Denim Trousers and Motorcyle Boots\" was on the initial Grammy ballot last year for \"Best Roots Song Performance\" and \"Best Music Video\" for the whiteboard video that went with the song. This year my song \"Flamingo\" is on the ballot for Best Pop Solo Performance.\u00a0 So....I must be doing something right!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my hope that\u00a0 \"The Pink Room\" album will eventually have wings to fly. This album is different than anything I have done in the past. It is mostly tunes from the American Songbook that are performed in a gypsy jazz pop genre style.\u00a0 There are songs from Gershwin, Mancini, Leiber and Stoller, Danny O\u0027Keefe, myself and some songs that are a little more obscure such as \"Boy on A Dolphin\" from Sophia Loren\u0027s first movie.The musicians on this album are stellar musicians from the Yakima and Seattle area. At the core of my production are three of the amazing musicians from Pearl Django to give it that gypsy jazz vibe (David Lange on Accordion; Neil Andersson on guitars; Michael Gray on violin).\u00a0 I have other guest artists contributing to the songs as well. Grammy winning South Aftrican floutisit Wouter Kellerman is showcased on the song \"Flamingo\". Michael Wansley of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis\u0027s hit \"Thrift Shop\" is featured on last years single \"Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots\" . Other fantastic musicians include: Brent Irwin on trumpt, Ed Ullman on trombone, Jeff Chang on alto sax, Bart Roderick and Dave Gross on keys, Don Kinney and Aaron Hennings on drums. Photographer Tonja Gabryshak has taken some really cool pictures of the actual Pink Room where I got the name of the album from which will be a part of the packaging production and she has worked on the album design to completion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e==================================================\u003cbr\u003eKari Gaffney,\nPromoter\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eKari-On\nProductions, LLC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eradio and press promotions, social outreach\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2016 Nominee for Promoter of the Year Jazzweek\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWHAT YOU GET:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022 Professionally Designed One Sheet (with your artwork\nfiles from CD \u2013 logos and pictures) \u2013 a black and white bio does not create the\ntype of professional #brandequity or impact needed to brand your release as a\nviable product.
