Historically, video game consoles produced on cartridges stored the game data (code, graphics, sound etc.) on \u0027ROM\u0027 (Read Only Memory) chips, hence where the name of the site comes from. It was founded in 2005 and is currently the largest site of its kind in the world. It is home to thousands of projects for hundreds of games on all your favorite classic video game consoles. Browsing our content, you may see patches that provide all new levels, new music, new characters, or even new abilities for your favorite console game. You might also find a fan translation patch in your language for a game you\u0027ve never seen before. Maybe you\u0027re interested in learning how it is all done. If so, we have documents and utilities for that too! The possibilities are endless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Data Crystal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://datacrystal.romhacking.net\"\u003eData Crystal\u003c/a\u003e is our separate general wiki site containing ROM maps, RAM maps, and other technical information reverse engineered from many video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do We Need You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over 11 years, we have worked hundreds of hours and spent thousands of dollars to provide a home for the ROM hacking community, never asking for anything in return.  We have provided a home for thousands of great community projects and learning resources. We\u0027ve joined ROM hackers and translators. We\u0027ve united international communities together to assemble the largest global force of ROM hackers on the planet! We\u0027ve developed a central hub and platform to share, discuss, and distribute your ROM hacking creations. We have processed nearly 40,000 submissions! Don\u0027t forget about the Data Crystal wiki too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost people take for granted what it takes to run a site of this magnitude. They visit, consume, and request, ever expecting more without a single pause to think about how much personal time and money was given to make that experience possible. The site grows larger every single day. It has now become an unsustainable reality for the site owner and a few select community donations to provide the development and financial resources needed. We are losing the fight against limited resources and are calling for reinforcements. The site now demands more. YOU demand more. We need you to take that pause now and think...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClose your eyes. Imagine that tomorrow ROMhacking.net and Data Crystal disappeared forever. Imagine thousands of patches, utilities, and interesting forum projects were lost to time. Imagine people no longer having a central resource location to learn the trade, or share their latest projects. Now imagine all of the data in the Data Crystal shattered into millions of pieces never to be put back together again. Maybe you could find some things on Google, in old archives, or on other sites. However, try as you may you\u0027d never be able to replace the many years worth of great things found only on ROMhacking.net. Scary, we know! Open your eyes now. We don\u0027t want that to happen either. So, now is the time for you to do your part and make your contribution. Help preserve years worth of work by thousands of community members. Help preserve the years of development efforts to provide the ROMhacking.net platform. Help the site continue to develop, prosper, and grow for future visitors (maybe even your kids!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIsn\u0027t ROMhacking.net and Data Crystal worth supporting? We think so too. We also think it\u0027s worth a tiny bit more to not only keep it around, but also allow for it to grow, improve, and reach new heights! This can only happen with your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow your support will help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst and foremost, you will directly ensure we remain online and operational. We need a stable funding source to continue operating. We currently have no other source of income to meet our ever-growing resource requirements or fund further site development. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp us put resources into servers. Anyone that was around for any of our extended outages will know that our current bottom-dollar operations are sub-par (to say the least) whenever something goes wrong. We are at or near capacity every day and need to make an expensive leap to better dedicated hardware, managed services, off-site backups, redundancy controls, and other modern services. This exponentially increases costs and this will not happen without adequate funding. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt will fund further development of the site. There is a long list of features and design improvements just waiting to be done. Without adequate funding, development will likely cease. It\u0027s a major undertaking, the code base contains 11 years of challenges. The database has thousands of hack entries, game entries, credits, reviews, etc. Some items date back to The Whirlpool (historical predecessor site). There are many tools for the submission and approval processes, and much more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSeveral areas of the site require professional design and/or development assistance.
