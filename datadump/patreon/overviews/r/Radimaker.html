Life can feel like a prison for both in so many ways. It feels like a 3rd party is stealing from you what others take for granted without a thought. A dance, a walk, a kiss, a smile, a trip somewhere nice, dreams, goals, plans, happiness. But, then you realize when you get that brief moment of joy or peace, it is more powerful than everyone else enjoys. It is like starving and getting a bite of your favorite meal when dirt would have done just fine. This fight has made us stronger than anyone could ever know. All we want is to be free from this rat race, to live the way we want to, to do what we want to do. That way being, one that can not and will never produce a victim. It is bad enough that we are limited in the ways that we are. But then the government comes in and makes what is possible, illegal. We have no choice but to fight even harder, inward and outward.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAll we want to do is go off-grid, provide for ourselves on land we own. Adhere to the Gerson treatment and a 100% raw organic diet, build an earth home and aquaponics system, grow cannabis for (non-psychoactive) CBD oil treatments, and not go to jail for things like, collecting rainwater and/or bartering items like... Raw Milk, Eggs. We just want to be left alone. Mostly to enjoy our friends and other loved ones while we still have time here on earth. Time is the most valuable thing a person has. If we talk to you know the reason is enough to propel \"us\" to spend it on you. Every moment I am not in her arms kills me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not like boxes. We all live in boxes within boxes upon boxes. I want to live in a circle, not a box. We are all trapped in this box you see right now, in the box of your browser, in the box of your monitor or smartphone, sitting at a box table, in the box room, in the box house, on the boxed property, on the boxed block you live or work on. Once you get past that, things start getting interesting to me. I need a lot of nature most of my time, to deal with the way of life we all struggle in. I travel for the film and I just help people never knowing how we are going to make it month to month, but somehow we do, thanks to some great people out there and the small jobs I can pull off between moments of our greater goals.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTraveling without my wife and seeing beautiful things without her is one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. It makes the more beautiful of a site I see without her, actually hurt. That is my prison. Why do I do what I do? When I lost my career I was very very bored and lost myself, I decided to be the help I needed, for others. I started doing things without the thought or concept of gaining or prospering, just to help change things in the messed up world, to help spread information and help build collaboration networks that focus more on direct-action that keep a \"just do it mentality\". I have been working outside of the system, I have not had a bank account in 15 years. I currently use PayPal for my centralized banking needs (Payments \u0026amp; Direct deposits) and I use Crypto-Currencies for my personal needs and finances.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWords of Wisdom:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\"Make a mental note of whatever offends you, and ask yourself who programmed you to respond that way \" because it is in no way natural to become manic and emotional when presented with largely abstract concepts. Many people become very angry about certain issues, and take on an almost militant attitude about issues that have nothing at all to do with their own lives. This type of behavior, once limited to heavily dogmatized religious adherents and communists, has made way into the mainstream of culture, and if one is able to recognize and acknowledge it in oneself, this leads to a dynamic paradigm shift. Again, all revolution must come to you by way of fearless and brutally honest self-analysis. Learning to accept and admit fault is key; one also must never set boundaries on one\u0027s own perception. No single article, link, blog, book, or library, can provide a truly comprehensive understanding of what is going on here on this satellite called Earth, because understanding is something that can\u0027t be given, received or memorized, but must be autonomously produced within your own consciousness.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIn closing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be using all funds raised here to help pay for a modest cost of living, allowing me to continue to work on the projects mentioned above.
