For the longest time I\u0027ve been wanting to work on a mock-concept project inspired by Visual Novel type games that I can easily share. Since I am not creating a physical game, production time is much more lenient without having to deal with all the assets I would not be able to handle by myself. However, whatever it is that I can handle is more than enough to get content out to viewers who will be able to enjoy my stories and concept work, as well as follow it as if it were an actual visual novel game (or at least that is what I intend).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, this type of work still requires a lot of time as well as money in order to support myself for a living, so any bit of support from my Patrons would do a lot for me, as well as keep me enabled to continue developing my world project, as well as release new ones in the future if I end up completing this one. Funds will mainly be going to paying off my school debt, which is my main focus. Supporting me will allow you as a supporter to continue seeing me update/release new content of my project, ranging from concept designs, artwork, story, and other types of development.\u003cbr\u003e I will also release exclusive content for my Patrons such as merchandise and exclusive series-themed character designs/adoptable previews before they are posted to dA for reaching certain milestones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[Supporting Through Patreon]\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron-related charges/payments will only be made per update vs per month, with 3-4 updates per month AT MOST, so you will only be billed when there is an update. You may set up a monthly billing cap or edit your billing method whenever or however it will suit your needs. Setting a monthly cap will keep you from being billed more than you would be able to pay during a month\u0027s worth of updates, so please check your billing methods carefully.\u003c/div\u003e"
