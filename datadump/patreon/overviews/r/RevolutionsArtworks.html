    "summary": "Thank you for taking the time to read about my art and for considering how to support it. I have worked as a full-time artist for more than 25 years, and I love what I do. But it has never been easy from a financial aspect. I\u0027ve always had the dilemma that my work is very labor intensive, and therefore, it is difficult to create enough pieces to sustain myself. There is always a limit to what I can earn, because in addition to creating pieces, I have to spend time at shows and galleries to sell my work. It\u0027s a juggling act to balance production, marketing and sales. (If only I could clone myself . . . I have often thought.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have always done whatever it takes to get by, including taking part-time jobs. Through this site I hope to have the freedom to create more art with less financial pressure. Thank you again! Your support is greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArtist Statement:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eUsing\nalabaster and exotic woods,  I seek to expose nature\u2019s inherent\nbeauty to enhance or even become the focal point of my work.  This\nideal blending of human imagination with nature allows me to\nhave infinite artistic possibilities. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Alabaster is an amazingly beautiful\nmaterial that comes in a wide variety of colors and unusual veining. \n Using this wonderful media, I turn bowls and hollow vessels on the\nlathe.  One of the most astonishing qualities of alabaster is its\ntranslucency.  Therefore, I shape my work in elegant graceful lines\nto allow the beauty of the stone to shine through.This is best\nachieved with the simplest of forms.\u003cbr\u003e"
