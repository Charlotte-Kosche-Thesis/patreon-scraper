    "summary": "My name is Rivers Solomon and I write about life in the margins, where I\u0027m much at home. I\u0027m reaching out to the community for help so that I can get support to keep doing what I\u0027m doing: making art that challenges the status quo and uplifts the voices and stories the world tries to silence.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a focus on speculative fiction - sci-fi, fantasy, magical realism, fabulism, afrofuturism - I create stories that paint a future (and sometimes a past) where society\u0027s most disenfranchised are front and center. I believe the histories of LGBTQ+ people, Black and Brown people, of disabled and sick people, of poor people, of women, are the stuff sci-fi is made of. We are Frankenstein\u0027s monster, and we will make our pained roar heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy novel \u003cem\u003eAn Unkindness of Ghosts\u003c/em\u003e, pitched as a \"science fiction meditation on intergenerational trauma, race, and identity, where a woman traces the connection between the mysterious death of her ship\u0027s sovereign and the disappearance of her mother a quarter-century before,\" is out now! You can find it wherever books are sold! Though I\u0027m blessed to have a wonderful agent and to have published a novel, the income from that is just not enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because my family needs to live. I\u0027m a disabled writer who works park-time as a TA and stays at home with me and my (severely disabled) partner\u0027s two-year-old. I also do freelance writing to help make ends meet, and have essays in The Rumpus, the New York Times, Paste Magazine, and forthcoming in Guernica and others! However, it\u0027s NOT enough to stay afloat. Due to my illness, I am unable to work full-time (and even if I did, it would not be enough to support us).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt heals. Stories heal. I want to do my part in that important, valuable work, but to do that I need support. I\u0027m thankful for every bit anyone can contribute. I will provide short-short stories (think flash fiction), art edits/digital art, and short essays here. I cannot promise it will always be monthly, but I will do my very best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Header art is by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cargocollective.com/zea\"\u003eZea Barker\u003c/a\u003e, which was drawn to accompany an essay I wrote called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://therumpus.net/2016/11/damned-and-damaged-vessels/\"\u003eDamned and Damaged Vessels\u003c/a\u003e at The Rumpus, about portrayals of Black motherhood and sci-fi and fantasy).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Header image features a series of stylized portraits in reddish ink on beige background of the character Queen Akasha from Queen of the Damned, sci-fi author Octavia Butler, the character of the First Slayer from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and character Michonne from the Walking Dead.]\u003cbr\u003e"
