    "summary": "Hi, my name is R. D. Lawrence. I write under the pen name of Rand Law. Almost everyone I know calls me R.D. at least friends and martial artist do. I have dedicated my life to training and writing about the martial arts and now fiction. Before that\u00a0I worked in law enforcement, personal protection, business management, charity fundraising, farm labor, construction and as a paper boy primarily in reverse order but not exclusively so. I came to Patreon on a lark because I thought it might help with marketing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have loved reading and writing since my youth.\u00a0My background in writing started first as a reader, which I began before kindergarten. By sixth grade I was writing stories that my homeroom teacher read to my classmates as a reward for completing assignments. This recognition from teachers continued as I went on to other schools as well. Likewise, my martial arts instruction began around the sixth grade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned I write both fiction and non fiction kindle books. My Dream Walker story line primarily utilizes a Lee Stanislavsky like system, (experiential based). My fictional stories are a bit of a m\u00e9lange of adventure, and science fiction; with an essence of mystic experiences as a core element in all of my Dream Walker book series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy fictional series begins with three separate views of life. Each of the three main characters explore the possibilities of what might have happened, (Xander Davidson). To (Jace Lee), which covers what could have happened (if dream meditation carried over into the material world). Finally concluding with (Ruger Jackson),\u00a0who brings us to a semblance of balance. Each book in the series reveals their struggles as they work to make a life  for themselves and elude those that seek to use and control them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally I would like to thank everyone who has followed my blogs and books. So far this is the great Derek Chin a martial artist (and a San Francisco realtor extraordinaire). For his patronage I wrote a charater based on him into my storyline. Let me know if you spotted me on Patreon too!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
