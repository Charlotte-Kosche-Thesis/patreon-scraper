    "summary": "Welcome to Escaping Atheism.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Max Kolbe and I head up a group of Non-Atheists we call \"little-o orthodox.\" Not all of us are ready to come forward with our identities, but we are all highly learned in science, philosophy, history, and believe in God. We also think organized religion is superior to non-organized or personal religion. But we also think virtually all serious religions, as well as Non-Atheist or what they call theistic philosophies, are superior to Atheism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think modern Atheism has become a warped political and social ideology--a mind-numbing, thought-terminating, science-denying, evidence-denying ideology that harms the individuals afflicted with it, the people around them, and society as a whole. Modern Atheism is a social disaster that needs to be fought. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also think it\u0027s time to start denying Atheists what Richard Dawkins called \"conversational tolerance.\" We think people should mock Atheism, and be intolerant of the frequently stupid things Atheists claim, like \"Atheism is not a belief it\u0027s merely lack of belief\" or \"there is no evidence for God\" or \"religion causes conflict but Atheism doesn\u0027t\" or \"science has invalidated the need for religion\" or \"Atheism isn\u0027t ideological.\" All of those are ideological views, and all of them are unscientific, unprovable, and often literally go against the evidence. In short, all those common Atheist beliefs are demonstrably false.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also frankly think that inflicting Atheism on people is abuse. We think it\u0027s especially bad when Atheism is inflicted on children, and should be called Child Abuse. You\u0027re better of with a child raised a Hindu or a Shintoist than raised an Atheist.\u003cbr\u003eWe have almost no money and no resources, so we\u0027re building everything up from scratch.  But we\u0027re going to do YouTube videos, blog posts on EscapingAtheism.com, microblogging to educate and debate Atheists as well as mock them--because Atheists absolutely deserve mocking and derision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want your help. We need your help. Whether it\u0027s your Patreon donations or your volunteer efforts or anything else. Atheism and Atheist assumptions now rule most of our popular culture, our entertainment, and much of our government, with Atheism privileged as the supposedly \"Rational\" view and everyone else\u0027s views set aside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we know there are ethical thoughtful compassionate and caring Atheists, we think it\u0027s obvious that the vast majority of ATheists are superstitious, pseudoscientific, superstitious, and closed-minded--and some are outright hateful. We think all this needs challenging and exposing, and we hope you\u0027ll join us in this initiative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need and wnat your help. Like, subscribe, donate, volunteer. Please, help join this cause. IT\u0027s time we as individuals, and a culture, Escape from dogmatic, mind-numbing, evidence-denying, science-denying, suffocating Atheism. And we hope you\u0027ll join us!\u003cbr\u003e"
