    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eRadio War Nerd Update\u2014\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt the end of last summer, we started these Radio War Nerd\npodcasts. Since then, the response has been fantastic. It seems like we can\nkeep this going and turn it into something with real strategic significance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt first we did a show every two weeks, but we promised that\nif the donations came in we\u2019d move to a weekly format. Well they did. And we\u2019ve\ngone weekly now, along with special extra episodes such as when Turkey shot\ndown the Russian Sukhoi, or our special interview with Guardian journalist\nJason Wilson on the Oregon standoff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks to your support for Radio War Nerd, we can devote\nmore attention and time to the one thing we all want to focus on\u2014wars. With\nyour help, we\u2019re getting closer to the real goal\u2014dropping all the dreary scary paycheck\ndistractions, and devoting everything to bringing you the world of war.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019re really just getting started\nsampling the rich vein of weird and gory in todays\u2019 wars. We have lots of ideas\nand above all bringing in new voices from parts of the world not often heard on\nthe air. To do that we\u2019ll need to make a few technical upgrades and I\u2019ll have\nto find a place to bunker up on a more permanent basis. This trudging around\nthe world losing bits of baggage like a SAM-hit Boeing is no way to run a War\nNerd Railroad (try saying that three times). Mark\u2019s been holding the fort in\nNYC while I bounce around southern Europe, but we hope that very soon we\u2019ll\nboth be in permanent reliable Comms rooms, a mere ocean apart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s exciting as hell and I just want to say I\u2019m really\ngrateful for the support. What with the ESL follies, my wife and I were\nbeginning to get the impression that we were Top of the Interpol Pops or\nsomething, and it warms the old ticker to learn that there are people out there\nwho want to hear from us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince we started these broadcasts, I have not been evicted\nfrom a single country. Keep the streak alive! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
