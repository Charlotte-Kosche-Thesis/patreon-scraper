    "summary": "Hi, it\u0027s me, that guy who makes those stupid mods that let you have aliens with classes, fight against humans with a really bad organization name, or have to face against rogue templars. (Although this one\u0027s a bit iffy at the moment.). If you\u0027re here from Battletech, I\u0027m currently that guy that makes it so machinegun bullets do nothing against a fully armoured mech head like you\u0027d expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore seriously, as you\u0027ve probably gotten through here, I\u0027m RealityMachina, maker of many (50+ by now) mods for Firaxis\u0027s XCOM 2, and expanding to Harebrained Schemes\u0027 Battletech. Unlike a lot of other modder\u00a0patreons, I\u0027m more focused on the programming-based stuff, I don\u0027t quite have any good screencaps to show off my mods, but chances are you\u0027ve seen someone like ChristopherOdd or Marbozir play a campaign with my mods installed, and have it subtly (or not so subtly)\u00a0alter how their campaign went.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like seeing that sort of stuff, feel free to contribute, even just $1 will be like a major fielday with me. Heck, might even post some in-progress stuff on here if there\u0027s enough people who take an interest in that sort of thing. (Don\u0027t expect it too frequently even then though, inspiration can strike me and leave me alone for varying periods of time.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor BattleTech Mods:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/10?tab=description\"\u003eLess Head Injuries\u003c/a\u003e - so your pilots only take injuries from actual serious hits to their mech\u0027s head, and not from machinegun rounds to an armoured head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/137?tab=description\"\u003eBasic Panic System\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e- You would figure that being surrounded by a full enemy lance while being the last survivor would give you some basic survival instincts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor War of the Chosen Mods:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1129661000\"\u003eThe MOCX Initiative\u003c/a\u003e - now using covert actions, and utilizing their own Psi-Operatives and Skirmishers, the MOCX Initiative is more dangerous as ever, especially when they can work with the Chosen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1123588800\"\u003eAllies Unknown: WotC Edition\u003c/a\u003e - this has been revamped from the vanilla/LW2 version.
