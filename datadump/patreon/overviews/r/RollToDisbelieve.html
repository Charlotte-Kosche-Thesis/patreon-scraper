    "summary": "Hi! Thanks for visiting my Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write the popular\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rolltodisbelieve\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRoll to Disbelieve\u003c/a\u003e blog on Patheos. I like writing in-depth posts that seek to understand the context for the sometimes confusing things we see coming out of the religious world lately. I also try to cover topics that will be of interest to people who are either coming out of a religious worldview or else trying to understand that worldview--like how to improve ourselves and how to escape and avoid harmful thought processes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO I AM\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an ex-Christian who was deeply immersed in the right-wing religious world. I was born and raised Catholic, but converted to a Southern Baptist Convention church in my teens and quickly moved on to a Pentecostal church, where I spent the next ten years. I even married a guy who wanted to be a preacher! I deconverted in my mid-20s (the mid-1990s), dumped the wannabe-preacher, and went on the lam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took a lot of time to really process my deconversion. I had a lot of time to think about what had happened and how I\u0027d gotten wrapped up in that stuff. I began hanging out on a forum for ex-Christians and discovered that I had a lot to say and share. I\u0027d been out of the country for a good part of that post-deconversion life, so I was especially alarmed when I returned to America and heard the news coming out about what right-wing Christian people in my home country were doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually I began blogging and the rest is history!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT YOUR KIND DONATION WILL ACCOMPLISH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI update several times a week, almost always brand-new content. I\u0027m also actively working on a book with more original content. Of course, I do other stuff for money to pay the bills. But I\u0027d rather be spending my time writing the blog or working on the book! Your donation will free me up from having to do that other stuff so I can concentrate on the book and blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIF YOU\u0027D RATHER DO A ONETIME THING\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a PayPal set up! You can donate whatever you like to the email address\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:captain_cassidy@yahoo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecaptain_cassidy@yahoo.com\u003c/a\u003e (and you can email me there too if you like), and I\u0027ll be very grateful and happy to see it."
