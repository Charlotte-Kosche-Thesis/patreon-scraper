    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHey There! Thanks SO much for stopping by!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a world full of talented artists, I appreciate you taking some of your precious time to check out my Patreon page! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Renata Carmen and I am relatively new to Cosplay. I have always been interested in it but was pretty shy and struggled with body image issues. So I watched from the sidelines.\u003cbr\u003eUntil 2012, when I started to struggle with health issues due to the onset of what would be diagnosed as Fibromyalgia. I was pretty sick and isolated as a result, and found an extreme catharsis through all aspects of books and film, including Cosplay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not new to film or performance arts, however. Ever since I was little I have learned various styles of dance, singing, acting, martial arts, and gymnastics. I\u0027m also a HUGE Gearhead! I hold certs in Automotive Technology and Welding \u0026amp; Fabrication and have hundreds of hours under various hoods on and off tracks. These artistic roots heavily influence my Cosplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m not content to simply look like the characters I am portraying\u003c/strong\u003e. I want to absorb them, to master voices and accents, write and direct my own short films, and even learn new skills, such as Aerial, just to imitate one scene, like the video below. It was my first time doing Cosplay, Aerial, and Dance together, on a complete set I had built myself, loaded with \"Easter Eggs\". The handmade beaded curtains alone took me hours to complete. Yeah, I\u0027ve fallen in deep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKRiWfLdFjs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen I mounted that homemade Aerial trapeze (don\u0027t try this at home! HaHa!) I had NO CLUE I was starting a new fitness routine/lifestyle, that would not only help improve the symptoms I deal with due to Fibro, but something I\u0027d become really good at. Compare the below vid to that above. Less time spent building the set, but you can see the vast improvements in my Cosplay and Aerial/Gymnastics skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZPhGpJaZJk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLittle did I know that this combination of obsessions: Crafting, Performance Arts, Cars, and Cosplay, would become a major part of my life. To the point I was willing to relocate from a place and people I\u0027d fallen in love with, to pursue my passions and better health back in my home city of Los Angeles. Where the accessibility\u00a0gives me leverage, and the climate vastly decreases my Fibromyalgia symptoms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iIy5-315x6A\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy current goals are to inspire and entertain through my many creative outlets. I would love to get to a point where I perform in front of large audiences and at big events. If I could pay my bills and support my loved ones and causes I care about in the process that would be the Ultimate for me, but for now, just breaking even on this expensive habit would be amazing. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have extensive experience with Events \u0026amp; Brand Building and Promotions, and Networking. Someday I would like to even throw my own \"Geeky Gearhead\" style events, but more on that later... ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI thrive off environments where artists come together to create something bigger than themselves. Collabs are one of my favorite things and I am in the process of bringing many fellow artists\u0027 visions to life and am just blown away that anyone would be inspired by me like I\u0027m inspired by them. That is one of the reasons I love sites like DeviantArt and Patreon, and sponsor several artists on here myself. So part of your generous donations here go directly to supporting other creative types as well!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you SO much for your time! Just by reading you provide support, but donations sure are helpful toooooo! ;) :) \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLove \u0026amp; Light - Renata \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.renatacarmen.com/\"\u003ewww.renatacarmen.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
