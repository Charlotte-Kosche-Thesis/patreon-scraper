I make art that invites you to come back to it again and again, and that promotes positive change in the world. \u00a0I\u0027m not interested in focusing on the ugly... even if the subject matter is hard, my aim is to find the hope within it, create awareness around it, and speak to the transformation possible through it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese shoots take time, money and research to create - my aim is to ultimately have them utilized by organizations that are making a positive difference for humanity and the planet we live on... and this is the best place I could think of to help make that happen.\u00a0I would love to have you come join me in this effort - at any level. We each \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e make a difference, and you can too...and best of all you get to take the journey with me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the best things about making these images are the people who support me in making them...from those who lend me props - or a vehicle to haul them in, to the talented HMUA\u0027s, stylists and designers who participate, to all the fans who cheer me on and respond with such enthusiasm - it is what keeps me motivated and inspired, and I cannot give enough thanks to every single one of them (they know who they are!) because I wouldn\u0027t be able to commit to this journey at this level without them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I will be posting all of my behind-the-scenes photos and videos, stories of the evolution of the ideas and the actual shoots (because each one has a story, and they kind of get life of their own at a certain point), and general musings about the process and inspiration. As a Patron you will get to be part of it, and I genuinely want to hear what you want to see more of - what has value for you, because that\u0027s the whole idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much love and appreciation,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuzanne\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "After several years of doing my conceptual/fine art work on the side, (in addition to my full time mainstream photography business), I decided that 2018 was my year to fully commit to this work, and to use it as a vehicle to bring attention to some of the issues that I feel need more conversation. Every shoot so far has been done on a shoestring - with all of the talent donating their time....but even so each one costs me anywhere from $500 to $1500 to create. \u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon goals are \u003cbr\u003e1. To create two fine art series in 2018 around social and women\u0027s issues and submit them to galleries and \u003cbr\u003e2. to raise enough to replace my aging computer (that can\u0027t keep up with the file sizes I\u0027m currently working on with composites) and \u003cbr\u003e3. By 2019 to be able to pay the other talents who work with me. (They currently get the images for their portfolio, which definitely has value, but they also deserve to be paid in addition to that).\u003cbr\u003eI am giving this everything I\u0027ve got, and my dream is to be doing this work full time by 2020. $1/month can make a big difference, and I will be posting all of my behind the scenes here, and other interesting musings about the themes I\u0027ll be shooting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so very much for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the journey with me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also follow me on Instagram @rothmeyerart",
