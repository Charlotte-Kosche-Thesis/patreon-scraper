    "summary": "Greetings my fellow bronies from around the world. For those of you who don\u0027t know me, I am Rated Ponystar, writer of various well known My Little Pony Fanfics such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.fimfiction.net/story/92801/why-am-i-crying\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhy Am I Crying\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.fimfiction.net/story/120494/the-assassination-of-twilight-sparkle\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Assassination of Twilight Sparkle\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.fimfiction.net/story/74679/treating-her-right\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTreating Her Right\u003c/a\u003e, and more. I also happen to be the writer, and commissioner, for various well known MLP Comics such as \u003ca href=\"http://rated-r-ponystar.deviantart.com/art/Angels-412336253\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAngels\u003c/a\u003e drawn by RatofDrawn, \u003ca href=\"http://drawponies.deviantart.com/art/Comic-Adapting-To-Night-Part-1-454009054\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAdapting To Night series\u003c/a\u003e drawn by Gray, and \u003ca href=\"http://jamescorck.deviantart.com/gallery/47407340/I-Will-Never-Leave-You\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eI Will Never Leave You\u003c/a\u003e drawn by Jamescorck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is to help me fund my MLP comic commissions since I sadly cannot draw. There are a lot of comic ideas I want to put out there for people to read, some of them are even series that I wish to do in the future. I\u0027m asking both fans of the series that I have created , fans of my work, and those who are just starting to my work, to help me fund my commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that this Patreon DOESN\u2019T support the Adapting To Night Series. If you wish to fund that one instead, please go here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/adaptingtonight?ty=h\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/adaptingtonight?ty=h\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit counts and this will be a\u00a0monthly patreon, although the more money I have the more comics I can get out as well as use more expensive and well known artists. The reason I do this is because I often commission more than one artist and if I get three comics done, I don\u2019t want to take money from you all three times. I\u0027ll be posting all my comics on this patreon, even ones that are done without patreon money or by being free\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the money you give to me will be commission money to give to to the artists. None of it will be kept myself (unless there is extra and I save it), and every comic that I used the money for will be posted on the Patreon. However, not EVERY comic I do will be funded by the Patreon, and I will not use the money to buy anything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNaturally, there will be rewards as well for those who donate. See below for details.\u003cbr\u003e"
