Simple as that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been producing material through several mediums for many years now and releasing it all on the internet for free. This started with music and has transitioned to cartoons and writing primarily.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows people who enjoy my work to support me financially in small amounts which frees up my time to create more content for everyone to enjoy and to a higher quality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e-\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rhathartist/\"\u003eCheck out the daily cartoons\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat content do I put out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post a new cartoon daily on Instagram as well as many other networks. These drawings tend to take an \u2018optimistic nihilism\u2019 approach, poking fun at the mundane and bringing all things in life into the realm of the absurd. If we can make a joke out of things it\u0027s easier to deal with them and take life a little less seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI release other work sporadically such as blogs post, youtube videos and other things. You can find that stuff on all my usual networks and i\u0027m sure you\u0027ll see more of it coming out as this patreon grows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI have a decent sized back catalogue of electronic music with hopefully more to come. This is all featured on Bandcamp as well with some releases floating around on major streaming services. My music isn\u2019t comedic in nature like my other work, though I\u2019d like to think its relatively interesting, so feel to check it out. If you like relaxed experimental house music there is some good stuff in there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhats the money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI heard it put well, that Patreon is like busking for the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI already create as much content as I possibly can at this point, and I just want to focus all my energy and time on it. Donations will go towards me creating more content and raise the quality of it all. You\u0027ll get access to some early stuff and forums which will allow you to get more involved with my work, so if that\u0027s exciting to you then sweet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThats all, not going to say too much more. Hit me up if you want to talk about what i\u2019m doing or anything else and thank you so much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e-Ry\u003cbr\u003e"
