    "summary": "Hey everyone I\u0027m Rizer. My band is called The Future Process, and we are working on our third self produced, full length album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo call my journey epic is really an understatement. It all started when I was about 5 years old. In Florida, the grocery store by my house had a promotion where they would give you a free classical record when you bought groceries. I would take the record home and listen to it over, and over. I got acquainted  with Mozart, Beethoven, Strauss, and all of the old greats. Hours would go by while I stared at the record player. Each time the record ended I had to have more so I would turn it over. This helped me develop an ear for it, and before long I was singing solo in the church choir.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I started to get older rock and roll was what it was all about. Jimi Hendrix, Iron Maiden, led Zeppelin, or anything I could get from my older brother. Before long it was all about heavy metal. I got a guitar for Christmas, and not surprisingly I was terrible at it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had lots of problems at home. I got into a lot of trouble, got stuck in some horrible brainwashing program, and ended living on and of the street for a few years. At 14 things started to even out with my home life, and I got my first drum machine. I lived in a small town so I had to talk my parents into driving me to the next county to buy it. Guitar and drum machine in hand I started cutting cassettes and doing my own metal vocals. Once again terrible! Eventually, after hearing EDM I got really into synthesizers, which was ok since all my metal friends wanted to play Metallica covers, and I wanted to write music. At the same time I was learning to program I had a little alternative rock band, and we were playing open mics and small parties. We had a lot of fun, and even got banned from the local open mic for starting mosh pits. \\m/ Metal AF for an alt rock group! \\m/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the time I was 18 I had accrued enough technical skill to work as a studio consultant. I ended up moving out to Colorado to escape South Florida. I got a job as a keyboard repair tech at a mom and pop in Denver. The local rave promoters welcomed me, so I started working at clubs. I was hanging out watching world class DJs like Qbert and Richy Hawtin from a few feet away! I really did not enjoy repairing keyboards, and the club work was slow. One day while at Guitar Center buying something one of the managers realized that I knew more about keyboards than anyone in the building, and offered me a job. While I was working at GC one of the guys I was working with told me that he knew someone who needed a keyboard player. The guy turned out to be Brian Steele from Gemini Syndrome. I ended up playing with Brian and Ivan Moody(of Five Finger Death Punch fame) in the band Toiz.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short I moved out to LA. Things did not work out for Toiz. While I was looking for a band I was going to like 5 auditions a week. I swear I went to every rehearsal complex in LA county. Walking into a room full of strangers and auditioning is a crazy thrill, and I have done it a few hundred times. I could tell you so many stories about those auditions! One of the high points was trying out fro The Apex Theory. They had recently had a video on TV, and they are totally pro players. I was 1 of 4 people who got a call back out of the 200 who auditioned. I played with Orange County pop band Bare Foot Bride for a while, and got to play some classic OC venues like Chain Reaction. We played Eon Copeland\u0027s (the famous music promoter) bar in Beverly Hills a few times. I actually got to hang with Eon a few times, and he was an awesome guy RIP. In the course of playing with bands in LA I also got the chance to play with Rail from Liars Inc. He is/was a pro who has toured the entire world opening for the Goo Goo Dolls. We were playing at Cole rehearsal down the hall from Wes Boreland (Limp Bizkit), and it was during this time that I really learned the craft of putting together songs. Another Highlight form this time was meeting Danny from Lost in Los Angeles. He and I really hit it off, and ended up hanging out and playing a lot. He is a super talented guy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ended up working on the sunset strip on the sound crew at the Whiskey a go go. This was in the days when From First to Last was just coming up, and I remember seeing Skrillex around town. He was literally no one at that point. Working at the Whiskey was fun, and Teeza is still my favorite boss to date. Plus I got to learn the ropes of being a live sound engineer from guys like Leonard who was Slayers tour engineer for a really long time. Meeting lots of famous people and living in Hollywood was fun, but I decided that being famous looked like a drag. I love to play and I could not afford to practice as much as I wanted to in LA, so I moved back to Florida to start The Future Process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I met Melissa AKA Riotgurl AKA the coolest keyboardist ever. After getting our first record \"Change\" done we went to Tampa to play venues like the state theater. We won 2nd place in the battle of the bands at my college, and got a write up in the local entertainment magazine. This was moving too slow for us so we went out to Austin TX.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile in Austin we played LOTS of shows. We got to play one of the larger stages for SXSW. We even got to open for some touring acts like Freeze Pop, and Slick Idiot (KMFDM guys). While we were doing this I was working on the sound crew at the Elysium, which is a freaking institution in the goth/industrial scene in the US. Somewhere around this time we released TFPs second full length Sex Babylon America. We were getting booked so much it was hard to keep up with, and we were playing every single weekend. One of our songs ended up being a hit in the local club scene. Before we left Austin we released our final single Pyramid. At some point we decided we need to start touring, so we took our stuff down to Florida to store it at one of our parents house. The price of gas went way up that year, and a few other things happened that made it financially impossible for us to start touring as intended. We were stuck in FL and it was pretty much the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ended up working a lot because we needed money so bad. I figured if I made some money that we could pay to tour, but we had a long run of bad luck, and things kept happening that prevented us from moving forward. This went on for almost 5 years! Luckily I was practicing everyday and improving my technical skills as a musician and vocalist greatly throughout that time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn summary, I gave being \"normal\" a try for a couple years, and I can\u0027t hang. I am an artist in my heart from the time I was a small child, and doing anything else makes me crazy.\u003cbr\u003eI am releasing a 6 song demo EP in hopes of finding a band to play with, or rebooting The Future Process. It\u0027s all about the metalcore these days. The equipment that I made the demo on with has been dragged around the country on stages for years and its literally falling apart. If things get any worse I will have to get out the soldering iron, and in most cases that has already been done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
