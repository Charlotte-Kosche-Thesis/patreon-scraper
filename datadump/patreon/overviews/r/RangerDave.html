Beyond that your monthly support will help me dedicate more time each week to producing YouTube videos and broadcasting live streams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e100% Voluntary Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThe great part about Patreon is it\u2019s completely optional and flexible - you support the content creators that you enjoy the most while picking the exact amount that you\u2019d like to offer. If you don\u2019t want to monetarily support the channel that\u2019s fine too! My current plan is to continue offering my videos for free as always at the same release schedule as always. All of the rewards here on Patreon are extras - nothing changes with the regular content!"
