     "about": "I am a HUGE comic book and art fan. I\u0027ve been into comics since my Dad taught me to read at age 3 with The Amazing Spider-Man.\u003cbr\u003e\nI self-published my first mini-comic, \"Yawn Comics featuring Captain Boring,\" when I was 16, with a xerox machine and a very accommodating Mom. It was an epic tale about a man whose shoes became untied. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have since published several works including: FISHMAN, SOCK, contributions to the anthology \"All U Can Eat Comics,\" and the web comic THE BAND. In 2010 I produced a comic book for The Epilepsy Foundation with writer John McLaren and in 2012 I wrote, illustrated and published a \u0027children\u0027s\u0027 book, \"Zach Meets the Zombie.\" It\u0027s the story of a little boy who would like to go outside to play, but there\u0027s a Zombie on his lawn!\u003cbr\u003e\nI volunteer each year at local comic book shops for Free Comic Book Day to do sketches for the kids. I feel that it\u0027s all about getting kids involved in comics so the tradition will live on. For ten years I worked at The Art Garage, in Montclair, NJ, teaching kids of all ages how to create comics during the school year and the summer camps. I was also the Grand Poo-Bah of the Super Secret Comic Book Club there. Currently I teach people of all ages how to draw and create comics as a freelance teacher, and I run a Life Drawing session once a week in Montclair, NJ.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI spent much of my youth drawing with my Dad, learning anatomy and form. I honed this craft at The Center for the Media Arts, Caldwell College, and The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was hired by the Kubert School in Dover, NJ, years later and taught some of the Comic Book industry\u0027s upcoming and current giants from 2001 to 2005. I have worked as a Graphic Designer for the NFL, Warner Bros., Lucent Tech., and Disney just to name drop. I was an art contributor and graphic designer for the \"Dave Cockrum... a tribute\" book.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAmong those I count for inspiration are Frank Frazetta, Alphonse Mucha, Kevin Eastman \u0026amp; Peter Laird, Jim Silke, Luis Royo, John Romita Sr. \n\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e Jr., Vargas, my Grandmother and my Dad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nRickman knows that until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him, he will have to continue striving to put right what once went wrong, and hoping, each time, that his next leap will be the leap\u2026 home.\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
