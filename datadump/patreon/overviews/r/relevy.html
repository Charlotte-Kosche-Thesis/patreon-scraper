However, on the edges of Cornwall, a Saxon invasion forces two strangers into an unpredictable alliance. Riona, an accused witch, is content to fulfill her role as the local hermit. That is until she saves the life of an outcast Druid, Aidan, whose murky motivations hurl her down a path toward danger and adventure. As their compulsory journey together continues it becomes clear to Riona that her past and Aidan\u2019s are inextricably linked. The sins of her mysterious Druidic father have left her balancing precipitously between the dying world of the Druids and the burgeoning reign of King Artor. Riona\u2019s mere existence has made her enemies. Enemies only Aidan can protect her from, or so they would have her believe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuzz about \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Hawthorn King\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e: \u003c/strong\u003eWritten by R.E.
