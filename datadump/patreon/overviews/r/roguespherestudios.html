    "summary": "Growing up I was bit of a shy dude. \u00a0I didn\u0027t want to get in front of the class to do an oral book report or anything that possibly could embarrass me or make me look like a fool. \u00a0I was terrified. \u00a0Oddly enough, however, I found that I loved the idea of \"communication\" and I quickly fell into playing around with electronic bulletin boards (BBS), the precursor to the Internet of today. \u00a0I was still shy, but I could hide.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFast forward to the age I am now and I don\u0027t give a crap about hiding any longer. \u00a0Sure I do stupid crap that makes me look dumb. \u00a0I embarrass myself (and my family) from time to time, but my time isn\u0027t getting any longer on this Earth and I just don\u0027t care anymore. \u00a0If you like me, that\u0027s great! \u00a0Let\u0027s be friends. \u00a0If you don\u0027t, well -- move along, nothing to see here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo when podcasting became a thing, I felt I had finally found my vehicle for truth, justice and the American Way....wait...wrong script.  (clears throat) So when podcasting came along, I felt I had finally found my vehicle for communicating, teaching and sharing my knowledge, my experiences and most of all - my opinions. \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou see, I\u0027m bit of a different bird. \u00a0I live in the South, in Georgia to be exact, and this area is known for being conservative and christian - two things which I am not. \u00a0So I don\u0027t particularly fit in \"well\" around here, but I\u0027m finding more and more folks don\u0027t either. \u00a0So I\u0027m not entirely alone, but just enough that I need to reach out to you fine folks for conversation. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve produced various podcasts since I started in 2011, but the one I do mainly is Don Talk (formerly The Donovan Radio Show). \u00a0I classify it as a variety show, because you\u0027ll never know what I\u0027m going to talk about. \u00a0It could be politics, it could be technology, it could be religion or it could be how Trump\u0027s hair has its own zip code. \u00a0My wife joins in from time to time also and if you think I\u0027m a bit odd, you\u0027ll love her. \u00a0;)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, I hope you like the show and I appreciate any little bit you\u0027re willing to part with to show your support. \u00a0I do have some goals and hopefully we can hit those. \u00a0I have some rewards and hopefully they\u0027re good enough, for now. \u00a0I\u0027ll work on better ones. \u00a0I promise.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSide note: \u00a0I\u0027d love to do this full time, but unfortunately it doesn\u0027t pay the bills right now. \u00a0I\u0027m an IT Consultant working alongside my youngest son. \u00a0As you can see, every cent you support me with gets me closer to my end goal. \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
