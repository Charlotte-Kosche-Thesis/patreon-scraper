As an activist and advocate, I have fought for an\nequitable application of the laws that are just, the repeal of laws that are\nunjust, an end to the disparaging conditions and factors that have led to the\nschool-to-prison pipeline, a new system of punishment and reformation, and for\nequitable access to education and employment.

This\ncannot and should not be done alone. I both need and want your help conceptualizing\nand working toward a new way of life for us all. Much as the rural south Bob\nMoses encountered when he with the NAACP, CORE, and SNCC ventured in to\nMississippi for Freedom Summer, many people are not completely aware of our\nrights, privileges, and immunities, or the truth of the conditions we live\nwith. I believe that music and art are powerful methods that can be utilized as\ntools to inform the people, grab their attention, and to provide some\ndirection. At the very least, art is enjoyable and tends to foster conversation\namong people, which leads to greater understanding.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPrimarily, my artistic work focuses on social justice, liberty, equity,\nand the dissemination of facts through \u003ca href=\"https://renaissancethepoet.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emusic\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://renaissancethepoet.wordpress.com/category/poetry/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epoetry\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ren_otography/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ephotography\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Gx3AFpNhojI\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evideos\u003c/a\u003e.

Most of my\ncreations address social problems and/or potential solutions to them.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have geared all my music, education, and activism to understanding,\nconfronting, challenging, and changing this unjust and inequitable system of\npower and oppression and creating the opposite in its stead. With your help, we\ncan achieve this, or at least continue the struggle toward achieving it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for the love.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am a first generation university graduate, I thought after I had my bachelor\u0027s degree I would be able to get all the jobs that I applied for. But apparently fighting against capitalism and all the other systems of oppression is not a selling point in corporate America. At first, I thought this meant I was somehow less than, when not even Walmart wants to hire me because I have been arrested for fighting for the people, it can be a blow to the self esteem. But then I realized this was not a reflection of me but rather the system itself when it wants to deny opportunities to Black men who want to do something positive in their life to change the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I am not letting corporate America stop me, I am continuing to be a light through my music, poetry, photography, activism, creating a curriculum for decolonization, and fighting against the prison industrial system. However, as much as I want to fight the unjust economic system I am still within it and I need to eat. Instead of continuing to be rejected by corporate America I have decided to employ myself, become my own boss and try to get paid for the work I am already doing for the people. Like everything else in organizing, I cannot do this without the support of my community. I have joined Patreon, a site that allows people to sponsor me with monthly donations. If 100 people sponsor me at $5 a month, I would have $500 to live off of. It\u0027s not all the way finished, in the coming weeks I will set up rewards for those who want to sponsor me. But I wanted to share this with you all and request you sponsor my work. Thank you and I appreciate you all.\u003cbr\u003e",
