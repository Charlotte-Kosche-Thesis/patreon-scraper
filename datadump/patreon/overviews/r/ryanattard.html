Presently I have 4 novels published and every year I put out about three more, one for each of my series.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page, however, is for my podcast, The Lurking Voice Podcast. Let me tell you a bit about it: every week, or every other week, I sit in front of some audio equipment and talk about a variety of stuff.\u00a0Usually it\u0027s a movie, or a comic book, a video game series, a few book - anything geeky and a little goofy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love music, particularly old rock from bands like AC/DC, the Scorpions, KISS, Led Zeppelin - you get the idea. But I also play a wide variety of tunes on the show, in between my monologues; anything from the bands mentioned above, to more modern stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately there are only a few handful of people who make substantial income form podcasting, and even if that were not the case, I still would not do this for the money. This podcast only exists as a direct line of communication between me and my listeners, where once a week our minds are joined together thanks to technology, and we all have a laugh.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth of the matter is, artists like myself need support. I am trying to make a living writing novels, and that means spending all of my earnings on writing more books. But I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e want to continue doing this podcast, and that\u0027s what this is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a thank-you for your support in making my podcast, you\u0027ll get different levels of rewards (obviously). Check them out, and if you can help make my podcast content even better, I\u0027d greatly apprecaite it."
