From early childhood,\nI was fond of design levels. Back in primary classes, I painted on paper my\nlevels for the video game Sonic the Hedgehog. Then, I\u2019ve began studying the\nengine GoldSrc and editor Worldcraft, now known as the Valve Hammer Editor. I\u0027ve\ndone the levels for the first Half-Life and CS 1.3. I also studied other level\neditors, including GtkRadiant, Unreal Editor 2 and Moo Mapper (map editor for\nGTA3).  Now I greatly known Valve Hammer\nEditor and intensively studying Unreal Engine 4.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a\ncomplete modification for Half Life 2. And one more is in development. You\ncan learn more\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.moddb.com/members/monty-rus/mods\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhy do I need your support?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am full of ambitions and try to make very high quality projects. Let me show you at which projects I\u0027m currently working on:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003ethe Mummy Run\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHow will my\nrunner differ from others? It will have three modes of the game process, which\nwill be divided into three types:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e1. Side view: the mummy is running, can\njump and do crouches.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e2. Top view: the mummy runs, can jump,\ndo crouches and turn 90 degrees to the right and left.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e3. Back view: the mummy runs, can jump,\ndo crouches and step left and right.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll modes\nchange dynamically and completely randomly. As well as building a level. The\npath along which the mummy runs is constructed quite randomly from pre-painted\nblocks that join together. In addition, in the game you will need to collect\nscarabs, which in the future can be spent on various gains for the mummy. Among\nwhich:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e1. Magnet. A classic magnet that\nattracts scarabs.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e2. Acceleration. Accelerate the speed\nof movement of the mummy with a safe overcoming obstacles.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e3. The multiplier of scarabs. Multiplication of picked up scarabs by x2, x3, x4, depending on the level of the ability.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e4. The second life. If the player makes\na mistake, the mummy will respawn and continue to run further.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nIn this video you can see a first concept of my game:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5BY3_PtdR3I\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of the\nabove is not the final concept. The game will be replenished with new ideas and\ntheir implementations as it develops. The game will have to be released on\nAndroid and, possibly, on iOS. I really hope for your support.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHalf-Life 2: Enslavement of Vortigaunts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe story of this mod starts soon after 7 Hour War. Humanity is defeated. Only a few are still trying to survive. Some of them are joining the nascent rebellion. After escaping Nihilant\u0027s impact, Vortigaunts are forming the alliance with rebels, hoping to defeat the common enemy and to return back home. As a player, you\u0027ll play a role of the man who survived in a war. You will join the rebellion and prevent Alliance from completely conquering Earth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn my mod you can find next\u00a0features:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eStealth. In HL2: Enslavement of Vortigaunts will be many levels with possibility hide in the shadows. You must stay out from Alliance\u0027s spotlights. Otherwise, they will spot you and they will kill you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eOpen levels. There will be several levels free to explore. In this levels you can find the fractions. And you can do quests for them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFractions. In HL2: Enslavement of Vortigaunts will be four fractions: Alliance, rebels, vortigaunts and bandits. Each faction will have their relationships between each other. For example, bandits are afraid of Vortigaunts and the Alliance, but they attacking the rebels. The player can develop a relationship with some factions. The higher rank of the fraction to the player, the more useful things the faction will give to the player. For example: if the rebels loyal to the player, they can heal him for free.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eQuest. You can do a lot of quests for various NPC. As a reward, they can give you an armor, health packs, ammo and weapons. It is necessary to do this quests, otherwise there will be a lot of problems during story levels. Because in this levels are very few supplies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you can see a video that demonstrate the stealth system in my mod:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmAa8m5CEYQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope you found interesting all that you saw! Your support will go to the voiceovers of characters, localization in different languages. And the improvement development of all my projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for you attention!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
