Ok, not really, but I bet you want to know what you\u0027ll be getting right?  Yes?  Told ya. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, so, aside from the private monthly show (where we discuss what you all want us to) and access to a PRIVATE forum and facebook group where we will share lots of reality tv secrets, spoilers (they will be hidden) and juicy gossip, plus we will follow you on social media and have a 1 on 1 moment via email (or autograph)... we have something that we know many of you have been DYING to get your hands on...  SWAG! \u00a0That\u0027s right you will also be getting your very own YRR pen and some other goodies I have around here as well.  Plus since I\u0027m gonna need your address to send you your swag... maybe I can pop over for dinner one night too?  Ok scratch that, I guess that\u0027s not really a reward for you is it?  Well fine, but one last thing and you didn\u0027t hear it from me... You for-really-real are getting our thanks and appreciation a split second before the 1, 5, and 10 dollar people.  So let that soak in... you earned it! \u00a0And hey, if you want to invite us over for dinner well gladly accept a handwritten invitation ... but only if it\u0027s written with your new pen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

We also give you a special thank you during our live show! \u00a0And while I cant promise it (cause those reality stars can be finicky biatches) if one that you really love is available (and they are willing) I will have them give you a special shout out too during a show! \u00a0Wan\u0027t more? \u00a0Good! \u00a0Cause I\u0027m also going to follow you on social media! \u00a0But that\u0027s STILL not all, if we are at a live event where you know a reality star is that you also are obsessing over we will (one time) get you their autograph!  Of course that depends on them being willing... but look if they don\u0027t do it we will publicly shame the hell out of them.. We\u0027re gay, and good at it.  Trust us.  Unless us being gay makes you not want to donate... then we are super straight and will straightly shame them!  Say that 3 times fast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, now that you are among the elite group of our top supporters we need to tell you something... we have been outsourcing our thanks and appreciation that we give to all the other donation levels.
