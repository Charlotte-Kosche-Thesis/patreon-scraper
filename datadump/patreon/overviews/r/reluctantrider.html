Just the fact that you\u0027re here means I\u0027ve made an impact and that\u0027s all I really ever wanted! Read on and let me tell what all this is about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon where I try and scrounge a little bit of money off you wonderful folks to continue making videos and save myself from having to get a real job ever again! I\u0027ve worked long and hard already in my short(ish) life and have far too many grey hairs! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve probably headed over from the YouTube channel so will probably know some of my story. I think it\u0027s more important that I give a bit more of an insight into what it is I\u0027m trying to achieve and why I think your money is well spent on me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my Patreon account I\u0027m trying to create a community. I know everyone says that and that it\u0027s true in almost all cases, but I mean an actual small community where we know each other. My goal is to get between 50 and 150 people to commit to giving me a few bucks a month, so as I have a small revenue stream and a small group of people that I can actually get to know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m all about multiple small revenue streams to keep my life ticking over financially while being time rich. It\u0027s kind of my new thing since getting stressed and sick when I was working full time. With this sort of support I can achieve that and you guys will get more access to me than on any other platform. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like my YouTube polished and fun. Regular, professional, fun uploads that I put a lot of effort into and can get creative with. I want my live interactions to be with you guys only (not on YouTube) on a regular basis so I get to know each and every one of you by name. Hopefully so well that you\u0027ll have a place to head for if you\u0027re ever in Europe, and I\u0027ll have places to head for when I venture out of Europe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of writing this I\u0027m thinking private Facebook group where you can get me anytime and where I do my lives, the vlog section of this Patreon thing keeping you up to date and giving you early vids, and some goodies like stickers for long termers! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that sounds good and it will develop as I get off the ground!"
