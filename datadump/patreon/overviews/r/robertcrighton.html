I\u0027m Robert\nCrighton and I\u0027m a storyteller, writer and performer who needs your support to\ncontinue creating new audio plays and stories to go online. I\u0027ve been writing\nand performing for over fifteen years now, winning good notices and the odd\naward, but now I\u2019m sharing my work online.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, I\u0027m looking for patrons to support my work -\nto help make the strange worlds that live in my head come out to play.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat do you get in return? \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, firstly, you get content. You\u0027ll get radio plays,\naudio readings, audio essays, new work, old work, every week.  And it\u2019s always different - my work comes in\nall shapes and sizes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, the podcasts, that\u0027s a given. By giving something you\ngive me a budget to make this stuff - the more of you there are, the bigger the\nprojects can become.  I\u0027ll be able to hire more actors to do plays and\nmonologues, so that you don\u0027t just hear my voice (which, fantastic as I think\nit is, is a bit much all year round!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve got some amazing ideas I want to get out there, audio\nprojects that are all about sound and not just audio only versions of my stage\nworks. It\u0027s thanks to you to make them a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s a monthly pledge rather than per thing. I\u0027m\ngoing for monthly, because I produce a lot of audio.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can\u0027t give anything (and that\u0027s cool)\nthen please share this with people online, with your friends, with everyone,\nbecause every little helps.  And, of course, listen to what I make anyway.\n That\u0027s what it\u0027s for.

Robert graduated from Middlesex University in\n2003 with a degree in Performing Arts: Drama which he occasionally uses to\nbolster his self esteem.  On leaving he\nimmediately set up a residency with his occasional theatre company Milk Bottle\nProductions in various studio spaces in Suffolk where, apart from occasional\ntouring work, he has been based ever since. \nHe is the only entrant in the history of the Lost One-Act Festival to\nwin three awards in successive years. He is no longer eligible to enter. \u00a0In 2014 he was\u00a0Artist In Residence at the Quay Theatre.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHe is fully air conditioned and much like Bagpuss.\u003cbr\u003e",
