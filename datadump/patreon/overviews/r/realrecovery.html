I\u2019m \u003cstrong\u003eCari De La Cruz\u003c/strong\u003e and I\u2019m creating \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eReal Talk About Real Recovery\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nABOUT ME\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nIn January of 2007, I\nweighed 320 lbs. By year\u2019s end, I had gastric bypass surgery to treat my\nobesity and quickly learned that losing half my body weight was a very small\npart of very big recovery. With a burning desire to spread the message of hope\n(and little idea how to do it), I set out on a personal campaign to share the\nunvarnished truth of obesity and food addiction. While still holding down a full-time\njob, I wrote, traveled and spoke to as many people as I could reach, until\neventually, I became a respected blogger, vlogger, public speaker and educator.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019d found my purpose and eventually\nfound the perfect delivery method. Through Facebook, I connect daily with\nviewers who tune in to watch \u003cstrong\u003eLUNCHBREAK LIVE: Real Talk About Obesity, Food\nAddiction, Recovery and What\u2019s Really Eating You.\u2122\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The show has become must-see\nviewing for hundreds of people around the world desperate to hear what isn\u2019t spoken\nanywhere else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLike the dandelion, my\nprogram spreads seeds of hope\u003cbr\u003efar and wide so recovery can take root and heal. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI joined Patreon so \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eReal Talk\nAbout Real Recovery\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e can reach more people hungry for help, hope and humor. I\ngive freely of my time, through my 30-minute weekday programs, writing,\nspeaking engagements and personal guidance, but could give even MORE with\nsupport of people like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a patron, you\u2019ll receive\na personalized Certificate of Support and be granted special access to \u201cPatron-Only\u201d\nweekly programming. At higher patron levels, you\u2019ll be able to choose a specific\ntopic for a Lunchbreak Live episode, have an opportunity for a private, one-on-one\nclass with me, and receive a free autographed copy of my upcoming book. The\nmore I grow, the more hope I can offer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nKnowing what\u2019s eating us has\neverything to do with what we\u2019re eating, but most people have no idea what\u2019s\neating them. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eReal Talk About Real Recovery\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e shows them what they\u2019re feeding. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecome a patron, and let\u2019s\nkeep the recovery conversation going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCari\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
