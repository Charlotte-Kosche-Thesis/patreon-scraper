     "description": "If we can get $1000 per episode committed to this show I will do this full time. For me that is a dream job but here is what it means for you...\u003cbr\u003eThe show will get a lot better. I\u0027ll have more time to seek out, get to know, and interview the real salty spearos before all that knowledge, guidance, and experience is lost. More and more of you reach out to me and say you have to interview our local legend and I want to get those stories on the air but that requires more time and commitment to reach out and build enough trust to have them be a guest on the show. I want to make some improvements to the website like get a better player. Also, purchase a few more mics so I can record panel discussions but the big difference that you will see as a listener to the show if we can make this my full time job is that I will produce two shows a week. I will double the output. I have a concept for that second show. I\u0027ve mentioned it in the SpearoNation intro video. That show is SpearoTV. One of the problems with the weekly audio interview is that it is difficult to explain more complicated things like speargun rigging or water entry with a speargun. So what I want to do is continue to do The Spear on Thursday and do SpearoTV on Friday or Monday. That\u0027s what I would do if this was all that I did.",

     "description": "This is the long term goal, the reach for the moon goal and I don\u0027t care if it take years to get to this level but I think it can be done. If we can get $2,500 per episode of The Spear, I know that is a big number, but there are more and more of you listening every week. So in a few years I think it is possible. If we get there, $2,500 per episode, then SpearoNation goes into overdrive and I\u0027ll start hiring freelancers to make a new daily show reporting on the world of freediving and spearfishing. I am not the person to host it. I want to watch it. I\u0027ll have a team of people covering events and developing quality content. I\u0027ll have people smarter than me on the ground researching and breaking down in plain English the regulations coming down the pipe and how they will affect our sport. This is something that is needed in our community.",
