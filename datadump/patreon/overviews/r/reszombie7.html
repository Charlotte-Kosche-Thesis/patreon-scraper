On top of all that, we usually provide a few bonus episodes where we discuss horror topics, look at new releases for franchises we have already covered or interview a horror celebrity. \u00a0Every Halloween season we provide six episodes of Zombie 7\u0027s Halloween Grab Bag where we discuss old Halloween specials. \u00a0Every year on the anniversary of the podcast, we release a commentary to play along with a cult horror movie.\u00a0",
