In the very first episode they asked the question \"Can Michael Owen replace Cristiano Ronaldo\u0027s goals?\" (and answered it with a very firm \"No, obviously not\").\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then many other United podcasts have come and gone, but the Rant Cast ploughs on, making a United-centric episode most weeks during the football season, 265 of them at the time of writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the beginning of the 2013/14 season, producer Tom came on board, and he makes the show sound really nice (thanks Tom.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve never run advertising, relying on listener tips to cover costs and make a couple of quid, but we thought we\u0027d set up a Patreon so people could support the show and its creators and be rewarded with something cool if they do. We\u0027d like to pay Tom for his time and maybe even get paid for ours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, check out the tiers and some of the cool rewards we have one offer, take a look at the goals we\u0027re hoping to hit, and get involved if it seems like something you\u0027d like to do!\u003cbr\u003e"
