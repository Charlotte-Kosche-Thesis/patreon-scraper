    "summary": "Hello there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Dalo Lorn (at least, that\u0027s how most of the Internet knows me), one of the lead developers on the mod Rising Stars. There\u0027s a big feature list up on its \u003ca href=\"http://www.moddb.com/mods/alternate-balance-expansion-mod\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eModDB\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=812827373\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam Workshop\u003c/a\u003e pages, so I\u0027ll stick to more abstract information like what the mod\u0027s about and what I hope to do with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt its heart, Rising Stars is... an unofficial expansion. It tries to add new ways of playing SR2, and expand upon the bits of backstory scattered throughout the game. (Often in ways that\u00a0heavily contradict the developers\u0027 original intentions.) Who\u00a0built the Remnants? How can a galaxy-spanning empire be reduced to a scattered fleet of weak\u00a0drones guarding various pieces of advanced technology? Who are the \u0027Old Gods\u0027 worshiped by the Feyh? What is the significance of the Orathi system if\u00a0the First live on Atrozal?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why am I here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo reasons: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Historically, I haven\u0027t been able to find enough people to play with, which has made it hard to motivate me to keep working on the mod. (After all, the point of my modding was mostly so \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e could have more fun playing the game, with everything else being a pleasant side-effect.) Having some kind of sustainable income, regardless of its scale, ought to be a decent alternative solution to the motivation issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Almost a year ago, I won an Outstanding Scholarship for RIT Croatia\u0027s undergraduate IT program. This was a bit of a surprise, and I\u0027m currently being dragged in half a dozen directions to help with paying my tuition fees. Being able to point at RS and say \"look, this is making money!\" would go a long way towards helping me justify going in this direction instead of doing something else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a few questions I\u0027ve tried to anticipate and answer:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Does this mean that the mod won\u0027t be developed without donations?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eNo. Well, yes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e... Maybe. The truth is, until I got started on 1.2.0, I thought I wasn\u0027t coming back at all. Now I\u0027m here, and hopefully I\u0027ll last long enough to finish it - but predicting my activity levels can be tricky. The whole point of this is to try making it more predictable by giving me a reason outside of \"I feel like doing this again for a while\" to maintain a steady pace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, given the hectic pace of the last semester, I suspect I won\u0027t be able to do much outside of the summer and winter breaks. I\u0027ve started suspending payments for every month where I wasn\u0027t able to get any work done due to either time or stamina constraints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: When \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eis\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e the next version coming out, anyway?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eAs with many programming projects... soon\u2122. After 1.2.0 released, I put up a rough roadmap outlining \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/DaloLorn/Rising-Stars/wiki/Roadmap\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy plans\u003c/a\u003e for the mod\u0027s future on the GitHub wiki. (1.3.0 should be just around the corner... just as soon as I find the right corner.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why isn\u0027t my question here?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eBecause I didn\u0027t see it coming. :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, you can visit the mod\u0027s \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/sUJKJDc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscord chat\u003c/a\u003e and ask your question(s) there. (You can also talk to other people who are interested in Star Ruler 2, and maybe organize a game or two.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
