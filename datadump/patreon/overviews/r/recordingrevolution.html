It will explain everything!\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been making free audio recording and mixing tutorials on YouTube since 2010, helping hundreds of thousands of home and project studio owners make better music with their gear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eExample Tutorials:\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UeccuFWtucY?rel=0\u0026amp;vq=hd720\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1o9L7agaluo?rel=0\u0026amp;vq=hd720\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have enjoyed the tutorial videos over the years and they\u0027ve helped you get better recordings and mixes in your home studio, and you\u0027d like to see more content from The Recording Revolution for years to come, then consider supporting me with simple tip above!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny and all support goes directly to helping me create newer, better, more helpful training content on YouTube for the world of home and project studio owners. I try to balance my time as a freelance mixing engineer and producer with creating content for The Recording Revolution, and your tips will help me to continue to focus on what I love: helping people like you make better music in your home studio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust pick $1, $3, $5, or more per video as a tip. I put out one video a week, so usually 4 videos a month. \u003cb\u003eAnd if you\u0027re worried about going over budget, Patreon asks you to set a monthly cap amount, so you\u0027ll never give more money than you intended.\u003c/b\u003e\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo check out all of the rewards below, find the ones you are most interested, and give at that amount. And just for giving at any amount, even $1 per video, I will be sending you an exclusive download of all 93 of my 5 Minutes To A Better Mix tutorial videos. These are my most popular videos on YouTube, but many people have asked me for physical downloads. I\u0027m only offering these to my patrons, no matter how much you give!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks again for even taking the time to stop by this page. \u003cb\u003eIf you can\u0027t financially afford to give, please don\u0027t feel obligated. Maybe just do me a favor and share a video or two with your music friends.\u003c/b\u003e That would mean a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd if you are more interested in supporting me by purchasing my more in depth tutorials, check out The Recording Revolution store here:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://therecordingrevolution.com/products/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://therecordingrevolution.com/products/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for your continued encouragement and support over the years.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHere\u0027s to making better music now!\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"
