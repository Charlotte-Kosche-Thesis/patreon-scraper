    "summary": "Basically, we at Rapture of the Deep are dedicated to creating videos of all kinds. At present, we specialize in videos with underwater content that harken back to the days of the 1950\u0027s and 60\u0027s when skin/scuba diving were all the rage with shows like Sea Hunt and Flipper. As well as movies like Thunderball, The Deep and Around the World Under the Sea. But, we do have plans to expand into other areas of filmmaking in the near future. Like animation, sci-fi, action/adventure and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, our biggest draw has been THE INCREDIBLE UNDERWATER WORLD OF RAPTURE OF THE DEEP. An episodic show that was produced in the 50\u0027s and 60\u0027s by Rapture of the Deep studios. We have plans to resurrect the show with new episodes, new models and new underwater adventures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll also be using any support we receive to continue the exploits of The Girls from S.C.U.B.A. in video, photo and, even, comic book form. Which our patrons will have special access to in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what are you waiting for? Get on board and take the plunge with us and our models."
