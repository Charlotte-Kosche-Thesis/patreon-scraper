    "summary": "Dear Patrons,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rick Morrison.\u00a0 I live in Calgary, Alberta, with my dog,\nChase. About 12 years ago I published a\nshort story\u00a0in a book of collective works\ncalled \u201cTall Tales and Short Stories Volume II\u201d.\nMy daughter, seven at the time, was so impressed that she asked me to\nwrite something for her.\u00a0Of course I said yes, and promptly set to work on\nwriting a chapter book called \u201cWhere Dragons Fly\u201d.\u00a0Little did I know that the\ncharacters I created would haunt my dreams until I promised to continue writing\ntheir stories. Well, once those characters took on a life of their own, that\nchapter book morphed into what will become a trilogy, which brings us to today. Yes, some 12\nyears later.\u00a0You see the stories and those characters went in and out of snooze\nmode over the years, daring me on and off to tell their tales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter being laid off due to a severe economic\ndownturn in Calgary, I took a part time job with hopes of living my dream of \nwriting for a living.\u00a0I am now very seriously making that attempt\nin the way of launching the first of many short stories, novellas and\nnovelettes, all revolving in and around the World of Calasia, leading to the\ntrilogy I started oh so long ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter trying to get\npublished through the traditional publishing house route, I decided to\nself-publish.\u00a0This has involved a great deal\nof time and energy, researching the different methods and approaches to getting\nstarted, from learning WordPress to create a website, to discovering Scrivener\nand learning how to use it to create my eBooks, learning all about Amazon\nKindle Direct Publishing, and a myriad of other things.\u00a0All in all, a great\ndeal of work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.calasia.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wheredragonslie_web.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally,\u00a0in November of 2016 I\ngot it all together and self-published. It was an amazing feeling. However, the sad reality is that sales are very slow for an unknown\nauthor, and I still have to work a conventional job to keep a roof over my\nhead.\u00a0I am now having to work more hours at a low paying job to make ends meet,\nleaving me with less creative energy at the end of the day to put into my true\npassion. My ultimate goal is to be able to quit my day job and become a\u00a0fulltime creator. To get there I have set some\u00a0achievable goals, beginning with getting to the point where I can significantly reduce the hours I spend working for someone else, and increase the time I spend on\u00a0bringing my stories to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a site from which creators can launch their creations while allowing you, the Patron, access to their work in a way that has never been done before. Hence the different tier levels you see on the right. You can now take part in the creation process, see inside\u00a0the creator\u0027s\u00a0life,\u00a0or simply support your creator to ensure their work continues to grow and blossom into its full potential. I just discovered Patreon,\nand I am so very excited to be here.\u00a0I\nsincerely hope that you will support me along the way in bringing the\nChronicles of Calasia to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease visit my website\nat \u003ca href=\"http://www.calasia.net/blog\"\u003ewww.calasia.net/blog\u003c/a\u003e to learn more about the\nworld I have created and to see just how much work I have done already.\u00a0I have\u00a0published the first novella,\n\u201cWhere Dragons Lie\u201d, a four part series.\u00a0I have also started creating audiobooks, another huge learning process. Time consuming, but a lot of fun, and a way that brings the story to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first story of the second\nnovella, \u201cWayward Knight \u2013 Book 1 - A Rock and a Hard Place\u201d is set to be released very\nsoon. My illustrator, Petra, is putting the final touches on the new cover.

I will not let my dream die, no matter what, but you can know that you are helping to bring it alive. I have so many stories to tell you, if I can put my time and effort into writing rather than struggling to pay the bills and put food on the table. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me in this epic journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much to those of you who have supported me along the way, and those of you who will do so going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost sincerely,\u003cbr\u003eRick Morrison\u003cbr\u003e"
