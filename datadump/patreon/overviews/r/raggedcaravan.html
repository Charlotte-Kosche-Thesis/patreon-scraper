    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u0027m Alex Wells. I\u0027m an artist and fantasy writer, and I make dolls.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe Ragged Caravan is the name for the world of these creatures and their stories, which I tell through words and digital illustrations. I\u0027m combining my two passions, writing and visual art, in a long-term creative project that involves a \u003cstrong\u003enew doll, new story, and new illustration every month\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making dolls for about five years and I\u0027ve shown in galleries in Los Angeles, California and Denver, Colorado. I was also the featured artist on the cover of the Winter 2017 issue of Art Doll Quarterly. My dolls are made with paper clay, antique textile scraps, vintage beads, and other ephemera. I love using re-purposed materials and I have a growing collection of tattered 19th and early 20th century textiles. I\u2019m interested in the ways animals are an intimate part of us--I see my creatures as guardians, companions, and messengers from another world. I\u0027ve been a writer for many years and telling the stories of these characters has been one of my favorite projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon? If my work moves you, Patreon is a way for you to support my art on a monthly basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u2019s like a tip jar for artists, with cool rewards. You subscribe for a small amount of money and get access to exclusive content, including tutorials, first access, and behind-the-scenes peaks at my process. You choose the amount and you can quit at any time. And even better, you get to join an amazing community of people. You get different rewards depending on the level you choose, but everyone who pledges gets an downloadable illustrated story.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy did I choose Patreon for my work? I\u2019m on Patreon because I want to bring my stories directly to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been posting stories and pictures for a while on Instagram and Facebook, but the social media format means they have to be very, very short--essentially micro-fiction. That\u2019s too short! I want to expand this format, writing a new story each month (of varying length). The stories will be linked in some way\u2014by setting, characters, or world. To illustrate the stories, each month I\u2019m creating (at least) one new doll, which will be used to make a digital portrait or illustration. I\u0027m also learning stop-motion video techniques and as the project grows, I\u0027ll be making some videos as well. Patreon is the perfect way to bring these stories and illustrations directly to you, the audience--it lets us interact, ask and answer questions, share research and ideas, and collaborate.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support gives me material for my work (clay, armature wire, vintage textiles, tools), time to write, and the equipment for my photography and videos. In exchange, you get access to my stories and illustrations, along with a range of other rewards, including prints, books, Google hangouts, and the chance to collaborate on dolls and stories! You\u0027ll be able to read the stories online, or as a digital download. This is what I love about Patreon--being part of a community of awesome folks. I promise to do my best to entertain, edify, learn, and inspire, because you guys ROCK.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your supp\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eort--it means the world to me. I couldn\u2019t do it without you.\u003c/strong\u003e If you like what I do, then please join our community, and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
