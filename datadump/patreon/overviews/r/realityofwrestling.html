    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eCan you dig it, SUCKA?! has become a household phrase thanks to wrestling superstar Booker T. After all, he is the\nmaster of the spin-a-roonie, the 5-time WCW Champion, a Best-Selling Author and WWE Hall of\nFamer. Booker T Huffman was born and raised in Houston, TX. He began his illustrious wrestling\ncareer with his brother, Stevie Ray, forming the tag team Ebony Experience (later to be known\nas Harlem Heat). The duo went on to claim 10 World Championship Wrestling (WCW) Tag Team\ntitles; however, Booker had loftier goals in mind. He soon went solo and quickly became a\ncrowd favorite and an opponent to be feared. As his popularity grew, so did his titles. While at\nWCW, he won the US title 4 times, the TV title 6 times, and ultimately, the WCW Heavyweight\nChampionship title an impressive 5 times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2005, Booker T ventured into the business world. He started Booker T\u2019s Pro Wrestling Academy\nand the following year he started his wrestling promotion, Pro Wrestling Alliance (PWA). In 2010,\nPWA rebranded to Reality of Wrestling (The ROW). In the 12 years that his companies have been\nin existence, Booker has worked and has achieved much success. The ROW can now be seen on\nFITE TV worldwide on a weekly basis, with plans to start touring and producing quarterly PPV specials!\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e"
