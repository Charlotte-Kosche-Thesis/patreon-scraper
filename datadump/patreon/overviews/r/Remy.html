    "summary": "Hi there, you.\u00a0My name\u0027s Remy, and I\u0027ve been writing for pretty much my entire life at this point. It\u0027s probably my biggest passion, and I\u0027ve found it to be essential to processing experiences, struggles, and limits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a transgender, butch lesbian living in Portland, OR, and I bounce around between non-profits and part-time gigs to make ends meet at this time. I\u0027d love to be in a place to focus more on my writing, and I\u0027m hoping to at least get a foot in the door on that here. Or at least, I\u0027ve never had the experience of anyone paying to see my poetry before, and that sounds pretty spiffy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the poems I\u0027ll be publishing here are from a series I\u0027m working on. Much of it is grounded in real-life experience but grows in abstract ways and handles some questions that still keep me up at night. A lot of what I\u0027m writing focuses on desire, intimacy, womanhood, violence, and sappiness -- I run the gamut from sad gay feelings to deep lez realness. Some of my biggest influences are Margaret Atwood, Richard Siken, Sandra Cisneros, and Corinne Lee, and I hope I\u0027ve been able to borrow from their intensity and nuance. I realize my content can be heavy, and I will do my best to use content warnings when needed so you can take care of yourself before you engage with my poems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you can contribute will help keep me writing. I\u0027m currently working for a non-profit that\u0027s unable to pay me more than a stipend which isn\u0027t nearly close to my rent, and I\u0027m picking up odd jobs to make ends meet. I am immensely grateful for all pledges, whatever you feel is appropriate for your budget and my work. I intend to post between 2-3 poems per month, so please keep that in mind if you are trying to work out how much to pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading through this! I hope that you consider pledging to my patreon (there are some cool perks in it for you if you do!), but mostly that you enjoy my writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
