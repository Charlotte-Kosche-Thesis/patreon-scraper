I currently work several disposable jobs to support my forever growing bucket list of dreams while staying unattached to any particular place. I work hard for months on end, build a security nest of funds and then take off to explore everything I can, living in my car, traveling on a budget and attempting to squeeze the most out of every dime I have before starting the process over again. Growth is never by mere chance, its orchestrated by a million things from circumstance, your actions, intentions, mentality to even your environment. Curiosity is the catalyst to discovery, a journey with no end, its time is measured in moments not days, weeks, or years. I can only encourage others to chase down their dreams and hope to inspire a stranger with my own stories along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIm sure you\u0027re wondering what Patreon is all about? huh.\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is a way to connect with and support your favorite artists. In a nutshell Patreon is a new(er) way for content creators to get support from their fans while sharing a more intimate look into their art/life. For example, I frequently post photos of my adventures on my instagram but have never had an appropriate platform to share my adventures in story form with epic detail. With the donations I receive via Patreon I can make the time to share my experiences through blogging, videos and more in-depth personal photos."
