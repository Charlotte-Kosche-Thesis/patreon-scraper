    "summary": "Twenty years ago, the doctors said I would never work again. Today, I\u0027ve published one novel, \u003cem\u003eGlassmusic\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003eand was featured in the \u003cem\u003eGuardian\u00a0\u003c/em\u003elast September. Because of their link to my poem, \"Sestina for Adjuncts,\" it was the most-read poem in \u003cem\u003eRattle\u003c/em\u003e that same month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is my first fantasy novel. After having worked on the manuscript for years between semesters of teaching, I was able to complete the first draft this fall after I quit teaching last May and moved to a quiet place out in the country! I am seeking patrons so I can continue writing novels instead of grading papers, and so that I can live the writing life in my beautiful home state of Washington and not have to move again. The novel is for young adults (hopefully adults will enjoy it as well), and I am currently revising the draft before querying agents. See below for more about the book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShortlisted for the 2015 International Rubery Book Award, my debut historical novel, \u003cem\u003eGlassmusic\u003c/em\u003e (unagented), was released from Conundrum Press in 2014. I was awarded the 2015 Robert and Daryl Davis Fellowship in Poetry, and my poems and creative nonfiction have been published in \u003cem\u003eProgenitor, Rattle, \u003c/em\u003eand elsewhere. I have an MFA from the University of Montana in fiction and poetry. My story as a former adjunct instructor was covered in a\u00a0\u003cem\u003eGuardian\u00a0\u003c/em\u003earticle on the plight of adjuncts (2017).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now work part-time, but it is not enough to cover expenses. If I can keep my four days off to focus on writing, I could write about one novel a year. I so appreciate any investment you are willing to make, even one dollar per month, to help me make ends meet as a novelist. I will also be working on my poetry, book reviews, and creative nonfiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal History:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI suffered a mild TBI (traumatic brain injury) and whiplash in 1997 and was not able to read for a year. I gradually retrained my brain to read, starting with Tolkien\u0027s \u003cem\u003eLord of the Rings\u003c/em\u003e. To read \u003cem\u003eFellowship of the Ring\u003c/em\u003e, I used a book stand because of my injured neck and large print because of my continued problem with double vision from damage to my occipital lobe. I remember looking up at the night sky and wondering if I would ever see one moon again instead of four. By the time I was reading \u003cem\u003eThe Return of the King\u003c/em\u003e, I had recovered enough to hold a paperback book in my hands in regular print. Tolkien, as a master of suspense, had inspired my brain to learn how to read and write again, and I\u0027m confident he helped my body to heal as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started teaching just one English composition class at a community college in 2005, and I slowly built up to teaching a full load at a university by the fall of 2016. But I was often up until 4 am grading, because I have to pace myself, and I continue to deal with headaches and neck/back pain if I push myself too hard. Because of the corrupt treatment of adjunct faculty in higher education, I decided last May to give up my dream of obtaining a tenure-track position. (Adjuncts\u00a0have no job security--teaching load depends on student enrollment and other demoralizing factors--as well as low pay and no benefits. Fewer and fewer faculty are tenured these days, and universities put their money into administration and construction instead of adjuncts, which now make up about 80% of college/university faculty. Without job security, I had no housing security. As a single mom, I moved my son every year or so because of poor living conditions.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I miss my son, who is now in college, I am so grateful to live in a quiet place in the country, where no drug smoke filters into my apartment, no parties rage beneath my floor when I am trying to write or sleep, and no sewage backs up into the bathtub. I live over a garage outside Spokane, Washington with a beautiful view of a lake surrounded by evergreens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent novel\u003c/strong\u003e (first one in a series): A fantasy set in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State. As the book\u0027s co-author, my brother Michael Snow created the original story and helped to develop the plot while I wrote the manuscript. We hope both young adults and adults will enjoy the book and that we will find an agent soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimilar in tone to Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s \u003cem\u003eA Wizard of Earthsea\u003c/em\u003e and Philip\nPullman\u2019s \u003cem\u003eThe Golden Compass\u003c/em\u003e, the manuscript received the following\nnote from the Sustainable Arts Foundation: \u201cThe troll mythology from your\nNorwegian background is really interesting. This is strong speculative fiction.\nThe action is clearly plotted and the pace is right on.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u00a0goal is to create a series of fantasy novels featuring the magician Molly. I also plan to\ncontinue writing both poetry and literary novels for adults.
