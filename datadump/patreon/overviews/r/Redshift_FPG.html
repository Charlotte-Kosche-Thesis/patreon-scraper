    "summary": "Redshift is a monthly science fiction audio anthology series which debuted in January 2015, some 40+ years after the style largely fell out of fashion in the US. The goal when we started was to recreate some of the magic of near-forgotten shows like Dimension X, The Whistler, Suspense. These shows featured stories by authors who would go onto to become legends ( Arthur C Clarke, Ray Bradbury, Kurt Vonnegut to name a few) and some of the most respected actors of the day like Vincent Price, John Gielgud and of course Orson Welles. While we certainly don\u0027t have the budget to get the modern equivalents (stretch goal?), the Twin Cities area has an astounding creative community of writers and actors. So we assembled a small cast of improv performers, voice actors and enthusiastic muggles to bring to life stories submitted by local authors. Some of whom have many years of experience behind them, others publishing for the first time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first season was a success on many fronts, and we want to continue that success in Season 2. Bigger and better stories, improved production values, a wider and more varied cast. All these things are possible through your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
