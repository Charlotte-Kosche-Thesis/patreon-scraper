You have total control over paying a few dollars for content a creator makes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo take for example, Every month I will be releasing two episodes of 30 with Lee that covers reviewing movies from past and present. Depending what\u0027s going on that month there could be multiple films playing in the theater. If so then that means even more episodes of 30 with Lee but at the minimum it\u0027s two episodes a month. Your card is charged $5 total the beginning of the new month. Typically your charged within the 1st 5 days.\u00a0You have control over how long you\u0027d like to be charged but keep in mind the way Patreon is setup it\u0027s to monthly support your favorite creator or per creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/j8xrq73zh/why-patreon.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI always strive for interacting and establishing a connection with my viewers and listeners on a more personal level.

I am one of the most passionate, opinionated, honest radio / podcast personalities you\u0027ll ever come across. To a degree what you see and hear is the same guy you\u0027ll come across in real life that you\u0027ll want to share a few beers with and just get lost in great conversation for hours at a time. I\u0027ve been a fan of pro wrestling ( which a big bulk of listeners have come to know and love ) since the mid 1980\u0027s. Along the way I\u0027ve befriended people that not only shared the love of this hobbie but also wanted to break into the industry. I\u0027ve helped friends over the years with putting a portfolio together to get noticed by a promotion, participated in the early stages of co-running a promotion, creating promos, calling matches, even once getting in the squared circle. Sadly any dreams or aspirations were cut short with a nasty bump I did in that same match that ended any chance of being a legit wrestler. Despite that I still kept helping out friends and kept the passion for loving the sport alive. Then in 2011 I decided to break out into the world of internet radio and take to the airwaves with my take on all things wrestling related.\u00a0Fast forward to the present and for almost six years, The RCWR Show with Lee Sanders has entertained audiences worldwide with its\nunique blend of up-to-the-minute news and incisive, entertaining commentary on wrestling,\nentertainment and beyond. Through my show I\u0027ve had the opportunites of a lifetime in talking to the people that played a huge part in the man I am today. Guests that include WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels, WWWF Legend Bruno Sammartino, DDP Yoga and WCW alumni Diamond Dallas Page, Sadermania Director Adam Gacka, Radio Personality and host of That Metal Show on VH1 Classic, Eddie Trunk, Matt Hardy, Chavo Guerrero and many, many, many more!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/eplj4om3x/Awesomecon_2017_Event_Highlights_Review-_Stan_Lee.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Chicago and now I reside in the nation\u0027s capital. From an early\nage I knew the performing arts were going to be my career, and I\u0027ve been preparing for this very\nopportunity ever since. I attended the prestigious Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington,\nD.C., alma mater of world-famous entertainers like Ben Williams, Dave Chappelle and Stacey\nLattisaw. It was there I learned from distinguished and experienced mentors and sharpened my\nambition to pursue the kind of creative excellence I was able to participate in for so many years.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/3jr83qbxp/Lee_with_Jim_Ross.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI personally believe there has never been a better time to be an entertainer. The opportunities I have to\nshape my industry and to capture for my audience the true essence of the one-man show are far too\ncompelling to languish only in my dreams. My goal is to shine a spotlight on what I know will be a\nlandmark effort and new direction for independent broadcasting. I want that light to be so bright\nnobody can resist at least giving my show a chance to win them over.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do that, I need your help and participation. This isn\u0027t just about donations, equipment and paying\nbills. This is about building a community around a vision. I\u0027m not going to set up a camera and\nmicrophone to talk at you. I\u0027m going to build a team around the best production values, the best\nequipment and tools and the greatest one-man features lineup since the lights first went on in the Ed\nSullivan theater. I want to invite you to join me and others in my audience to explore possibilities\nothers haven\u0027t considered yet.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/57ls4n0fh/Top10shows_on_Spreaker.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMultiple times we\u0027ve ranked in the top 1000 shows on Stitcher. We\u0027re currently in the top 10 shows on Spreaker in the category of WRESTLING. I\u0027ve\nalready had exclusive celebrity interviews. I already have thousands of downloads and thousands of\nlive plays. We have momentum, excitement and potential. I want this to go to the next level but in order to do that I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s4.postimg.org/tpdvsj2zx/19222691_1133753030063783_7221035629284316522_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider joining my campaign. We\u0027ve got the talent and the track record. Now we need the tools.\nWe\u0027re going to set the standard and the only way I know to guarantee we are at the top of the list is to\nmeet and exceed your expectations show by show, week by week. This isn\u0027t just my project. It\u0027s your\nproject too.
