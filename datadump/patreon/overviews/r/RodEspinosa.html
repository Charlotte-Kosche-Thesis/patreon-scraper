With your help, \"Adventure Finders\" can be a regular series to look forward to every month! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will always strive to give you the best stories we can. And this one is no different. We all know how adventure stories go and with our main character, well, her choices may be a little different than the usual tropes of adventure because she cares about --well, nearly everything. And her path will be her own unique way for sure! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will release a chapter of my book \"Adventure Finders\" every month or so... sometimes once every two months. So donations are per chapter released.\u003cbr\u003eThere are settings there which allow patrons to limit their donation to once a month.\u003cbr\u003eMore than likely, though, you will mostly be donating for a chapter once a month or twice every 3 months. It is far from a monthly thing.\u003cbr\u003eWith that, welcome to Adventure Finders!\u003cbr\u003e",

For now, I will release the links to the PDF on the message boards for this level and up only.
