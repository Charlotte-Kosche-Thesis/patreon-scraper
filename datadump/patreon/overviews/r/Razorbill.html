This goes towards the\u00a0research into you\u0027re character, drafting of ideas, concept art and development then the finished product plus any other minor details you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharacter sheet?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re\u00a0character sheet will express the creature (species), background, and appearance then characteristics like personality or expression, which are important for character design. You could preferably treat this like a character creation sheet for d\u0026amp;d with more visuals. You don\u0027t have to supply all the details but it does help me on the designing end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy experience!\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re looking for concept or reference art for a character you have already made then describing the appearance and expression (personality) is important for the designer.\u003cbr\u003ePersonally I\u0027m mostly experienced with lizards, reptilian, and theropod particularly Baryonyx and then the more legendary dragons to drakes (of equal legendary description). This all stemmed from avian designs in order of bird raptors, reptile, dinosaur (theropod), dragon and then gryphon. So yeah, ending in the harder creature structure of bipedal, quadrupled to hybrid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducer and consumer design preferences.\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0design will have a similarity to my style, hopefully that\u0027s what you\u0027re looking for here!\u003cbr\u003eMy preference for species creation is quite broad but the design boundaries are still there. I am mostly a creator for fantasy creatures and animals of their accurate or mythological anatomical structure with subtle design changes for the types mentioned above.\u00a0Fan based creature design isn\u0027t my style, such as anthropomorphic (human like) or obscurity fan art styles, though there are excuses for certain character designs such as Sergal\u0027s or the scaly variety such as Dragonborn (d\u0026amp;d) or Argonian (Elder Scrolls), not creatures or animals recreated to assume human characteristics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayment for production\u003cbr\u003eWe can discuss a suitable price for the amount of work you require me to produce, this is based around drafts and sketches of you\u0027re desired character design and time taken to produce. Once the work has been produced at the end of our collaboration, it will be made available in high quality, for the required format once you have completed the transaction, contributing towards my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
