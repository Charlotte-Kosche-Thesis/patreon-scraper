All money made here goes straight to my college fund, and I appreciate every cent I receive.\u00a0By no means does anyone have to donate, and I hope no one feels guilty if they can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to donate. Even if I receive nothing on this site, I will continue to progress with determination!

I love constructive criticism, so please give any advice you have! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to contact me, you can note me on DeviantArt (Riverspirit456), or send me an email using my Website (link is on my Patreon page, and in the About page on my Youtube Channel).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by!
