    "summary": "\nI am a 2 year old child, sitting on my grandfather\u0027s lap, watching Michael Flatley and Jean Butler in Riverdance on VHS. The room is sparkling with electricity, their chemistry vibrating through the TV, and I know I want to dance.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGrowing up, it was impossible to take formal lessons, but I never stopped dancing and learning with what resources I had.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt 17, there was a chance to take classes and I jumped into dancing! For a brief year it was all I had to focus on. \u00a0At 18, I began paying for everything myself, working multiple jobs to do so. I have worked 80 hour weeks and practiced 20 hours in that same week. \u00a0Imagine if I could reverse those numbers!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince that moment as a child, it has been my dream to dance. \u00a0Adults would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up. \u00a0I would say proudly, \"A flamenco dancer.\" \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, I am a Competitive Latin Ballroom Dancer. \u00a0Not quite the same thing, but I found the dance form that fits me best. \u00a0It has flare, poise, elegance and passion.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI train daily, in dance and fitness. \u00a0Every decision I make is based on my life as a dancer, and I furiously dance towards my goals. \u00a0Dancing used to be just a dream, now it is my Purpose.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s why, 4 years into my journey as a Competitive Latin Ballroom Dancer, I am calling upon Patreon and all my supporters to help me attain my dance goals, and to cast off the term Starving Artist (I\u0027ll keep the term Tiny Dancer, that\u0027s kind of nice).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI vow to my fans to never give up, always push harder, and to share dance to inspire as it inspired me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your belief in me! You are a part of my growth as a dancer, and your support will create beautiful movement all over the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
