    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eGood day, Thank you all for your interest. Here is some info about me (that\u0027s also my first post):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Reinhardt RENATI holtzinger, 29 years old, born in Toulon (France) where i lived until i was 2 years old. Mum is a chemist and dad is a former french Navy deep sea diver and captain.When dad retired from the Navy, he took my mum, baby brother Ludwig and I to live on the island of Tahiti. This is where i grew up and started learning about Life a very natural and innocent way. Climbing to the tree tops (not affraid of heigths), eating fresh fruits ; Snorkling in the lagoon and diving in the open waters amongst coral reefs, manta rays and perrot fishes ; Learning traditionnal weaving, crafting, building and cooking.\u003cbr\u003eI had been working from the age of 13 in a \u00ab cr\u00eaperie \u00bb after school to make a little money ; i worked a lot in hospitality until 19 y.o. before i got sick of it ; then i did various jobs, i started a business, with my companion at the time, selling and reparing watches, and then i met Michel : he had a vanilla plantation on the Island of Taha\u2019a and a store in Pape\u2019ete where everything was handmade. He taught me how to make soaps, candles, inscents ; how to grow, dry, keep, sort, massage, calibre vanilla and make \u00ab vanilla anything \u00bb. Up to this day he is a mentor to me. Then i became sales manager for Tahiti Vanilla Market. One year later, i flew off Tahiti to start a journey in Australia.\u003cbr\u003eBefore that, i had been to the U.S. and to France a couple of times with my parents to visit familly, i\u2019ve lived for about a year in french speaking Canada from 5 to 6, and i had been to New Zealand (the closest place to fly to from Tahiti) on my own four times from 15 to 20. I had travelled a fair bit before going to Australia.\u003cbr\u003eThere i spent the first 8 months getting an English  diploma (that allows me to teach in CW countries), after what i attended university. I enroled in an Environmental Sciences and Engineering course where i studied ecology, geology, chemistry, climatology and so on. I loved it but it was too academic for me after no school for 6 years or so, and way too expensive. So i quitted after the first year and went on to learn Sustainable Agriculture in a farm school in a nature reserve \u2026 it was a life changing experience ! it really openned my mind to a whole new dimention to Life ! i spent a bit over a year there, the time to get the Certificate of Permaculture under my belt. After that i spent the last 4 months of my trip in Australia helping out an environmental plumber : Trout, to me he is a brother and my second mentor, he helps people setting their off-grid life. I took the plane to come to Europe.\u003cbr\u003eThere i visited South of England, France, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, North of Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and Bulgaria, going everywhere hitch-hiking, following my heart. I mostly attended environmental and social projects, essencialy helping associations to manage their waste as i am good at this. This allowed me to pretty much live for free the whole time, trading my creativity and skills for food and shelter. I did a lot of dumpster diving also. I spent most of 2016 volounteering for an association that holds a ressourcerie . I think this is all too fresh for me to fully realise how good this was.\u003cbr\u003eI had been away from Tahiti for over 6 years. I have been building up skills and researching to create a sustainable project about Miconia, a fast growing plant from Central America that invaded Tahiti and covers around 80% of the Island, and that spreads in all tropical zones in the Pacific Ocean. I want to dedicate my life forth doing my best about that and help people reconnecting there lifestyle to the land they live on and make community. Once I am set up, that is what i will use Patreon for. I\u0027ll probably need more money then.\u003cbr\u003eIt is good to be home.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m pretty eager to learn anything practical.\u003cbr\u003eI also practice chi qong, ta\u00efchi, and a\u00efkido. I am very friendly and i am full of energy ! i can use it in action when needed or to explore my inner universe during quiet times. And to cook delicious meals.\u003cbr\u003eI speak French, and English fluently. Good at Tahitian cr\u00e9ole, learning traditonal Tahitian. I get a fine spanish after a few days of practice.\u003cbr\u003eHere i try to live with the least need for money as possible, by all organic and/or salvaging ways. \u003cbr\u003eOh ! and let me tell you that i am happy to live !! Life is a miracle to my eyes.\u003cbr\u003eI love to share a good laugh.\u003cbr\u003ethere is more to say and plenty more to do ! let us get together !\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
