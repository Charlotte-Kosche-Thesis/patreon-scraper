The work I\u0027m doing is a combination of game guide and full fledged work of fiction, seeking to both inform and delight fellow fans of the series, to help guide new and old players but in the tradition of past games where information wasn\u0027t served up on a silver platter but rather discovered in engaging ways, with a clear aesthetic, but also to tell a story and to pay homage to and turn the camera on the rich world those game developers have built.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see what I\u0027ve made so far in full at:\u003cbr\u003eHttp://roguesfolio.tumblr.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe in progress guide is found at:\u003cbr\u003eHttp://roguesfolio.tumblr.com/guide\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ongoing fiction \u0026amp; backstory can be read at:\u003cbr\u003eHttp://roguesfolio.tumblr.com/story\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I devote more and more time to these projects (which now include a full illustrated set of maps, a game guide, and a growing work of fiction) it takes time out of my other life, painting my own images, and my day job. I\u0027ve always thought that most art, this project included, should be free to anyone to enjoy, no matter social or economic standing and as such work towards keeping it completely an unflinchingly free. That said any support given will be used to further devote time to the expanding of this project, the completing of its tales, and future work in the same vein. I\u0027m nothing without the community of like minded lovers of this series from which I sprang and this work will always continue to be about them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for everything. Your donations, comments,\u00a0criticisms, praise, shares or just your reading mean quite a lot to me."

I set about to make supplemental content to those games, specifically The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, in the form of immersive game guides about a year ago and have since expounded on those core stories by writing fiction after some of my favorite authors and illustrating the works as well. I currently am working on a piece of fiction exclusively which takes place in and pays homage to the stories of Tamriel wherein fellow lovers of the game can get a taste for the rich world building of the series and find helpful guides that enhance their gameplay. The work is available, as it always has been, for free and with an open call to share, distribute, use, and enjoy at will. That said, as I spend more time on the creating of this content, of pouring my absolute best into the storytelling, I turn to you, the fans of this project and those coming in the future, for support. Your support frees me from the difficulties that surround creating free work, namely living day to day, and eggs me on to devote ever more effort and time to making sure they are on par with the content we know and love from the games.",
