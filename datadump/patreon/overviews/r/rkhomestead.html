Our ideal is to create a self sufficient homestead; with an eye towards sustainability, practicality, and respect for animals and nature. Little did we realize that starting this way of life was fascinating and educational for everyone else, not just us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far in just under 3 years of \"backyard farming\", we\u0027ve given excess produce to friends, shared helpful advice and tutorials, and even had a small home-schooled group of kids come to the farm to learn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting a farm and getting it initially established is a pricey endeavor. No matter how much it is \"an investment for the future!\"... it still makes the present quite a struggle.\u00a0Though we tend to be private people, we realized that this is an opportunity to benefit everyone involved. We are looking to share our knowledge and our adventures, in exchange for sponsorship of our farm!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will have content such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Blog posts updating the current events at the farm\u003cbr\u003e- \"How to\" videos for how to do things like chicken tractors, butchering, and gardening\u003cbr\u003e- Livestreaming of special events like, chicks hatching or new animals arriving\u003cbr\u003e- Q\u0026amp;As and AMAs... you have questions, we\u0027ll have answers!\u003cbr\u003e- \"Adopt an Animal\": choose a specific animal on the farm, and you get to name it! In addition, we\u0027ll send you pictures and updates about your special farm friend\u003cbr\u003e- Gift boxes! Get a monthly gift box of various rustic farm items. Presents could be a feather wreath one month, soap the next, jewelry, candles, or various household decorations!\u003cbr\u003e- Farm shares: get a seasonal sampling of what we have to offer every month."
