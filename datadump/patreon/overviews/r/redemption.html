    "summary": "Back in late 2015, our original crew got together to play the Star Wars RPG by Fantasy Flight Games, and decided on a lark to record the show. \"Hey, maybe we could put it out as a podcast!\" we said half-jokingly. By the end of the night we realized we had compelling characters and a great story that we thought others might be entertained by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, that first session was recorded by a laptop and a single microphone in the middle of the table, and that sound was so atrocious we didn\u0027t feel it was worth releasing. Determined, we invested in new microphones, a sound board, and other improvements. A few months later, once we were sure we were going to keep flying, we upgraded yet again to even better gear. We\u0027ve lost a cast member, and gained a new one and the show continues to strengthen. Now we have just started our fourth season, with no plans of stopping anytime soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love what we\u0027re doing, but there are costs associated in producing a quality podcast. That\u0027s why the Patreon. \u00a0We aren\u0027t ever going to charge for any of our episodes, but by supporting us through Patreon, you help us improve the quality of the show and give us more ways to interact with you - our listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider joining us and helping us continue to tell great stories."
