    "summary": "Welcome, my name is Rhodanthe, a full time, freelance, traveling model/ Chief of the Order, currently residing in Philadelphia. What is it that an art model does? They are the power to convey and change a piece of work with the transmutation of soul and lens; trans-formative beings that dance across the canvass, luring you in. The art of a model is to give oneself fully to the evocation of a vision, whether it is directed or of free will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt is about creating an abstract version of reality to reveal the underlying realms within the creator(s). All art is truth, just as truth is subjective.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am creating art as a model, but my next goal is create my own video and film art projects as this is a life long passion. As a stepping to videography, I have divulged in photography and creating gifs, which I frequently share on my private blog. I don\u0027t identify myself as a model on Patreon, but as a visual artist, creating in different mediums. With small to large pledges, I will be to continue these artistic pursuits that will be shared with you all spectrums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I Use Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the best way to say thank you and share my work with the world in a way that appreciates the value of the work created. I do what I can to make sure I get to know my patrons as they get to know me, as in alchemy, life is about equal exchange.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreating Goals and making a Change\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only will you be helping me, but in the long scheme of things, I\u0027m looking to give back to certain organizations, firstly the ALS foundation and 2 others once I reach my $250 goal. If you look at my other goals there is a theme of giving back to the community and people. All goal progress will be shared!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for the interest and I hope that you enjoy the path in which my art takes.\u003cbr\u003e"
