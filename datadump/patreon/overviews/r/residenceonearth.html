    "summary": "Hi everyone,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://residenceonearth.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eResidence on Earth\u003c/a\u003e in 2012 as a way to share my environmental writings, it has been an amazing journey. We live in an extraordinary moment in time where so much is changing and we can co-create our future on this beautiful planet. I believe that we were created for Earth and this is the only planet that we can call home, because everything we are is inextricably part of the Earth. The first essay that I published was\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://residenceonearth.net/2012/09/01/why-we-still/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"Why We Still Don\u0027t Believe in Global Warming\"\u003c/a\u003e which outlines the challenges of communicating climate change and the campaign of climate skepticism fostered by the fossil fuel industry. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I have written articles on many topics, mostly based on what I was interested in at the moment, tied together loosely by the theme of environmentalism. There were sustainable living articles, such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://residenceonearth.net/2013/11/02/care-for-your-pet-care-for-the-planet/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCare for Your Pet, Care for the Planet\u003c/a\u003e, an ambitious three part philosophical essay articulating why the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://residenceonearth.net/2013/09/05/the-art-of-submission-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003earts are essential for sustainability\u003c/a\u003e, tips for people in sustainability careers (\u003ca href=\"https://residenceonearth.net/2014/01/15/charming-your-way-to-sustainability/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCharming Your Way to Sustainability\u003c/a\u003e), and a very personal reflection on love and nature in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://residenceonearth.net/2013/12/20/falling-in-love-on-the-chesapeake-bay/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFalling in Love on the Chesapeake Bay\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently I have been venturing into politics and environmentalism, analyzing how\u003ca href=\"https://residenceonearth.net/2015/04/16/economic-justice-and-sustainability-common-solutions-to-a-common-problem/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e poverty and environmental degradation are linked\u003c/a\u003e, why\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://residenceonearth.net/2015/12/02/why-behavior-change-wont-stop-climate-change/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebehavior change is not enough to address climate change\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://residenceonearth.net/2016/04/19/why-higher-education-should-engage-in-climate-advocacy/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewhy higher education should be engage in advocacy on climate change.\u003c/a\u003e The blog gave me the means to start a dialog with others about these subjects. Most of all it gave me hope in times of doubt.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe connections that I have made through the blog have been amazing, and I\u0027m so grateful for everyone who has read, shared, or responded to the blog. My articles have been assigned as course readings, reblogged to sustainability websites, and published in Sustainability: The Journal of Record. I have had people come up to me at conferences and tell me that my blog gave them hope and inspiration. Young people have told me that my articles have helped them survive in the bewildering arena of the sustainability profession. I\u0027ll never forget the time my essay on behavior change sparked a firestorm of discussion on the Green Schools Listserve, and challenged the way we think about how we respond to the environmental crisis. This last summer, one reader told me that my blog gave her hope and courage in the middle of the worst election in recent memory. She invited me to be keynote speaker at the New York State Sustainability Conference.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that it has been seven years (!), the blog world has expanded a lot, and I have changed a lot. The cost of running a blog has increased, and my time has become more limited. Each year I have to pay fees to maintain the site, the domain, and promotional materials. Going to conferences to give talks and workshops based on the content are enormous costs. I put a great deal of thought into articles, which means that they take a lot of time for me to write, time that I would otherwise be using for paid pursuits. For seven years this has been my gift to the community, but I can\u0027t sustain it without help. My articles have become less frequent, and I have less time to promote it to social media to make sure that it reaches the widest audience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is where you come in. At this time when so much is at stake and our leaders seem determined to destroy the progress that has been made, you can do something to support literature, independent journalism, and intellectual analysis. You can invest in a community of people who want to make the world a better place. You can help to educate minds, promote dialog, and inspire action. Whether you can support $100 a month or $1 a month, you will be doing your part to make the earth a home for everyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith gratitude,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eClara\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
