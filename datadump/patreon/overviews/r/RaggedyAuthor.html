I truly, truly appreciate it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs we move into 2018, I am offering some new selections in the rewards section.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, I am introducing new and continued series here. Season 2 of The Lawmaker is coming, as well as some other cool things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also introducing new rewards tiers - you can now choose which of my serialized offerings you want to support, and at what level. Or, you can continue to support my general writing. Totally depends on what you like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you so much.\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eKai Kiriyama\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.theraggedyauthor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image-21-300x150.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Kai Kiriyama, better known as The Raggedy Author.\u003cbr\u003eI am an independent author-publisher, who writes a little bit of everything. I write horror (for people who don\u0027t like horror,) romance, Urban Fantasy, Noir and everything in between. I have successfully produced and published several books that are widely available in ebook and physical formats.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.theraggedyauthor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image-24-300x150.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way to directly connect to my fans, to get them involved in the creative process and to get immediate feedback on what I\u0027m doing. It is also a steady source of income which, in turn, allows me to produce more quality content on a regular schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.theraggedyauthor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image-22-300x150.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me financially here means that the higher the support, the less I have to seek outside employment. Supporting me here allows me to continue my creative endeavors, and allows me to expand my production away from strictly novels and short stories. Your support means that I can begin producing other media, especially multimedia offerings.\u00a0Your support here, at higher goals, will also allow me to produce physical media, paperback books and such, as well as allow me to keep my lights on and continue to generally live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.theraggedyauthor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image-23-300x150.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me here gets you access to all my Patron-exclusive content. You will see all the things I\u0027m writing well before the general public gets to read them. You will get exclusive content, behind the scenes looks into how I operate. You\u0027ll get to see blogs and journals and all kinds of things that most people don\u0027t get to see. You\u0027ll also get exclusive rewards, such as free copies of ebooks or paperbacks when they\u0027re produced, thank you cards, etc. You\u0027ll also get the feeling of doing something awesome and supporting an independent creator making her dreams come true.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you will consider supporting me.\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u0027re interested in further supporting me, you can check out my other works\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;text=Kai+Kiriyama\u0026amp;search-alias=digital-text\u0026amp;field-author=Kai+Kiriyama\u0026amp;sort=relevancerank\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003eKai Kiriyama\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
