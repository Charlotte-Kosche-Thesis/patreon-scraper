Our articles are aimed to highlight a\nbetter way, how our current system can be reformed, hence our name.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis keeps us away from boring restatements of\nevents that happened, overwhelming detailed analysis, and emotionally laden\narguments, making a trusted source of change and progress presenting views from\nboth aisles of the political spectrum. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\u2019s\nour mission?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst, we want to re-invigorate political\ndiscussion based on issues and theoretical frameworks. When issues such as the\nburkini ban, black lives matter, and even elections come up we want to get to\nthe bottom of what this means for us as citizens, and what\u2019s at stake for our\ncountries.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will do this by drawing on a diverse set of\nopinions and writers, and finding contributors with a passion as deep as ours\nat uncovering causalities and building solutions. This process will be closely\nmonitored through an editorial process and will be based on a writers guide.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSecond, we want to make sure we are fair to\nwriters. Your monthly support will go directly towards compensating our writers for creating well researched content. Nothing frustrates us more than how other online platforms capitalize on free unedited\ncontent provided by writers putting in their best. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy are\nwe on here?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo cover our costs and compensate our writers we need your help!
