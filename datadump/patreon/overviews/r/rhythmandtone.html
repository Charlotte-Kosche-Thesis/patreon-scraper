    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHO I AM\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHi, welcome to Rhythm and Tone RAW~REAL~EXPOSED.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alisha\nLaflamme, I\u0027m the Producer and Host of a bi-monthly Podcast of Performers that captures the untold, humorous and behind the scenes stories with the intent of exposing the persona of the Artist. My show is based out of the \"music capital of the\nworld\", Austin Texas, where I deliver the culture of the community to those who want to get tuned-in about who\u0027s who in the art scene.\u003cbr\u003eI have been a singer song writer, artisan, and\nperformer for over 20 years and now I have the pleasure and duty of exposing the REAL and RAW lives of wacky yet very talented Performing Artists.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMY VISION\u003cbr\u003eFrom music, to comedy, to performing arts, Artists need to be heard and understood. That is why I started RAT. To\u00a0provide\u00a0a platform to share their craft, stories, experiences, road hazards, wisdom, wounds, recoveries and laughs with the desire to encourage and promote our local artists community. My Studio Stage is built to reveal, pull back the curtain and says\" HELLO, I may seem crazy and weird but hey I\u0027m doing what I love!\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy GOAL\u003cbr\u003eTo become a full time Podcaster, so I may\ndedicate more time to Creators and to fulfill my dream of traveling around the\nworld, capturing the most interesting and unique journeys of artists. This can only become a reality if\nI gain your belief, build up our community and capture the finances to fund it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith an exclusive community, patron rewards, and the\nopportunity to grow my Podcast, Patreon was an easy choice. The most exciting\npart is building long lasting relationships with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e$$$ What will I do with the your money I \u00a0receive on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell for starters get rid of one of two jobs so I can actually dedicate more energy, research, time, thought and creativity into produce a top notch show. On a more tangible note; a really sweet computer\nfor editing, an editing program, basic hosting expenses covered, a video cam, lights, new\nspeakers and monitors, mics, chords for My Studio Stage, plus a little extra for looking good and entertaining my guest with some drinks and snacks. My interviews take place in my home studio and I have done a pretty good job piecing it all together but taking it to\nthe next level would be super cool.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPEAK BEHIND THE CURTAIN\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0When you contribute to my show and become an exclusive member of my RAT\ncommunity, you will have access to all podcasts, unseen pics, clips, videos and songs not\nheard anywhere else. You will get a peak behind my Studio Stage Curtain,\ninto the real Persona of THE ARTIST\u2026.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJOIN\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s easy to become part of my RAT Patreon Community click BECOME A PATRON\u003cbr\u003eYou will only be billed for actual shows posted, ( approx 2 shows a month) all the other \"extra\" content is free for exclusive members.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMusic and Arts saved my life\u2026It gave me purpose and meaning\nin a time I could not hear one. Stories are who we are. I want to give back to\nall the artists who have made my life beautiful, by sharing their stories with\nyou. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003eLaflamme\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
