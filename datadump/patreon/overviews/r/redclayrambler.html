    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHelp me document the field of studio ceramics. The podcast features interviews with the best makers, curators, and gallery owners working today.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I created the \u003cem\u003eTales of a Red Clay Rambler Podcast \u003c/em\u003ein\n2012 I wanted to document the quickly evolving field of ceramics from the\nperspective of the maker. So many of the publications about art focus on the\nobjects being made and not the story of the makers. I find it\u0027s essential to\nhear from the artists in their own voices. The podcast format is perfect for\ncapturing in-depth discussions about what it means to devote your life to being\ncreative in the world we live in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYour donations contribute to building a global community of artists and listeners.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nProducing this show has allowed me\nto talk to the most talented makers, curators, critics, and gallery owners\nworking in the field today. I\u2019m grateful to them for freely sharing their\nexperience and creativity with my podcast audience. To date the show has 194\nepisodes, with over 600,000 downloads in over 60 countries. My listeners often\ntell me that the show has been a catalyst and an entry point for them to participate\nin the global community of artists and listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne key element to capturing a good\ninterview is to locate the conversation in a place that makes the person being\ninterviewed feel confident and comfortable. My listeners often tell me that\nthey are pleasantly surprised with how intimate the interviews are. They love\nhearing specific details about success and failure from the lives of the people\nI\u2019ve interviewed. One of the best compliments I\u2019ve received is that longtime\nfriends of the interviewees learned something new about their friends after\nlistening to our interview. Part of creating this intimacy entails meeting\npeople in their own spaces. Every interview recorded over the six seasons that\nthe show has been on the air has been recorded either in the person\u2019s studio,\nhome, or place of their choice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly\u00a0contributions help establish a working budget,\u00a0allowing the podcast to grow and flourish.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo fund the travel, equipment, and\nother costs that are necessary to produce over 40 episodes a year I need your\nhelp. Each hour-long episode takes around three hours to record and four hours\nto edit. Combine this with the time and expense involved in getting to the artists\u2019\nhomes and the production costs quickly escalate. I love making this podcast for\nyou, but I need financial support to keep the show fresh and growing. The best\nthing you can do is to donate monthly to help establish a working budget for\nproduction costs. Your contributions help me schedule, research, and record the\nepisodes, giving you more content to enrich your creative life. The Patreon format\nallows you to easily become a sustaining member of the Red Clay Rambler\ncommunity and support a show you care about. I\u0027m happy to join thousands of\nother content creators who are now using this service to help fund their\npodcasts and projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m honored and grateful to have a\ncommunity of listeners who value the podcast and its role in documenting the\nfield of ceramics. Many thanks for joining this community and making the \u003cem\u003eRed Clay Rambler Podcast\u003c/em\u003e possible!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBen"
