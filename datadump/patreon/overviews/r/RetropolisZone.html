    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Retropolis Zone:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRetropolis Zone is a YouTube channel I started in March of 2015 and have evolved into a place dedicated to in-depth reviews on video games. In recent years I have taken a lot of interest in game design after trying to understand why I like or dislike certain games and why I feel certain games are good or bad in terms of quality. To share this passion of mine, I created \u003cem\u003eQuickies Don\u0027t Cut It\u003c/em\u003e: a series where the ultimate goal of each video is to give the covered title as much of a fair and unbiased analysis as I possibly can. Due to mediocre performance in terms of views, however, \u003cem\u003eQuickies Don\u0027t Cut It\u003c/em\u003e has been dropped, in favor of experimenting with a new format. With this new format, I split my reviews/retrospectives up in chunks, and then release the full version after all the parts are uploaded. The parts usually release on a weekly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon campaign:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon campaign has been set up for generous fans who want to support me. The amount of effort that goes into producing what seem like silly YouTube videos is very substantial for most content creators - it\u0027s no different for me, regardless of my relatively low subscriber count. Even though I absolutely love uploading finalized videos I am proud of and can\u0027t say enough about the great comments I receive afterwards, the process of getting there is a time-consuming and demanding one to go through -- especially with such long videos. I do my best, but like any other human being I have responsibilities, so getting quality content out there consistently isn\u0027t always achievable. There are so many games I want to talk about and I am already getting so many requests; donations can help in pushing all of this forward. Ideally I would do YouTube as a part time or even full time job for as long as it is feasible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you drop me a dollar per retrospective or more -- heck, if you just watch my content and enjoy it -- I thank you very much for doing so! I just want to make it abundantly clear that backing me via Patreon will not give you influence over the direction of my channel. Go forward knowing that your dollar(s) are much appreciated and go to a collective goal for Retropolis Zone: me being able to justify to pour more and more of myself into the channel as the donations become higher.\u003cbr\u003e"
