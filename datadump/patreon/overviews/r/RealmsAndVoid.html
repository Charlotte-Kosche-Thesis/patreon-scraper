Fantasies I\u0027ve never heard of do not offend me, they INTEREST me!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to heavy workflows, commissions are limited to my OWN characters (which you can browse in the archive comics), but if I pay homage to a guest-OC, and their creator has permitted me to offer them, I will make a post announcing them as \"unlocked\" :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have set up different reward-tiers for different amounts of custom-images. Feel free to pledge long-term and build your own comic or image-set over time. In the past, some people have been very detailed about their commission requests, some have been very laid-back. Some have even said \"I want X vs Y - do whatever you want.\" So feel free to be as descriptive or non-descriptive as you wish. But do remember that descriptiveness will get you closer to what you want to see. Many of my commissioners have shown me reference-images or even images of my own to refrerence from. Some folks just say \"I trust you\" when commissioning me, and, well, if you trust me, then feel free to trust me! Ha ha!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, this might make some of you laugh; but in the past, I have been commissioned by people who have not SEEN my work before. I know, that\u0027s sounds silly, but it happens. So err... ...make sure you\u0027ve SEEN my work before commissioning me!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOMMISSIONING EXTRA PAGES OR IMAGES:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the $20 and above tiers, you can donate extra payments to my Paypal to commission more images or comics pages. - If I am making an image-set for you, $5 will get you 2 extra images for your commission, and if I am making a comic for you, $5 will get you 1 extra page. You can add as many images or pages are you like to your commission! - All additional payments will be handled via Paypal, payable to Cybermonth@hotmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOMMISSIONING YOUR OWN OCS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCommissioning your own OCs is a bit of a grey-area. It all depends on what the OC looks like and how easy (or complicated) they\u0027ll be to build in 3D. - When you show me your character, I will carefully examine it and give you the build-price. The build-price will take into account the simplicity or complexity of the character, my ability, the labour that may be involved and the time it will take. - \u003cstrong\u003eBuilding a character is treated as a project in and of itself\u003c/strong\u003e, so that payment will be handled seperately from the project you want. - So if you want a comic with X vs Y, you\u0027ll pay for the build of X vs Y first, then after that their comic or image-set will be regular prices. Once a character is built, that character will be saved, so regular prices will be available for them after that. - Prices can range anywhere from $10 to $50 to build a character. - For example, a bikini-girl isn\u0027t going to take that much labour, so $10 will be average, but if it\u0027s someone with a fancy costume and appendages coming out of her wazoo, then that may cost more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for supporting myself and the Realms And Void, may General Ulkun Backshank watch over you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e- Dr. Edgar Slam\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
