You can put a cap on it if you are worried about me\u00a0writing 200 essays and bankrupting you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything that would have gone on the blog will still go on the blog -- you can carry on reading me for free if you want -- but if you find me interesting and want to encourage and support me then please consider clicking the button and becoming a patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
