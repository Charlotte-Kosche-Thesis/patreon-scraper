This has always felt like another social media scenario and I just can\u0027t get into it. ]; SO come follow me at \u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/killernen\"\u003ehttp://twitch.tv/killernen\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027ll be folding private streams into my subs from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes down to it, not all my paintings are treated the same. I don\u0027t make limiteds of everything I do, and I can\u0027t make a landmark painting every month. It\u0027s just not how my brain works. Patreon needs that monthly consistency, and it\u0027s just not in me right now. \u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for coming on this brief journey with me.
