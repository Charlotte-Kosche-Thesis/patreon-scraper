    "summary": "My name is Rikki Poynter. I\u0027m a 26-year-old deaf YouTuber, content creator, writer, activist, and public speaker living in Charlotte, North Carolina. I am mostly known for my video, \"Shit Hearing People Say\", and as the person who has been advocating for more and proper closed captioning on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI officially started YouTube in 2010 as a beauty vlogger until I decided to start fresh as more of a lifestyle vlogger in 2014. On a new channel, I started making videos about deaf awareness and accessibility, mostly closed captioning. My advocacy got the attention of people like Tyler Oakley, who had made his own campaign inspired by me called Hear Me Out, and Lilly Singh. News outlets such as Huffington Post, BBC News, Upworthy, and ABC News have also take notice. Through this work, I\u0027ve been able to work with Google and YouTube on bettering accessibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough my YouTube channel and written works, I talk about my life as a mainstreamed deaf person who is finding her way through Deaf culture and a new identity, learning ASL, as well as my mental health, growing up with child abuse, social issues and more.\u003cbr\u003e"
