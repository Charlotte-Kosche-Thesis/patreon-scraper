It represents my tree of life, where the roots connect me to my past, the trunk being the core of my soul, and the branches seeking the light, growing upwards; expanding and experiencing different avenues and mediums. All are constantly connected, growing and evolving and this is reflected in my artwork.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI explore the spectrum of creative mediums and my creations reflect the free spirited ideals I have developed through exploring it.
