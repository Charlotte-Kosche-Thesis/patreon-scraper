Actually, I\u0027m pretty sure you don\u0027t. My name, at least my online name, is Ratchetness. Or nowadays, it\u0027s Ratchet Noblewolf. This name change was to merge with the many things I believe in, especially wanting to give you a less misleading impression (Because come on, RATCHETNESS is perceived in stereotypical ways, let\u0027s be honest, despite my name origins coming from the video game Ratchet and Clank.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI make videos...Well...That was easier than I thought.\u003cbr\u003eAll seriousness, I usually make gaming videos predominately, and I also make commentaries on other things that probably isn\u0027t as gaming related (film, animations, etc). I also like to write, from making music to script writing for a potential film or video, or writing chapters for a literature story or two. Basically,\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e I like to tell stories\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e*gasp*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eComing out of school, I can finally seize the opportunity I wish I had throughout my distracting semesters. I just purchased FAR more stable internet connection (My OG subscribers know haha), along with an office space location to create content more flexibly. These assets will definitely help me move forward in growing my channel. The challenge? The intent in taking this fuller time. This is where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the pledged funds, first and foremost, are going towards my Youtube finances to sustain the assets I have, from stable internet and office space, which is an important recording location. I don\u0027t have any intention using the funds for buying games, materialistic items, or even recording equipment (UNLESS something comes up through importance).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWhy pledge?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e So I want to be as simple as possible: That\u0027s a tricky question for many to answer, to be honest. With that said, there is something I did figure. I am \u003cstrong\u003enot \u003c/strong\u003eintending on using Patreon tiers, rewards, or whatever seems like a potential paywall that I don\u0027t want to enforce. For the record, my videos and content will still be for free through Youtube. So, I just think this can be considered as a \"tipping jar\" of some sort, where you can help me out with however much you\u0027d like. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it also comes down to \u003cstrong\u003ebelief\u003c/strong\u003e. If you believe in who I am and what I do, this could be one way of showing that. Like any other entertainment piece we all go consume, from your favorite video games to films, music and novels:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI honestly want you to help me because you want to help me\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. As simple as it gets really. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there is anything else to say, I will obviously give this page some light on my social media, meaning that I will mention, advertise, and promote here and there. THAT said, there\u0027s no worries. I don\u0027t plan on shoving it down your throat, as it\u0027s just not right. It\u0027ll also be way too alienating and intrusive. In other words, If I\u0027m promoting, it has to be in context and make sense. So, I will keep all of that in check. I don\u0027t want anything too technical or confusing on what I\u0027m doing here vs. what I\u0027m doing on Youtube. Simplicity is key here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eHey, you should know this!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSo let\u0027s talk on the medical side. I think people should know that I have\u00a0two diseases, one back spinal (degenerate) \u00a0and another being both of my corneas (keratoconus). My treatments are pretty pricey, with insurance difficulties. They are also pretty painful and annoying, especially my vision. I have to be honest, it can get overwhelming sometimes. So I guess if anybody is thinking about helping me out, you should know about my disabilities before doing so. I may have to be away sometimes for these reasons, and that alone is frustrating. However, many people have it worse, and I\u0027ve gotten this far, so I\u0027ll keep going. I just thought it\u0027s worth a mention if you notice these issues and have no clue what the deal is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou should also know this!\u003c/strong\u003e Let\u0027s talk about ambition! Expect an average of gameplay videos and commentaries on my Youtube channel, both gaming and non-gaming related. You can also expect my ambition. I tend to try new things, such as being a writer for making a script-based series. Or maybe you\u0027ll see me write stories that may actually take your eye, the little naive/novice author that I am. You could also see me work on filming, short films, and the like. Or even, you could see make some music...\u003cbr\u003eI guess what I\u0027m trying to say: I intend to do a lot of things. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI think we all have that artist within ourselves to express ourselves in one way or many\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. We all have dreams, we all have those thoughts on what we want to do. We also should have thoughts on what we\u0027re going to do. Who knows? Maybe you\u0027ll be surprised as I may be myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWelp...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis, so far, concludes my introduction. I think for a better, concrete idea for those who may want more evidence of my content, you could always check out my Youtube channel linked here for confirmation. This could determine whether or not you want to support me. Whether it\u0027s through a pledge or through a view, any way helps, and I really do appreciate it. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e to everyone who has read this. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e to all for your patience and consideration. And lastly, but definitely not least, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e to anyone out there who stuck with me for this long. Who knows? Maybe that\u0027s belief right there."
