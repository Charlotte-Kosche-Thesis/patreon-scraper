     "about": "I\u0027m here to bring yoga to the people. I\u0027m here to introduce yoga without the ego. Life is too short to take ourselves seriously. There are no prerequisites for yoga. You \u003cem\u003edo not \u003c/em\u003ehave to be \"in shape\", I love what ever shape you come in. You\u003cem\u003edo not \u003c/em\u003ehave to be flexible, everyone has to start somewhere. You \u003cem\u003edo not\u003c/em\u003e need to believe in a certain dogma, yoga fits into any spirituality or lack there of. The only requirement is that you come into class with the willingness to try something new in a supportive, non competitive atmosphere. I facilitate yoga all over the world but my home is southeast Michigan. We smile in class, we giggle, we fall, but we get back up again. Yoga can be a challenge but it has the power to transform lives. That\u0027s why my mission is to make it available to anyone who is willing to try, without the intimidation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy teaching style stems from a background in performance art and psychology, specializing in teaching those who would normally shy away from yoga. Performing and teaching at a myriad of festivals \u0026amp; events across the US \u0026amp; Central America, I received my 200RYT at Danyasa Yoga Arts in Costa Rica trained in the art of Danyasa (Dance-Vinyassa).  Seeing this big beautiful world is of the upmost importance to me. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve created an online practice, so my students around the globe can continue their own practice in the comfort of their own home.\u00a0",
