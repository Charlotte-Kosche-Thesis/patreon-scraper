Not far away I grew up in an old 10 room farm house that had lovely art nouveau style in every pillar, picture frame, and stick of wood. The artists who contributed to that art period were absolutely rock stars to me. When I was 6 my brother got the D\u0026amp;D red box set when it first came out and I was blown away! Holy crow that box cover, am I right!? I mean... I already thought I wanted to be an artist, but from that moment on I was certain that I wanted to do fantasy illustration \u00a0- and for years I have! I\u0027ve had the good fortune to work on very cool games and books. Some notable ones are Call of Cthulhu, Cthulhu Wars, The Gods War, Starship Troopers, Conan, and I even got to do some cartooning work in Red Dragon Inn.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is more than any one project for me though, it has the power to translate an idea from one person\u0027s mind to someone else. A painting can be an arrangement of color and form that can help someone feel exactly what the artist feels and it can tell an entire story with a single image. That\u0027s really exciting stuff to me!\u00a0Painting and creating a visual narrative is my passion. I love to create things that inspire, something that helps bring an idea to life in a unique way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/v9tQa3O.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hU0Ie37.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/37JNuM0.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main project at this time is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eVisions From the Dream Diary.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I have selected entries from my very own dream diary and I am going to make an art book from them! I have been recording my dreams for many years, most of them are like finished short stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just starting the book now and I thought some people might really enjoy seeing this as it develops! \u003cem\u003eThat\u0027s what I plan to do here, exclusively on Patreon!\u003c/em\u003e I will document artwork from beginning to end and even share some art techniques that I have learned or created myself. I plan to post at least once a week and share a video that reveals some of my secrets and techniques once a month! I am brand spanking new here, so I\u0027m sure things will change a bit as we go along. I definitely would like to hear from \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e about what you would like to see and what your opinions are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and one more thing. The 8\"x10\" gicle\u00e9 prints I have as rewards? They are a only available right here on Patreon! Though I do have 12\"x16\" prints available for sale in my Etsy shop, the smaller size is only available here. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JypJgKy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform where people who appreciate an artists work can show their support in the form of monetary love. We all have expenses, right? Patron is kind of like a tip jar. In return for your patronage you get an exclusive look behind the scenes.\u00a0If you are a first time Patron you can find answers to most of your questionshere \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e.
