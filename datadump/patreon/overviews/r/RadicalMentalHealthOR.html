    "summary": "Hi!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Caleb and I\u0027m the founder of Radical Mental Health Oregon. I started RMHO to unify our communities to challenge current practices of the mental health care system and psychiatric field. Our goal is to make the system humanizing, peer and patient led, scientifically based, and built around freedom of choice and treatment.\u00a0 We fight against involuntary confinement, restraint, and coercive treatment. We also oppose the rampant medical neglect found throughout the mental health industry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRMHO was created to be a space for survivors of the abusive psychiatric system and their allies to radically challenge the harm being perpetrated against people with psychiatric diagnoses in our communities. We do so through activism, education, and community building strategies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can we make sure that RMHO lives up to its potential and accomplishes its goal of radically changing the way people in the mental health care system are treated? By establishing a solid base of supporters! Things like flyers, leaflets, posters, educational pamphlets, and protest material cost money. Distributing information about the organization costs money. And time. There\u0027s a vast array of things RMHO can do to become more effective if given the support and backing it needs. We could have events, speakers, build coalitions and committees, work with individuals in the field, or become a source of vital assistance to people struggling with their mental health or the system that is meant to help them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a monthly patron is the most powerful way you can show your support for this projects and its goals. With your help, RMHO can make a difference and change the field of mental health. We can protect people in Oregon and beyond. Together we can become a catalyst for action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a final note, I want to thank everyone who has helped Radical Mental Health Oregon come this far. That goes to every single person who follows us on facebook or twitter, or engages with our content. To everyone who gives to RMHO. And really, thank you to everyone who is aligned with our mission. I hope that we can join together to create a powerful movement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Caleb\u003cbr\u003e"

These experiences opened my eyes to the catastrophic issues facing mentally ill people and others diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. I discovered there are inherent flaws to the field of psychiatry and that it\u0027s doing serious harm to people in my communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to protect others by reaching out, educating people, and being a force for change. RMHO was inspired by Radical Mental Health Maine and the radical abolitionist community, and I hope that through it I can accomplish the kind of activism I have dreamed of since I was a kid.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make art, do martial arts, and am learning ASL. I\u0027m researching for a book I wish to write about psychiatric trauma. My main self-help strategies are using SuperBetter and EpicWin (SB is a website and a mobile app, EpicWin is a mobile app). Through these I\u0027m creating a survival kit for people who have experienced trauma at the hands of the mental health system.\u00a0",
