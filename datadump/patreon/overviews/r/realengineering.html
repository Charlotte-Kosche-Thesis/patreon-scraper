So let\u0027s talk about some things you may not know. My name is Brian and I\u0027m an engineer from Galway, Ireland. I have a B.Eng in Biomedical Engineering and a Master\u0027s in Aeronautical Engineering.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy journey with Real Engineering started in early 2016 when I got frustrated with the way engineering was being portrayed in popular culture. I believe engineers create positive change in this world and I wanted to share their stories and hopefully inspire some future engineers while I was at it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also just adore learning and I was inspired by people like Destin and his channel Smarter Every Day. He\u0027s actually why I studied aeronautical engineering in the first place!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created Real Engineering to showcase the amazing engineering that goes behind everyday things.\u00a0I like to ask simple questions \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rXGRPMD-GQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhy Are Plane Windows Round?\u003c/a\u003e \" and explain the science and history behind it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have a big production team behind me. When I started Real Engineering it was just me. I wrote, animated and voiced everything myself. Today I have another Engineer/Animator helping me create better videos, thanks to your support on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, I managed to make this channel my full time job. That was my goal for the year. For 2017, I aim to begin expanding and employing other people. I plan to begin expanding the Real Engineering team to improve the production quality and frequency of the videos I post. All of these projects are going to require investment and your donations are helping towards that goal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading all this. Thank you for watching my videos. Thank you for even considering supporting me on Patreon. I am eternally grateful for all my subscribers for helping me live my dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
