    "summary": "When Rhiannon was six years old she wrote an eight page story and fell in love with the art of writing. When she was sixteen a little voice came to her in class. The voice was Andy Martin and she hasn\u0027t shut up since.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAt eighteen years old Rhiannon was diagnosed with Endometriosis and thought her life might be over. She spent four years attempting to do what she was supposed to and work a normal job but her health only got worse and she was forced to stop. She stopped everything until she was twenty-three years old when, after eight years, she completed her first novel. From the moment her fingers typed the last words she felt a weight lift. She could do this, she could write and she could do it well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eShe created this account to start a community where both creators and lovers of all things fiction could come together. Where she could be supported while she works. Where she can connect and share her work with like minded individuals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

Six years ago I was diagnosed with Endometriosis and PCOS after trying and failing many careers due to my illnessess I fell into a depression wondering what I would do with my life. One year ago I sat down at my desk and finished the novel I had been working on for eight years and was filled with joy. Here was something I could do with the rest of my life, regardless of my setbacks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOblivion is that novel and it is the first in a seven part supernatural thriller narrated by reluctant protaganist Andy Martin. With your help I will be Self-Publishing this year.\u003cbr\u003eAlong with this series I have several other projects in the works. I write novels, short stories, flash fiction and poetry. This year I have started to dabble in article writing and blogging.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
