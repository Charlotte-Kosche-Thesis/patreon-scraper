    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://www.lummoxpress.com/lc/about-the-head-lummox/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eI\u0027ve\u003c/a\u003e been writing for most of my life, but it\u0027s only in the last 23 years that I\u0027ve gotten serious about it. Also about 20 years ago, I started the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.lummoxpress.com/lc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLummox\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Press\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to self-publish chapbooks. This soon led to a series I called the \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLittle Red Books\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e. Soon I was publishing other poets. The \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLittle Red Book\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e series lasted for 61 titles. In 2008 I started publishing \u003cstrong\u003ePrint On Demand books\u003c/strong\u003e (or \u003cstrong\u003ePOD\u003c/strong\u003e). This became the \u003cstrong\u003eRespect Series\u003c/strong\u003e. So far, I have published 63 titles. Most of this publishing was done as a hobby which paid for itself and in turn gave me a small profit after I paid the poets their royalties. During this time I was working my handyman gig...but now, due to health issues, I can\u0027t do that kind of work anymore, so my hobby has become a full time job (for part time pay) and that\u0027s where \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyou come in\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. With your help I can continue to grow the \u003cstrong\u003eLummox Press. \u003c/strong\u003eThis will make it possible for the Lummox to meet the growing demands for quality\u00a0poetry books for both first timers and \u00a0experienced poets. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t believe me, check out a few of the comments I\u0027ve received from poets I have published:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA\nsimply beautiful book--thank you so much. \u2013 Lyn Lifshin\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eKeep\nup the good work.  \u2013 Dan Fante\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eI have been following you for a long\ntime and I think you do a splendid job. \u2013 L.

The winner gets a chapbook (40 copies), a feature in the Anthology and a small cash prize. I\u0027d like to make it a bigger cash prize, but I\u0027d also like to pay my rent on time...So you can see there are lots of projects and more in the future, here at Lummox.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could really use your help, can I count on you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e"
