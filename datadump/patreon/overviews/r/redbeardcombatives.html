    "summary": "Redbeard Combatives was birthed out of a need in the civilian community for a comprehensive combatives program. Much of the world\u0027s militaries do not have a formalized combatives program competent for their needs. Those that do have the down side of have to mass produce their product and tailor it to all levels of thinking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is\u00a0not to simply take a military combatives program and sell it to the public, but\u00a0rather take my experience\u00a0in curriculum development and mission specific planning to deliver a competent combatives program that the civilian populous can utilize. The program is geared toward not simply taking techniques and committing them to memory where only the athletic and coordinated can retain them but instead to start at a foundational level and\u00a0teach the thinking involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo\u00a0do\u00a0so we will look\u00a0at\u00a0proven battle tested techniques from squad level small unit tactics to individual combat skills. We will then tailor them for some of the most common encounters and PROVE them in force on force training.\u00a0"
