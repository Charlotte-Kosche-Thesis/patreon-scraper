I\u0027ve founded activist theater companies in Scotland and Ecuador, created public art projects in Los Angeles and New York, and helped nonprofits get funding for community improvements and arts. I run my little pop-up poetry store on the streets of LA and publish reviews, poetry, and, once, an academic article on Thoreau.",
