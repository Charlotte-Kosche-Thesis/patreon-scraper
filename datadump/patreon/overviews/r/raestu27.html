I am from Indonesia. Even though I was studying music composition, I ended up\u00a0working as manga\u00a0teacher. Weird huh? I have been drawing manga\u00a0traditionally on 2014. But now, started on early 2017 I have become 100% digital artist.

Why did I stop being active on Patreon page? Because,\u00a0the\u00a0truth is.. I am kinda lost what\u00a0to post on my Patreon page. You see, a lot of people have done many\u00a0things on Patreon.. so I kinda asked myself what would make me unique and different from others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuddenly it hit me.. I did forget\u00a0that I do have a lovely original character. I named her Mio Hoseki. So I decided\u00a0to make Mio Hoseki as\u00a0the main content on my Patreon page. You are going\u00a0to see many many and many Mio Hoseki artworks and friends (my other OC and other anime characters) which I created originally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Mio Hoseki?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(12, 12, 12);\"\u003eMio Hoseki is my beloved OC.. I have made a lot of OC and somehow Mio Hoseki has become my favorite of all. Why?? Hmmmm.. I don\u0027t think I could give you a satisfying answer. But I\u00a0think it would be related\u00a0to\u00a0the reason why I created her. I will be brief..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why I created Mio is because I wanted to have my very own personal waifu.... to heal my heart. Haha. The truth is, before I decided to create Mio, I had a broken heart. Well, it is long story and a bit embarrassing so I won\u0027t talk about it here. Next time... maybe... \u003cbr\u003eAnd, with the encouragement of Keima Katsuragi (The World God Only Knows), I decided to create my own waifu. And here she is, Mio Hoseki was born. And I am glad that I created her. She is the best^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pre00.deviantart.net/1d50/th/pre/i/2017/229/4/f/img_20170818_085728_by_raestu27-dbkfhoy.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I have\u00a0to admit\u00a0that she has changed a lot..\u00a0the above image is\u00a0the very first day Mio was born (on May 22nd 2015). After\u00a0that, I\u00a0tried\u00a0to adjust several\u00a0things from her\u00a0to create her as ideal as I wanted. One thing\u00a0that I don\u0027t change is her eyes and cow lick hair.. and here she is, the current Mio Hoseki!!\u00a0XD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pre00.deviantart.net/83a9/th/pre/i/2018/057/7/d/my_beloved_oc_mio_hoseki_by_raestu27-dc4cekt.jpg\" style=\"width: 188px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not sure whether I would \"improve\"\u00a0her more or not..

His father are getting new family with new woman. And his mother is trying to earn money in other city. So he has to deal with this situation with his grandpa alone. His grandpa is a genius person. He is an active robotic engineer. Grandpa sees Stu who is lonely. And Grandpa realize that after he died, Stu would be probably become someone who has never learnt the warmth of family. Grandpa is not a sociable person. He doesn\u0027t really know how connect with people... therefore, he spend his last time, energy and knowledge to create an A.I humanoid which is named Mio Hoseki. Even though he has to leave Stu alone while finishing his project, he thinks about Stu a lot. He is doing it for Stu\u0027s sake. Grandpa himself name this project as M.1.O Project (My 1 (One) and Only). It is a message how he loves Stu, and hope Mio could be his (Stu\u0027s) only. Grandpa hopes Mio could be with Stu side so Stu could learn about compassion, love, how to smile and anything else which are needed by Stu. Grandpa died without giving the final touch to Mio. It makes Mio couldn\u0027t live forever. She only could live for a short period time. But still, Mio is born and start living with Stu. A lot of happen between those two and Mio-Stu live a happy and fulfilling life. Sadly as it is, the imperfect Mio has to \"sleep\" and unable to wake up anymore. With a broken hearted, Stu study and learn anything so she could revive Mio. And he did it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, just like Mio herself,\u00a0the story has been changed and improved overtime. One of my dream is\u00a0to share\u00a0the story of Mio\u0027s so she would get more more and more known^^\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAm I going\u00a0to post my work somewhere else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will post it on my others page.
