    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Kayleigh - a coxswain, coach, and creator of \"\u003ca href=\"http://readyallrow.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReady all, row...\u003c/a\u003e\". I started the blog in October 2012 when I realized there weren\u0027t many educational resources out there for coxswains to turn to if they had questions or just wanted to educate themselves on what their role entailed. We\u0027re expected to do and know a lot but it\u0027s rare that anyone actually sits down and explains that stuff step-by-step or relates their own experiences as a coxswain in a way that helps others learn from their successes and failures. That\u0027s been my primary goal since Day 1 to ensure every coxswain is confident in their abilities to lead their team and help make their boat go fast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re interested you can check out \u003ca href=\"http://readyallrow.org/ready-all-row-2-0-in-progress/\"\u003ethis blog post\u003c/a\u003e where I laid out all the details of why I\u0027m starting a Patreon and what I hope to do with the blog going forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn five years the blog has never been monetized, which is something I (stubbornly) held as a point of pride for a pretty long time. After taking a hard look at my finances, especially after moving to New York, it was clear that it was time to find a way to capitalize on what the blog had grown into if the quality it\u0027s become known for was going to be sustainable going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever seen that episode of Family Guy where Stewie asks Brian if he\u0027s got his money, Brian says he\u0027ll pay him soon (twice), and then Stewie kicks his ass?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TruXhuAO4IY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStewie is my student loans and I\u0027m Brian. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn average I spend about 20 hours per week on the blog, either writing articles or responding to emails. That\u0027s 20 hours a week I could be spending at a part-time job (on top of my full-time job) earning an additional paycheck so I can pay my bills each month and \"put some money away for the future\", whatever that means (I\u0027m a millennial, saving money is a foreign concept to us). Your support can help make that happen though, in addition to ensuring Ready all, row... will be a viable resource for coxswains well into the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patreon is...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eConsider it a virtual tip jar that lets you donate what you think is appropriate in order to help me continue growing the blog and working with coxswains around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patreon isn\u0027t...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t about putting the blog behind a paywall or limiting access to it - in my mind that would be hypocritical and counterproductive to everything I\u0027ve been saying since I started it. Ready all, row... will \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be a free resource for coxswains, rowers, and coaches to use whenever they need it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn to the good stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to make this Patreon beneficial for the both of us. You\u0027ll see that one of the rewards is a monthly one-on-one Skype sesh with me where we can talk about ... pretty much whatever you want. Questions you have, recordings you want feedback on, it\u0027s up to you. I know a lot of you are operating on student-budgets though so I plan on setting aside a portion of the donations to cover \u003cstrong\u003efive\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003efree 30-minute one-on-ones each month that any coxswain can take advantage of. Keep an eye on the blog or email me for details on how you can snag one of those sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI say this anytime I talk to people about the blog but I\u0027m still blown away by what it\u0027s grown into and I attribute a lot of that to the coxswains, rowers, and coaches who read, ask questions, and share the knowledge they\u0027ve gained with their teammates. I really wouldn\u0027t be able to do what I do without you guys and I am so appreciative of your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you on the water!\u003cbr\u003eKayleigh\u003cbr\u003e"
