    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi beautiful folk! \u003c/strong\u003eThanks for visiting my Patreon. I am Polish, London-based, left-wing but into listening, political but quirky. Interests include feminism, mental health, cultural differences and punching-up humour. Love poetry, adore theatre, music, singing and dancing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is what I do: \u003c/strong\u003eI write and perform stand up comedy, poetry and theatre. I wrote a play called \u003cstrong\u003e\"Girlfag\"\u003c/strong\u003e (now writing full-length version); currently I\u0027m performing a new one woman show \u003cstrong\u003e\"Fuck It, I\u0027m Thirty\"\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m also working on a podcast \u003cstrong\u003e\"London Pole: Jobstealer\u0027s Podcast\"\u003c/strong\u003e with a German friend, showcasing German-Polish friendship in the EU crisis. I do live videos (recently from show\u0027s creation, earlier from Polish #blackprotest about reproductive rights), I improvise, I write songs - alone and within the duo The Living Songbook (find us \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thelivingsongbook\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thelivingsongbook\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://thelivingsongbook.bandcamp.com/releases\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e). If you choose to support me, I can offer a lot of variety, as well as interesting, thoughtful message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a blog called \u003cstrong\u003eGood Enough Diary\u003c/strong\u003e, for mental health related content. I write for \u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/author/rita-suszek\"\u003eHuffington Post\u003c/a\u003e  and \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@RitaEs\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e on more political things. You can find me on \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/RitaSuszekTV\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/RitaSuszekTV\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, Instagram - @rita_vision and Twitter: @ritasuszek.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is The Money For: \u003c/strong\u003eI am slowly switching from the job-based model. By slowly I mean that I will maintain a casual employment while making art and trying out business ideas on the side. Most of my art I don\u0027t get paid for yet, and I\u0027d like to change that. So if you feel that I\u0027m worth reading, listening to or watching, you can follow me here and choose to contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
