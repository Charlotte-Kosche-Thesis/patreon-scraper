The story of a young half-elf artist named Eldril who meets the dragon, Clemexa in a London coffee shop. She quickly finds herself thrown into a world of sex, intrigue and dangers she never new existed, not to mention the attentions of a very dominant dragon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also planning a new project to create a sort of \u0027audio book\u0027 of me reading the various chapters I\u0027ve written. Likely published on youtube!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m putting up this patreon page mainly as another place to share my work rather than a way to make money for it. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m remotely good enough to earn money through writing yet, but hopefully one day!"
