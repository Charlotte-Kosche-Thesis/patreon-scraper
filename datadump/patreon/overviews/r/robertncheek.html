    "summary": "So, I\u0027m new to this whole creative process. While I\u0027ve pursued a career,\u00a0I wrote two novels that have done marginally well.\u00a0(You can find them on Amazon here: \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/RNCAmazon\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/RNCAmazon\u003c/a\u003e ) I\u0027ve produced some other materials that everyone who reads them seems to like. \u00a0Most importantly- I\u0027ve found that I LOVE to write. And, if I may say so- I\u0027m good at it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut,\u00a0I was tired of spending 70 hour weeks in an office and trying to find extra time to do the thing that I love. So I needed to make a change. I quit my job. I walked away from a law practice, a secure income, and the reason for hundreds of thousands in student loan debt to chase my dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t do anything in half measure. When I start something, I dive in head first. For a few weeks, I was working from home and getting tons of writing done- but now, I\u0027m setting out on the next phase.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m moving to LA! In November, I\u0027ll be packing up the car and heading west. I\u0027m going to try to break in to the industry as a writer. And with your help, I know it\u0027ll happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, how will I be using your support? Well first, your support will help keep alive- essential to the writing process, as I understand it. As things progress, I would love to update my equipment to produce better audio and video and make my production process easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will you get for your support? Once I get things settled, I will be the most active creator on this website. I will update multiple times a week with audio podcasts, video blogs, and new short stories all the time. You will get access to everything I do- to join me as I start this crazy adventure I\u0027m going on. \u00a0I promise a patron experience that is second to none.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe most importantly, my hope is that someday you\u0027ll be walking through a book store (those still exist right), flipping through your channel guide, or walking through a movie theater; you\u0027ll see a cover or advertisement or poster for something I\u0027ve produced. And when you see it, you\u0027ll know that you played a HUGE and important role in putting that into the world.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My name is Rob Cheek and I am\nlooking for my next great opportunity. For the past few years, I have had\nthe great opportunity to work as a attorney for a small firm on the\nEastern Shore of Maryland. But the time has come to take a chance and\nstrike out on my next big adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my time as an attorney, I wrote and published several novels. I have worked on several others that are due out in 2016 and 2017. I have written several screenplays, including a web-series that my writing partner and I are producing ourselves this Spring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came to the decision in the Fall and Winter of 2015 that it was going to be now or never for me. I enjoy writing, and I didn\u0027t really enjoy being an attorney any more. I had an awakening. I wasn\u0027t going to be miserable just because I was \"supposed to.\" So, I put in my notice. And in a short few weeks, I will be unemployed, a.k.a. a full time writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no lack of inspiration. In my life, I have had the opportunity to work, and thrive, in many different environment. Although most recently I was an attorney,\nat one time I was the most overqualified pizza delivery driver in\nMaryland (and probably the only bar-certified attorney who mopped\nfloors regularly). In the years before that, I sold cars on a lot and\nlater on the internet. I was at the\nbottom-rung of an Independent Review Board, working in the mail room; and on the top rung of a video rental store, managing a staff of ten. I\u0027ve picked vegetables and run political campaigns. I\u0027ve\nshaken the hand of a successful candidate and five thousand voters during my\nown campaign. I\u0027ve flipped burgers and I\u0027ve set multi-billion dollar\nstate agency budgets. I\u0027ve cow-towed to nobodies and accidentally\ninsulted an Ex-President to his face. I\u0027ve had dinners with farmers\nand former UN weapons-inspectors, and held my own in conversations\nwith both. I plan on utilizing all of this in my coming works.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy Father told me a long time ago that\nyou always work the job you have or can get until you can get the\njob you want. I\u0027ve tried to live by that sage advice throughout my\nlife. But I\u0027ve also set several goals for myself. The first one was\nto be able to have a five minute conversation about anything with\nanyone. The second was to never say no no anything. I think I have accomplished both. Now, I\u0027m ready to move away from my Father\u0027s plan, and onto my own- and I\u0027m looking for your help to do that.\u003cbr\u003e",
