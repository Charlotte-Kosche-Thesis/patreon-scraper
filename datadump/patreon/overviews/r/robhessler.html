    "summary": "If you\u2019re looking at this page chances are that you know a\nlittle bit about me and my work. You may know that I show regularly at the\ntremendous Speakeasy Art Gallery in New Jersey. Perhaps you saw my exhibition\nat Lois Lambert Gallery in Los Angeles, visited The Butcher Gallery during the\nrun of \u201cThe Book of Demons and Angels,\u201d or have checked out my pieces in The\nBoston Drawing Project at Carroll \u0026amp; Sons Gallery. Maybe, just maybe, you\nknow my work from The New York Times, the Parisian art journal \u201cInsistence,\u201d or\nNBC Savannah\u2019s \u201cSouthern Scene.\u201d It could be that we\u2019re good friends, that we\nsupport each other as fellow artists, or that you\u2019re a long time patron of my\nartwork.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRegardless of how we\u2019ve come into contact, you\u2019re probably\naware that I have a tendency to tackle difficult subject matter, from school\nshootings and slavery, to devastating tornados and nuclear fallout.  The duty of an artist, in my view, is to make\nwork with meaning and purpose. It\u2019s my job to look at the world and\ncourageously reflect upon it, even when the picture may not be pretty.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat brings me to the point behind this fundraising effort.\nYou see, in spite of my success at being able to show around the United States\nand my appearances in newspapers, magazines, and on television, the art world\nmodel is inherently flawed at creating an environment that allows artists to\nexplore the depths of their creativity. As it stands, I\u2019m essentially a\nmanufacturer, creating objects for sale at stores that happen to be called\ngalleries. That\u2019s fine if I were interested in making pretty pictures that\nwould go well in your living room, but my dream is to delve even further into\nchallenging topics without concern over whether or not it will sell.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHave you ever thought of investing in a dream?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your support, I\u2019ll be able to create projects of a\ndepth and scope unlike any I\u2019ve been able to undertake before. I\u2019ll be able to\ntake my current massive in-progress exhibition \u201cThe Other Side of the World\nPart 4\u201d to multiple cities, likely including yours. I\u2019ll be able to publish my\nbook about \u201cThe One in the Duck Feather Cloak.\u201d I\u2019ll be able to engage in\ncollaborative projects with other amazing artists who share a similar vision,\nbut that are now only in the planning stages due to cost concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost importantly, with your help I\u2019ll be able to do\nsomething artistically important with lasting value and worth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you in advance for your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e"
