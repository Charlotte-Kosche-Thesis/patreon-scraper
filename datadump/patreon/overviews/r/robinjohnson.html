It\u0027s a difficult process involving lots of different skills, which is why I enjoy it. There\u0027s the writing. There\u0027s the programming. In some of my games, there\u0027s music, which I play and record myself, and artwork, which I either draw myself or edit up from public domain images. All of these tasks are labours of love, and your support will help me make the time to do them all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeelies and e-feelies\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the golden age of interactive fiction, the undisputed genre masters\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInfocom\u003c/a\u003e used to pack their games with nicely printed documents and small trinkets, which they called \u003cstrong\u003efeelies\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eCutthroats\u003c/em\u003e came with a book of adventure stories. \u003cem\u003eA Mind Forever Voyaging\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0came with the April 2031 issue of \u003cem\u003eDakota Online\u003c/em\u003e magazine.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0came with demolition papers for your house, demolition papers for your planet, and a plastic baggie purportedly containing a microscopic space fleet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m continuing this tradition as rewards for my patrons, by making feelies and\u00a0e-feelies\u00a0for every game I release. E-feelies can be short stories, replicas of in-universe documents, pieces of music, and various small creative side-projects. At higher tiers, you can receive physical feelies - maps, booklets, and other surprises sent to you through the mail.
