My name is Reginald Williams and I\u0027m veteran of the United States Army. After leaving the army, I moved to Washington to start my life. I\u0027ve always been a PlayStation Fan and have pretty much everything that makes the PlayStation systems great. Around 2011, I read about an all in one retro system that could play up to 6 retro gaming system consoles. I\u0027d always dreamed about an all in one multi system, so I started to collect games for the old school 8-bit and 16-bit eras. Ever since then, I\u0027ve collected for everything that interested me. But I want to let you all know that I don\u0027t collect games to keep them sealed or to throw on a shelf to be forgotten. I do this because I enjoy playing video games. I honestly never intended to be a collector, but when you have over 2000 games, I guess it\u0027s a title I inherited.\u003cbr\u003eGoing into making YouTube video seriously is not an easy task, but it\u0027s actually something I\u0027ve grown to enjoy. I promise that I will do my best to bring you all enjoyable videos ranging from podcasts, top 5 and 10\u0027s  game reviews, breaking the seal, the horror insider show, hidden gems, movie reviews, collection vids, interracial gamer, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
