Here\u0027s where we\u0027re at:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a part time youth pastor in a little prairie city making youth ministry and writing YA stories that keep you up all night my full time job. In 2014 I self-published \u0027HIDING - every scar has a story\u0027 and began writing the sequel. The first third of that new novel is now available here on Patreon, the second third is complete and ready to roll out over the next months for your reading enjoyment, approx. 5,000 words/month. I am working on the last third of the novel, hoping for a Fall 2018 release, and your patronage makes it possible for me to devote more time to that project! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo all the readers and fans of HIDING - thank you. \u003c/strong\u003eI have been amazed and grateful to hear your responses to the book. HIDING has opened up conversations with youth about self-harm, abuse, bullying, healing, friendship, God and the church. Your support here on Patreon makes it possible for me to continue to serve the young people in my city as a youth pastor AND to provide for my family through my writing! Even if all you have to chip in is a dollar or two a month -- I\u0027m so excited to share this creative journey with you. Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s how it works: \u003c/strong\u003eThe beauty of Patreon is you can support the writers and artists you love directly, and get exclusive access to their creative work. Small, monthly amounts from a crowd of fans, family and friends make a huge difference in our family budget.Your chosen patronage amount will come off on the first of the month, every month until September 2018. At that time if I have another project in the works, or if I need more time to complete this novel, I will contact you to see if you want to continue with your support. Patreon takes a cut off your donation amount to cover processing fees, so this site will be free of ads and clickbait -- just my creative content and your comments. You can check out the steps Patreon takes to keep your credit card information secure \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913779-Do-you-store-my-credit-card-information-\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e A tax deductible receipt will not be available. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s the outrageous goal: $450/month\u003c/strong\u003e means I free up enough time to write and share fresh chapters with you weekly. In the meantime I will release chapters every other week, in order, so you get to read the new novel start to finish as I write it. You\u0027ll also have access to exclusive illustrations out of Cary\u0027s brain (by the very talented @Teylor.AArt), sneak peeks at the title and cover design, and access to HIDING deleted scenes and extras.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
