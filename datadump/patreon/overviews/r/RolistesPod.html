I live in London but I actually come from Belgium, my first language is French and as a result I am lucky to have a feet in the French geek scene while enjoying British culture as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created The Rolistes Podcast with the hope not only to create a little bridge across the Channel, and beyond, between tabletop RPG fans, but also to offer a window on tabletop gamers in general and life as an immigrant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m already a few episodes in but I want to take the podcast to another level...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...enters Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe podcast is and will remain FREE \u003c/strong\u003eand under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\u00a0Licence...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...but, as I like myself to show a modest support to my favourite podcasts, I thought some of you might want to contribute to my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why supporting through Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst I want to engage in a form of commitment with listeners. Even the modest single contribution from a single one of you will mean: \"Kalum people are counting on you. Get this episode out this month.\" While I would not continue if I didn\u0027t take any joy in doing so, noticing in some form the listeners appreciation will support the podcast\u0027s future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I want to improve the quality, form and content of the podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eimprove the quality of recordings, invest in hardware, training...\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebetter website, better hosting...\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003etravel to interview people more often across the UK, across the Channel (currently I can do so only a bit as part of my work or private travels) or attend more conventions...\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAll contributions will be used to keep The Rolistes Podcast running and improve your experience as a listener. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eIMPORTANT: Patreon is simply for the people who want to lend a helping hand. If you don\u0027t want to or if you are unable to, nothing changes. You can still enjoy the podcast (and everything else we do) the exact same way you have been: free of charge! \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eThe most important thing is that you keep listening to and enjoying the podcast! \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers, \u003cbr\u003eKalum\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Note: All rewards are fulfilled the month AFTER you pledge.
