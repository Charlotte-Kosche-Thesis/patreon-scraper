    "summary": "I believe in healing most of all. I also know that finding the path to healing is an incredible challenge in our society. The work I am offering on Patreon is a trauma informed journey into your own self through the cycles of the Moon and other natural forces. It may be a piece of the puzzle you are missing, or it may be what helps you understand what you need next by shedding some light into the shadows that keep us stuck. These courses can be used for understanding whatever obstacle, big or small, that life has bestowed on you to work out, as well as to celebrate your strengths, passions, and joys. We tend to overlook in our busy world the fact that our challenges and our strengths work together to teach us our Soul Purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an herbalist, a priestess, an energy healer, and so much more \ntoo! Here on Patreon, I am offering a set of courses that guide you \non a journey into yourself to heal your wounds through understanding and\n incorporating the natural cycles provided by the world around us into \nour lives. Learn to incorporate ritual into your daily life, track and understand your emotional landscape, and foster a greater state of personal and emotional self-awareness combined with self-empowered healing to bring transformation into your life.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor about a decade, members of my community have been benefiting from my\n understanding of trauma, herbalism, and looking to natural cycles for \nguidance in our journeys of healing, and now here on Patreon\n YOU CAN TOO!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin my exclusive community here on Patreon as we weave the Magick of natural cycles into our healing journeys together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiers are explained a little more deeply in the public post titled Welcome! An Introduction. \u003cbr\u003eSo please check out that post for some more information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: The Monthly and Weekly Calendar pages are suitable for older teens and adults. Children aged about 10-12 and older will likely be able to work these pages mostly on their own, but may need adult assistance sometimes. Children younger than 10-12 can participate with the family or use their own printouts but will likely need guidance from their adults to understand and integrate the topics and journal questions. It is never too early or late in life to develop our relationships to natural forces, our emotions, and our dreams!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
