    "summary": "First of all, welcome stranger! I\u0027m very happy to have you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Suzanne (With a \u0027Z\u0027, as I\u0027m particular of my z, and yes, if you have to sing \u003cem\u003eOh Susanna\u003c/em\u003e, go ahead.) I\u0027m a little crazy, a lot of funny, and bursting at the seams with my personality. (These little boxes are a little difficult for me to paint myself, but I try.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit about myself as an artist. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started off my drawing when I was a kid, tracing and freehanding Pokemon, I was about 9 or so at this time. But my passion for drawing really took off when I found anime. My focus changed from the little pocket monsters to characters of InuYasha, Ruroni Kenshin, Cyborg 009, Sailor Moon, and many, many more titles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime went by and with encouragement from my friends\u00a0in high school, I began to branch out and make my own characters rather than drawing boat-loads of fan art. My dream was to be famous... but even more simple I just wanted to have fans. (That\u0027s hopefully you!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo after high school I went to a few years of college but after realizing that I could just teach myself the things that were being taught in the classroom from Youtube, and other artists who were more than happy to make tutorials and post them on Deviantart, I stopped going \u003cdel\u003ebecuase I\u0027m stubborn and poor\u003c/del\u003e but for a few years I stalled. Where was my niche?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my friends from high school was a furry. \"A what?\" That conversation and the days that followed opened a door to the community of animal-lovers both anthropomorphic and not. Furries would not exist without the artists, and I was happy to roll up my sleeves and dive head first into offering my skill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the first time I was able to sell my art to people who understood my passion, and enjoyed my art as much as I did. But in that time I learned a lot about my at and what kind of artist I wanted to be. I learned anatomy from drawing porn, and I learned where I drew my lines in the sand for my wills and won\u0027ts. I also found that I didn\u0027t like doing commissions as much. Too high stress for myself at this time (I\u0027m hoping to change that.) I really loved, loved making gift and free art. But I couldn\u0027t live off free. Or could I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWell, I want to make this into my career. I\u0027ve been drawing for as long as I can remember, and I want to be able to give you a glimpse into my worlds, and a bit into the craziness that makes me tick. I\u0027m an artist who loves to get her hands dirty in any kind of medium, and it\u0027s hard for me to keep down on one particular style for very long. I want to explore every avenue. And I want to take you for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the end goal with this? I want to live off of my art. I work full time, currently. And that means that I have less time for my art. I want to bring you my best. But I\u0027ve only had time for only doodles and sketches and the occasional inked work. With your support, my art to work ratio would gradually increase, to the point I would be able to draw until I die. (Plz sell everything. Get rich off my ass, Idc I\u0027m ded.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut yeah! If you\u0027ve made it this far, awesome! \u003cdel\u003eI didn\u0027t bore you to death.\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m hoping that you\u0027ll help me to my life goal. I want to make art that makes people happy, and have fun doing it. So I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me, and believe me when I say I appreciate every single one of you. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
