    "summary": "Hello there! My name is Rosie, and I am obsessed\nwith creating edible art in the form of cake and delicious desserts. I have\nbeen in the cake decorating industry for a little over 3 years now, starting\noff as a self-taught baker and cake decorator and eventually working for a\nbakery where my skills were fine tuned. Currently, I am working from home creating fun, instructional and easy to follow cake decorating tutorials (http://www.youtube.com/c/rosiesdessertspotaustralia). Which, lets be honest, I wouldn\u0027t be doing if it wasn\u0027t for the amazing and overwhelming love and support from my followers, so thank you so much for being there and keeping interested!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put it simply, I love what I do and what I do takes up the most part of my week. To be earning an income from Patreon would mean I can continue to work this full time, focus on improving the channel and creating better quality content for you guys, more often!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Goals for Patreon:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eReducing my workload by supplementing my income with Patreon means more time to think creatively, and more time dedicated to creating extravagant looking cakes for you guys\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExtra videos will be made available on YouTube, hopefully doubling the entertainment and learning opportunities\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eUpgrade equipment to improve video quality and ultimately viewer experience\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEventually be able to rent a more appropriate space for recording and live streaming, free of interruptions! This means longer live streams complimented by a quiet and focused learning environment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eListen to your opinions, learn what you would like to see next and what interests you and create content accordingly.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThank you so much for considering my page! Your support, no matter how small, will make a huge impact on my ability to fulfil these goals, and also bring you top quality video tutorials, more often! I have devised some tempting pledge tiers which will give you exclusive access to videos, live streams, direct influence on what is posted on the channel, and many more perks. Stick around, have some fun, and most importantly learn something new!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
