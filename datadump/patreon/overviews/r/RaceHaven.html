    "summary": "Hi, My name is Dr. Scott Speed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started \"Race Haven - Solutions Focused Dialogue About Race Relations In America\" as a Facebook discussion group in 2014 because I wanted a safe place for authentic solutions oriented interracial dialogue about the race related issues that plague our country. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew tired of the arguments and debates that happen daily in mass \u0026amp; social media. I truly believe that the majority of Americans want peace and harmony, but a perception gap exists due to a complex racial history that continues to impede our progress. Through my readings and academic studies I learned about a proven solution for opening the lines of communication, Authentic Dialogue, so I decided to use those principles to address race relations in America.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February 2016 I started the Race Haven Podcast to further this mission and after appearing as a guest on a few episodes, my friend John Costino decided to join me as a co-host so that we can provide diverse perspectives for each other and our listeners to learn from.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next goal is to start the Race Haven Live Dialogue where I facilitate interracial dialogues on race relations in America in schools, companies, and communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read about my background, my motivation for doing this work, and find all Podcast episodes\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.racehavenpodcast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0I am truly passionate about this work. I have a\u00a0burning desire to make America a better place for my children and yours. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, your support will help me devote more time and energy to this work. I currently do independent contractor work to provide for my family. Each financial goal reached here on Patreon will afford me the opportunity to spend more time doing this important work to improve communication and strengthen relationships amongst Americans.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You For Your Support!"
