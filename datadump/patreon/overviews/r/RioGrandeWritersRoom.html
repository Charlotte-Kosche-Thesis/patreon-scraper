    "summary": "We at the Border Theatre know firsthand that there\u0027s a pressing need to to generate high quality material for both stage and screen that is practical for the needs of aspiring filmmakers and smaller theatre companies; we\u0027ve observed this need through our work over the last six years. That is why for 2017 we have launched The Rio grande Writers\u0027 Room. These weekly sessions, under the tutelage of award winning mentors, are generating critical content through the maintenance of a permanent writer\u0027s room and the formation of a standing acting ensemble. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe scripts we develop using the Writers\u0027 Room are created to fit the budgetary needs of smaller theatre and film production companies, while also reflecting the diversity of contemporary society, especially along the border. These works will be shared directly through live performance, digital production, and industry networking so that the stories developed here are not only experienced by our immediate community, but a global audience as well. This is essential in creating an identity for the city of El Paso on an international scale, reflecting the vibrant and enduring people who live here along the border.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Creation Lab presently meets in two forms. The Rio Grande Writer\u0027s Rooms, in which writers of all experience levels gather to work on the craft of storytelling and development with the constructive support of their fellow writers and mentors. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThese scripts/ideas are later synthesized with Performance Labs on Sundays so that the texts can be workshopped by the performers who are honing their craft as well. When a specific project has been developed to the point of being performance ready it will be produced by The Border Theatre directly or released to partner production entities.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOur goal\u00a0 is to develop no less than one short script a week. A 30-45 minute project on a monthly basis and a 90 minute piece every two months. This output meets the rising demand of this community for quality work and ensures that the project remain relevant and active as a creative outlet for our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Labs are led by Artistic Director/Co-Founder Austin Savage who\u00a0was the recipient of the 2009 Kennedy Center/American College Theatre Festival Meritorious Achievement Award for Directing for his region. He has worked at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, as an Assistant Director for their MFA Playwriting Workshop in which he helped develop Norway, an original work by Obie Award winning and Macarthur Genius Grant recipient Samuel Hunter. In 2010 he was named an Observership Fellow by the Society of Directors \u0026amp; Choreographers. As part of his fellowship he Assistant Directed The Good Negro by Tracy Scott Wilson at Chicago\u0027s legendary Goodman Theatre under the direction of acclaimed director Chuck Smith. In 2010 he founded The Border Theatre, a performance ensemble dedicated to developing and performing original and world premier works as well as educating the El Paso community in the artistry of theatre. His body of work over the last 6 years led to a nomination for the 2015 Texas Medal of Arts Award.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
