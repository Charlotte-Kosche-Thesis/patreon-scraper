    "summary": "Thanks for checking out my Patreon page! My name is Jason Petersen. I\u0027m a servant of God, author, and entrepreneur. I am seeking support for my ministry (I\u0027d like to go into ministry full time). I became an entrepreneur in October of 2017 after I was suddenly (and wrongfully) terminated from my job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010, I was diagnosed with ocular melanoma (cancer in the eye). This diagnosis put me on an awesome journey that brought me closer to God than I ever was before. I felt compelled to share and defend the truth of Christianity. I would initially defend the faith through social media, and a lot of Christians approached me to tell me they were encouraged by the defense I gave.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still had A LOT of spiritual growing to do. Even though I was out there defending the faith, my faith was still in its infancy. God slowly matured my faith over time. I still have growing to do, but I can look back and see the work that God did in my life. I can happily say that cancer was one of the best things to happen to me. It only shows that God can take the worst of situations and turn it around for the greater good!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy two primary focuses in ministry is defending the faith and teaching people how to handle their finances wisely. I am well read on both topics and I have also published books on both topics.In an age where secularism is gaining more political influence and where secular culture is giving us bad advice on how to handle money, we should all be well informed on those topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went to seminary for a while. I went to Columbia Evangelical Seminary and then I studied at Whitefield Theological Seminary. When I embraced Messianic Judaism, I was kicked out of Whitefield Theological Seminary. I also studied at Biola University and earned a certificate in Christian Apologetics in 2013.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to dedicate more time to releasing articles, books, and video content, but it would mean that I would have to back off business ventures that are currently providing me with income. This is why I have started a Patreon account. If you enjoy my content, I hope you will consider becoming a patron!\u003cbr\u003e"
