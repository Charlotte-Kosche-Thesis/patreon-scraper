Seriously though, if you pledge a small amount per month, I don\u0027t have to worry about my basic survival needs, it can lower the cost of things like commissions, and (most importantly) it can get you more art! Whether it be comics, illustrations, fan art or anything else. No matter how small your pledge, your financial help will be invaluable!"
