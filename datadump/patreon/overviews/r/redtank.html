We\u0027ve been a band since 2010. Over the better part of a decade, we\u0027ve been on several West Coast tours, put out a few albums, played weird desert festivals, crashed SXSW unofficial shows, soundtracked video diaries of near-space protests, and unleashed guerrilla sets in Chili\u0027s parking lots and in front of 50 foot Christmas trees in outdoor shopping malls. We\u0027ve also emphasized the importance of playing all-ages shows--performing at house shows, beloved DIY venues such as The Trunk Space, and playing all-ages sets at Crescent Ballroom, Valley Bar, and the like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cimg src=\"http://redtank.org/fresno.jpg\" style=\"width: 471px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRed Tank! performing at Dynamite Vinyl in Fresno. \u003cbr\u003ePhotographed by Annabelle Klick\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve had several lineup changes throughout the years and suffered one of our most demoralizing moments when we had our van stolen on our most recent West Coast tour. With the help of friends, family, and benevolent patrons such as yourself, we recovered back to a point of equilibrium. We replaced our equipment, the van was found, and we were able to recoup the costs of repairs. It was a touching moment for us to see how many people cared about the band, how many we\u0027ve touched throughout the years, and how many people were rooting for us to succeed.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile it may come as a shock to some, independently funding a punk band is not a profitable\u00a0venture. Spotify earnings, merch sales, and show profits can often be slim and don\u0027t always cover the costs of recording, putting out albums, going on tour, etc--let alone having anything left to compensate members for making tough journeys, enduring rigorous practice schedules, or taking weeks off of work at a time. I wonder sometimes what it is we\u0027re searching for. We like to think we\u0027ve inspired other young performers to express themselves--to try their hand at making art in their communities in whatever way they can.\u00a0We like to think we inspire people to ride through waves of turmoil and become better on the other side of things. We like to think people like the riffs, weird noises, and honest lyrics we propel. We\u0027d like to keep doing these things for as long as we can. And--we\u0027d like to bring everyone on that journey with us, while giving back something in return.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://redtank.org/comic.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://redtank.org/comic.jpg\" style=\"width: 355px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRed Tank! mini-comic liner notes insert \u003cbr\u003eArt by Anders Karlsson.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re making zines on a bi-monthly basis in an effort to share more of our experiences and art with the people who care and want to hear about it. The content will be composed of photographs, band history and updates, lyrics, comics, flier art, poetry, and more. The pages will be filled by current and former band contributors, fans, and friends from all over. Their length and content will vary, but we wanted to do this on a bi-monthly basis in order to ensure a certain degree of quality. We wanted to keep costs inexpensive and affordable, which is why we\u0027re doing subscriptions at $5 or more a month. We want them to be tangible, totable, and sharable, which is why we\u0027re mailing them out in a physical format. Occasionally, we\u0027ll also provide access to unreleased music, mail out buttons and other small merch items, and guestlist or send tickets to zine subscribers. Your contributions will go towards funding tours, recording music, printing merch, and more. Thanks for reading. We hope you\u0027ll join us on this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours truly,\u003cbr\u003eClipper Arnold and Red Tank!\u003c/div\u003e"
