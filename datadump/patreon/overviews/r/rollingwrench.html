If we haven\u2019t met.\u00a0I\u2019m Matt, I have two passions in life: filming and wrenching. I have been doing both for around 18 years. For the past 8 years when I have extra time, I film scooter, motorcycle, and some \u00a0occasional ATV\u00a0projects, tech tips, and \u201chow to\u2019s\u201d for my YouTube channel. In the last year or so my channel has kind of evolved into more of a vlog / build series (episode based projects) type channel. My favorite videos to make are the build series videos! People seem to love them too! One problem. They are super time consuming, some videos take days. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love it! Becoming a Rolling Wrench patron will help with the unbelievable amount of time it takes to create good content, better lighting, and camera equipment. In return for becoming a patron you will get exclusive access to my patron only page, even more tech tips, updates, live chats, talked with other patrons, pictures, videos, and have a input on builds and video content."

When I have extra time I film my projects for my YouTube channel to help others with common problems I see on motorcycles, scooters, and ATV\u0027s.\u00a0However it has kind of evolved into more of a vlog / build series type channel. The part I love about what I do, is my personal scooter / motorcycle builds. People seem to love them too! I started this Patreon account to hopefully come up with a solution to my problem. As you know everybody has to work. When I do my videos I\u0027m not working, well kinda, but not getting paid. If I can make money on my videos I can dedicate a weekly or even daily dedicated time for creating. I have a lot of knowledge to offer through my 18 years as tech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhy become a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- Live video help\u003cbr\u003e- How to\u0027s\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- DIY\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e- Honda Ruckus\u003cbr\u003e- Honda cub / streetcub\u003cbr\u003e- Vlog\u0027s\u003cbr\u003e- Performance tips\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Pure entertainment!",
