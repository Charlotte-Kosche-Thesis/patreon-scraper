Every month that amount will be charged to your credit card or PayPal. You can stop at any time, no-strings-attached.

The more patrons that join me on this journey, the more time I can spend creating beautiful things for you. It will help me purchase the tools I need to create, like camera accessories, lights, and audio equipment. It will also help me hire talented people to help me make better and better music and videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is there only one pledge tier?\u003c/strong\u003e I have decided that I want everyone who donates to have access to the same things, regardless of their means.

That said, if you can afford a higher monthly donation, I would greatly appreciate that!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this and thank you SO MUCH for your pledge!
