    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eArt and music rarely bring wealth.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0And one can never be paid, in the sense of a wage, for the countless hours of practice, late nights at gigs, arriving early, leaving late. There are the unknown hours of thinking and sometimes worrying about what you are doing. Some call it day-dreaming. But it can also mean, being half asleep and having to get up and write down ideas. It can also be lost hours and frustration trying to record musical ideas, pressing the wrong button and erasing days, weeks or months of work. It happens. It can be driving for hours, and arriving sleep-deprived, only to pack up and head off again the next day. And there is the mental and emotional toll, the vulnerability of rejection, whenever you put yourself on display. It is not for the feint-hearted. And yet so many of us are delicate creatures. For me - this is not a self-serving pursuit...it is serving a higher purpose. It\u0027s trying to reach across that spiritual, metaphysical chasm that seems to divide us all - that creates a yearning to connect to something, to someone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why it is often a certain amount of sacrifice that allows artists of all kinds to share their particular brand of art with the world. That\u0027s also why many creators are forced to fit their art into something that sounds or looks like something that is perceived as popular at the time, to tip the balance towards commerciality and perhaps focus less on their own true expression. It\u0027s just the way the world works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut having patrons of the arts, and crowdfunding platforms like this, there is a new wisdom, a new system, which means that the very album I have been protecting like a child, since I wrote some of it some 20 years ago, has the chance, with your nurturing and support, to blossom into an entity with the potential I have always hoped for. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut without enough money and timely application to this undertaking I have had to shelve the project on and off, for 2 decades now. Fortunately, I believe all good things take time. And, having turned down Record Deals, and other opportunities to reveal them, I now have \u003cstrong\u003eLouis Tillett\u003c/strong\u003e on board as a producer, along with some musicians who are highly prized as collaborators. And I believe in this project now, more than ever. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my model will be \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eto be vulnerable, open, and sharing of my progress through updates to my patrons, including sharing songs, in their early stages, through to completion.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Born in Melbourne, Rachael spent her formative years growing up in PNG, the Philippines, and the USA.\u00a0 She started singing and performing in general from a very early age. She was playing in her first professional band by 16. Around 21 she bought a 4 track recorder and wrote some songs on her guitar. She has been working in and around the Entertainment scene for decades. She has yet to release an album. But as interest has increased since her periodic appearances with the renowned Australian artist, Louis Tillett, and her featured performance in his new project The Art of Darkness, she has been encouraged to begin work on a debut album, in earnest. She will be collaborating with many fine musicians, including Louis Tillett, who has offered to produce her album too. In order to make this a reality, she is attempting a unique offer to those willing to support the project - to release various tracks, in demo, and semi-developed form (unplugged if you will) - to share her progress with her supporters. And of course..they will be the first to be able to receive a copy of the completed, full album, in exchange for their support, without which the project would be much more difficult to launch.\u003cbr\u003e",
