It was prompted by a Minimalism Contest which challenged entrants to make a track with just 300 lines. The challenge sparked an idea to make a track synced to a particular song and the concept fell into place from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gfZstO0XwKw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlackheart:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e A massive collaborative project originally conceived by Sean Reynolds \"Boo\", a member of the Line Rider community who tragically passed away in 2015 at the age of 18. I directed the project for the majority of the process, drew the scenery at the end of the track, and handled the recording and editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been creating Line Rider tracks since 2007 - from the age of\u00a016! - simply because I love creating works with the art medium of Line Rider. Projects often take dozens or even hundreds of hours to create, and\u00a0I am a young adult and starving artist with a need to support myself financially. The more income I can get from Patreon, the more time I can dedicate to Line Rider. Every pledge, even a $1 pledge, means an enormous amount to me, because it means I have another fan to motivate me - and the more fans I have, the more art I can make!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI typically release a monetized video \u003cstrong\u003eabout once every 2-3 months.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0This includes major solo projects as well as collaborations that I played a direct, major role in. I will occasionally also release unmonetized videos, such as smaller experimental projects, time-lapse videos, compilations, and commentaries.
