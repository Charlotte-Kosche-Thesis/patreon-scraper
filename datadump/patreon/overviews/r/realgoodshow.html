The third guy lives in Los Angeles and pretends he needs money to pay the bills, but he lives in Los Angeles, so fuck that guy. He\u0027s probably typing on a gold-plated keyboard or some shit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we will continue to produce RGS every week and you will always get it for free (aside from the donors-only episodes, because, uhh, they\u0027re for donors only), any support listeners can provide us is greatly appreciated. Consider your donation not just support for Real Good Show but for all the work we do as writers, comedians and broadcasters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe good news is the money will not only help each of us scrape by a little easier at the end of the month (this money has legitimately paid Hydro bills), a lot of it will also go right back into the show. We\u0027re very proud of what we\u0027ve been able to create with RGS, but we still want to work to continually improve the show for our amazing listeners. We\u0027ve done over 100 episodes and we have used the money from our listeners to buy a new soundboard, new sound equipment, design and print t-shirts, put on several live shows, accommodate guests on the program, and hell, you guys even paid for a cat\u0027s surgery. That\u0027s super cool.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for reading, thank you for listening and thank you, if you can, for supporting the show. You\u0027re a Real Good Person for doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, the bonus episodes kick ass and the second you donate, you get access to all of them(hours and hours of them!) so...you\u0027re really dumb if you don\u0027t donate to get access to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJustin, Stefan, and John\u003cbr\u003eThe Good Boys of Real Good Show"
