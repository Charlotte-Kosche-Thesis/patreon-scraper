What I hope to do with Patreon is to eventually earn enough that I can take the time out each year to produce at least four individual issues a year and have them printed to sell online and at conventions. I\u0027ve also made a start on writing a new series called \"Poppies\", a dystopian, sci-fi story based on the \"Tall Poppy Syndrome\" concept.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your pledge, you will get to see the comics progress and also have early access to the finished comics before they are released.
