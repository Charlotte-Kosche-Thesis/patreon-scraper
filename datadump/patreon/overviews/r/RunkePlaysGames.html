    "summary": "Hello, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Shane Runkle creator of the Bolg\u00a0Runkle Plays Games. I have been playing and running RPG games in one shape or for 35 years now!\u00a0 At the end of 2013, I decided to start this blog with the crazy idea that some people might enjoy hearing what I have to say on gaming topics. Since then the blog has grown in ways I never thought it would!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest changes to the Blog was that I began reviewing gaming products. My motivation was simple I wanted to share with my reader\u0027s honest heartfelt thoughts from someone that was not a \"Yes Man\". That attitude eventually gained the attention of other companies and creators that desired this kind of feedback. Since then Runkle Plays Games has gone on the review several amazing Pre Release Kickstarter projects that have all fully funded and delivered to their backers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood reviews take time and this is where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last year, I have been working as a Part-Time ghostwriter for companies and other blogs. I have been earning a paycheck by writing other peoples blogs. With your help, I hope to change that. Every dollar here that I earn is a dollar less that I have to work anonymously for someone else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhat do I expect from this? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, I am not looking to\u00a0make a ton of money from this Patreon. I would just like to earn just\u00a0 enough here to pay for my yearly costs to run my Page and Domain. Long term it would be nice to\u00a0 reach a level\u00a0 where\u00a0I might be able to upgrade it as well.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eShane Runkle\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eRunkle Plays Games\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
