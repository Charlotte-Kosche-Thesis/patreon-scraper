Something it turns out I\u0027m not. The one thing I\u0027ve come back to again and again is my art. So it\u0027s time. Hopefully, with your support and encouragement, I can open up the possibilities. My first and most comfortable love is pen and pattern work, so I\u0027m starting there... but get ready for whimsical paintings and portraits and stories as well!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a queer femme, cis passing, white human with some MAJOR head goblins... (yeah, I\u0027m open about mental illness). These things infuse and influence my art. From obsessively loving pattern work to introducing and supporting other artist of the queer and POC spectrum. I\u0027m hoping to get some of what\u0027s in me out of me, before I burst.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I need help filling up my skill set with lots of different works of art and building out my particular style. These coloring pages I make are an effort to improve my skill and creativity. The things I make have mistakes. I think that\u0027s important. I want those who color and practice fill work from the things I make to feel inspired and empowered. So, get ready to notice little things... and get over them. My favorite thing about line work is how everything comes together and be more then the sum of it\u0027s parts. The same, I hope, is true for we humans and our souls.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Just keep in mind at the $25 level I\u0027ll need your address to send you bonus gifts! You\u0027ll get access to everything, be able to vote for what I do next, send me suggestions and assignments, and all sorts of inside looks at what I\u0027m doing next.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

Those of you in my All Access Pass tier will be able to purchase those prints AT COST.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will be my first step to creating an actual, sellable, deck! Some of the exclusive cards that I\u0027m hand making and sending in limited amounts to my Card Club, will become a part of a retail deck.\u00a0I\u0027ll stop hand cutting my cards (*if I can find the right printer) and start having them professionally printed in bulk.",

This means studying 2 things: figure drawing (so I can start work on my other projects) and Biology (because I\u0027m a brewer). That means my patrons will start to see both figures and scientific studies come into my work! I\u0027ll start on a long dream of creating Botany Cards full of scientific drawings of plants I\u0027m studying (many specifically involved in beer), and to involve more human figures in what I\u0027m doing.\u00a0",
