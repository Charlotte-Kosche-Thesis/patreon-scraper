    "summary": "\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat Is The Project?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSome years ago we began collecting and creating reptile feeding videos. They were pretty good quality media for the time, and in the pursuit of a Masters in Zoology with a focus on predatory reptile feeding behavior, it would eventually become an online repository to freely share with everyone, which we are excited to say, we are doing now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWho is this for?\u00a0 The videos are for\npeople young and old who like reptiles, learning about them, and plain ol\u0027 just enjoy watching them. Think of them as \u003cem\u003eShark Week\u003c/em\u003e but with scales (and actual science!). The videos are also created for students who need to cite reptile behavior for their studies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis project became a significant endeavor. Back in the day when we were working on our thesis of reptile feeding behaviors, the\nfocus has always been on creating high quality reptile videos, the more\ndiverse the better. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe\ncontent includes a wide spectrum of material: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePhotos of reptiles\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo of snakes hunting and eating, focus on anatomy and physiology.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo of large predatory lizards hunting and feeding, focus on behavior and (cooperative) strategies.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nReptile Channel was created to freely share original content with the mainstream public, especially academia and people who are interested in reptiles.\u00a0 Our goal from the beginning\nis to both collect and create a comprehensive portfolio of predatory reptiles hunting, feeding, and explaining their anatomy, physiology, and behavior in acquiring caloric resources.  This is such a quixotic goal that the project\nhas grown far beyond any of our expectations in becoming a valuable educational resource. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDollars and Greenbacks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, it takes money to produce content, interview people, and to\nkeep it going. From basic things like\npaying for food and heating and general reptile care to the more\nsignificant upfront equipment costs of traveling, shooting, and processing high resolution media, especially by today\u2019s standards. We have gladly funded the work\nout of our own pockets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what is the best way to fund an endeavor like Reptile Channel? We believe a tiny amount of support from a large number of\npeople is an awesome way to keep the content flowing, and Patreon looks like a way to achieve this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eProposal\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nReptile Channel is distinct from the vast majority of\nreptile content today in that we focus on the science of feeding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe internet\nchanges things. We have collected, with permission of creators, an archive of reptile material that we believe will be interesting and should be shared for their uniqueness. \u00a0And the potential audience for information is unlimited, and Patreon offers the prospect of sustainable micro-payments. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you enjoy what we share and create at Reptile Channel,\nthis is a way you can contribute a buck a month to ensure that it keeps\ngoing.  If you want to contribute more that is wonderful\u2014but a buck a\nmonth is all we\u2019re asking.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost creators offer hidden perks to encourage people to donate more. Reptile Channel is not doing that, for two reasons.  First, we want to\navoid producing special content accessible only to people who have paid\u2014that\ngoes against the \"free and public\" philosophy of the project. \nOur background is science and education, so our philosophy reflects this. Second, we want to focus our time on shooting high quality science media which has always been the point of the project, rather than devote time to what are\nbasically marketing ploys.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you, and please support us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Reptile Channel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
