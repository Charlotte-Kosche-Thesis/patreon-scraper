    "summary": "Service Coordination and Case Management services are hard to find but often a key support for people who need them. I help people in our community do the things they want to do by connecting them with supports, navigating the bureaucracy of the social safety net, filling out applications, in-person support at appointments and meetings, and other non-therapeutic social supports. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking from a disability justice perspective and trained as a social worker, I am committed to ensuring people in my community have the tools and supports they need to thrive. As a nonbinary and Autistic activist, I believe that our social service system is built to be inaccessible to marginalized communities. By helping all people navigate these systems, we can work together to subvert the systems of power that facilitate and perpetuate oppression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is non-therapeutic, meaning that I am able to help you navigate systems, but I am not currently offering therapy or other medical/psychological services.\u00a0"
