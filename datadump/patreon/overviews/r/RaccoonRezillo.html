I plan to\ncontinue creating them, but I have come across a problem; working at a full\ntime job outside of my animation career, I lack the time to create much\nanimated content for you guys to see. To give an idea how long it is taking me\nto create an animation, simply a good 10 second animation takes up to 3 months.\nNow apply that to a 20 minute pilot episode. Do the math, and this will take me\naround 30 years to complete. Reason being for this ridiculous amount of time\nisn\u0027t even due to how long it takes to animate. It\u0027s because of my full-time\njob taking up all my time. This is why I have now set up a Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an adult, money is a basic need for me unless I want to live on the\nstreets and starve to death. Your Patreon support can help me earn more money\nso I can focus less on my full-time job and more on my animations for you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a story that I\u0027d love to create as a show about\nthe life of a mouse and the war he is faced with. Hints of this\nvision can be seen in 3 animation parts that I created for multi-animator\nprojects, also found on my channel. I wish I had more to show everyone this\nsort of content. This is again the reason why I am looking for support through\nPatreon. I have big plans but no time to work for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you would\nlike to see more animated content from me, please feel free to support me on my\nPatreon page. I currently do not offer special rewards for my supporters, but your\nsupport is still very much appreciated, as it allows me to continue to make\nmore free content for you all to see on YouTube. And who knows? Maybe if enough\ntime is freed up I may throw in the rewards in the future. \u003cbr\u003e"
