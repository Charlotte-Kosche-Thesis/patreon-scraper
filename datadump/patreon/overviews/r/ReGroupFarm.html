\u003cem\u003eFood Movement\u003c/em\u003e Changes More Than Food)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, this is Tim.\u00a0 I used to teach science, and loved it, but left several years ago to work on something that was nagging at me.\u00a0 The more I dug into it, the longer it took.\u00a0 This project started as an effort to shore up a tiny town and provide meaningful work for older youth.\u00a0 We wanted to provide an orchard, gardens, and an old farmstead for them and others to restore and enjoy.\u00a0 Learning and doing, and having fun.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, as I understood more about why nearly all of the rural towns were decaying after thriving for a hundred years, and how that hurts even urban areas, it got even more intriguing.\u00a0 The Food Movement (Food Network, Farm-to-Table, Know-your-farmer, etc.) was fairly new, and it was clear that it wasn\u0027t just about food.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked on related historic restoration on the side while trying to come up with a better understanding of what was happening and what concrete things might be done -because I felt like there were new opportunities developing for both ruralites and urbanites, and we weren\u0027t putting things together like we could.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re in farm country, but it wasn\u0027t just about rural spaces.\u00a0 It\u0027s a long story, and you can probably relate to it, which might be why you\u0027re here -maybe after checking out the some of the main website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://regroup.farm/about/\"\u003eReGroup.Farm\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 Most of the content will be here, because we\u0027re using this to support our efforts on both the for-profit side and the non-profit side.\u00a0

friends and I have talked and worked together for years on \"This Project\", and we think there\u0027s a special crowd out there that will feel a connection to what we\u0027re thinking and doing.\u00a0 The kind of people that like to think deeply and creatively when they\u0027re looking at a problem -going back to causes of causes of causes sometimes.\u00a0 Then\u00a0they also like to see some action to check out the new ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you\u0027ll see here is a mix of urbanites and ruralites, Lefties and Righties, believers and non-believers, taking another look at things we normally take for granted.\u00a0 Lots of things.\u00a0 Things that divide us and things that unite us -which might seem rare.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings our grandkids will wish we\u0027d done differently.\u00a0 Wasteful things, and things that create anger without much chance of resolution.\u00a0 Ideas and actions that don\u0027t fit well in the Liberal/Conservative frameworks.\u00a0 (This might bother some people, but let us show you what we mean.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFood is a big part of this -including our country\u0027s changing food system.\u00a0 So is our built environment, especially out in our decaying rural towns.\u00a0 But it isn\u0027t about the sad state of things as much as it is about renewal and re-thinking rural spaces.\u00a0 It\u0027s already starting to happen, we just want to encourage the new conversation that\u0027s emerging.\u00a0 It started with the Food Movement, and that\u0027s still the anchor.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support is what lets us continue our hands-on projects as well as this \u003cspan
