I paint, draw pictures, and recently I\u0027m wading into making webcomics. My preferred subjects are the fantastical - animal-human hybrids, demons and mythical monsters: beautiful people with beastly features. \u003cbr\u003ePatreon and commissions are both awesome things : they allow me to leverage art as an income source! Income from artwork allows for me to offset the costs and focus on creating rather than balancing the books or pulling extra shifts at my service job.\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons get to enjoy high resolution files of finished works, wips that don\u0027t make the cut for posting on my tumblr, exclusive commission offers, and input on select projects through polls. \u003cbr\u003e"
