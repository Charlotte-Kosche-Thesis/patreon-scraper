    "summary": "Fort the past 4 years (now into our 5th season), Rockets Insider has been an avenue to share film-study content and analysis from each Houston Rockets game. Kelly and I have been fortunate to write on numerous websites, and now are able to cover the Houston Rockets as credentialed reporters. However, both of us as full-time undergraduate students and soon-to-be graduate students, devoting hours to developing content can be difficult. The support of followers and Rockets fans is the lifeblood of what we do since our only goal is to always inform and educate fans about the Rockets, their schemes, playbook, decision-making, and other nuances throughout the preseason, regular season, postseason, and offseason. We would like your support as we have started a Patreon page. Film-studies will continue on Twitter and through our new YouTube channel; more exclusive player-insight film-studies and other exclusive and creative content. We will also have player features and stories on everyone on the Roster 1-15 and the two-way contract players. We will share our game notes after every game and provide you with true comprehensive analysis. We would love to continue providing analysis and film-studies you won\u0027t find anywhere else on your Houston Rockets, but we kindly ask for your support."
