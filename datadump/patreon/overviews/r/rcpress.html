    "summary": "Raging Chicken, is a Pennsylvania-based left/progressive media site devoted to covering and helping build on-the-ground activism and communities of resistance. Our media work includes our main website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ragingchickenpress.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRaging Chicken Press\u003c/a\u003e; our social media pages; and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rcpress.podbean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRaging Chicken Radio\u003c/a\u003e - our series of podcasts launched in 2016\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Background\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRaging Chicken Press was founded in April 2011 by Kevin Mahoney on the heels of nation-wide attacks on working people, public education, women, and organized labor.  After being swept into office with the Tea Party in 2010, the right-wing, Koch brothers-backed Governor of Wisconsin began an attack on workers\u0026#8217; right to collectively bargain. That attack quickly spread to Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Idaho, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and in our home state of Pennsylvania.  What initially appeared to be the work of a \u0026#8220;rogue\u0026#8221; governor in Wisconsin, showed itself to be a coordinated, and well-funded effort by a new breed of Republicans and their corporate backers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe right-wing in this country has been extremely successful at building an entire intellectual and political base over the past 40 years. They have invested in journalists, academic departments, think tanks, media networks, and grass roots institutions. From the beginning they knew that in order to win, they needed to invest for the long-haul. And they did. And now they are winning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProgressives, liberals, and the Left more broadly has not invested in our own intellectual and political infrastructure. We are out spent, out organized, and our voices are often drowned out by the wall-to-wall media dominance by the right-wing and corporate media. At Raging Chicken Press, we decided to take up the call from Independent Media activists at the dawn of the 21st century who urged: \"Don\u0027t Hate the Media, Become the Media.\" So, we are in this for the long haul. We actively pursue connections with other progessive media sites and journalists in the state to help build that progressive media network that we so badly need. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe Are Building a Sustainable, Progressive Media Network\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRaging Chicken Press publishes articles, analyses, reports, photos, videos, comics, reviews, and calls-to-action that engage, support, and help build progressive, activist social movements. We are have local and regional roots and we believe that a good place to begin fighting back, is right in our own back yard. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeginning in November 2016, we began paying a small group of regular contributors a small stipend of $50/month. Our goal is to build a strong cadre of pull-no-punches journalists and writers by investing in them. Up until November , all of us who wrote for Raging Chicken Press did so on a volunteer, extracurricular basis. Our members are our primary source of funding our server space, upgrading equiptment, and covering the cost of investigations and reporting. In order to build a sustainable, progressive media network, we cannot rely upon volunteers. We need to be able to pay our writers and contributors and help train the next generation of progressive, media activists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u0027t do this without you. From the beginning, we have been rooted in the progressive, activist community. We don\u0027t have billionaire backers and we don\u0027t want to have to rely upon corporate advertising to fund what we do. We want to be responsive to you...fellow activists, public intellectuals, and progressives of all stripes. Help us build this movement. Become and member today! \u003cbr\u003e"
