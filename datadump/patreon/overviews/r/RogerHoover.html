In these changing times, patronage has become integral to sustaining a creative career. With a few generous patrons, I can continue to focus solely on creating music that many have come to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a platform that facilitates ongoing, direct patronage to \ncreators. Basically, instead of making one pledge, one time, you make a \npledge to continually support the artist with each release. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your help I will be able to release \n\u003cstrong\u003eone new recording every month\u003c/strong\u003e. Your\n pledge will help cover the cost of producing those songs. For being so generous, I will make sure that \n\u003cstrong\u003eyou are the first \u003c/strong\u003eto hear what I create. \u003cstrong\u003eYou can\u0027t buy a candy bar for $1. But you can help an artist create music. \u003c/strong\u003eThis shows how little we value creative pursuits today.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRoger\u0027s latest album, Pastures, was included on many \"Best Of\" 2016 lists, reviewed by prominent publications like No Depression, Paste Magazine, Elmore Magazine, and more. Despite the reviews, despite the touring, despite the album sales, there is a substantial lack in financial support for today\u0027s independent artists. Roger\u0027s creativity and desire to express have never wained, nor has the drive to create his brand of song - \" one that manages to find an effective middle ground between softly-etched songs about love, life and remorse, and edgier intents that betray a sense of uncertainty and desire.\" Hoover continues to document the external in internal struggles of all people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e_______________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\t\"As close to a John Prine record as it gets.\" - Isthmus\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u201cPastures\u2019 thoughtful meanderings take listeners through a map of contemplative, everyman\u2019s observations in the vein of music history\u2019s best storytellers.\u201d \u2013 Paste Magazine\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\"Pastures displays the talent of a rising artist whose music promises that the best is yet to come.\" - Pollstar\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\"There\u2019s some early Dylan here, some James McMurtry there and a whole lot of Hoover\u2019s well-worn, rust-belt Americana\u2026It\u2019ll give you goosebumps.\u201d - Arkansas Gazette\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u201cRoger Hoover is as close to poet as he is raconteur\u2026a songwriter with Raymond Carver\u2019s observation and Kris Kristofferson\u2019s ear for poetry.\u201d \u2013 No Depression\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSongwriter and guitarist Roger Hoover has remained steadfast in his creative pursuits for nearly a decade and seeks a few generous patrons to help him sustain this level of creative commitment over the long road ahead.
