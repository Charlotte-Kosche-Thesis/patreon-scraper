I\u0027m a solo content creator who produce music covers on YouTube, focusing on anime songs and Vocaloid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes my covers unique? They\u0027re much more than just me playing songs in front of a camera. I love trying new things and pushing my own limit. The majority of my videos use two or more camera angles, and the audio track ranges from one to over 15 when I recreate songs using multiple sounds. My goal is to\u00a0recreate the same atmosphere of the original songs. In order to accomplish that, one has to understand what the composer is trying to tell and express to us, the audience, because behind every song, there\u0027s a message that the composer tries to get across. I only cover the songs that give a very strong impression on me, the ones that reaches out to me, the ones that I love. It doesn\u0027t matter if the song isn\u0027t popular, I\u0027ll cover it if it\u0027s a brilliantly written one from an art\u0027s perspective. The cinematography, sound effects, and camera angles are tailored specifically to the song that I cover, which is why you\u0027ll never find identical video styles across my videos. I want my covers to give the same impact to my audience, as the original song impacted me. My covers are done through careful analysis in addition to emotion and art to bring out the best of it. Every sound, every camera angle, every bit of my videos are very carefully thought through.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon, you\u0027re not just supporting my channel, but you\u0027re also supporting me as a person. It means that you\u0027re taking part in my life, how wonderful does that sound? If you feel it in your heart that you want to support me and the things I do, I can\u0027t thank you enough.\u003cbr\u003e"
