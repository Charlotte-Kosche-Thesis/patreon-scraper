    "summary": "Hey. Hi. Hello. My name is Zachary Spencer. Some of you might know me as radicalApollo. This Patreon is for my Youtube channel, Rad Plays, a Lets Play channel where I\u0027m playing every GBA game ever made!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my channel right over here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkgxAS-9lsdSt3GmuJFMzWA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkgxAS-9lsdSt3GmuJFMzWA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of recently, a lot of things came up that require me to have... a fairly large amount of money, meaning that in order to keep going with everything on the channel like I would want to, I\u0027m going to need your help in doing so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the introduction video, I explain all the details of the rewards for my Patreon, why I made the Patreon, and what will be happening on the channel now that the Patreon is a thing. For the sake of putting it down in words, I will explain those last two things here as well. Lets start with what will be happening to the channel.\u003cbr\u003e___________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eTHE CHANNEL AND HOW IT WILL BE RUN.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have nothing but good news for you guys. There is going to be nothing that will be taken away from your eyes. Every video I make will be able to be viewed by you. No gate keeping as far as that goes. With that, I\u0027ll be opening a poll on here for everyone at the $5 tier and above to decide the next lets play I do. That poll will pull from every game that I\u0027ve played before as one offs on the channel already, and if pick that game in the vote, I will HAVE to finish that game, regardless of it\u0027s quality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means as of January 1st, Rad Plays will have two videos every day from Monday to Friday. One video will be the standard fair: GBA Fun House and any lets plays I\u0027m interested in starting, but the other will be exclusively decided by you. Now, obviously, I can\u0027t pick every single GBA game for the poll, so I\u0027ll pull 5 from the pile and let you guys pick from those. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I\u0027ll also be holding a stream that\u0027ll pretty long, which will have a poll of it\u0027s own that will have a game that\u0027ll be decided by the people at the $25 tier. From those streams I will make more videos from the footage. We would still have two videos per day, but I\u0027ll be switching out a video for one of the stream videos in it\u0027s place. Anyone will be able to view the stream, but certain people will be able to help me decide which games to play for them. These streams will also start in January.\u003cbr\u003e___________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne question you might have going into this is what I will be using the money for. Well, I\u0027ll make things easy. There are three main things I\u0027ll be using the money for from this point on. These are not in any particular order or importance, and in fact, all of them have the same level of importance to me. So lets gets started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#1: School Expenses:\u003c/strong\u003e I have a good amount debt built up from my time in college. A good chunk of the money will be used to pay that off. This way, I\u0027ll get the debt out of the way and continue to make good content for everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#2: Paying For New Equipment For The Channel:\u003c/strong\u003e I want to use a chunk of the money from the Patreon to get new and better equipment for the channel. Meaning a new microphone, new headphones, a better computer, better editing software, and anything else that could make the videos better for everyone watching them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#3: Moving Out Of My Current House:\u003c/strong\u003e I was recently told that in possibly two years from making this post (December 1st, 2016) I will be given the opportunity to live with several people that I really love and care about deeply. The place we\u0027d be moving to is on the other side of the United States compared to where we are right now, and that means a lot of money will have to go into the move. That\u0027s where the money from this comes in. \u003cbr\u003e___________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all that said, I believe that is everything you need to know outside of the video. The video itself has a lot of good information in it that you\u0027ll want to hear, so please watch it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about the patreon, the rewards, or anything else, please send the questions to \u003ca href=\"http://radplays.tumblr.com/ask\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://radplays.tumblr.com/ask\u003c/a\u003e and I will answer them as best I can. You can ask even if you don\u0027t have a tumblr account!\u003cbr\u003e"
