So here\u2019s the deal. It costs money to produce a podcast. Web hosting, quality equipment, and monthly fees start to add up, and that\u2019s before you consider the countless hours we put in researching, recording, and editing. In order to give you even more content, we have some goals that you can help us meet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we hit $250 per episode, we\u2019re going to have an exclusive donors-only after-party with you guys once a month via Google Hangouts. Maybe we\u2019ll watch an episode of Rebels together, have a special guest, or just chat about anything and everything liberty and/or Star Wars related. Maybe we\u2019ll throw in some cantina music and chat the night away?",
