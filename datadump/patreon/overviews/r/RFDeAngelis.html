    "summary": "M\u0027Diro is a Fantasy Sword and Sorcery style world built on the gothic, the macabre, the darker side of romance, LGBT rights, equality, and much more. I love a good story; a rousing adventure with lovable, well-developed characters, a plot that stretches out and gives people puzzle pieces to put together. A good story gives something to get invested in; something where the reader can pick a side and ride the ride, and when it\u2019s done still be thinking about it days, weeks, months later. I\u2019m not talking about simple morality tales, I\u2019m talking about stories that raise questions and don\u2019t give you an answer but encourage you to come up with your own. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI grew up on such tales; Mercedes Lackey, Anne McCaffrey, Jim Butcher, Spider Robinson, and more recently J. K. Rowling. These and more are the people who gave me the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, I decided I wanted to give back. For years I did this by being a DM, a Dungeon Master for tabletop roleplaying games, and then I started designing my own game. This didn\u2019t stop me from running \u2013 and playing in! \u2013 other games. While I was helping to run a L.A.R.P. (Live Action Role Play) I had to write what are called \u2018meanwhiles\u2019 \u2013 short stories of my character\u2019s doings and thoughts to help flesh out the world, the story, and to help things be entertaining and fun for the other players. One of my players contacted me about these meanwhiles and \u003cem\u003edemanded\u003c/em\u003e to know why I wasn\u0027t writing professionally. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAfter patiently explaining I was severely dyslexic and had tried, repeatedly, only to fail each time, I realized that the advice I had been giving other people for things exactly like this was \u003cem\u003e\"AND?\u201d\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince hypocrisy and I don\u2019t get along very well, I took my own advice and sat down to write a short story in the world I had been researching for my game. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat was two years ago. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs of today, I have 13 short stories, and one novella, edited and self-published through Smashwords as well as being up on Barnes and Noble\u2019s website. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I have run into a problem. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile I love to write\u00a0and have a backlog of unedited short stories, a finished but unedited novel, a second novel that is almost finished, a written but unedited/unillustrated children\u0027s book, and a serial novel making progress in my head \u2013 But now I\u0027ve gotten sick. No idea what\u0027s wrong, still doing loads of tests, but the best they have told me is extreme exhaustion and lack of sleep. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing is the only thing that is keeping me going right now. I love it, so I am going to do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo chip in for me and you will get the Short stories on here for free, then I will publish collections of them about 4 times a year with smashwords as well as my other works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can get enough money from this to go full time, there will be so much more I can offer. I spent ten years on research for this world. I have lore, monsters, stats for said monsters, ecologies, spells, how and why things work, and much, much more all waiting at my fingertips to come out to you, to be someone out there\u2019s Pern, Valdemar, Dresden\u0027s Chicago, or a little bar outside of time just off the interstate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of the short stories, if you pleage enough you will also get lore, I have tones of it. Nothing like winning an internet argment with lore strght from the author you can\u0027t get anywhere else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease help me give this to you.\u003cbr\u003e"
