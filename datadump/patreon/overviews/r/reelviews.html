    "summary": "For 25 years, reviewing movies has been an integral part of\nmy life and ReelViews.net, which launched in January 1996, has been a big part\nof that. Now, as a result of Patreon, I have been able to expand Reelviews into\nwhat I had always hoped it could be. As far back as the turn of the century, I\nenvisioned two versions of the site \u2013 a free one that would include a full\narchive of older commentaries and reviews alongside a full selection of new\nreviews, and a membership area that, for a modest fee, would provide additional,\nexclusive content as well as early access to new VideoViews and ReelThoughts.\nLogistics (primarily related to the need to maintain a paywall) kept me from\nrealizing that\u2026until now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI came to Patreon on the advice of many of my readers. To\nthose who subscribe here, I can offer \u201cmembership benefits\u201d: monthly\nReelThoughts and Video Views in advance of their being added to\nthe site as well as a daily diary/blog where I share thoughts about life, cinema,\ntrivia, and the world in general. There are additional perks at higher levels.\nWhatever you choose to give, however, will be appreciated. And, if someday I\ncan get rid of all the ads and turn ReelViews back into \"the largest\nnon-commercial movie review site on the \u0027Net\", that would realize a hope I\nhave harbored since I first went commercial in 2007. Thanks for your support in\nthe past and your support as I seek to make ReelViews bigger and more vital\nthan it has ever been.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "James Berardinelli began writing movie reviews on the Internet in 1992 -\n at a time when few people knew what the \"Internet\" was. Being educated \nas an electrical engineer gave him an inside track when it came to the \nconcept of being \"online.\"  In the early days of 1996, he founded the \nsite that would become known as reelviews.net. That has been his primary\n home for nearly two decades.  Now, more than 3000 reviews later, he \ncontinues to go strong, having added radio and newspaper jobs to his \nresume.  He has written for the Burlington County Times, the Chicago \nSun-Times, and Playboy magazine. He was once cited by Roger Ebert as the\n \"best online film critic.\" He has published two volumes of review \ncompilations (\"ReelViews\" and \"ReelViews 2\") and was the longtime host \nof the movie club \"Talk Cinema\" in Voorhees, NJ. He has published four fantasy novels - The \"Last Whisper of the Gods\" trilogy and \"Lingering Haze\" (the first book of a new series). Today, he can be heard weekly on \nWNPV and is a regular contributor to Sohaib Awan\u0027s Fictional Frontiers . He is syndicated to about 20 web and print outlets worldwide \nthrough Webedia and the entirety of his output can be found at \nreelviews.net.",
