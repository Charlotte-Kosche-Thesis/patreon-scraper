Financially depleted from the war, \nthe German government doesn\u0027t give aid, infrastructure, or financial \nsupport to the residents, who have few options to leave. There\u0027s no \norganized police force, no protection of basic human rights, and no one \nto balance the scales. A few rich individuals are able to build their wealth on \nthe backs of those who have no way to defend themselves, and crime becomes common among the disillusioned and desperate. Vigilantes start to crop up because this is the only way to \nprotect the people, but each have their own motivations. Some less \naltruistic than others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this world, biological advances were \nmade early, sometimes with advances in physics and sometimes instead of \nphysics. Science learned how to splice and create new creatures, and \npushed the limit of human advancement in regards to everything from \ncustom pathogens to incredible beasts custom made for specific purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\n soon led to a craze of resurrecting extinct species of animals, adding biodiversity and sparking interest in the strange creatures of the past. One such\n species existed alongside humans as early as just a few hundred years \nprior, and were physically almost indistinguishable. They had the same \nskeletal structure, the same features, but remarkably different DNA. It \ntook years to successfully clone this species, considering their high \nintolerance to iron, but scientists were fascinated with the results. \nThe children grew incredibly slowly, had distinct blue blood, and as \nthey began to age had the ability to compel people and their enviroment.\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe children, quickly named the Fae Children after old lore and\n their clever and mischievous personalities, had incredible magic power.\n Depending on the child, they could change the world around them, \ndisappear from sight at a whim, and even control the will of their own \ncaregivers. It didn\u0027t take long for military forces to take notice of \nthe potential of these powers, and nations came into conflict over who \nshould be allowed to create the Children, and who could control their \npower. This erupted into an all out war which changed the face of the \nplanet, before finally a tense peace was arranged under the condition \nthat all Fae Children should be exterminated and no nation is allowed to\n continue their creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, not many \nnations followed these terms. Many hidden labs continued to experiment, \noften on people who were dislocated during or following the war. They \ncreated new children and even hybrids, like Tiltilla - a Native American\n refugee who became one of the first successful attempts to turn a human\n into one of the Fae.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story opens with Tiltilla, now free \nfrom her captivity, trying to justify her existence by using her power \nto establish order and law in the city. Her creation is proof that someone broke the treaty, \nand if people find out what she is capable of, it could spark another \nwar. She struggles to find purpose and validation by walking a very narrow line, and learns more about others who fight this same battle - each for their own reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eOkay, that doesn\u0027t sound awful... What do you need money for?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSetting up a webcomic in insanely expensive, particularly since neither my partner or I are artists. We\u0027re working with a massively talented artist to create this project, his work can be found \u003ca href=\"http://thisbananaboy.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and even though he was very flexible with prices, getting him the money he deserves will be difficult. In addition, keeping the webpage up, living expenses, and other fees quickly drain what money I have left. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything will help, please.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eSo, what, I pay and then you might release a page now and then?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNope!
