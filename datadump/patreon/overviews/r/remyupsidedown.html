    "summary": "Hi. My name is Remy, and I am a producer with a background in journalism, anthropology and shark taxonomy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving several proverbial pots in the fire during a transitional time, I find myself broke but eager to continue brewing what I have: Shark University, Maker Blue and a new, potential third entity of\u00a0 my own creativity. Lucky for me, my current involvement in shark research, media, production, art and technology can all come together quite seamlessly, while allowing me room to express myself in a lifelong goal or two. I think I found a way to have it all. Hurray.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeedless to say, I need a method to continue devoting myself to Shark University and Maker Blue as well as branch to my own corner to develop my communications expertise in order to give back to the research and maker communities as they continue to grow in our current progressions. So how do I do this?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere all this usually leads me is that I should go back to graduate school to fine tune my discipline as I realize the potential in my involvement with research and makers. Alas, with current time restraints and resources, dipping back in to academic cycle would not only disrupt my interdisciplinary curriculum but also just plain make me unhappy and further break my bank. For now, I\u0027d like to stay interdisciplinary, and I believe I have proven worthy to stay in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I do I do? For shark research, I consult early-career scientists in methods of media (e.g. how to storyboard your expedition so you can film as you research, how to manage your online entity, how to see, film and project your research \"cinematically\" for your public audience). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do I stay practiced with my discipline? I write storyboards and screenplays as well as produce popular science copies for the public to latch onto as they wade waters of distrust and disinformation on Shark Week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do I bring people together? That\u0027s all Maker Blue. Currently, researchers and inventors do not meet together at Maker Faire. I\u0027d like to make that happen. More on this later. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I have been working on a true romance graphic novel, which you can sample on Instagram (see link below).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can I do now? Now, I can digest. I have plenty of great material in the social ether that I would rather pack together in a digest for you to take home, patrons. In this digest, you can learn about the worlds I create as well as what it means as it part of the real scientific world of sharks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFore more on the content, visit the following Instagram accounts:\u003cbr\u003e@edgeofhaven\u003cbr\u003e@sharkuniversity\u003cbr\u003e@makerblueagain\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eRemy\u003cbr\u003e"
