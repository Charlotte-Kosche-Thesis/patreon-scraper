We wanted to give fans truly on-demand access to the kind of player-led discussions they\u2019ve always wanted to listen in on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, The Royal Blue Podcast was born, bringing Brigham Young Football fans a taste of real locker-room style conversations between the guys who\u2019ve stood in the huddle: BYU Football Players. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Royal Blue Podcast lives and breathes by one simple rule: Keep the fans first in everything we do \u2014 and everything we talk about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve invited Cougar Fans to be a vital part of our show, by telling us what topics they want to hear the players discuss.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eReal talk. By the players, for the fans.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow the Podcast Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the first BYU Football platform of its kind; the fans have full control over the main topics discussed on each week\u2019s episode! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll conversations will be inspired by the fans through surveys and questionnaires, so the more you engage with us and share your opinions, the better our podcast will be! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you bleed blue, you can help fuel the conversations by supporting the podcast. Take full advantage, and pitch as many topics as your BYU-beloved heart desires!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
