What\u2019s Patreon?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nPatreon is a crowdfunding website that helps/supports artists/content creators/indie workers earn a type of living doing the thing(s) they have a passion for. For me, Patreon will help me to NOT worry so much about financial difficulties and just focus primarily on content YOU all want to see and I want to create. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ll be able to keep up with \n\u003cem\u003ecfbg tips;\u003c/em\u003e to the point that I have enough pages to make a book. I\u2019ll be able to make quality videos for youtube, produce animated short films/clips, create more art and illustrations, eventually provide merchandise WITHOUT a third party taking a chunk of the profits, be able to afford equipment and software to better help produce work and be more efficient at it and, if God willing, be able to jump-start a production studio. And I believe Patreon will help me with all of that because it\u2019s a monthly guarantee direct deposit. And in the past, Patreon helped me afford a copay for an emergency doctor\u2019s visit so THAT\u2019S NICE (I had nothing BUT what I got from my Patreon Supporters and I\u2019ve never been so grateful in my LIFE).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003e\"Can I cancel/delete a pledge if need be?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nYeah, fam.
