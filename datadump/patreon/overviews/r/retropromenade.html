    "summary": "Work is currently underway on an informative and fun video, but for now, IT\u0027S ALIVE!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eRetro Promenade, Synthwave, Nostalgia, \u0026amp; The Mission:\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Retro Promenade began as a small side project in 2013 sort of as an excuse to work on really cool projects with the mindset of trying to brand \"differently.\" Synthwave (a genre of 80s \u0026amp; 90s inspired electronic music) is a fun world to explore and is rising in popularity, but with that comes a surplus of producers, creating very sometimes similar content, with a heavy emphasis on taking it all too seriously. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the past five years, Retro Promenade\u0027s tagline was \"Bright. Fun. Retro.\" and that mindset was imbued into every release from the start. It\u0027s as simple as that. The core values of what makes Retro Promenade what it is today are all about finding your own path, making your own way, doing it with a sense of pride, and doing it with a smile on your face. Even if your music is super dark and moody cyberpunk, it can still be \"fun.\" I think it\u0027s that sense of fun that keeps hardcore fans returning to the RP music and art projects over and over and what keeps new fans on the edges of their seats. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u0027s not enough for me to just make something, I tend to lean towards thinking of adding one or two more things to elevate projects. Blowing people away is sometimes how I refer to it. In most cases, it\u0027s just incredibly fun to put more effort into things. In ALL the cases, it has meant more work, but fan support has been through the roof. It validates the ambition. And, thus far, it has all been \"Made Possible by Viewers Like You.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just like PBS, your continued support as fans of Retro Promenade for the past five years, and synthwave in general, has already turned many ambitious ideas into successful realities. As for the future, there\u0027s an infinite well of talent out there and I, Mike Mendoza (also jams as Who Ha), have always been committed to coming up with and executing highly entertaining ways to advance our retro culture as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So\u00a0in the spirit of PBS, with this Patreon, I\u0027d like to start leaning towards an educational approach in the future, with new focuses on news and making connections between modern pop culture and its roots in retro, in addition to the music element. I believe that if we take the lead on aiming higher in all the rad things we do, we can even inspire our peers to do the same, fostering an even bigger and livelier community that we can interact with.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I believe that with better branding, higher ambitions, intelligent self-awareness, and the most excellent senses of imagination and fun, we can be free do what we do best; and here\u0027s where I think I can speak for all of us in the community... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur business is Retro.
