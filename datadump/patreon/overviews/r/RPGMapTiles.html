These maps will hopefully make your gaming nights more scenic, help your work as a Game Master and make adventuring more enjoyable for your players, too. These are system-agnostic maps, perfect for D\u0026amp;D, Pathfinder and any other systems. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou only have to select a reward level and enjoy what I send you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe next release will be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe result of our poll:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\tthe Ruined Windmill. \t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blackscrollsgames.com/sample/patreon/how_it_works.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is not like other crowdfunding sites, it\u2019s a bit different. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s more like a recurring pledge of a smaller amount, not a single one-time donation \u003cem\u003e(I will be very grateful if you choose to stay here, which means you will always get my maps at almost half price and support my work). \u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u2019t have to pay in advance here and await the fulfillment, it\u2019s much safer than other pages. I\u2019m planning to release 1-2 maps or tile sets per month and you have to pay only when I release something. You can even set a limit, a monthly-max-charge in the case that you don\u2019t want to spend over your budget if I, somehow, release more things within a month. Patreon will charge you at the 1st of every month based on the releases and your selected rewards of the previous month. You can read more about the process at the bottom of this page. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blackscrollsgames.com/sample/sewer/sewer%20map%20tiles%20sample%20physical%2004.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blackscrollsgames.com/sample/patreon/what_will_i.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy maps are usually 24 by 30 inch sized areas. This size leaves enough room on a common table for players. The digital version comes with poster sized pictures for VTT users, and with the big map broken into pages in PDF files you can print out yourself. The resolution is 300 dpi, which is perfect for even photo quality prints (that you will get with my physical card-tiles). Tile sets will usually include 24-30 tiles. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is the minimum I can promise. If we reach more goals, I can offer you more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe physical set contains the same, usually printed on 6x6 or 8x10 inch sized, double sided and UV coated tiles with a 1\u201d grid overlay. (It\u2019s possible to request gridless version, too, if there\u2019s enough interest, I can release it.) Because more than 2/3 of the original price is the cost of printing and the size of the sets and shipping cost may vary, I can offer you only an \u201cat-cost\u201d coupon code for physical products. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blackscrollsgames.com/sample/rewards.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor more details of what the rewards include, please see the right-hand side. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blackscrollsgames.com/sample/sewer/sample_corpses.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blackscrollsgames.com/sample/patreon/why_here.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve created this page here to see how many of you are interested in my work.

I fully understand if you are the type who doesn\u2019t like to fit and bend your game to the content of a map or a pre-written set. That\u2019s why I\u2019m constructing modular products. Every printed set and the digital products contains alternate versions of areas. Sometimes it is a night version or it can be an empty version of the rooms/areas that are originally full of stuff and furniture. You get the freedom to decide which one will be better for your game. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blackscrollsgames.com/sample/patreon/03hutb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blackscrollsgames.com/sample/patreon/more_about_me.jpg\"\u003eI live in Hungary (a small country in the hearth of Europe), and I\u2019m one of the lucky ones who have a job that is also my hobby. When I was a young adventurer, I always had an interest in the newest and spectacular computer and practical effects like CGI in the movies, and everything that showed how they\u2019re made. I started to learn 3D graphic on my first 133mhz PC (a cheap phone is now around 4x1000mhz), so it was extremely slow but I learned how to optimize my process :) . I started working in this area later. I learned art in college, worked on iPhone games at a company after graduating, so I\u2019ve got 10 years of experience creating 3D graphics. I\u2019ve learned to use professional software products that I\u2019m still using. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI also have 6 years experience in publishing. I started Lord Zsezse Works with my best friend, Zolt\u00e1n. I\u2019m still helping to him with a lot of things around LZSW, but I wanted to go out on my own with my 3D-based maps, so I\u2019m here with his support and I\u2019m really grateful to him for this. If you also are the type who likes the wonderful visual worlds of movies and games, then you can partly relive them on your gaming nights sitting around a table in your home (or online) with your friends using my maps. Well, at least I will try to bring you the best I can produce. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEverything you can see on the maps is designed, sculpted and painted/textured by me. It\u2019s a one-person show and I\u2019m very grateful to everyone who is supporting me and what I\u2019m doing! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blackscrollsgames.com/sample/christmas/face_short_gif.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon bills either your credit card or your PayPal account at the end of each month, and then sends me 95% of what they charge you (minus the transaction fee from Stripe, the credit card processor). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in becoming a Patron, here\u0027 how it works: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDecide your \"per map\" pledge \u2013 I release 1-2 maps per month, and you will only be billed for those I release. Due to the unpredictable number, you can opt to support only a certain number of times per month. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDecide your \"monthly max\" pledge \u2013 You can use this to set a cap on your pledge based on how many maps I create in any given month. For example, if you would like to pledge $5 per map up to a max of $10 per month, you will pay $10 if I create two maps that month, or $5 if I create one. Set this to 15-20 if you would like to support the creation of every map. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/images/site_resources/DTRPG-FulfilledBy-250.png\" style=\"width: 145px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eYou will get download links for the digital, and at-cost coupon links for the printed versions via DriveThruRPG.
