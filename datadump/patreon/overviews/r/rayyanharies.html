    "summary": "Hi everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rayyan Haries. I am on Patreon because I am trying to fund my study so that I can study Disaster Management to do more amazing stuff to give back to the world. For those who don\u0027t know me, I am a travel-junkie turned Disaster/Crisis Response Volunteer. For the past 3 years I have been stationed in the Philippines for 10 months after Typhoon Haiyan and Earthquake Bohol, Japan for 6 months taking care of cats, and I was aslo in Nepal when the second big earthquake happened to provide aid. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll these lead me to start my own kitchen called The Volunteer Cook kitchen on the frontline of Refugee crisis in Skala Skamnias, Greece. My stories were featured on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/11/07/refugee-volunteering-greece-food/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMashable\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/volunteers-come-from-all-over-the-world-to-help-migrants-1.2429045\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Irish Times\u003c/a\u003e and many others. Recently I was invited to Canada to present as a keynote speaker at a conference focusing on the Syrian Crisis, while I was in Canada I was fortunate enough to also talk at the Citizenship Immigration Canada/Immigration Refugee Citizenship Canada office. It also brought me to the Canadian House of Commons where I get to meet some of the most friendliest Canadian ministers as well as MPs and share with them about my experiences in Lesvos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep doing what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep giving back to the world.\u003cbr\u003eBut I also need to find the fund to get this extra knowledge that will help me greatly with my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI keep a fulltime job while doing all my volunteer work but most of it goes to the work that I didn\u0027t have the chance to keep for my education.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI produce inspiring, funny, witty videos, live broadcast and photos. Come and enjoy the journey with me. I promise you; you will laugh, giggle, cry and be emotional with me and my journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
