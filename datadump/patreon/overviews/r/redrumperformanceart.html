When those lyrics are chanting out DO IT DO IT DO IT...what was \"IT\"...drugs...sex...MURDE\u0026lt;wbr\u0026gt;R?! In a time of deep social upheaval paranoia is paramount! Remember the power that misunderstanding and moral panic holds to destroy lives; think of the West Memphis Three, the San Antonio Four, the McMartin School Trial, widespread censorship, mishandled investigations, beware thy neighbor, and media fueled fear. Is the devil at work or is it just mankind\u0027s way?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn March 2018 in a grand ballroom in the heart of the Chicago Loop transforms into an occult ritual space where infamous talk show host \u0027Gerald Rivers\u0027 conducts an expose on the dangers of Satanism!! Whether you are for or against or simply a morbid curiosity seeker be part of the studio audience while the host confronts this moral binary of good versus evil. Allow yourself to be lured by electric tabloid sensation into an immersive evening of entertainment that brings together 40+ visual artists, designers, and performers from across the country who have created pieces that touch on specific media stories and personal experiences related to the 1980s-1990s cultural phenomenon of Satanic Panic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to 3 ritual sets of burlesque and variety performances audience members will have the chance to interact with floor characters, engage in games, be branded with unique body art, purchase from vintage pop culture vendors, engage with roleplaying photo opportunities and earn badges of \"sin\". Guests are encouraged to dress in punk rock, gothic or heavy metal attire to help transport the event to a time and place. The goal is to push the boundaries of live entertainment into an engaging immersive environment where patrons can reflect on events of the past and discover ways that this same kind of moral panic and hysteria is thriving today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePress:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://travelvania.net/2017/03/18/satanic-panic-burlesque-show-chicago/\"\u003ehttps://travelvania.net/2017/03/18/satanic-panic-b...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://SAIC FNews Article\"\u003ehttp://fnewsmagazine.com/2017/03/this-friday-commune-with-the-devil-satanic-panic-comes-to-maclean-ballroom/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/satanicpanicevents\"\u003e#satanicpanicevents\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/satanicpanicburlesque\"\u003e#satanicpanicburlesque\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/heretodothedevilswork\"\u003e#heretodothedevilswork\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/thedevilmademedoit\"\u003e#thedevilmademedoit\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Red Rum\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"As the most purely evil and frightening individual to emerge in the 60s, this female performer gave a most convincing portrayal of seduction of the darkest kind.
