    "summary": "Hello people, that\u0027s me. \u003cstrong\u003eA gay comic book artist\u003c/strong\u003e. A guy who lived the most of his life feeling like a \u003cstrong\u003efish out of water\u003c/strong\u003e. Too insecure, shy, good at school but not excellent in anything. So, after the graduation in Environmental Sciences I difficultly realized, that I couldn\u0027t be excellent in living a life that wasn\u0027t my life, a life that started the day my dad (I still love you dad!) said to a 13 years old no-more-kid that was thinking to an high school with artistic specialization \"Think firstly at settling down, and, found a good job, you will do everything you want.\"\u003cbr\u003eGOOD MOVE. \u003cstrong\u003eThinking firstly at setting down implies that your whole life will be dedicated to \"settling down\" without never reaching it.\u003c/strong\u003e That\u0027s a matter of psychological orientation.\u003cbr\u003eAnd I wanted to break it up, resuming my \u003cstrong\u003eyounger wiser self\u003c/strong\u003e and focusing where I\u0027m really good, creating a story supported my images.\u003cbr\u003eI was also a 90s\u0027 kid, whose imagination was stimulated by comics, movies and TV shows based mostly on very \u003cstrong\u003emasculine and though heroes\u003c/strong\u003e, He-Man and the masters of the Universe, Conan the Adventurer, John Carter, and I really admired them. It was the archetype of the Noble Savage growing in me. And obviously a childish sexual fascination.\u003cbr\u003eSo, in the XXI century, noticing that it\u0027s still hard to find in fiction of any media giving us a gay character different from the usual shy, weak victim of the society, always orbiting around his fag hag, or the Fabulous Queen of Evil, or the eternal sissy provocateur, or the pederast, and worst of all the bunch of people who try to apply the SAME social stereotypes of straight relationships to themselves, I choose to \u003cstrong\u003ebecome the change I wanted to see in the world\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eSo I started drawing \u003ca href=\"https://tapastic.com/series/The-Hunter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Hunter\u003c/a\u003e, a fantasy comic settled in a magic ucronia where the \u003cstrong\u003eKnossos Empire\u003c/strong\u003e didn\u0027t extinguished but adopted magic technology to expand in the whole eastern Mediterranean Sea. \u003cstrong\u003eThe hunters\u003c/strong\u003e are there, in the ancient Germania, and they just want to go ahead with their stone-age way of living, just between man, because discrimination against homosexual historically was born with the civilization, with to need tho make some people unequal to others to the superior ones rule above the others and make them build palaces and temples.\u003cbr\u003eSaid that, my project for The Hunter, and maybe more comics in future, is to publish a \u003cstrong\u003efree to read webcomic\u003c/strong\u003e with the whole plot, and \u003cstrong\u003ereward my supporters with explicit sex scenes\u003c/strong\u003e that actually happened in the main story but obviously isn\u0027t show.\u003cbr\u003eProceeding with the story will let me to add new characters, relationships and sceneries to the story, and so new sex scenes with other performers and performances, so you will find really really satisfying to support me. For the actual story, that I want to be very intense, with \u003cstrong\u003epassion, tension and magic,\u003c/strong\u003e and the \u003cstrong\u003espicy extras\u003c/strong\u003e."
