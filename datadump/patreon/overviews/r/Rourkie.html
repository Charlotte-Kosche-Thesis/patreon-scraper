I believe that there is always more to learn from someone or something, and that there is always some fun in any situation, you just have to go out and find it. I run my own production studio, for art, writings, and music. I write music, poetry, and stories, and love to draw, paint, or act when I have the time. I also love to be outdoors whenever I get the chance, and go hiking as often as I can. I also enjoy changes in the weather and walking barefoot. I like to cook when I have the time. Most of all, I enjoy being with my friends whenever I can.",
