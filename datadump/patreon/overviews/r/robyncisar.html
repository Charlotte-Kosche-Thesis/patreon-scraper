    "summary": "Welcome! \u00a0I\u2019m an adoptee with a passion for empowering others in the adoption triad. I believe understanding the adoptee experience fosters stronger relationships and family values for anyone with or without experience in adoption. By sharing my story and perspective on adoption, I hope to encourage other adoptees to do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I talk about the adoption triad, I am talking about adoptees, adoptive families, and birth moms. But there are some other guests that often live within the adoption triad - loneliness, isolation, confusion, and hopelessness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBirth moms, adoptees, and adoptive families all experience these (and many other emotions) but when just one voice shares a story of life change, new emotions come in - comfort, boldness, faith, and hope. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMembers of the adoption triad need a voice and an outlet. A voice to champion their cause and normalize their feelings. Someone who has felt the same way, has been in the same situation, and who understands. A voice that says you don\u2019t have to do it all perfectly and without any angst or confusion. A confidant that will tell it like it is while always pointing back to the One who loves each adoptee, birth mom, and adoptive family fiercely and intimately. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen members of the adoption triad have hope, they are able to function better in all of their relationships. \u00a0Adoptees and waiting kids can better accept themselves as well as love from others. Adoptive parents find grace and strength for the next day of supporting their child. Birth moms accept love and find peace. And a young, scared pregnant woman who is wondering which path to take sees that there is a legitimate option to give abundant life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be that voice, and because of your support right here on Patreon, I get to be. Since launching my blog, adoptees have reached out to me from all over to share their stories. Several parents have told me that my writing has helped them better understand what their child may be feeling, allowing them to communicate better. And there is a little girl out there who recently turned one with her adoptive parents because her birth mom walked out of an abortion clinic while reading my #ShoutYourAdoption article. You make these stories possible. You make it possible for me to dedicate my time to connecting with birth moms, adoptees and foster kids, adoptive families, and even schools and groups that want to introduce adoption education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you join me in fiercely loving everyone in the adoption triad through a gift below? Thank you for linking arms with me to bring hope to this amazingly resilient group of people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
