    "summary": "My names Roxy! So probably wondering why patreon?? Well I made a patreon so I can create and bring more characters to life. Its a very pricy hobby and takes quite a while for me to finish all the costumes I make, I also currently have a full time job so most of my rewards are released at the end of the month. What rewards for being a patreon?? Full sets of monthly character! for my lewd set thats released at the end of the month. Also depending on the tier your in I also send personalized prints to my patreons. and small rewards from things I make, and print rewards. I also do a raffle to give out prints to special lucky patreons, everyones qualified to be in the raffle.\u003cbr\u003eDo you have to become a patreon? No not at all especially if you cant afford it, only join if you have the extra funds if not don\u0027t join! I\u0027m a humble bean you would all support me in any way even if its a month! Seriously thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
