You pledge an amount that you\u0027d like to donate\neach month (or by creation if the creator has it set that way), and\nit automatically conducts the transaction every month. You can set a\nlimit on your donations if you have a tight budget. You can pledge as\nmuch or as little as suits you, safe in the cozy knowledge that it is\nthe cumulative effort of the community that keeps each project\nafloat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe added bonus of this system is that\nwe can easily share extras with you guys!

For me, each dollar becomes\ntime I can spend creating more cool stuff for you guys. I\u0027d like to\nsee Greasy Space Monkeys and Stillwater Springs continue well into the future and release\nmore often (see\nthe stretch rewards ). Contributing is a vote for me as a\ncreator, my projects and your desire to see more of them.

Greasy Space\nMonkeys and Stillwater Springs will remain free, online to read, now and in the future, as\nlong as I n spare the time financially. Becoming a Patron is\ndirectly supporting the comic so I can keep making it, but it will\nalways be free to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat about Mr. Kestler?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is currently set up to support\ncreators rather than projects.
