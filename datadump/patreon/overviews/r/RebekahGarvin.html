They need to know what is going on. It is time for them to rise up and discover what the Creator made them to be. It\u0027s time for them to find the ancient path and walk boldly in it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll religion is man-made. It was created to be the monster it is. It is doing what it was designed to do. It was designed to hide the Truth. It was designed to keep women (men and children) from knowing how to have life, now and eternally. I already am going up against this Goliath with the name of the Ancient of Days going before me, YHVH Elohim. But I need your help to speak to women of any age, of any status and in any place in life with more energy and power. I want to set them free from the evils of religion. I want to show them the ancient path. The only path that is not man-made. The only path there is off this sinking Titanic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help me show women the path that they must take to be set free from the abuse of the religious spirit. It will help me show them what it is that they are to reject and what they are to embrace. Women must find this freedom and understand what their beauty is for. They need the Truth and they won\u0027t get it sitting in a church pew week after week...dying inside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is hope undiscovered.\u003cbr\u003eThere is a path that we must walk.\u003cbr\u003eThere is freedom to have.\u003cbr\u003eEspecially for women.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank-you for your over-the-top generous support empowering me to speak to women and assist them on their journey out through the following ways:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e YouTube Video Teachings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLIVE Facebook Events \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrinted Resources\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSocial Media Contact\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersonal and Snail Mail Contact\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOnline e-Commerce Market\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLocal Workshops\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNational Conferences \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see in my goals, as my support grows I plan on doing even more than the above list to serve Yahweh\u0027s daughters.
