    "summary": "I\u0027ve always been a huge fan of Art. Honestly most of my income goes to supporting artists and helping them survive. Of course this isn\u0027t completely selfless, because I get a pretty piece of art out of it. One of my favorite things to do is to definitely get a new artist out there, so they get seen and hopefully are able to support themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis this whole comic idea started out to help a friend of mine. He does his own manga as his passion project. But that doesn\u0027t always pay the bills. It started out as me just commissioning him to help him pay some bills, but eventually we got the idea to do this comic featuring my character.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u00a0hopes for this patreon is so I can support him. Everything I make from this patreon will go to help support him so he can live. He and his wife have been friends of mine for quite a while, but sadly my career stops me from ever really getting to see them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you from the bottom of my heart for even looking at this page. It really does mean a lot to me. If you do decide to stick around I will do my best to make it worth your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is the comic about. What I\u0027m hoping out of this comic is to make several small stories revolving around my character Jemma, who is a Naga. What happens when you\u0027re a giant snake lady, who is trying to do the work of normal people? How badly will her \u00a0odd body get in the way? How well can you keep track of a 20-foot body when there are a bunch of people around that you aren\u0027t used to? Hopefully we\u0027ll find out, and enjoy a little Mayhem in the process."
