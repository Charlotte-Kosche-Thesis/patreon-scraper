Now, you\u0027ll see a lot of people out there trying to do the same, making gameplay videos or just vlogs talking about the newest games. What I\u0027m aiming for is somewhat different:\u003cstrong\u003e I want to create my own games.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only problem is that\u003cstrong\u003e I also need money to live\u003c/strong\u003e, and here\u0027s when I must chose between living a normal life, trying to survive with the money I would get paid by working at something I don\u0027t like at all, or taking this chance and trying to make a living out of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who don\u0027t know how this works, Patreon is a way to donate a certain amount of money each certain amount of time. This can be each week, each month, twice a month, even each time you upload a video if you\u0027re a youtuber. In my case, it\u0027s a monthly thing. I want to make it as if this was my job and I was paid each month for what I\u0027m doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I don\u0027t you to get confused or anything; \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m not gonna stop doing what I love if you don\u0027t donate.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I just might find it more difficult to get the time or resources to do it, but I will never stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re here to donate, I cannot express with words how glad and grateful I am.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0But not only that, you can check out the \"rewards\" at your right. The more you give per month, the better the reward gets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you want to stop donating, you can do it whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who don\u0027t know what have I been doing, here\u0027s my Gamejolt page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gamejolt.com/profile/red-x/1075380\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRed X\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave a nice day!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
