Check it out! :)\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eComputer status:\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe difference between when I first created this Patreon and now is that I need funds for new parts to build a PC to make my daily work schedule a lot smoother and without problems. My PC which has created every single video in the last 5 years is crashing every day, it\u0027s probably going to die soon and I have very little spare funds to be able to replace the parts required for it to be stable again so instead I\u0027ll be trying to save up and purchase various parts for a new build and cannibalize the old parts (as many as I\u0027m able) for the new PC.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat will this mean for you?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eA new PC build will mean videos can be processed and uploaded a lot faster. This means better and higher qualities as well, 1080p60fps can be a regular thing on the channel. You may have also noticed recently that my uploads have slowed down, well that is due to my PC crashes. I\u0027d be able to produce much more of the content you want to see and enjoy with a new PC.\u003cbr\u003eRight now my PC will take on average around 2 hours for one 25~ minute video to process (that\u0027s not including uploading it!) and that\u0027s if it doesn\u0027t crash in that time. The PC having a crash when the processing is at or above 90% complete happens more often than you\u0027d think.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew Discord reward:\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe new Discord reward is designed to get everyone involved, it\u0027s going to mean you can actually chat to me in real time and offer your support, a funny joke, or just say hi. Being a participant on the Discord also means you have the chance to play with me in games. I wanted to make the entry to the Discord be affordable for everyone and it\u0027s only if you really want to show that extra support that there are higher reward tiers (with fancy titles) available for prioritized selection in playing with me. Otherwise everything is unlocked for everyone and that\u0027s a great thing in my opinion.\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to chatting with you on the Discord channel!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eBelow is what I wrote when I first opened this Patreon account and most of it is still very much applicable (paying rent and bills) however the reward structure has now changed!\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e*fades in*\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelloooo Reformers\u003c/strong\u003e..
