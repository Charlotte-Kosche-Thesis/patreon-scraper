We need more wholesome, independent sites that nurture creativity, instead of advertising and playing on a \"compare-and-despair\" ethos of insecurity. I have my own website, where you can get on the mailing list and still get\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://rowenbridler.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eupdates and insight into my work for free\u003c/a\u003e, but I wanted to create an \u0027Inner Circle\u0027 of special people who get first access (and indeed entirely unique content that I don\u0027t share elsewhere) to my work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u2019m experimenting with Patreon to keep you in the loop with my writing/books, recording/songwriting and making videos. The beauty of Patreon is that you can experiment too: you can cancel at any time, elect to donate on a one-off basis\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/RowenBridler\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e instead or donate to some other project that takes your fancy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do decide to play along with this experiment and claim your preferred fashionista style and creative swag, I THANK YOU. Truly, Madly, Deeply. You are a believer. A dreamer. An outlier. I commend you for your courage and sense of adventure. You are extraordinary!!\u003cbr\u003e"
