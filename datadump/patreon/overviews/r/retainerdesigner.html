I have been creating instructional videos for orthodontic lab technicians since 2007 when I first launched \u003ca href=\"http://www.retainerdesigner.com,\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.RetainerDesigner.com .\u003c/a\u003e I started posting these videos on my blog \u003ca href=\"http://www.DesignerRetainer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.DesignerRetainer.com\u003c/a\u003e not long after to teach other labs how to create the many designs from the RetainerDesigner website. With the response to my YouTube Channel, I saw that there are a lot of people out there wanting this knowledge of this almost secret industry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is not much out there for us, I know. I ran into the same problem when I was at your stage. I was lucky, I found a dental lab school 3 hours from my house that I attended. But not everyone is so lucky and the schools are closing down one by one. At the time of me writing this, there are currently no dental lab schools in the state of Texas and more closing every year nationwide, which is sad. The lack of truly knowledgeable technicians out there is hurting our industry. So I know there is a need out there. Heck, the 8,000+ subscribers to my niche YouTube channel proves it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Ultimate goal is to create an Orthodontic Laboratory Technician School! \u003c/strong\u003eThis school will start online with, hopefully, the physical portion to follow. But, I need help getting the online courses started. I want to create a vast online library of ortho lab instructional videos. I want this library available to all people wanting to learn this industry and I want you along for the ride as I produce these videos giving me feedback telling me what you want to learn, what subjects to cover, creating sylibus for the courses. Hey, you might learn a thing or two along the way! In fact, I want you to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that these could be used by many people in the orthodontic industry. \u003cbr\u003eEverybody from:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBeginners wanting to learn\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIntermediate techs that want to learn new appliances\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOrthodontic assistants that want to learn a few basic lab appliances\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThose that want to branch out on their own and open a new business\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDental Lab technicians that want to add ortho to their business\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStay at home moms (or dads!) that would like to make an income by learning a new skill\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAn Example of one my older videos:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e5db5vDpBz8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
