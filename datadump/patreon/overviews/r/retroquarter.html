    "summary": "Many moons ago (around 9 years) during summer 2006,\u00a0two friends started hanging out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the summer months flew by, they bonded over playing video games, watching the World Cup and drinking a gratuitous amount of Coors Light - it should be noted that they were trying to save up points so they could get a delightful Coors branded poker chip set!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, those two friends were Stephen King \u0026amp; Alistair Cowan. We have been playing games and podcasting for a number of years now; from running our own video game website (that we will not name), to running other sites\u0027 podcasts for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided we would like to try something a little different, something a little more focused. And that my friends is the story of how Retro Quarter was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur approach to podcasting is a lot like our approach to most things - over-orchestrated, not held together by much, but damn is it fun! If you like podcasts, laughing, video games, laughing, chat about how tiring being parents is (I promise this is not often, it just usually goes hand in hand with talk about being tired) why not support us?\u003cbr\u003e"
