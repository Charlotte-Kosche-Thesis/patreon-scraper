    "summary": "Welcome to the Patreon page of Ren Hurst, owner of Render Me Wild, LLC -- a company dedicated to undomesticating the planet and ending animal exploitation through an applied understanding of unconditional love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI teach people how to undomesticate their lives through a set of principles I call Sanctuary13: A Sacred Path to Unconditional Love.\u00a0 My speciality is interspecies relationships and in how to recognize the difference between a loving interaction and an exploitative one.\u00a0 Think of it as a very grounded and practical form of animal communication that can help anyone return to their full, authentic power and release the conditioning and trauma of their past.\u00a0 The difficulty is that not many people are ready to step into full accountability in the area of domesticated animals, and it is far more easy to get surface level needs met through animals using control.\u00a0 True love is not a path for the faint of heart.\u00a0 I\u0027m here to rewild your heart and teach you how to honor the animals you love with the respect they deserve so that you can find what you\u0027re looking for where it\u0027s always been -- inside of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what is this \"rewilding\" or \"undomesticating\" and why do you want it?\u00a0 It is freedom.\u00a0 Freedom from the beliefs, control, and abuse of others or your past.\u00a0 Freedom to be your truest, most expressive self.\u00a0 Freedom to feel safe in your own skin.\u00a0 Freedom to be the you that you were born to be.\u00a0 To rewild is to return to your most natural state, and that state is always love.\u00a0 I\u0027m going to invite you to explore a deeper understanding of love than the one that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.\u00a0 Do not think for a second that we can reclaim our free and wild nature while extinguishing it in others.\u00a0 If you have an animal in your immediate care, I can almost guarantee you have an obstacle in your path to self acceptance.\u00a0 I want to help you turn that obstacle into opportunity.\u00a0 The animals in our lives, and how we treat them, hold the answer for what has been holding us back.\u00a0 When we learn to listen to them, and stop using them, they have infinite wisdom to give and an unbelievable depth of love to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDomestication is a betrayal in every love relationship, and the connection we seek through animals can never be restored through controlling them for our use.\u00a0 Fortunately, we live in a time where there are an enormous amount of animals that need our help.\u00a0 We can change everything if we start listening to them instead of trying to save them.\u00a0 This is one of the hardest paths an \u0027animal lover\u0027 could ever choose to walk, and I\u0027m going to be with you the whole way.\u00a0 How incredibly brave of you to step up and acknowledge you\u0027re ready to love yourself so fiercely that you never need to rely on another being to know your worth again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work transcends biology, history, and conditioning so it is equally applicable to all species and all relationships.\u00a0 Please enjoy the video below of me interacting with a young camel named Baraka at the Sacred Camel Gardens in Northern California, circa 2015.\u00a0 The principles of Sanctuary13 have evolved a great deal since then, and I find myself now critiquing my interactions with Baraka with much more awareness and understanding.\u00a0 That said, this is a beautiful representation of the connection that can happen between even strangers when authenticity is the foundation and the universal language of love is understood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXLh5qFfxFk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour money is creating a revolutionary sanctuary to catalyze a global shift in consciousness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support through this platform allows me to offer lifetime freedom and care to the animals at Phoenix Landing - the sanctuary I share with my partner and 13 horses, five mini equines, three pot-bellied pigs, five dogs, and two cats.\u00a0 First and foremost, the money received through Patreon directly supports the animals in the form of food, shelter, and other necessary care expenses.\u00a0 After that, it pays the bills so we can continue to live here and develop the property.\u00a0 This will allow me to be able to focus on creating content to teach this transformational body of work and develop our sanctuary home.\u00a0 Most especially, it will allow me to finish my upcoming book, ANIMAL KIN: Restoring Connection to Wild Wisdom, which is the why and the how behind it all.\u00a0 For those that don\u0027t know me, all but two of the animals I care for are from my past.\u00a0 In 2013, I had a radical shift of perspective that resulted in my first book,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Riding-Power-Others-Horsewomans-Unconditional/dp/1940184118/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1519333570\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=Ren+Hurst\"\u003eRiding On the Power of Others\u003c/a\u003e, which is the story of my evolution as a professional horse trainer and how these concepts came to be.\u00a0 I\u00a0walked away from everything I knew to take responsibility for my exploitative relationship to animals and instead offer sanctuary to the ones I intended to train and sell for profit.\u00a0 The past five years have been filled with enormous challenge as a result of leaving my career, and income, behind to live in the integrity of my new beliefs.\u00a0 I am currently camping full time, off the grid, in order to offer sanctuary to this many animals and bring this work to the world in whatever way I can.\u00a0 Your financial support allows me to actively move toward a more sustainable lifestyle that will give me a chance to make this information available on a much larger scale.\u00a0 For the most part, I am physically bound to the sanctuary and unable to travel to teach until I can establish a modern home and caretaker\u0027s quarters for someone to look after the animals in my absence."
