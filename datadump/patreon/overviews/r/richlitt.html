Knowing that you\u0027re here means a ton to me.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFor those of you who are unfamiliar with my work: I do a lot of things. Mostly, I write. Essays, articles, and poetry are my main mediums, but I\u0027m also working on a fantasy novel and a whole host of short stories. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI also make video documentaries about travels I take around the world as a digital nomad, and I design, code, and ship a ton of different types of websites as a way of making art. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHere\u0027s a few things I\u0027m working on at the moment, with your help:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://nomadasfuck.com/\"\u003eNomad As Fuck\u003c/a\u003e.

And I want to make even more.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlright, let\u0027s get to some questions. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQuick - what if I don\u0027t want to do Patreon, but I want to donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo worries!

But why should I trust you? What have you done before?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGood question. I\u0027ve got a lot of stories to draw from. Here are some highlights:\u003cbr\u003e\n- \n\u003cstrong\u003eSailed my own yacht in the Med\u003c/strong\u003e. I knew I was going to live in Malta, so I bought a yacht in Sicily on Ebay, and learned how to sail enough to get it 90 miles across a shipping lane without getting killed. I had no qualifications, no license, no insurance, and no regrets.\u003cbr\u003e\n- \n\u003cstrong\u003eGot paid to drink a lot\u003c/strong\u003e. I founded [The User Is Drunk](https://theuserisdrunk.com), where people paid me money to drink and look at their websites. This got a lot of press, and went wildly viral.\u003cbr\u003e\n- \n\u003cstrong\u003eWrote the dictionary for a fake language.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I was in charge of the Na\u0027vi dictionary on LearnNavi.org for two years. I used to be fluent in the language spoken by aliens in the movie Avatar. \u003cbr\u003e\n- \n\u003cstrong\u003eSwam in the winter ocean in Svalbard, in the Arctic\u003c/strong\u003e. My friends and I organized and went to a JavaScript conference in the arctic circle. Each night, we stripped, ran screaming into the arctic ocean, and then ran back inside to be warm. In January, in the polar night.\u003cbr\u003e\n- \n\u003cstrong\u003eHitched 20,000 miles\u003c/strong\u003e. All over the place.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to learn how to do these things too, or what it was like, Patreon is the best way to support me telling you. I\u0027m working on writing stories that I can share with you, and in the meantime, I\u0027m always trying to share interesting tips on doing stuff like this yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get as a backer?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll post stuff to Patreon regularly. As a backer, you\u0027ll get \u003cstrong\u003efirst access \u003c/strong\u003eto my essays, thoughts, and updates. I\u0027ll send along a weekly update, and I\u0027ll post an essay a week that is \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive\u003c/strong\u003e to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWant more? Get in touch. I\u0027m happy to edit my rewards to make it easier for me to help you level up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m here because I make a lot of websites and content which isn\u0027t directly incentivized, but which often costs me money to get off the ground and get going. A good example is websites: I make a ton of websites! Each of domain costs around $13.17 to buy - that all adds up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing on Patreon allows me to figure out how to make those costs back easily, and not sweat the small stuff. I\u0027m using this to make more art. For great good!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do the little tier drawings come from?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to run a webcomic, years ago!
