    "summary": "Hello, my name is Ryan Bayne. Welcome to my Patreon page. Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTHE SKINNY:\u003cbr\u003e\n I am writing songs, shooting videos for said songs, directing music videos for other artists in Boise that I dig and collaborating with them to make more music. I want to share all of this with YOU. In exchange, for a couple bucks a month to help move these projects along, I\u0027ll pat you on the back, give you first dibs on my new music (free MP3 downloads) and concert tickets. You will be the first to see the new music videos that I create for my tunes and the artists that I collaborate with. In addition you will get exclusive content that you won\u0027t get anywhere else, and a peek behind the curtain so we can get to know each other a little better. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI have been very fortunate to work with some of the best talent in Boise, in the studio, on stage, on music videos and in film. These collaborations have been instrumental (pardon the pun) in making the music that I have thus far. I am looking forward to doing more of it and sharing it with you. My Last record,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/beloved/976688161\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBELOVED\u003c/a\u003e showcased a number of artists that I am grateful to have worked with. I have been able to write and record songs for the highly acclaimed documentaries\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076KN3VRQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJens Pulver | Driven\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bloodsworth-Innocent-Man-Kirk/dp/B01BLUTWQA/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1518786259\u0026amp;sr=1-1\u0026amp;keywords=bloodsworth+an+innocent+man\u0026amp;dpID=51h0j11vvbL\u0026amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_\u0026amp;dpSrc=srch\"\u003eBloodsworth - An Innocent Man\u003c/a\u003e. Most recently I composed and performed the soundtrack for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.6dynamiclawsforsuccess.com/homepage/\"\u003e6 Dynamic Laws For Success in Life, Love \u0026amp; Money\u003c/a\u003e. Currently, I am working on a new record that will feature some talent from Boise that you may or may not be aware of, so I would love to introduce you to them and get you some exclusive content of that process as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get access to all of this, all you need to do is subscribe. Check out the REWARDS section to choose your subscription level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!!!\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for taking the time to read through this. Thank you for your support.
