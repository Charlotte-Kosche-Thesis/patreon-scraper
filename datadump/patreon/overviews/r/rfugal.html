The trickster, FAIRY, is a pooka \u2013 a spirit, ghost, or fairy from Irish lore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story of Sara is inspired by the author\u2019s own daughter, who learned to read in the same manner as Sara. In Act 1, we are introduced to Sara\u2019s love of stories right before she is kidnapped by MANTIS (a giant mantis) to be educated by JULIUS and JOHANNA (a dragon and a phoenix). In Act 2, Sara is introduced to her new home, the castle of Hofenzell, its residents and educators, and method of instruction. Sara endeavors to escape the castle, and ends up in trouble and embarrassed. In Act 3, Sara finds a friend and ally in the pooka whom she has named FAIRY. Together they plan Sara\u2019s rise to the climax \u2013 Sara shows Julius and Johanna that she can read.\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
