    "summary": "Thank you for coming here! To give money to a podcast on theology is tremendously generous of you. As Christian people of good will, you are already asked to give your financial support to many things. For you to even consider including me in such company is an honor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years now, I have dedicated myself to producing solid, Christian and free media online. It has had many ups and downs, but I have always striven to produce free, distributable entertainment that also teaches the faith with clarity and integrity. Yet while the entertainment has always been free, the technology and (more importantly) time to produce it is not. That is why this Patreon account exists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining my Patreon team, you are becoming a consumer of the products of Awesomecorpe, a limited liability company. Its goals include many more projects, some of which will be free, some of which will require purchase, some of which will be free only to Patreon subscribers (such as all Kindle ebooks in pdf format!). From transcription books to graphic T-shirts based on the best shows, the plan is to keep drawing you back to the central truths of our holy faith by developing a worldview that feasts on the Scriptures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support is not tax\u00a0deductable, but in exchange Uncle Sam\u0027s sticky fingers and a small cut for Patreon\u0027s financial management, Awesomecorpe has great freedom to maneuver, particularly when it comes to that one resource even money can\u0027t buy once it has all run out: time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you listen to anything I do, you know that I live to share the gold of Christ-centered theology. I live to dig deep into the Scriptures and mine out the goods until I can deliver them to you in both informative and entertaining ways. Thank you for considering that this work is worth supporting. Thank you for being willing joining the Awesomecorpe team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
