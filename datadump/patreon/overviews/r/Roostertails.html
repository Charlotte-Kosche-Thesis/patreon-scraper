    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010 I started a comic called \u003ca href=\"http://www.roostertailscomic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRooster Tails\u003c/a\u003e; it\u0027s an autobio webcomic about my life, as a queer transguy, and the things I get up to living in Auckland (New Zealand) with my genderqueer partner and our cat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started drawing these comics because when I looked for stories about queer trans guys, I couldn\u0027t find any, and that was sad. Well - y\u0027know - there was \u003cem\u003eBoys Don\u0027t Cry\u003c/em\u003e, but sheesh, that\u0027s not really a great movie to watch when you\u0027re looking for something that celebrates trans-ness. So I started drawing my own comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of the stories in the media show trans people in a really narrow way - stories about how scandalous and freaky it is, stories that often only talk about a \"wrong body\" narrative (which is a fine enough narrative, but it\u0027s not my experience of my body), and stories that concentrate on pain and isolation. My comic doesn\u0027t do that. I tell stories about my life, and share my experiences transitioning, being a nerd, the fun stuff, and some of the hard stuff too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve recently begun a comic series called \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.roostertailscomic.com/family-portraits/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFamily Portraits\u003c/a\u003e\" where I explore and celebrate other people\u0027s stories of being Queer, Trans and other letters in the non-straight/non-cisgender world. I have released the first three issues of these comics, and y\u0027all should read them. Part of my reason for setting up this patreon is to have more time/money that I can devote to making more of these comics. So, supporting this patreon will help make sure both Rooster Tails and Family Portraits continue!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.roostertailscomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HOW-TO-DO-SAMS-PATREON.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIf you\u2019re having trouble with the patreon site and don\u2019t know how to sign up \u2013\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.roostertailscomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HOW-TO-DO-SAMS-PATREON.pdf\"\u003echeckout this little PDF I created.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
