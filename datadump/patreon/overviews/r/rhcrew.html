    "summary": "We\u0027re a group of lifelong friends that get together for a weekly podcast. We give our own take on current events, insult everyone and everything, turn nearly every comment into an innuendo, and try to avoid the job lynch mob at the same time. Everything goes, especially our pride and dignity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUntil now, our podcast has just been for a small group of our closest friends. But today is a new day. The sun is shining. There\u0027s a crisp breeze flowing through the trees. In the distance a coyote can be heard mauling someone\u0027s cat. Bliss. It\u0027s time to step up our game and expand the size of the RHCrew and open our podcast up to everyone. We\u0027re going to streamline our format, add more segments, and provide much more up-to-date content. That\u0027s where you come in. Everything we\u0027ve done up to this point has all been funded out-of-pocket. And our pockets aren\u0027t that deep.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy becoming a Patron you will help us to upgrade equipment, hire people to help with production and writing, build a set to record on and reduce the echo...echo.....echo.........echo. We also hope to take the podcast on the road someday! Thanks for stopping by. Check out our content. And if you like what you hear, go check out the rewards we have for becoming a Patron and pick the one that works best for you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.rhcpodcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePast Episodes \u0026amp; Updates!\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheRhcrewPodcast\" rel=\"alternate\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheRhcrewPodcast\" rel=\"alternate\"\u003eSubscribe in a reader\u003c/a\u003e"
