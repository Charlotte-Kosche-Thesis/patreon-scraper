    "summary": "Roadside America is an unforgettable panorama of life in rural United States. The exhibit spans more than two hundred years of history, and roughly seven thousand square feet in size. Featuring moving waterways, working model railroads and trolleys, building lights and sounds, and so much more; Roadside America is one of the most incredible feats of craftsmanship ever completed by a single man.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we say we are \"creating\" the world\u0027s greatest miniature village, what we actually mean is we are keeping a monumental piece of history alive through the means of hand restorations and maintenance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe miniature village at Roadside America was actually completed in 1963 with the passing of its single creator, Laurence Gieringer. Since then, the exhibit has been passed down through generations but always kept in the family. It has been on display in its current building in Shartlesville, Pennsylvania since 1953. To this day, thousands of patrons visit and are amazed by the larger-than-life landscape. Although the village was created by one incredible man over his lifetime, it takes an entire workforce to maintain and restore such a delicate exhibit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs is to be expected with an exhibit of this age, many aspects of the village, particularly the electrical work powering the various elements of the display and its interactive push-buttons, are beginning to become inactive. With monthly contributions from our loyal patrons like yourself, we will be able to better address these and other issues we are currently experiencing with the village.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we do charge for admission, we keep admission rates as low as possible. Our admission revenue leaves little room for restorations and maintenance. 100% of Patreon subscription revenue, however, will go directly into restoring and maintaining our massive display. In 2015, the village celebrated its 80th anniversary of originally opening to the public. With your help, we can keep this historic work of art on display for generations to come.\u003cbr\u003e"
