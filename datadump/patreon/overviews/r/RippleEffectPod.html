However, I am a big fan of Savage\u0027s and Who\u0027s work, and the three of us communicate quite frequently via email. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I digress. I\u2019m the doctor who\u00a0makes and hosts a podcast called The Ripple Effect.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy show unfolds the stories of business leaders dedicated to making our future better. Stories mixed with thoughtful commentary from\u00a0inspired women and men who run charities, not-for-profits, and social enterprises. And each episode exposes listeners (aka the Ripple Nation) to a different business that shapes society\u0027s beliefs, ideas, and viewpoints. Bringing about fantastic transformations.\u00a0Hopefully, you\u0027ll become a citizen and start seeing the world around you a bit differently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill it\u0027s intriguing\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u00a0that you\u0027ve come here.

Thanks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u0027re thinking of supporting the show via Patreon (which automatically grants you full citizenship of the Ripple Nation, by the way), you may also be wondering ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat exactly do you do, Doc?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Well,\u00a0I travel anywhere I can reach.

Supporting The Ripple Effect on Patreon translates into writers, producers, composers. Keeping it 100, this would be a huge step towards delivering a lot more shows to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I\u0027m not rich enough to join the Nation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Then apply for a tourist visa. All you need to do is subscribe to The Ripple Effect and write positive reviews.\u00a0But fun fact: podcast players such as iTunes can sometimes be as reliable as an underwater hairdryer when it comes to telling you\u00a0when a show\u0027s uploaded. However, a few gold coins a month via Patreon (that\u0027s just 2 bucks US for you non-Aussies) gets you notified straightaway\u00a0there\u0027s a new episode--which is pretty awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow could I go\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eabove and beyond\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e? \u003c/strong\u003ePicking a larger reward level will certainly do the trick.
