Our music is composed in-house by our team of producers, and uses sound sweep technology designed to relax and calm your dog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe help tens of thousands of dogs worldwide suffering with sleeping problems, anxiety problems and signs of stress. Our main priority is making sure every dog gets the important relaxation time that they deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRelax My Dog\u0027s music will help to calm and soothe your dog or puppy in a variety of situations. Console whimpering puppies, minimise separation anxiety, reduce hyperactivity, minimise fear of thunderstorms, stop unwanted barking, comfort sick or injured dogs and calm your dog on car journeys - Relax my Dog does it all! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRelax My Dog\u0027s sound sweep technology is the high pitched noise that runs through a lot of our melodies. Many people believe that dogs hear two to three times more than humans - which isn\u0027t true. Actually, dogs hear the same as us - just two to three octaves higher. The sound sweep in our music is designed the same as a dog whistle - to hold your dogs attention to the music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRelax My Dog\u2019s music is unique, and will help in a variety of situations as a substitute for medication. We have helped dogs and puppies worldwide to sleep and reduce their anxiety. Music therapy for your dog can keep them calm, happy and healthy, and it is a great way to rehabilitate rescue dogs - or just get your puppy or dog used to their new home. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing re-homed is an incredibly stressful time for dogs - as they have to get used to a lot of different sights and sounds, as well as their new family and any other pets in the household. We recommend that you play Relax My Dog during this time, and it will help reduce their heart rate and relax them while they explore their new surroundings. No more whimpering puppies - they will get used to your home in no time at all with the help of Relax My Dog\u0027s music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may be crate training or obedience training, which can be a stressful time for both dog and parent, and our music will soothe your pup making your life easier. Crate training can be one of the hardest things about getting a new puppy - as being trapped in a new space and away from you is very scary for them. However, when listening to Relax My Dog you will notice your puppy start to relax, and get more used to their crate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is also very useful to calm your dog during car journeys - which many dogs find a stressful time. They may associate it with vets visits - so we recommend playing Relax My Dog\u0027s music before and after visits to the vet to reduce their stress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe worst time of year for over 60% of dogs is Firework season - the loud bangs are really scary for them and you may notice a huge change in your dog during this time. Thunderstorms are another difficult time for dogs, with the majority of dogs being very scared of storms because of the unfamiliar loud noises. Relax My Dog is the perfect solution to this anxiety inducing situation - just play our firework and thunderstorm playlist to reduce your dogs anxiety and make them feel safe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most common problem we hear is separation anxiety in dogs, they are pack animals and see their owners as their pack - being separated from you can cause severe anxiety in many dogs. Relax My Dog\u2019s music has improved thousands of cases of separation anxiety and barking canines all over the world - just play them our music when you leave to go to the shops or out of the room, and you will notice a lot less barking and whimpering from your four-legged friend!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have over 120,000 subscribers on YouTube, and we\u0027re hoping that you will join us on Patreon so we can carry on our stress reducing work for the dog world!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting us,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eRelax My Dog xxx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh yeah, and here is proof of our music working :D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bt_931J0Yg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
