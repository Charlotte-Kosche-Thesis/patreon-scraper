My art is very cartoony, whimsical, and I love line work and heavy details, as well as watercolor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Rad Giraffe?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen\u00a0I was graduating school I needed a resume and business cards and such (an identity) for art basically, and I really wanted something unique, long story short I turned myself into a giraffe , laughed at it and made it into my logo.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAny \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eREAL \u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eart experience?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a caricature artist while in my senior year of college and stuck with it after, it was a job where I got to draw and thought why not, I never thought of caricatures as a money maker, but 3 years later there I was. It would eventually eat at me and I didn\u0027t make anything my own for a while and I had a life crisis and ended up leaving that, but now I\u0027m drawing more and more of \u003cstrong\u003emy own work\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and even still do caricature gigs like parties and such still. Caricatures isn\u0027t my passion or anything, but so much of what I learned from it carries over into my own work to this day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e(also why the shouting bold caps lock?)\u003cbr\u003eTo be short and sweet, money.
