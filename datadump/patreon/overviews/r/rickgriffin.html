    "summary": "Hey there, this is Rick Griffin. You might know me from my webcomic,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.housepetscomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHousepets!\u003c/a\u003e What you might not know is that I am an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/rickgriffin\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003easpiring writer\u003c/a\u003e as well, and have plans for many, many other stories too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet Me Tell You About Stories\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far back as I can remember I\u0027ve always had a fascination with stories; I was to a degree story-starved. There seemed to be some kind of ethereal communication that was going on, that the right combination of words and ideas and places and colors and characters can inspire people to great things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have for a while now been developing a philosophy of storytelling: If I say stories are important, some may take it to mean\u00a0stories are supposed to be stuffy. If I say stories are meant to be fun, some might take it to mean stories are supposed to be\u00a0frivolous.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut stories are both these things and everything inbetween; the entire range of human experience should be cataloged--triumph and terror, love and hate, inspiration and horror, everything from the cosmic to the personal--life scales in all directions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my journey. It is also yours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStop Pretending You\u0027re Profound And Tell Me What This Means\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis platform is for my creative storytelling works--Housepets, primarily, as well as short stories, serialized novels, and longform comics (Which I am building a site for!) I hope to build my skills and tell stories that are engaging and meaningful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe above section was mainly meant to show that my interest in stories is not limited to the silly and comedic--many of my settings can be dark and oppressive, and wrestle with uncomfortable--even caustic ideas. I do believe all these things have a purpose; I\u0027m not nihilistic by any stretch of the imagination, but if you are uncomfortable with the terrible standing alongside the weird and irreverent, then follow and purchase your stories of preference individually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo What\u0027s The Deal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not financially independent. I understand that it is difficult to make a living as an artist, but I would not have it any other way. It would really help if I can get my insurance and student loan bills knocked out, however, as well as be able to afford rent on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, my lack of funds makes it difficult to increase my range of production for additional Housepets merchandise I know people would enjoy--better (and cheaper!) t-shirts, character plushes, prints of ANY comic you wish, offset print editions of the books--all these things take capital, not to mention time, which more financial independence helps create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, I will admit, I very much want to continue my education in storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHousepets will continue on as it does, 3 days per week--for the foreseeable future, most of my effort still is reserved for Housepets. Next year, after I\u0027ve built a site for all my projects, I will strive to add new, finished material every 1 to 2 weeks, in the form of new comic pages or prose chapters (sometimes illustrated!). This will include things like A\u0026amp;H Club, as well as Snakes Conquer Earth, In the New Age, Dogmen, and other stories as they develop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that will allow you to ongoing-ly support my ongoing work in bringing stories to you. When you pledge, I receive an amount you specify at the end of every month. At any time, you may change or cancel your pledge if you wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to supporting me, you also gain access to exclusive backer rewards--the details of which I am still hammering out!\u003cbr\u003e"
