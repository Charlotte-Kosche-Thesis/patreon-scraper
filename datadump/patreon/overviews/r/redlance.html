    "summary": "Good morning, good afternoon, good evening!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWherever you are in the world, no matter the time, hello! Welcome to my little corner of Patreon. If you\u0027ve found this page, chances are you either a) know me from my fanfiction, or b) have stumbled across this page because you too enjoy fanfiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing fanfiction for around 15 years, give or take a few sabbaticals here and there. Writing has been my passion for a long time and it first crossed paths with fandom back in the days of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. That was the first fandom I ever wrote anything for. And most fics I wrote then were... awful. Terrible. Truly wretched pieces that I\u0027m happy have been lost to the sands of time. However, those terrible first forays opened up an entirely new world for me and it\u0027s one I\u0027ve spent a lot of time in ever since. Improving, spreading my wings, accumulating fandoms and pairings along the way. Currently in my collection: Bechloe, Supercorp, Bering and Wells, Faberry, Brooke/Sam (from the WB\u0027s long forgotten \u0027Popular\u0027 TV show), Xena/Gabrielle, and of course, Willow/Tara.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why Patreon? What\u0027s my goal here? What I can tell you is that I\u0027m not going to be forcing people to pay for fanfic. That isn\u0027t what this is about. Everything you see on here will be put out into the ether, you just might get to see it first. My hope is to create a little community of sorts. Somewhere I\u0027ll share little bits of what I\u0027m working on, ideas and such, as well as snippets of updates for Experimentation (my current multi-chapter fic, set in the Pitch Perfect fandom) and things in similar veins. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will your donations do? Well, they\u0027ll do exactly what this website is all about: \u003cstrong\u003esupport\u003c/strong\u003e me. Each and every donation will go towards keeping me afloat day to day, providing me with an extra poking stick I can use to get that pesky stress-monkey off my back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe dream, ultimately, is to write original stories, novels, featuring my own characters and worlds, and your support will help me get there. Heck, you might even get to see that stuff develop! Until then, I\u0027ll be here. Writing fanfic for a multitude of fandoms. If that sounds cool to you and you want to drop a dollar in the bucket, you\u0027ll have my eternal gratitude. \u003cbr\u003e"
