That\u2019s why 10% of every dollar spent on the site goes into a fund which helps those people get the help they need. (I call it the Tom\u0027s Shoes model of financial planning). This 10% allows those of us in the creative world who have the means to support members of our community that don\u2019t. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I wanted to open up the pool of support to everyone, not just my clients.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u2019ve turned to Patreon to build a group of patrons from all over the world who want to support financial stability in the creative community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT I USE YOUR MONEY FOR:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now there are two main programs supported by outside funds: office hours and pay-what-you-can financial planning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ragstoreasonable.com/office-hours/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eOffice Hours:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ehave been in operation for almost a year now.
