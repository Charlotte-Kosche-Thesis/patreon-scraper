I am a YouTube creator running a deer stalking (deer hunting for my American friends) channel. Main content is my deer/wild boar/fox hunting videos, but I also create how-to type and educational content. I also show the gear I use, some DIY, share my load development process and target shooting practice. Basically, anything hunting related including field dressing and venison preparation. Although roe deer stalking is my real passion - hence the name - \u003cstrong\u003eRoeStalker\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you never heard of Patreon, here is a brief description. Patreon is a platform where fans can support creators, but it differs from other crowd funding sites as here you pledge a monthly amount you are willing to give your chosen creator.\u00a0If you like what I am doing, you can become my patron, and support me on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals and rewards.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am still going to publish free hunting videos on YouTube (currently working on a weekly schedule), but the more support I get, the better videos I create! It\u0027s that simple! However, since you are paying directly for my work, you are getting various rewards for your support such as early access to my videos and some unpublished content. You also become part of my closest community and I will listen to your feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI set up several initial milestones I would like to achieve with your help. I would like to create videos more frequently and of higher quality. Upgrade my video gear to support 4k, do more night hunt filming (invest in nightvision and thermal), I have lots of new ideas. If you can help me achieve these goals, please support me on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=9176170\"\u003eBecome a Patron!\u003c/a\u003e"
