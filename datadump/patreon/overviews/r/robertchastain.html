    "summary": "Hello Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to visit my Patreon\npage. Thank you above all for becoming a patron of the arts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m \u003cstrong\u003eRobert Chastain\u003c/strong\u003e,\na composer with a busy performing and teaching career. All-in-all, I\u2019d say I\u2019m\na freelance musician who has been blessed with the opportunities that the San\nFrancisco Bay Area has to offer. I remember telling my undergraduate composition\nteacher, Paul Richards at the University of Florida, that my career goal was to\nbe a freelance composer in a major city. Wow! I had no idea that goal would\nbring me to San Francisco (The \u201cOther Bay Area, for those of us born in Tampa\nBay). And I REALLY had no idea how that career would look. I teach for the San\nFrancisco Opera\u2019s ARIA (Arts Resources in Action) program (K-12), I taught UC\nBerkeley\u2019s Chamber Chorus as assistant director, I host concerts, I do supertitles\nfor the opera, I sing, I play the bassoon, I conduct\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen do I compose?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYeah, that\u2019s a question that burns me often. I do so much\nmusical activity to make ends meet. I mean, it\u2019s all GREAT, and it\u2019s a happy\nlife, but my craft is composition and I need to focus on it more. I am\nsincerely hoping that you can help me out with this. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo begin, I\u2019m not asking for much. I\u2019m not asking to pay the\nrent. I just need the extra cash to outfit my home studio, and I can\u2019t wait to\nshare this process with you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI know that I am asking for monthly patronage, and not per\nproject, but that\u2019s because classical music projects are HUGE! I will, in fact,\nbe sharing milestones with every project, which will result in one to four\nitems of creative property per month. These might include score excerpts,\nlibretto drafts, recording drafts, and anything else that I can think of to\nshare my creative process with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCan you imagine what it\u2019s like to be privy to the creative\nprocess\u2026 as it unfolds?! This is what it must have been like when composers of\nthe past shared their score drafts with friends and colleagues. Only now, I can\nhave a large donor base with whom I can share my ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for your patronage!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMusically Yours,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRobert \u201cBobby\u201d Chastain\u003cbr\u003e"
