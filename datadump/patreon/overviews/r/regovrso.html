My name\u0027s Arthur, I\u0027m an illustrator/comic author living in the city of Monterrey, located in northeastern Mexico. I like to draw monsters, pretty girls, and generally creepy/fantasy/indecent stuff. Sometimes I combine all five of them. Sometimes just two. I like to keep people guessing, as you can see. I also write and illustrate my own comics on occasion, something which along my side business selling Nicaraguan mustard seeds to protect you from witchcraft I hope this page will help me do more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings me to the main purpose of this Patreon. No, sadly not witchcraft. I\u0027m not a proficient spellcaster. BUT, I\u0027d like to think that I can make a semi-decent comic. I\u0027ve already made\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://espanol.wthi.one/comic/elf-queen/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eone which apparently didn\u0027t make anyone want to kill themselves by setting their computer on fire and then jumping into said fire.\u003c/a\u003e That said, I do not want to become just a \"comic artist\". I don\u0027t want to work for the Big Two. I like to have 100% creative control of my stories and the way I tell them, and for that I\u0027m hoping your support will help me keep that dream alive by covering part of my monthly expenses. In return I will do my best to keep most of my comics online and free to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOGHvfvVwAAOsgM.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page I will post work in progress shots, personal ramblings about film, comics, MMA and the occult, comic thumbnails/drafts, and some of my nsfw material that has not had as much circulation as the rest of my work. I\u0027m not a very organized person so every week/month will be a mixed bag of updates, which I hope is okay with you. I will make sure to set up rewards that make it worth your money if you decide to pledge a more substantial amount of money, nonetheless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you all in advance for both reading this and pledging your support. You are putting food on the table not just for myself but for my four \u003cdel\u003efeline sociopaths\u003c/del\u003e cats.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
