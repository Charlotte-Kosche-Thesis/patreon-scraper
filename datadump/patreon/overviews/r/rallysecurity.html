    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eRallySecurity podcast\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo us, RallySecurity means being active in rallying our community members and helping them recover and return to fighting the good fight. Each day brings news of more breaches, vulnerabilities, and bad news. Its easy to succumb to burn out, to get depressed and despondent, to feel hopeless. We wanted a place that we could lift up spirits and have a good time, as well as share knowledge and information within the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe record live each week at\u00a0\u003ca\u003etwitch.tv/rallysecurity\u003c/a\u003e and then push the episode to our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/rallysecurity\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e for archiving. In addition to video formats, we also convert each episode to mp3 and release it to several different podcast apps and websites via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rallysecurity.com/feed/podcast\"\u003eour RSS feed\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe launched the show back in October of 2016 wanting to do a couple things. We saw the Twitch as an interesting platform for creating content. Other security shows also have video content, but none really embraced the Internet of Memes to its fullest potential.\u00a0We\u0027ve all attended security conferences and had really productive conversations at the bars. We wanted to bring in other opinions and try to host those bar conversations, as well as allow a large number of folks to both listen in and contribute to those conversations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution with Patreon allows us to keep things going. Patreon contributions are a per-month basis. If you\u0027ve never used Patreon before,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\"\u003echeck this out\u003c/a\u003e for more information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou want to know where your schmeckles are going\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eSo you\u0027re thinking about throwing a couple schmeckles our way. That\u0027s cool, but I\u0027d want to know too before I tossed my precious few schmeckles into someone else\u0027s hat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, know that we really appreciate your support. \u003c/strong\u003eLike, really appreciate it.

We were excited to add Danny huge personality and keen observations in early October of 2016, and after having OscarOn as a guest, decided we had to have him on as a co-host. MzBat first appeared as a guest, and her invaluable insights and analysis was a welcome addition as she agreed to be a co-host. Ajediday has been in our chat for every episode since day one; The Tweets every Tuesday are his handiwork, and we\u0027ve made him our chat moderator and meme connoisseur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find our more about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://rallysecurity.com/about/\"\u003eeach of us on our website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
