     "description": "I can\u0027t tell you how many clients have slimmed me out of $10 dollars. To some people $10 is something easily forgotten. Earning my first $10 as an artist took years of doing work and clients not paying. Even a family member commissioned something that I would spend hours on only for them to decide on something else or just not have the money, before I\u0027d ever been paid once for my work as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also can\u0027t describe to you in full account the joy of having my first successful venture at an art festival, and have people lined up to see what I have before other people get to it first. The people who were in awe seeking to invest (sometimes as little as $10) in my work were appreciating the sacrifices I had to make to achieve my level of technical ability. It feels amazing to spend those earnings investing further in my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this goal is reached I\u0027m going to make more goals and put far more effort into this!",
