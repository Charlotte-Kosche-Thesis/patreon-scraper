Hopefully some day I\u0027d like to be able to attend gaming related events and do video coverage, as well as stream games I play, or create video reviews. I\u0027ve always provided this free to anyone who wants it, and that will never change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut sadly I could really use some help right now. I\u0027ve been homeless a number of years and recently lost my job.\u00a0Money will go towards helping me stay fed and happy enough to think clearly and creatively in order\u00a0to continue to do my podcast. Money beyond basic food costs will be split between games to play, talk about, and review, be saved for going to gaming related events to cover (and the monthly software license to create the video content), and probably honestly a bit will be saved to continue to keep myself fed and hopefully eventually move back in to a home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy sad life is very sad, but I love being creative and doing what I\u0027ve been doing. If people want to help me achieve that goal, and help me get \u0027to the next level\u0027, then I\u0027d love the help.\u003cbr\u003e"
