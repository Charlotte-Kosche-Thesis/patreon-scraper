Well, it\u2019s not a revolution of force. It\u2019s a revolution of ideas. In my estimation, the most powerful revolution a person can have is within one\u2019s own mind.

There you will find my commentaries on news and politics called, \u201cThe Special Comment.\u201d I often read these on air and then post them to read with relevant, hyperlinked sources. Additionally, I will continue my dialogue on secular humanism with my partner on this endeavor, Tylor Lovins.
