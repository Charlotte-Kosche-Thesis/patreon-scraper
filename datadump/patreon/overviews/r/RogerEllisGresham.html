In high school and college I was the creator of sets and props and those beautiful intricate backdrops that create the worlds for the actors to play.

Given MultI Million dollar Budgets the designers and directors would ask for anything and everything and it was my job to figure it out, from spray cans that turn into rocket ships, and a bag full of \u003cstrong\u003e300 skull and bones a week to be crushed and pummeled on stage\u003c/strong\u003e, to a 20 foot tall Blackamore Candelabra. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/0B3qvtdsqmq07VHVib3doSVdJNmc=w4682-h2406-iv1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI once had to create a life-size greek sculpture whose \"Leaf\"  had to pop off with a bullwhip while Opera singers performed on roller skates and at the same time I had to hand carve and create a replica of Lincolns Chair. \u003cstrong\u003eI tell you this so you understand the depth and experience I have in materials and production. \u003c/strong\u003eAt the same time I worked every extra minute at my gallery on 23rd street and a recording company art project experience me and my partners had right up the street.

I looked up as I saw many other pedestrians doing, to see the most terrifying and horrific event unfold on the giant Time Square Screen. \u003cstrong\u003eThe First tower had been hit by a plane\u003c/strong\u003e, we all stood in astonishment wondering how this accident could have happened, then more news, more attacks, and soon we were being told Time Square was a next possible Target. I told the actors to go home and headed for my shop, fortunately located in a concrete tomb in the base of the roundabout offices on 39th street. I sat in there for what seemed like and eternity and listened to the radio. Later when I went back outside I witnessed a silent and somber mob  of thousands of dust covered people slowly migrating up Manhattan island towards Central Park. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt was at that moment I realized I was not creating the Art or living the lIfe that I wanted.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took about a year to prepare but I loaded up and headed to the one city I lived in that I thought was paradise, Having attended college there many years before, Miami, Florida.

A perfect area to create art, live in peace, and still be just 30 minutes away from the beautiful art filled Metropolitan City of Downtown Miami and the new home to Art Basel, Miami Beach. I spent 6 years on that project from designing, blueprints, permits, building, and planting every single living thing until my Dream home and studio were complete. In between all those moments I studied fine art, I developed my skills, and \u003cstrong\u003eI planed for a new life where the art I create was my own.\u003c/strong\u003e Things don\u0027t always go exactly as planned, but I still followed my belief to live life as art and just when I thought I was on track and going to be free to create and focus on the art world again, fate had other plans for me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/0B3qvtdsqmq07OV9FaEJpMzRQTU0=w4682-h2406-iv1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe birth\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eof my beautiful daughter, Ella Rose\u003c/strong\u003e, became an unexpected but amazing artistic journey in itself. With this beautiful home complete I then found myself as a full time father. From sleepless nights to the first day of school,\u003cstrong\u003e I spent 24 hours a day raising this angel\u003c/strong\u003e. While walking the property with her when she was just a tiny baby, watching and explaining the process of nature as she listened and eventually learned to speak. \u003cstrong\u003eI, myself, became more enlightened during this time.\u003c/strong\u003e I began to notice the geometry and patterns of all the different life forms around me as they thrived and died. I saw ways of manipulating them using the light and shadows just like one would with paint on a canvas. I began to compile the data in my mind and mix it with the years of design and construction I had spent in what already seemed life another life. \u003cstrong\u003eUpon Discovery of sacred geometry \u003c/strong\u003eand the use of mathematics in fine art and using that geometric framework to stretch images from my imagination over I spent the next 2 years, as my daughter was learning to read and write, diving deep into the concepts of geometric armatures and any other heuristics I could use \u003cstrong\u003eto help clarify the language of my subconscious mind\u003c/strong\u003e. \u2028\u2028Now My little girl is 6, she is busy with so many things, I feel it is time to return to my long time dream of just creating and sharing my art, and\u003cstrong\u003e I invite all of you to join me now,\u003c/strong\u003e to learn from me what I have learned, to communicate with me, to inspire me as I spend the rest of my life pursuing this thing that drives me, this feeling and need to create art, \u003cstrong\u003eto think art, and all that encompasses. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkeYLcr6xLI?list=PLAPpl6B_7Wq-ICvYtW3EFq5cUiAQk17-q\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nPlease join me on this journey, \u003c/strong\u003eyou will love the ride, help fund my research and art work by pledging a small amount monthly, and in return you will receive invaluable insight, intriguing information, and loads of delight in watching me work, think, and dream. \u003cstrong\u003eYou will be rewarded for your patronage.\u003c/strong\u003e Sign up today,  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u2028\u2028Roger Ellis Gresham - Artist - Miami, Florida\n\u003cbr\u003e"
