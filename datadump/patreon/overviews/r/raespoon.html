    "summary": "Please note: All donations are in USD. I tried to adjust it to Canadian, but the don\u0027t use any other currency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rae Spoon. I\u0027m a trans/agender musician,\nauthor and podcast-creator, and I run a record label and agency. I live on\nunceded Lekwungen territory (Victoria, Canada). I\u0027m hoping for this Patreon to support\nme in sharing what I\u0027m working on with people whether or not they can support\nthat work with money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you can\u0027t support with money, but want to\nsubscribe to my Patreon feed for free downloads of home recordings, demos,\ncovers, podcasts and writing, join my Rae Spoon Patreon monthly email list for all of\nthe content that I can legally share: \u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/cAK2Df\"\u003ehttp://eepurl.com/cAK2Df\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/KITK9\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause of who I am and the type of work I do,\nI\u0027m not often supported through mainstream funding channels, so any amount\nreally helps me spend my time focusing on making stuff and helping other\nartists out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMusic:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have released eight solo albums as well as four\ncollaborative albums. I\u0027m always in some state of creating a new one, whether\nI\u0027m writing, arranging, recording or touring to support the music I\u0027m\nreleasing. I usually release a full-length album every couple of years as well\nas many collaborations in between. I also enjoy recording the odd cover and making\nup experimental pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI play lots of shows all around. I try to find\naccessible spaces to play and to play with other artists who are working with\nanti-oppression politics in mind. Often the shows are DIY and rely on local\ncommunities to happen. I try to keep the costs accessible by offering no-one-turned-away\npolicies whenever I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMusic Videos:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve made many music videos and I always love\npairing up with creative directors to add a visual element to my music. I\nusually release one or two of these with every full-length album.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPodcast: \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have a new podcast about my travels called \u003cem\u003eRae Spoon Goes Around\u003c/em\u003e. In it I explore\nthemes I encounter while I travel around playing music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWriting:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have published two books with Arsenal Pulp Press,\nalong with contributions to various anthologies. I also create blog posts and\nhave written for CBC Canada and Huffington Post. I also have speaking\nengagements through organizations and universities that I plan on posting in\nhere. I may also post drafts and other things that may not have found a home\nelsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCoax Records/Agency:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI created Coax Records to make a home for my\ncatalogue of music. Since I started it in September 2015, we\u0027ve released nine\nalbums from Concealer, Geoff Berner, LAL, E.S.L, Plastik, Abigail Lapell and\nmyself. I\u0027ve been working with many artists who don\u0027t necessarily find\nmainstream funding or music industry support, and we\u2019ve been working to build a\nnetwork for them to play shows across Canada and distribute their music. I\u0027d\nlike to grow my agency more, but as it stands I would need funding to employ\nsomeone to help me do that.\u003cbr\u003e"
