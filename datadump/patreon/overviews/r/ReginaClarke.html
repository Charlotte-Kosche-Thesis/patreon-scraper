    "summary": "Though I have written stories most of my life, and sometimes would send them off to magazines and traditional publishers, it was sporadic, intermittent, almost like a recurring dream seen and felt and then fading away. I had begun life studying and teaching English grammar and literature at a university. Life switched that about all too soon and I became a technical writer in Information Technology. If EVER there was a field I was less suited for temperamentally, that was it...but I did it for two decades, except for a few short sabbaticals in which I immersed myself with immense hope into the writing I loved, until, each time, I ran out of money. I couldn\u0027t stop writing, but I had begun to wonder whether in this lifetime I would ever find readers who cared about my characters and places and stories as much as I did. I had nine books either finished or almost finished, and no takers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then I discovered two remarkable things in 2014...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first was that traditional publishers accept 2% or less of the books offered to them in query letters. The second revelation was that Amazon had created a self-publishing platform that was not a vanity press, but a viable, extraordinary way to create books on one\u0027s own. If I had less than a 2% chance of getting my books out into the world the time-honored way, I knew I had to enter the strange, new world of independent publishing. I\u0027ve never looked back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn future posts I\u0027ll describe more of that journey that began three years ago and the amazing and generous people who shared their expertise online and helped me discover how to do it all. But first and foremost, almost as soon as I began researching the process, one name kept appearing, and it is someone I have never met, but who gave me crucial and critical information from the very beginning--\u003ca href=\"https://www.thebookdesigner.com/\"\u003eJoel Friedlander\u003c/a\u003e. The essays and articles on his website and his frequent webinars became (and still are) a passageway for me--I could go through the looking glass and bring the writing I cared about so much to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo question, being a writer is a joy. Sharing it is the gift.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Profile cover image by Brenda Clarke, Australian digital artist, who can be found \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/brenda-starr/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
