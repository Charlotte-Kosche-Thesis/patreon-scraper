    "summary": "Hello, and thanks for viewing Letter From The Frontline. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ryan Vizzions, and I am an independent photojournalist from Atlanta, Georgia. Over 6 months, between 2016-2107, I came to Standing Rock to stand in solidarity with First Nations, documenting indigenous led resistance against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota to protect the water \u0026amp; treaty rights. I ended up playing an important role in media support. Through a social media page I founded, No Spiritual Surrender, and my photos, NSS was able to amass over 270,000 followers during the resistance, and became one of the most followed ground news sources for the movement. Often times, the page was reaching over 40 million people a month. Through my photography, I was able to help amplify the voices of the movement, and help spread awareness on a worldwide scale. One photo, \"Defend The Sacred\" went viral and reached nearly 100M people in a week. After that, many other photos went viral as well.\u00a0 Having photos featured in People Magazine, Newsweek, Mother Jones, The Guardian, Amnesty International, and most recently the Nobel Peace Prize forums in Oslo, Norway, among many other outlets. In the last year, I have been able to reach nearly half a billion people through my updates and coverage of the movement. If you were following the Standing Rock movement, it\u0027s very likely you have seen some of my photography. My photos are now hanging on the same walls as some of the greatest photojournalists in history, including many Pulitzer Prize winners. I didn\u0027t come for recognition or fame. I came to stand in solidarity. Because of that, I want to use whatever recognition I received to continue the conversation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStanding Rock was by no means about me. It was about standing for the water, and First Nation rights through non-violent, indigenous led direct action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have grown very close to my friends in the First Nations, and am determined to continue to help amplify the stories, not of the movement itself, but of the people who stood for the water. Standing Rock is not my story to tell, and I want to make sure the voices it belongs to are able to have their messages heard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeginning in January of 2018, I will begin working on a book, Letters From The Frontline. The focus of the book is to travel throughout the United States, and Canada, and reconnect with many of the faces that took a stand at Standing Rock. To give them a space to speak on whatever they would like, and create a hardcover book. A mixture of letters, experiences, stories, and more, the focus of the book is to bring to life, and continue to amplify the voices of those who stood. To create a body of work that will withstand the test of time, and continue to inspire the next generation of Water Protectors and land defenders. To momentarily dissolve the cultural barriers often between us, and tell the stories of how people from all walks of life came together to defend the water, treaty rights, and ultimately take a stand for humanity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the \u0027Letters From The Frontline\u0027 is finished, for every book purchased, a book will be donated to a tribal college or First Nation family to continue the conversation within the community. Funds will be used to financially support Murdered \u0026amp; Missing Indigenous Women\u0027s programs, as well as First Nation language preservation programs. When completed, the book will be overlooked financially by a First Nation tribe to help ensure transparency. I will receive roughly 15-20% of the profits. The rest will be used for First Nation programs and uses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this sounds like something you may be interested in supporting, please head over to the rewards section to further learn the levels of support you can provide, and how you can help make this book a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all the love and support,\u003cbr\u003eRyan Vizzions\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ryanvizzions.com\"\u003ewww.ryanvizzions.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
