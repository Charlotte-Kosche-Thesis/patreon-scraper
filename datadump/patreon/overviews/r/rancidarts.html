My name is Bonny Kessinger, and I have recently chosen freelance art and illustration as a full-time occupation. As an artist with a degree in creative writing, I love getting to tell my clients\u0027 stories and reinterpreting pre-existing characters through line and color. My hope for this patreon is that maybe one day, I\u0027ll get to start telling my own stories and introducing my own characters to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m passionate about the way that art has the power to affect people and express emotions and feelings that can be difficult to vocalize. I firmly believe it to be a powerful platform for working through life\u0027s darkest corners and moments - and many people have told me this is reflected in my style. Most notably I have an affinity for gore, horror, monsters and all manner of things creepy-crawly and ooky-spooky. My absolute favorite part of my job is highlighting the elegance in the grotesque and breaking down the societal standards of beauty. I cherish any opportunity to raise up the importance of self-love and acceptance. While coming to terms with all that one is, flaws and all, can be one of the biggest challenges in the human experience, I feel it\u0027s also one \u00a0of the most important. If I, as an artist, can make that easier for even one person, I\u0027ll have accomplished more than I ever dreamed possible.\u003cbr\u003e"

Honestly it\u0027s always resided in line with my love of story-telling. That, and my love of world-building, escape and fantasy would probably also explain my love of video games and any other media used to create entire realms of escape for the brain. Along with visual art I pretty much listen to music whenever I can, and almost always when I work - and I LOVE getting suggestions from other people, so feel free to toss some my way any time!\u003cbr\u003e",
