Your patreon-age helps keep me in food and sanity whilst I write words (and videogames). Obviously, this is tremendously appreciated so THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat this campaign will support.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve recently (as of May 2017 anyway) moved my writing across to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://punchingrobots.club\"\u003ePunching Robots\u003c/a\u003e. I split my writing between two sites over there:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://robf.punchingrobots.club/\"\u003eWe Punch Robots\u003c/a\u003e, where I write more personal stuff and about being in videogames and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ttm.punchingrobots.club\"\u003eTake This Machine\u003c/a\u003e where I write about good things that interest me in the world of videogames. I aim to expose a more humane, more kind approach to being in videogames wherever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to write a fair few articles a month and then offer up a monthly round up to all those who contributed to my Patreon. That was great whilst I was hitting 5-10k words a month. As that\u0027s no longer really viable, I\u0027ll be writing one piece a month on either We Punch Robots or Take This Machine (or both if it\u0027s a good month) and maybe, maybe more if I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be lovely to get to a position where I can pay someone else to join me in my exploits over there as well but that\u0027s obviously for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eRob Who?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBefore people kinda gave them up and started making their own things because they could make their own things, I ran a site dedicated to remakes. During my time there, we held competitions that saw hundreds of games made, bolstered a library of accessible games, \u003cem\u003eshouted loudly\u003c/em\u003e about accessible games and tried to lift people up along the way. We didn\u0027t always succeed, we made some missteps, got some things wrong but it was fun trying. These days, the place is kinda mothballed outside the forum so I do most of my writing over on my personal blog, \u003ca href=\"http://robf.punchingrobots.club/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWe Punch Robots\u003c/a\u003e. I also once ran an XBLIG site but we lost that somewhere. It was great whilst it lasted, mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been called \"The Godzilla of grumbling\" by Develop, \"defiantly \nindie\" by Edge Magazine, \"an effusive individual\" by The Guardian and \"\n\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-02-21-rob-fearon-on-three-screens-and-the-truth\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea massive jerk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\" by Eurogamer. I\u0027m likely all these things but also, I hope, sort of OK really. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eOK, so how does this all work then?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made this patreon a monthly recurring thing. Anyone who punts in a dollar or more will get access to one or two monthly pieces a few weeks before they go up on Take This Machine. Obviously, I\u0027m incredibly grateful to anyone who can and does contribute more but it\u0027s not essential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSo yeah.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHi. My name\u0027s Rob and if you like the words I write, like the things I \ndo, I\u0027d be grateful for you supporting my Patreon so I can do that a whole lot more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery dollar pledged makes this writing words thing a whole lot easier and less stressful and I\u0027d be thankful for your support as would my three cats. It always comes back to cats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
