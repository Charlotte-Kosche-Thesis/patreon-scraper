    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Rihaan. Well, I\u0027m also Demontre. But on the internet, my creepy shadow pseudonym is Rihaan Shimomura.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs to what I am - I\u0027m a writer. Or an Author. Whichever is Politically Correct. I like to write fanfiction, and I have been for about ten years at this point, in my twenty-four year lifespan. I don\u0027t know the popularity of my stories, but if you\u0027re here, I qualify that as a win.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly, I write Harry Potter. I\u0027ve dabbled in other fandoms (Batman, iCarly, Life is Strange and more recently, Once Upon a Time), but the Potterverse is one I\u0027ll likely keep returning to, until the readers stop reading it. In recent years, I\u0027ve been more interested in Harry/Multi or Harem-type stories, but I\u0027ve kept smut to a minimum, in favor of the plot line. Though I try to make the erotic scenes worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so very thankful, and grateful, for anyone who decides to give to this \u0027tip jar\u0027 of mine, on a monthly basis. You have helped me so much, and I hope to continue to earn your support and love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the undecided: read some of my \u003ca href=\"http://rihaansfics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003estories\u003c/a\u003e (some are NSFW). See if you like some of them. Original fiction works are iffy, and terrifying, and while I work on that little by little, please continue to enjoy what I\u0027ve already made, and will make in the future. Of course, your fandom could be on my list of future endeavors as well. If you like what you see, think about making a donation, to let me know that there\u0027s more than just a passing interest in what I could do for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you soon, and thanks for reading.\u003cbr\u003e"
