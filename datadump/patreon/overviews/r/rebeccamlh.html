And thank you for visiting this page and for thinking about helping me pursue my dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a designer and artist. From a young age I couldn\u0027t keep pencil away from paper and I sketched constantly: fashion, animals, buildings, people... I also made constantly: stained glass, paintings, photographs, leatherwork, clothing, accessories for my dolls, collages. It seems I\u0027d have landed in art school, but things out of my control at first led me down a different career path. But the voice inside, the creative who can\u0027t keep her hands off things, kept getting louder and louder, and eventually I jumped into designing swimwear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFour years later, on the brink of making my largest swim order yet and with a screaming voice inside urging me towards building a new resort wear label and opening an atelier, I\u0027m in need of a little kickstart. \u003cstrong\u003eMy hope is that your contributions will allow me to cut back on my part time job so I have the time to complete this large order to the best of my ability and ride the momentum it brings during launch to continue growing my business.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m also going to be designing and making samples for a resort wear line focusing on easy, functional, high quality pieces, which I\u0027ll start selling online and in local markets under a new label. All this to propel me towards opening an atelier, a little studio with a showroom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s review what your contributions will help me do over the next 1-24 months:\u003cbr\u003e1. Complete a large order for a custom swimwear collection\u00a0whose momentum will ideally allow me to pursue other similar opportunities\u003cbr\u003e2. Source fabrics and make samples for a new resort wear label which will eventually absorb my swimwear label\u003cbr\u003e3. Develop a small collection to take to markets, starting small and moving my way up to Swim Week Miami and Pool Las Vegas\u003cbr\u003e4. Open a small atelier where I can effectively make and sell my clothing, swimsuits, and accessories focusing on a new type of retail and clothing experience for women\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re not in the market for a swimsuit or women\u0027s resort wear, I thought this might be a fun way to support my efforts - my dream - and hopefully enjoy the fruits of some of the other skills I have, as well as get some insider peeks into my efforts behind the scenes."
