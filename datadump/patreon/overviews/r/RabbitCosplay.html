My name is Rabbit and I have been cosplaying since 2002. Starting cosplay so long ago (At least in internet terms) has allowed me to watch the cosplay community change, grow, and progress, and has allowed me to learn so many techniques and skills throughout the years.\u003cbr\u003eOver time, I have come to realize that I enjoy teaching cosplayers skills and crafts as much as I enjoy cosplaying myself. Due to this, I started creating tutorials, running panels at conventions, and been around as much as I can to help teach.\u003cbr\u003eAlong with cosplaying, I am an avid crafter and I am currently in school to get an art teaching degree. The end goal is to open a studio where people can go to learn how to use materials they may not normally have access to. Until then, I will happily create tutorials, be around to help, and create items to help others as well.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve finally decided on opening a patreon for several reasons. First one being that it\u0027s mutually beneficial for those that enjoy my cosplays and tutorials and it allows me to ability to create so much more. Sometimes I see a design I absolutely want to make, but by the time I have the funds saved up, the desire has died down, or I forget about it completely. Being able to pull costume after costume out also allows me to the chance to create tutorial after tutorial since I tend to create them as I\u0027m making a costume. Another reason is that I have had people ask how they can thank me for teaching them and what they can do to make sure I keep teaching. Now I can point to Patreon and thank them for thinking of me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOne main reason that I am making a Patreon is so that I can feel an obligation to keep working on teaching. Every pledge, even a $1 pledge means that you are interested supporting me and seeing more works from me. This keeps forward motion in what I am doing and reminds me that I have an obligation to keep working for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
