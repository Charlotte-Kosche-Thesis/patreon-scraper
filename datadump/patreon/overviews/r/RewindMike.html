    "summary": "For the past 3 years I\u0027ve been producing videos with the intent to educate and inform people about any game or topic I see fit. There\u0027s something about discussing games, tips, and just really getting to be myself that I find in a group of gamers. I needed an outlet to discuss!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I\u0027d be able to bring at least two videos to the channel a week and continue to upgrade my whole setup.\u00a0I\u0027d love to start filming about video game topics to present them as a conversational piece. Along with an LP series, playing through random games that I\u0027ve never touched.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the research, editing, game play, writing, and recording are done by me and me alone. The process is time consuming, but it\u0027s something that I love doing and with the help of YouTube I\u0027ve been able to share that with the community. Even with this work load I still want to add more shows!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing I would love to do is bring someone else into the channel, like another editor, but all that is end game material. That will require a bit of leveling up first.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $30 tier I offer 1 of 3 shirts! If you receive all the shirt designs I have, It will default to me sending you random games for a console you own. Unless I commission more designs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand at the $50 tier you pretty much get to pick a game for me to review, with the addition of the shirt. So it\u0027s a pretty sweet combo, but since I\u0027m only one person, it\u0027s limited to only two. I can\u0027t review all the games in a month :D\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027d also find a shotgun microphone for live action filming. The camera I currently use cuts the videos into 5 minute segments. So a lot of words can be lost between the automatic cuts, making vlogs or live segments painful to film.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I can start filming about video game topics and present them as a conversational piece. Not only that but I will start up a LP series, playing through random games that I\u0027ve never touched...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis should assist in bringing me up to about two videos a week.\u003cbr\u003e",

The amount of doors that would open up and the content I could bring would rival even the best!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also the point where I can start to upgrade some of the parts in my PC to bring you game play for some of the newest game, and really smooth out streams. This rig is running on 3 years and with all the editing, rendering, and streaming. It can really leave a toll on the processor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention the costs of keeping a channel running. I might even be able to bring someone on board to help with the process of things.\u00a0",
