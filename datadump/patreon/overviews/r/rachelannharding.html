And I am one of those artists you can support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn contributing to me monthly as an artist you support defying the \"starving artist\" cliche and get a pass into my digital studio! I want you to know what is going on - the music and the stories that I create. The patrons get to come in the studio and see the things that I am working on, the things that are waiting to be worked on. I have a google doc that outlines what I am working on, where it is currently, and why I am working on it. You will have access to my schedule, my content, and behind the scenes stuff.\u00a0These are projects and personal things I want to achieve. It is the inside look at my life as an artist. If this interests you I would welcome your patronage in exchange for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
