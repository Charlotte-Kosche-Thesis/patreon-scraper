    "summary": "Red Cow Entertainment was born in 2000 when Jon Hunt and Frankie Frain began collaborating on their first independent feature film. Since then, the group has grown into a prolific producer of indie films, podcasts of all genres, web series, animations, music, books, and\u00a0hilarious reviews of food, TV, and movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all that time, Red Cow has funded its hundreds of projects with the day job earnings of its creators. The only revenue we\u0027ve ever brought in have been off the sales of our completed blu-rays and DVDs (and other merchandise that breaks even). But as our brand has grown and we\u0027ve become more well known on YouTube for projects like BoxMac, we\u0027ve been approached by die hard Red Cow fans who want to help us increase output and bring them the content they want faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we\u0027ve thoroughly proven, we will continue to make content with or without crowd funds. But if you\u0027ve enjoyed free and consistent content from Red Cow Entertainment and want to help us or thank us, we\u0027d be honored to welcome you to our Patreon. In doing so, you\u0027ll belong to an exclusive group of our top fans, and we\u0027ll work hard to bring you early content and special treats. We can\u0027t thank you enough for your fandom, let alone your dollars."
