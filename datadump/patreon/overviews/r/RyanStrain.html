    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Ryan and I\u0027m a vocalist. I\u0027m currently the lead singer for the Central European band \u003cem\u003eRecode The Subliminal\u003c/em\u003e, American deathcore band \u003cem\u003eSea of Trees\u003c/em\u003e, a contributing vocalist for Austrian metal group \u003cem\u003eC4TM\u003c/em\u003e, a guest singer for many bands, including \u003cem\u003eBuried Realm\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ePlaguestorm\u003c/em\u003e, and various solo musicians, as well as an accomplished cover artist in genres ranging from Metal to Opera, and everything in between. Phew!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSinging is my passion, and it\u0027s really the only thing I\u0027m decent at. Anyone who\u0027s been following me over the past 10 years will know that I\u0027ve always been very ambitious, but my head is also all over the place. It\u0027s been a long journey trying to decide what it is I actually want for myself and my musical career. There have been many obstacles and set-backs along the way - mentally, financially, and physically - all of which were challenging and educational. Life changes rapidly, and my personal goals have to adjust to parallel those changes and move peacefully along the same line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest obstacle for me over the years has been finding my own space to record where I\u0027m not affecting the people around me. We\u0027ve been living in apartments forever, and the vocal booth you guys helped me build served it\u0027s purpose for a while, but it never really worked as well as it should have. It barely muffled the sound, and it was pitch black inside and 180 degrees at all times. Not to mention, it was also a huge eyesore in the middle of the living room. This made recording vocals a chore. Within 10 minutes, I would be dripping with sweat, and on many occasions, I actually blacked out from the heat. \u003cem\u003e*Announcer voice*\u003c/em\u003e \"There must be a better way!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for the future is to be an established studio vocalist, aside from my full-time job at USPS, in my own house. I want to work from home, writing and recording music with bands and artists that I love. I also want to be able to invite other local singers to come and use my studio to record their tracks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, I\u0027m going to be using my father-in-law\u0027s music room to record. This means, I have to save up a bit and pad up the room with acoustic foam because the echo is so bad. Thankfully, he\u0027s generous enough to let me use his home for now, but it\u0027s not a permanent solution. It\u0027s 30 minutes away, and I\u0027m always going to feel like I\u0027m putting them out by being there, so my recordings are going to be a lot less frequent and more reserved for the important projects \u003cem\u003e(no more spontaneous covers)\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I have a real home studio in my own house, I will finally be free to do what I love, which is providing quality music to supportive listeners like you. Your monthly contributions will be deposited into a savings account, where they will not be accessed until I\u0027m ready to take the next step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR; Your monthly pledges will be used for:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuying acoustic foam and setting up my father-in-law\u0027s music room as a temporary recording space.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSaving up for a down-payment on a house.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSetting up my own home vocal studio.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePutting my voice on as much music as I can before I expire.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank all of my Patrons who have been so supportive so far, and I ask for your continued support in reaching this ultimate goal.
