    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMy \u003cdel\u003eStory\u003c/del\u003e Stories\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi, I\u0027m the Renaissance Guy, a Class-IV Restorative-Type Cyborg who occasionally writes about, among other things, what life is like as a physically handicapped augmented human, world travel, advocacy, politics, science, and general life stuff. In my travels, I give speeches and meet important people with the goal of making the world just a little bit better all around. I have won a few different awards for my writings and ramblings, which has led me to start posting my work publicly, and subsequently accepting money here to cover the costs of it. The fact that I\u0027ve done things in that order should also clue you in that I\u0027m really writing more for me than for others, although I am overjoyed that other people claim to benefit from my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0also write fiction, and create visual media, some of which is loosely based on parts of my life, but most of which is escapism based on the games that my brother, my friends, and I would play as kids. After being told that I really ought to serialize and publish, I finally accepted my friend\u0027s dare, acting on the logic that, since I would never really publish it as a proper book anyways, if only one person likes it, that\u0027s still a net gain. Never one to do things by half-measures, I also resolved that if I was going to go the route of serial author, I would also set up the corresponding crowdfunding infrastructure, on the slightly-better-than-getting-struck-by-lightning chance that someone enjoyed my work enough to fund it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, here we are\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere we are indeed. Here, by the way, in case you weren\u0027t aware, is Patreon, a platform that allows creators like me (or anyone, really\u2026 it isn\u0027t an exclusive group) to accept donations from fans, with the aim of making online creative projects financially sustainable. While there are other services like it, Patreon has the dual advantages of being focused towards online creators such as myself, and being large enough that most people and institutions trust it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you give money, you can choose to give a flat amount, or contribute per month. Once the money gets to me, I put it towards things like web hosting, honing my craft, and the incidental expenses of writing. If any is left after that (it almost certainly won\u0027t be), it goes towards paying for me medication to keep me alive. Did I mention that cyborg parts to treat medical issues are really expensive?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what do I get for becoming a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAside from my profound gratitude, there are a variety of different perks available to patrons, ranging from simple thanks to early access to new material. If you\u0027re interested, you can even select a topic for a post to sponsor. And naturally, I will add more and better perks should demand require it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
