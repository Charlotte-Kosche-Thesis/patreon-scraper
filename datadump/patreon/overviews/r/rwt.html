This isn\u2019t about \u201cgood vs evil\u201d or \u201cright vs wrong\u201d, but, instead, trying to understand why we \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/?ref_=sr_1\"\u003ecling to a hero\u003c/a\u003e, why we \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914798/\"\u003ecry at a characters loss\u003c/a\u003e, or why we totally understand how it feels to \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/?ref_=sr_1\"\u003efeel aimless in life\u003c/a\u003e. To turn our minds off and simply write off these narratives as \u201cfun\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d would be doing them a disservice. Instead, we would encourage that whenever you walk away from a movie and cannot get that \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lGrarz3MQ\"\u003eone great scene\u003c/a\u003e out of your head, or you just can\u2019t shake a feeling you received from that \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H78Go-8p1iI\"\u003etouching scene\u003c/a\u003e at the end of the film, ask yourself \u201cwhy?\u201d From there, follow the white rabbit and discover more about yourself, the film, and the world around you\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eentertainment is not mindless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEveryone who works for Reel World Theology does so on their own dime. We are all passionate about creating spaces for conversations about the entertainment that is shaping culture. As I am sure you are aware, creating content comes at a cost-- the cost of time and money. All the podcasters in the network all have brought their creativity to the table for free, but because of the listeners, we want to take things to the next level. That requires listener involvement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy any of the shows on the network (Reel World Theology, Reel World: Rewind, Home One Radio, or The Body|The Blood) please consider supporting our work. With your help we will be able to increase the quality and quantity of our content. We will also be able to launch even more podcasts and content that we\u0027ve been developing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at our donation levels and see what you might be able to contribute to keep us going. We have some great rewards that only get better at higher giving levels. I think we have some very reasonable goals and our team is so excited to get to work creating space for productive conversations and engaging culture in a way that will ultimately encourage discussions and build relationships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReel World Theology exists because you listen... Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
