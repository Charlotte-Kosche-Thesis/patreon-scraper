You are the reason why i continue to record and make episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Real Talk?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReal Talk is a podcast from the minds of piercing industry professionals on piercing and piercing culture. Each episode is centered on a common theme with a guest.We will discuss things such as piercing methods,industry topics, jewelry, and culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should i support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a supporter, we would be able to provide better content, better recording, and possibly more frequency for episodes. This podcast is important to me because it provides me the chance to get unspoken topics out to many up and coming piercers but also to experienced people in our industry. It provides a platform for topics to be discussed and enables us to have recordings of interviews of people within our industry. This also allows us to keep these recordings for future generations of piercers and our industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t you have sponsors?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe do! We have amazing companies that provide us with small donations that allow us to upgrade our space and help cover the expenses of hosting and the software we use to record. Even though we do have sponsors, each episode takes between 15-20 hours to produce. That\u0027s a lot of coffee and time taken to ensure we are putting out the great content you have come to expect from us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do you make the podcast?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason is simple. I do it for our industry. I do this podcast because I feel these topics are important to hear and i feel its valuable for the industry. I believe no matter what the situation you are in, its refreshing to hear things from others in similar situation. I also feel this is important for those that may not have the means to travel to classes, shadow others or have industry mentors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get for Subscribing?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get to be part of the topics we select. You get to be part of the variety and the reason why we put out such amazing content. You will be doing something special and meaningful.
