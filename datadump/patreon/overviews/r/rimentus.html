    "summary": "I am Rimentus, and you may know me from my Dragon Daycare comics! However I do venture a lot into other silly arts involving dragons. Also write novels as a hobby and dabble in some music production, both of which are available on my Furaffinity webpage \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/rimentus/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist, I enjoy the process of storytelling through art, through Dragon Daycare and my other creative ventures. With the exception of one novel I published awhile back (Seek and Hide) I hope to make everything else I do free for all to enjoy with no strings attached. That is why you\u0027ll see that I don\u0027t offer many rewards that other artists typically do--I believe that nearly everything I do should be free for all to enjoy, regardless if people are able to afford to support me or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause art (music, writing, visual) is my true calling. Ever since I\u0027ve left my rather unfulfilling job in a warehouse, I\u0027ve worked a nearly 7 days a week on my arts, relying mostly on my savings to maintain a roof over my head. By supporting me on Patreon, I\u0027ll be able to spend more time working on more Dragon Daycare and other webcomics, and won\u0027t have to rely so much on commissions to sustain myself financially.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will you do with the money pledged to you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I hardly spend money on purchasing art, I only use the money for basic necessities, like groceries, bills, and car fuel. Most of the savings I accumulate also goes into upgrading my equipment to improve the productivity of my arts, or replacing gears that has been faulty for some time. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eDo be aware that I don\u0027t offer all the rewards below every month.
