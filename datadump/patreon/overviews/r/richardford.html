    "summary": "Thank you for visiting Patreon page! I\u0027m going to tell you more about how this works in a minute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy this page? For me, Patreon represents two big opportunities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I struggle with creating a community musically. I love sharing music with people just like you, and Patreon is a really good way for us to share my music and other music while giving us a place to discuss it without the distractions of Facebook or Twitter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond is the part that makes Patreon different from just hosting my own website with a blog. Patreon makes it easy for you to support my music. It allows you to say how much and how often, and to only support when I publish something, without paying 80% to a big company like Apple or Amazon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that sense, it\u0027s an experiment for me. Can it become a source of real income to support my dream? We\u0027ll see! That\u0027s what you\u0027re considering is, will I be part of supporting Richard\u0027s Music Dream? And that\u0027s pretty cool that you\u0027re considering it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does it work? I\u00a0create 2 to 4 pieces of music per month. These will be songs or instrumentals. You choose what to pay per piece. You can set a monthly limit. A fantastic way to support me is by grabbing the \u003cstrong\u003e$3 Reward\u003c/strong\u003e. Based on the level you chose, you\u0027ll get certain pieces exclusively here and you\u0027ll get everything first. I invite you to sign up at the level that really works for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t forget the pledge is per piece, so if you want to limit how much you spend per month just say that when you sign up (it\u0027s at the end of the signup process).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2016 was a great year!\u003c/h3\u003eThese were my highlights of the year:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"Re-composed\" the 1st and 3rd movements of Beethoven\u0027s Violin Concerto for choreographer Rebecca French/Ash Danceworks for 3 nights in Houston (Had a great time collaborating with John Edward Ross)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eComposed and premiered a new, commissioned orchestral score for the classic, silent sci-fi film \"Voyage to the Moon\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrote a bunch of theatre songs and film cues\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTaught a bunch of kids to compose music and make their own films\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMy plans for this year\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRelease THREE albums: a concept album of songs from my new musical \"The Prisoner,\" an album of my film music, and an album of electronic songs\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePerforming live\u00a0(scary, right?)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProfessional workshop of \"The Prisoner\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe pieces will be available as albums and you\u0027ll get them as part of your support here.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThank you, thank you, thank you!\u003c/h3\u003eThanks for checking out my Patreon page!
