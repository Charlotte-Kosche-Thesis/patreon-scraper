I like painting on boards, and\ncanvases, but I also like painting on dolls. Really, though, \u201clike\u201d isn\u2019t the\nright word. I feel compelled to make art. Which I do, every day. Sometimes from\nbefore the sun rises until long after it sets. As my patron, you\u2019ll have a\nwindow into my daily activities. Which means what, exactly? Work in progress\nshots, mostly, along with discussions of the techniques I\u2019m using in each.\nInsights on materials. So basically, my feed is one never ending tutorial.\nSometimes about drawing, painting, or whatever else and sometimes about dolls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nReally,\nthough, the techniques I use in each are the same. So even if you\u2019re really\nonly interested in one kind art, there\u2019s still plenty to benefit you. And, of\ncourse, I take requests: for tutorials, for information associated with my work\nlike what colors am I using, etc., and for finished artwork!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSee\nyou on the other side.\u003c/div\u003e"
