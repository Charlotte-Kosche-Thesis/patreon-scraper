Originally from Brooklyn, NY, and of first\ngeneration Russian-American decent; Rami has been writing, producing, and composing in the New York City\nmetropolitan area since 2011, and began singing in 2015.

He started playing piano and\nguitar, as well as acting and dancing at the age of 8. Rami became a DJ when he was 13, applied his knowl-\nedge of music and composition, and started producing his own original tracks shortly after. He teamed up with\nfriends, and has played some of the best clubs in New York, such as Webster Hall, Pacha and Stage 48. He\ngained support of Botnek, on his original track \"Trip\", that was released by Pyro Records in early 2015. In\nMay he remixed Major Lazer\u0027s \"Too Original\" before completing his first LP release, \u201cMeet On 32nd Street\u201d\nthat features several EDM tracks, as well as pop / rock tracks and a unique \u201dsofter\u201d sounding \u201cInkwell\u201d. Includ-\ned as a bonus track is the theme for \u201cReaching Equilibrium\u201d, a documentary that Rami produced the score\nfor and mixed all of the tracks for the record in September of 2015.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHaving dozens more tracks completed for future release; Rami went to his journal of life experiences and\nlyrics to create a new variety of songs that feature his vocal abilities. In late 2015, he completed a 9 song pop\nalbum, as singer, songwriter and music producer that is expected to release by fall of 2016.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRami sets his sights high, works hard in pursuit of his dreams and sets no boundaries on what he intends to\naccomplish. Rami will be showcasing his new music and performance in late summer of 2016, and throughout\nthe remainder of this year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e",
