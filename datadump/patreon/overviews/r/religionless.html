    "summary": "For 11 and a half years I worked full time as a pastor. During that time, I began to rediscover the concept of God, spirituality, religion, and everything in between, and found myself in a place of deconstruction that, honestly, was more than a little bit lonely. My questions forced me to rethink and overhaul my theological views on everything ranging from the nature of humanity, to the nature of God, to the nature of hell, and I eventually resigned my position, in order to speak, write, and author full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I\u0027ve noticed that so many are in this very same place, and while they are happy to leave behind old paradigms, and discover new ones, leaving behind the community they once experienced through church, can be extremely difficult. Some who are even still a part of local churches find themselves lacking in this area, as they\u0027ve come to feel isolated because of their beliefs. \u003cem\u003eReligionless\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is an attempt at speaking directly to this need. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may no longer hold to certain evangelical beliefs, or you may just be questioning and deconstructing, or, you may have gone all they way, and left Christianity, religion, and God, behind altogether. Or none of these categories might describe you, and perhaps you\u0027re just seeking community, but are uncomfortable with traditional forms of church. Religionless is meant to be an online community where you fit in, belong, and are included, regardless of where you are on your journey. It is a safe place to ask your questions, vent your frustrations, tell your story, and just be the authentic, religionless \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003ethat you are\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Yes, we will still be coming at things from the angle of a progressive, Jesus-centered Christianity, but everyone from the atheist, to the agnostic, to the fundamentalist is invited. So long as we all play nice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be launching a podcast, and putting out videos, all aimed at speaking to those who are in this place, but perhaps most importantly, we will be creating an online community via Facebook, where you can have real conversation, with real people, about real issues. I will be sharing audio, video (pre-recorded \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003elive), interviews, and articles in this group, that I will not be sharing anywhere else, all with the intention of helping you journey the religionless journey, and experience Jesus in the context of authentic community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do need your help to get it done, though. I will not be charging any fees to be a part of this group, or to view, listen to, or read the content. I want to keep it free, to ensure as wide an audience as possible is able to get in on it. That said, in order to do this well, and have it be up to the standards I want it to be up to, it\u0027s going to require a lot of time on my part. I work a full time \"secular\" job, at present, in addition to the writing, travelling and speaking I do. I would \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to be able to devote my full time to overseeing this community, however, and to be constantly putting out the sort of content those on this journey desperately need. If you would consider becoming a monthly patron, it would help to put us one step closer to making that a reality! I know it\u0027s a long shot, but if we could reach our goal of $2,500 a month, we could do this with zero problems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your generosity, your support, and just for being plain awesome. I love you all, and can\u0027t wait to walk the Religionless path with you!"

     "about": "For the last several years, I have given the majority of my time to writing, blogging, and travelling to teach the message of a non-violent God, the end of \"religion\", and helping believers question and challenge their present paradigms. It has been a joy and a pleasure, and something that I intend to continue doing for as long as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, though, it can be a bit of a strain financially at times. Doing this work full times requires large chunks of time for doing research and study, and the same for writing, whether it be blogging or working on book projects. I\u0027m also travelling most weekends to teach at conferences, in churches, or in home groups. In addition, simply answering the emails and private messages I receive can be a full time job in itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work is truly the joy of my life, and there is nothing I enjoy more. My aim and goal is to keep this my full time work so that I can pour the time into providing the best and most well researched resources possible (for me, anyways). I am, however, a husband and father of 3, and so have to look beyond what I wish to do, and to what\u0027s practical. My desire is to make this work of speaking, writing and resourcing those rethinking their beliefs, my full time occupation and give it my full attention, without needing to work multiple jobs. I want to remain accessible to those needing help, and keep the resources we provide sharp and on the cutting edge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to do this, we need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make your support worth your while, there are several new services I will be providing, starting in late September:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- A new podcast\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- A new blog\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- Bi-weekly videos\u003c/div\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIn addition, there are other services we\u0027re aiming to begin offering this fall as well, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- Month long courses for churches or home groups with mid week gatherings, either in person or via Skype\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- Skype or phone coaching session for those in the process of deconstructing or rethinking their theology, experiencing burnout, or just needing someone to help walk them through the process of questioning, etc. This is also something that could be done for a group.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(It would actually be my desire to offer the above services free of charge to church groups and pastors, but that wouldn\u0027t be possible without a support base.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we will be able continue this work full time, giving it our full attention and providing you with the best, most cutting edge services and materials possible. If you have enjoyed or benefited from my books, blogs, videos, teachings or live events, please consider supporting this campaign so that we can get this message to as many as possible. I love and appreciate you all so much.",
