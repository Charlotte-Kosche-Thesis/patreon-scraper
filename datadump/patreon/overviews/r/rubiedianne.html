    "summary": "yo-yo\nfuture devotees! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started my yoga, van life, and farmer journey\nroughly 3 years ago. I started yoga because I was struggling with depression\nafter exiting an abusive relationship. I bought Frida a 1987 Volkswagen Vanagon\nafter I completed my yoga teacher training based on a \"50\nThings-To-Do Before I Die\" list written as homework during that\ntraining. I look at that list and said to myself, \"What do I think is the\nimpossible thing for me to accomplish this year?\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI skimmed the list and read \"Sell\neverything and live in a van for a year.\" Laughing to myself sitting in my\ndowntown apartment I thought \"Yep, that\u0027s the one.\" So then began the\njourney of shopping for a van, to which I found a good deal on a rebuilt VW\nVanagon in Washington state. Bought a one-way plane ticket over a long weekend\nand flew up to get Frida. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEver since I have been in love with the van life\nand over the next few months after getting her I sold, gave, and threw away a\nbunch of shit. The challenge was to live as minimal as possible, use the extra\ncash for travel, and hold down a full-time 9-5 job in the process. That was in\n2015, and I successfully did so for 4-months until I moved in with my\nboyfriend. \"Wa-Wa.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYeah, I wasn\u0027t true to my 365-day van life and I\nhated myself for it. So I bought up all the shit I just dumped in a hurry to\nshack up. Did I ever hate that IKEA trip and boy did I argue with him the\nentire time! I wasn\u0027t happy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFast forward roughly 10-months later, we broke\nup. And I went back to the van life. The running joke among my professional\nfriends had become, \"You\u0027re doing, well right? I mean you\u0027re not living in\nyour van anymore down by the river?\" I was happy to again say, \"Well\nyeah actually I am.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis past summer I started my first urban farm\nroughly 6,000 square feet of various herbs and weeds that I proudly planted,\nwatered, and harvested to craft natural beauty products. This venture is  \u003ca href=\"http://www.firstmotherfarms.com/\"\u003e First Mother Farms\u003c/a\u003e (FMF) where we\nbroadly define the word \"farm\" to include the cultivation of\nintangible products like mental health, peace, and equity. We inspire mental\nwellbeing through the cultivation of inner peace and social equity. We inspire\nplant-based wellness through the sustainable farming of herbs and native weeds.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing a farmer in the age of Amazon is no easy\ntask! And guess what? I fundraised more money through donations then I did\nactually selling any products! So, this season, I won\u0027t be wasted valuable\ntime producing products that don\u0027t sell at the end of the day. I will be\nsharing the lessons learned from my farming, van living, yogi lifestyle while\ncontinuing to free myself from the societal stereotypes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have been toying with the idea of\nquitting your job, getting out of debt, living like a nomad or generally\ntelling stereotypes to go-fuck-itself well FMF is the place for you.\u003cbr\u003e"
