    "summary": "Hey everyone! Thanks so much for checking out our Patreon page. My name is Chris Sanders and I founded the Rural Technology Fund because I\u0027m from a rural area and I know the challenges students like me face when trying to get ahead. I created the RTF to introduce rural and high poverty students to the opportunity that tech jobs represent. Computer jobs are often high-paying, can be worked remotely from anywhere, and have the ability to bring families out of generational poverty and revitalize rural communities that were once thriving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe work with passionate teachers to equip their classrooms with resources to get kids interested in computer and engineering technology. We donate things like Raspberry Pi\u0027s, Ardunios, robotics kits, circuit kits, snap circuits, ozobots, and more. We also help building school-wide maker spaces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read more about our mission and background here: \u003ca href=\"http://ruraltechfund.org/mission/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://ruraltechfund.org/mission/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow successful have we been?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, we\u0027ve been able to put technology into the hands of over 50,000 rural and high poverty students. We want to grow that number to 100,000 by 2020. But, we need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read more about our impact here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ruraltechfund.org/impact/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://ruraltechfund.org/impact/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I help\u003c/strong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eEvery $2 you contribute helps us put technology education resources into the hands of another student. By contributing on a regular basis, you\u0027ll help ensure we\u0027re able to continue changing lives by providing opportunity to rural and high poverty students. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy using our Patreon page you can get connected with our progress and read thank you letters from students who receive benefit from your contributions.
