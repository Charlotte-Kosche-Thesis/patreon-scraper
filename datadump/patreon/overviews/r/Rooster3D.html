If you\u0027ve arrived here on purpose, then you\u0027re likely a fan or supporter of Arma 3 or other military-themed games, GI Joe and other \u002780s toys, or 3-D Game Development - or perhaps you know me in person. If you\u0027re just curious and want to see what\u0027s going on, then stay a while and find out what this growing site might have to offer you. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(200, 0, 0);\"\u003eELABORATION\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy current focus is creating game assets inspired by GI Joe toys from the \u002780s and \u002790s. This content includes vehicles, characters, uniforms, gear, equipment, weapons, and structures. So far, the majority of production has been in vehicles, and many are in working stages within the game. I have made a couple of helmets working in-game, but there are other helmets and gear I have started and am still trying to find time to get to. My hope is that I will gather enough Rooster3D Patrons to fund producing the 3-D game \ncontent at a more dedicated pace. The more patrons subscribe, the more people I \ncan hire to help, including artists, programmers, video editors, foley artists, actors, and testers. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://t00.deviantart.net/z4XsLXRUWbQuw84zdi3keWIHBQ0=/fit-in/700x350/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/a01b/th/pre/i/2018/109/3/2/cobra_assets_on_tanoa_by_rooster3d-dby7gq7.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 350px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tArma 3, with its military setting, serves as a great foundation for a GI Joe-inspired game. If you are not exactly a fan of GI Joe, don\u0027t worry! The assets are unique apart from the vanilla Arma 3 content, and they have been refined for a more realistic function than they had as toys, in comics, and in cartoons. The result will provide gamers with alternative tactics to bring to the fight. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf the project stays with Arma 3 and its engine, called Real Virtuosity, then the final content will be available for free download. If the project becomes a full-fledged, AAA stand-alone game, then a couple of things will occur. First, it will require a price tag to pay for the huge amount of people involved. Second, it will most likely move away from the Real Virtuosity engine to something more up-to-date, more reliable, and easier to work with - probably Unreal Engine 4. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tEither way, this does not change what patrons are getting from this site, as spectators to the development process. The value you get here is more akin to the bonus features you get from buying a deluxe version of a video game, blue-ray, or DVD - a sort of infotainment purchase, but with the added benefit of watching it unfold as it happens. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://t00.deviantart.net/ZzPBAgB2BHVTKsVAcHIMXMc-Tlw=/fit-in/700x350/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/bafa/th/pre/i/2014/250/7/a/rooster3d_by_rooster3d-d7ye280.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 281px; height: 350px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(200, 0, 0);\"\u003eROOSTER3D\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThroughout my career, I had been a Web Graphic Artist, \nspecializing in Flash Animation and Web Design. To distinguish my 3-D artwork from my mostly digital 2-D career work, I produce models under the name Rooster3D. Using 3D Studio Max for \n3-D creation, I create vehicles, characters, props, weapons, and structures from scratch for real-time \napplications such as video games. I have created assets for Unreal \nTournament 2004, Battlefield 2, Crysis/Crysis Wars/Crysis 2, and ArmA 3.\n\tThe irony of having a 2-D logo for my 3-D artwork does not escape me. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(200, 0, 0);\"\u003eABOUT ME\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tCurrently,\n I am a stay at home dad of two girls, and I have managed to develop a \nroutine giving me pockets of time for my artwork. My goal is to raise a \nlittle bit of extra income to help take care of the bills and provide \nfor them. We are not a charity case, though, and my wife makes a good \nenough salary to provide. This is more of a personal thing for me, as a \nman, to make sure she doesn\u0027t feel like she is shouldering the entire \nfinancial burden of the family.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI am also a veteran of the US Army Reserves, with real-life training and experiences to pull from when developing these military assets. As such, you know the assets I present, even if fictional, have their roots in reality. Finding the balance between sci-fi, mil-fi, and IRL can be elusive, and I hope to develop unique vehicles and technological devices that are at least plausible. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBy becoming a Patron to my project, you can take comfort in knowing you \nsupported a God-loving family man and veteran dedicated to providing a little extra \nincome for his family. I aspire to make\u00a0 content that\u0027s either entertaining, \nuseful, fun, informative, interesting, or any combination of these.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPraise Jesus for you! May this endeavor bring Him glory, and may this be the primary reason for moving forward. So it is. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for stopping by!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
