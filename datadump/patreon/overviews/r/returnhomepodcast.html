It is fully produced, in \nstereo sound, to make you feel like you are part of the action. It tells the story of Jonathan Barker, who returns to his home town of Melancholy Falls to unravel the mystery of what his home town has become\u2026or has always been.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnofficially, Return Home is a passion project from a group of people who wanted to do something fun. We\u0027ve always loved audio dramas, and thought we would try our hand at it. We wanted to make something we would listen to, and have a good time doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReturn Home isn\u0027t from some big production company, nor does it have any sort of corporate backing. Instead, we are a two producers who are working hard on it because we believe in it.\u00a0 That includes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eJeff Heimbuch\u003c/em\u003e - The stories come from his brain. He writes every episode, records the actors, and then edits it togethe\u003cem\u003er.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eKori Celeste\u003c/em\u003e - The musical mastermind. Every piece of music you hear on the show is composed specifically for it by her.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIn addition, we have a whole host of amazing actors who have graciously provided their vocal talents, including Forrest Orta, Alyssa Rittorno, BJ Grip, Cleve North, Bridget Farmer, Clarence Leonard, Taylor Thorne, Paulina Logan, David Doris, and many more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we do have a small, dedicated team working on the show, we are all doing it sans paycheck. If anything, we do lose a little bit each show. As people with a desire to create, we are completely OK with that. We\u0027re not begging for money, and we will continue to do the show regardless of receiving any sort of monetary gain, because we love doing it. That said, everyone involved in the show is working for free, sometimes traveling some distance in order to do so. We would love to help off-set some of the cost of producing the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEXTRAS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExclusive access to early release episodes, Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s with the creators, free/cheaper tickets to live performances, and things written just for Patrons. We really want to make sure that you get the most out of your pledge every month. We appreciate you supporting us, and we want to show our thanks the best we can.
