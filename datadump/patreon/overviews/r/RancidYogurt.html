My name is Sherry Cotton and I want to create fun and cute cartoons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RancidYogurt/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFACEBOOK\u003c/a\u003e // \u003ca href=\"http://rancidyogurt.storenvy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eONLINE STORE\u003c/a\u003e // \u003ca href=\"http://thingsthatiwontfinish.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTUMBLR\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tEver since I was a child, I\u0027ve had a huge interest in anime and cartoons. My parents have always encouraged me to draw and create my own characters and artwork after seeing how immersed I was with television characters. Now that I\u0027m older, I try and find inspiration and influences from everything around me. My hobbies include toy collecting and cosplaying, as I enjoy to surround myself with cute and happy things, and dressing the part too!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve attended Sheridan College for \nArt Fundementals, Visual and Creative Arts and Animation, however, that \nroad didn\u0027t work out for me. I found myself being able to take what I \nlearned and the friends that I made and turn it into something new and \npositive and I couldn\u0027t be happier. I feel like I\u0027m in a good place in \nmy life and that now more than ever is the time to get serious about my \nartwork.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027d like to really push making colourful and fun artwork that people of various ages can enjoy. I want to create artwork people will be proud of hang up in their homes, to wear and to carry around with them. I\u0027m always up for trying new directions with my artwork, but when it comes down to it, I want to make things that I like and I am happy to work on.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where YOU come in!\u003c/strong\u003e When you pledge me, you help me spread my wings and grow as an artist to make more shirts, get things printed, expand my inventory and convention budget. A huge dream would be travelling outside of the Toronto area to sell at new conventions. An even bigger dream would to be get my products into local shops, or have a small studio place.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRight now I\u0027m struggling through debt from moving to the big city, and I have to get dental surgery done.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m not able to take the risks I would like when it comes to creating because of constant payments on my card and trying to save up to have some of my teeth removed.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e~A brief History on my Art~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve been all over the place with my art, having won a small art contest in my home town at the age of 16, following up with winning an award at the student art show later that year. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy second year of college, my Lady Gaga fan art was apart of an art exhibition at the Reflex Gallery in Paris, France, called \n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027The Gaga Experience\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e. Alexandra who set up the exhibition later published my work in her fan created book \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027The Secret World of Lady Gaga\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs of recently, you may be familiar with my work through Huniecam Studio available on Steam! I helped create fun new characters such as Nadia, Zoey and Sarah just to name a few! I also helped dress and colour old favourites like Beli, Aiko and Tiffany.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

     "description": "So here is the looming operation I have been putting off. The surgery is to remove my 2 bottom wisdom teeth. The reason for the huge expense is because I need to see a specialist. Unfortunately, they have grown in completely sideways, and therefore will cost more to take out. We did the estimate for the total surgery and it was around $1,900, without taxes. I\u0027ve had my wisdom teeth since I was a teenager, and they cause me pain on and off, sometimes to the point where I can\u0027t eat. They are rotten, and cause my breath to constantly smell awful and food constantly get caught in the gums around them. Even after brushing my teeth, I can still smell it in my head. Please let me get rid of these awful problems.\u003cbr\u003e",
