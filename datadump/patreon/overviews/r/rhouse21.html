My family didn\u0027t have the means to buy me any of the good stuff, so I took apart anything I could find around the house to build all sorts of little creations. This inspired me to go to MIT and become an engineer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make cool videos that inspire young people (and the young at heart) to explore the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. I want to show them that the same concepts that allow you to build a high performance RC car can also enable you to build a real car, or aircraft, or electronics system, or anything their imagination can conjure... if they set their minds to it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying to create a community for the \"RC Speed Geek\" who wants to look a little deeper into why thing work (or don\u0027t work). I use my RC cars as teaching tools for a variety of physics/engineering concepts... and for just plain high speed fun!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome on in and watch me break stuff, fix it, and break it again! You might even learn something along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little math never hurt anybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help to grow my on-line community. Feel free to cruise the content, learn, and tell me what you think. My goal is to eventually partner with High School \u0026amp; College STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) programs to make videos that help augment their lesson plans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease support the cause and share with anyone you feel may want to feed their inner \"\"RC Speed Geek.\""
