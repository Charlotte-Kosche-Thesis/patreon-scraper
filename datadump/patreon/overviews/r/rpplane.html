    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we and what is Red Paper Plane about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_9000,w_1200,f_auto,q_auto/v1/4213/GSG_9872_copy_qc2yei.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are Tsveti and Georgi - a Bulgarian couple with two kids, Sonny (5) and Annie (4). Together with all the usual challenges of raising two kids, we felt the need to spend as much quality time as possible with them. This meant two things - \u003cstrong\u003ewe wanted to give them skills, not just play time, and we wanted to have fun with them, too!\u003c/strong\u003e Completing a puzzle or drawing a picture together felt OK the first couple of times, but then it kind of got boring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe started researching more about early childhood development and found out that it is actually the best period for learning and creativity... in our entire life! At the same time, very few children games, toys and activities currently available on the market truly match the learning abilities and brain potential at this age and stimulate essential 21st century skills like problem solving, empathy, co-creation and teamwork. So we saw an opportunity and decided to do something about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nArmed with our experience in innovation consulting for adults and our love of Maria Montessori\u0027s principles, we decided to \u003cstrong\u003eadapt the design thinking method for 3-6 year olds\u003c/strong\u003e. Kids transform every situation in our daily lives into a learning experience, so we decided to engage them in a whole process, not a one-off activity. Because later in life, this is the way artists, designers, architects, engineers, developers, teachers or entrepreneurs live, work and solve problems in new and exciting ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the summer of 2015, together with our son and co-creator Sonny, we created\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.rpplane.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRed Paper Plane\u003c/a\u003e - a new type of learning game for the whole family. It consists of missions\u003c/strong\u003e - challenge-based activities that last 20 minutes per day for several days ahead. The missions take us on a journey to solve challenges together in a useful and enjoyable way \u2013 with your child as the chief pilot and you as the trustworthy navigator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA mission goes through a 3-step process - (1) Observe and remember, (2) Select and prototype and (3) Create and present. Going through the process and not focusing on the end result is what actually matters in our missions - \u003cstrong\u003ethe more you play them, the better they (and your children) get\u003c/strong\u003e. Of course, a 3-year old will do it differently than a 6-year old, but that\u0027s OK - we only provide a framework, basic steps and some guidance. The missions can be enjoyed with your own pace and style. In addition, each mission ensures repeatable play - it can (and most probably will) be played a number of times in a row and each time with a unique outcome. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhere are we now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://bagra.bg/Covers.png\" style=\"width: 592px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo far we have developed \u003cstrong\u003e15 different missions\u003c/strong\u003e, providing a different take on the world through the eyes of someone \u201cdesigning\u201d and accomplishing things (\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/RPP-Mission-FamilyDoctor-EN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMission: Astronaut\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/RPP-Mission-Chef-EN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMission: Head Chef\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/RPP-Mission-Cartographer-EN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMission: Cartographer\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/RPP-Mission-FamilyDoctor-EN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMission: Family Doctor\u003c/a\u003e, etc.). Each month a new mission is available as a free PDF download from our website. Families from more than 70 countries all over the world download our missions on average 2000 times a month. They are currently available in Bulgarian, English and Brazilian Portuguese, with more languages coming soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe missions are intentionally gender neutral and can be played without adaptation in families with different social and economic backgrounds. Among our first fans were kids and parents from Uganda, Ghana, South Africa, India and at the same time countries such as Sweden, Canada, UK and Australia. The majority of our parents are designers, creative professionals and Montessori parents - people who rely on the great power of a process behind their day to day working challenges.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have an amazing media coverage in Bulgaria. We were also recently featured in a number of leading blogs and sites such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.swiss-miss.com/2016/01/missions-for-your-little-one.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSwissmiss\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fatherly.com/red-paper-plane-learning-games-turn-life-into-missions-1585836632.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFatherly\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dadsanddesign.com/play/a-new-game-that-encourages-kids-to-think-like-designers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDads in Design\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do we want to go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://bagra.bg/Collage.jpg\" style=\"width: 506px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRed Paper Plane is slowly, but steadily becoming a primary occupation for us, even though we currently don\u0027t make any money from it. Judging from the amazing feedback from families, kids and learning centres which adapt our missions, there is great potential in continuing out work forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWe are currently publishing a brand new mission every month - and we want to keep it that way!\u003c/strong\u003e In order to do that, we need to make Red Paper Plane self-sustainable and generate enough revenue to at least cover our efforts for researching, developing and creating the missions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe tried experimenting with \u003cstrong\u003eMission: Eskimo/Inuit\u003c/strong\u003e - a paid, physical mission box for a whole month of fun and adventure. Together with the mission itself, the box contains a varity of booklets, learning materials and specially designed games for different activities. Our biggest lesson from piloting a mission box was the enormous amount of time to research, compile and design the whole thing - it\u0027s painstaking work that cannot survive on our spare time alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are also currently in the process of \u003cstrong\u003eadapting the missions for educational environments\u003c/strong\u003e - kindergartens, play centres, children museums, etc. But this is a whole different project altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nIn short - we would love to be supported by passionate people who want to engage their children, nieces, nephews and grandchildren in a new and meaningful way, so we are able to publish a new mission each month for a whole year ahead!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nHow are we going to use the funding?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe set up an initial goal of $1,000 a month. This will enable us to cover the following things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDesign and development\u003c/em\u003e - we create the contents ourselves and design the missions ourselves, with occassional support from friends in illustration, editing, social media and PR. It would be great if we can afford to use additional external support.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eHosting \u0026amp; website fees\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0- we use the Strikingly platform and it\u0027s been amazing so far, but the Pro option costs money.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003ePrototyping materials\u003c/em\u003e - we always make several iterations before publishing a mission, which takes time and resources.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eMarketing and promotion\u003c/em\u003e - we use social media promotion tools as a way of spreading the word about the missions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is more or less all we need right now. It would be great if you decide to jump on board!\u003cbr\u003e"
