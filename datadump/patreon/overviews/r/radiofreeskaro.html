We\u0027ve interviewed dozens of the cast and crew, attended conventions, and provided commentary and opinion on all eras of \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e history.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, we\u0027ve had many people tell us they\u0027d like to give us money to help out with the podcast. How nice of them! But, really, how could we possibly \u003cem\u003echarge\u003c/em\u003e money to talk about a TV show we love so dearly? Well, we can\u0027t in good conscience, because we\u0027re Canadian, and we try to be humble. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you\u0027re enjoying the show and you want to chuck a dollar or two in the Patreon tin, we\u0027d genuinely appreciate it. Server fees are a monthly reality, and we do try to get the best audio equipment we can. We want to make sure Radio Free Skaro sounds as good as it possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are currently no special rewards for people who pay more, no higher tier of listeners to whom we will cater. We\u0027ll continue to do this show every week with the same amount of passion and joy as we\u0027ve always done, and we hope you all enjoy it enough to listen. Whether you want to kick in some cash or use your Consumcard, credit bars, or narg notes while doing so, is entirely up to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
