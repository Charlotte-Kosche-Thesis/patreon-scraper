    "summary": "Rivera-Sennett treasures the communal ritual of watching a movie. Our\u00a0films are meant to be seen in a dark, dingy theater where the image flickers, the AC roars, and leg room is scant. We want to make films for small movie houses, to hold on to the fulfilling experience of watching a movie with others around you. We invite you to join us in creating work that brings people together in the dark.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCollaboration\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRivera-Sennett is our signature (Matthew Rivera and Evan Sennett) because our work is the product of a hyphenation. When we met in the 7th grade, nearly a decade ago, we both knew we wanted to make films. We learned how to make movies side-by-side, so it was only natural that our tastes and visions aligned. The individual parts of our operation can never equal the whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f2370ee4b0d588cece5d2b/t/5958423c03596e73b4fc2605/1498956387273/?format=500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve gone on to make eight films together that have played around the world in the U.S., France, England, Russia, Brazil, Israel, India, the Dominican Republic, Spain, Canada, Belgium and Serbia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough middle school, high school and now at separate colleges, we have managed to make films. We\u00a0always have a new project in the works, and we love having more to work on than we can manage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProcess\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile digital filmmaking offers many beautiful options, our work thrives on 16mm film. Black and white 16mm shapes our process. Due to its expense, we are forced to make deliberate decisions, and to prepare extensively before shooting. Film disciplines our work because we have to get it right on the first or second take.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first expense we encounter is purchasing film stock. We shoot our\u00a015 minute short films with about 55 minutes of film (5 400ft. rolls) which runs at around $500.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f2370ee4b0d588cece5d2b/555a5a01e4b0aff6c9e3a566/555a5da8e4b0b0825df19408/1431985577064/P1001644.JPG?format=750w\" style=\"width: 428px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we\u0027ve shot the film, the most expensive step is scanning it in very high resolution so that we can edit it on a digital platform. A 2k scan of 55 minutes costs around $1000. The image maintains a glorious look through this transfer, rendering out a razor sharp texture and a soft, rich palate of gray tones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we transfer the finished film back to a 16mm projection print and the movie is ready to be shown the way it is meant to be seen. This is the final expense, a cost of $150 for a 15 minute short.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1508037_938937506146207_9108385721625904595_n.jpg?oh=5f864f3fce309621451e0878fdb21b73\u0026amp;oe=5AB3F578\" style=\"width: 435px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe process is long, arduous and expensive, but it makes us closely consider every decision making our films and gives them a bigger than life presence on screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInvest\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2012, we have made one short per year. We are different from most Patreon video makers because we aren\u0027t releasing work on a monthly or even weekly basis. The time and labor that goes into making one of our films is a slow-going process. We make movies to have lasting value rather than immediate appeal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, we\u0027re working on a series of films called \"The Ballad of Lucky Lucifer,\" which will be a feature length series of shorts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur work would be impossible to make without the contributions of other artists and investors. The biggest challenge is the constant stop-and-go routine of finishing one film and starting a new one from scratch. With your patronage, we can continue creating with fewer obstacles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you will receive regular updates on the progress of our films, as well as exclusive first looks at the final product. As long as you contribute, your name will be in celluloid at the end of each film we make! Most importantly, you will be part of our trusted community and investing in the beautiful experience of going to the movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like our work, and want to become involved in realizing its creation, become a patron. It allows us to continually make our films, while you continually invest in them. We\u2019re immensely grateful to everyone who has contributed so far. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
