    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Rachel Welton. I\u2019m here to yell about stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been writing all manner of nonsense since I was a wee gal, but this year, I\u2019m getting serious about my nonsense. By supporting me, you\u2019ll help me become a professional writer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight now, I spend my days working as a seamstress. This takes a decent amount of time and an even larger portion of my attention, so your support will let me spend more time finishing manuscripts, submitting stories, and learning about the wild world of fantasy and young adult publishing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBeing a philanthropist feels great (I know: I back a few writers myself!), but you\u2019re not here \u003cem\u003ejust \u003c/em\u003efor those good feelings. By becoming my patron, you\u2019ll gain access to my works-in-progress, story outtakes, thoughts on the writing process, and much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut there are millions of aspiring writers. Why should you back me, of all people?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u2019ll be funny. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou\u2019ll get to watch me tackle absurd challenges. Last year, I made a solemn vow to write for 365 days straight. This year, I swore to rack up 50 rejections from professional short story markets. Patrons at the $1 level will get access to my blog, where I post about what I\u2019ve learned from these stunts, snippets from works-in-progress, and insight into my writing process. You\u2019ll see my one-off challenges, everyday musings, and failed experiments!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ve got a track record.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThough I\u2019m new to the world of publishing, I write like it\u2019s my job. This year, I laid down more than 400,000 words (about five book\u2019s worth of pages!) on various projects. I\u2019ve completed NaNoWriMo ten years running. I have two novels in progress, several short stories out on submission, and a novella in revision. I\u2019m determined to make it as a writer, and with your help, I can do it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy day job as a seamstress is hard on my hands. Years of cutting and sewing mean that overuse now makes my hands tingly, numb, and worthless for other pursuits. During months when I have to take on a lot of extra sewing to make ends meet, my ability to type\u2014 and thus write!\u2014 \u003cem\u003etanks, \u003c/em\u003eand I have to chose between writing and recuperation\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eIf you support me, I\u2019ll still have enough dexterity left to type!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ll get never-before-seen stories-- and more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons at the $1/month level\u00a0will get access to flash fiction, short stories, and in-world snippets from my works-in-progress. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons at the $5/month level will also see book reviews, get updates as I flail my way through the Wide World of Publishing, and get a crack at naming characters and places in my worlds!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a writer who needs some loving encouragement, you can join at the $10/month level. Patrons at that level will get to join in monthly writing sessions, where I\u0027ll run writing sprints, offer up prompts and suggest writing resources, and keep you on track as you get your words in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks so much for checking out my Patreon page, and thank you for believing in me!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
