    "summary": "We have always loved world-building, brainstorming together, and we have always wanted to do a shared story. The Rule of Five is that perfect story, big, sprawling space opera, with a complex cast and complicated plots \u2014 in fact, it\u0027s too big for a single novel, or even a trilogy. It\u0027s ideal, however, for a serial, one episode a month, and that\u0027s why we\u0027ve turned to Patreon. With your help, we can tell our story as it should be told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePirates! Judges! Weird physics! Desperate refugees! Struggling colonists! Missing persons and a mystery ship! A quest for human origins in a pocket universe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, we\u2019ll post an episode with a minimum length of 2000 words \u2014 a solid short story. All subscribers will be able to see each month\u2019s episode plus the previous episode; if you subscribe at higher levels, you can get a quarterly ebook compilation, access to all past episodes, and even a print edition containing the completed Season, as well as public acknowledgement for your support. These stories will be hosted at our dedicated website, \u003ca href=\"http://rule-of-five.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003erule-of-five.com\u003c/a\u003e, where you can also find various bits of background information about the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Rule of Five is a journey, a story that will take its characters to the farthest reaches of known space, and to the very core of their being. We hope you\u2019ll join us on the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e-\u003cem\u003e Melissa Scott\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u0026amp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e Don S\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eakers\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWho is Don Sakers?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was launched the same month as Sputnik One, so there was a certain inevitability about becoming a science fiction writer. A Navy brat by birth, I spent my childhood in such far-off lands as Japan, Scotland, Hawaii, and California. In California, rather like a latter-day Mowgli, I was raised by dogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer and editor, I\u2019ve explored the thoughts of sapient trees (\u003cem\u003eThe Leaves of October\u003c/em\u003e), brought ghosts to life (\u003cem\u003eCarmen Miranda\u0027s Ghost is Haunting Space Station Three\u003c/em\u003e), and beaten the \"Cold Equations\" scenario (\"The Cold Solution,\" \u003cem\u003eAnalog\u003c/em\u003e 7/91, voted best short story of the year.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m best known for my high space opera series \u003cem\u003eThe Scattered Worlds Mosaic\u003c/em\u003e, but I\u2019ve also written dark fantasy (\u003cem\u003eCurse of the Zwilling\u003c/em\u003e), future superheroes (the \u003cem\u003ePsiScouts\u003c/em\u003e series with Phil Meade), and gay young adult romance (\u003cem\u003eAct Well Your Part\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eLucky in Love\u003c/em\u003e). \u003cem\u003eMeat and Machine\u003c/em\u003e is a career retrospective collection of my queer short fiction and essays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2009, I took up the position of book reviewer for \u003cem\u003eAnalog Science Ficiton \u0026amp; Fact\u003c/em\u003e, where I write the \"Reference Library\" column in every issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live at Meerkat Meade in suburban Baltimore with my spouse, Thomas G. Atkinson. I\u2019ve just recently become a retired librarian, after 42 years on the payroll, so now I am able to devote all my attention to my lifelong goal of becoming a poor, starving writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho Is Melissa Scott?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, with a brief excursion to Mississippi when I was two, and the southern story-telling tradition remains a definite influence on my work. I discovered SF after I broke my arm in 7th grade gym class, and was sent to the library until the cast came off. One of the librarians saw me reading a Joe Poyer techno-thriller and said, \u201cIf you like that, you might like Heinlein \u2014 or what\u2019s-his-name, Andre Norton.\u201d He was right about that, even if he was wrong about Norton\u0027s gender. I picked up an Andre Norton novel and never looked back.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI got my undergraduate degree from Harvard College, and my PhD from Brandeis, working in their comparative history department \u2014 my particular interest was in the relationship between technology and society. (My dissertation, which looked at tactics for early gunpowder weapons, was like doing an SF novel in reverse, or maybe inside-out \u2014 I was looking for the mental scaffolding early tacticians used to figure out how to use these strange new devices, and for the unforeseeable consequences of choosing classical literature for their models.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been writing science fiction and fantasy since \u2014 well, my first published novel came out from Baen Books in 1984, while I was still in graduate school, so it\u2019s been a while. (And that doesn\u2019t count the things I wrote before my first sale.) I\u2019ve won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, four Lambda Literary Awards, and four Spectrum Awards. I\u2019ve written space opera based on Hermetic and neo-Platonic science (\u003cem\u003eFive-Twelfths of Heaven, Silence in Solitude\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eThe Empress of Earth\u003c/em\u003e) and near-future queer cyberpunk (\u003cem\u003eTrouble and Her Friends, The Jazz\u003c/em\u003e). I\u2019ve written alternate histories in which Alexander the Great turned west instead of east (\u003cem\u003eA Choice of Destinies\u003c/em\u003e), and Elizabeth I sent poets Sir Philip Sidney and Christopher Marlowe to save the King of Scots from a plague of witches (\u003cem\u003eThe Armor of Light\u003c/em\u003e), not to mention a secret history, the Order of the Air, in which Jo Graham and I follow a group of veteran flyers, survivors of the First World War, as they face occult threats in the interwar years (\u003cem\u003eLost Things, Steel Blues, Silver Bullet, Wind Raker\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eOath Bound\u003c/em\u003e). I\u2019ve collaborated on two fantasy mystery series, one set in a very different Victorian England (\u003cem\u003eDeath by Silver\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eA Death at the Dionysus Club\u003c/em\u003e), and the Astreiant novels, where astrology steers most things, including murder (\u003cem\u003ePoint of Hopes, Point of Knives, Point of Dreams\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eFairs\u2019 Point\u003c/em\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, I\u2019ve done a lot of very different kinds of stories over the years, and have no intention of cutting back now. Currently on the drawing board are an epic fantasy, a far-future SF novel about salvage and immortality, and a steampunk Martian invasion. (And the idea that arrived unbidden last week, complete with working title: \u003cem\u003eThe Unmurdered Poet\u003c/em\u003e.) But space opera remains a particular and perennial delight \u2014 and the serial format allows us to work on a larger-than-usual canvas. I\u2019m looking forward to exploring this universe, where everything happens in fives\u2026\u003cbr\u003e"
