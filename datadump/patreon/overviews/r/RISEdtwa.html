    "summary": "It all began with a simple idea - Use today\u0027s top performers and industry legends to develop tomorrow\u0027s generation of women professional wrestlers. Our formula broke the traditional mold of pro wrestling training. Instead of building one school in one spot with one trainer, we tour worldwide bringing the best trainers with the most experience to provide access to aspiring talents around the globe. We offer a unique combination of World Class Development Seminars and Live Events. Our Live Events showcase talents direct from our seminars mixed with some of today\u0027s top independent attractions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do something that has never been done before takes a lot of effort and a lot of capital. In our case, fan support and Patreon support is key. To provide the best, we need to have access to the best. And that is where we turn to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a 100% privately funded, independent company. We have no corporate backing or sponsorship. We will continue to grow. We will continue to hold events domestically and internationally. However, every little bit raised through Patreon helps immensely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration of supporting RISE as we innovate and elevate the next generation of professional wrestling\u0027s top female stars."
