For those of you unfamiliar with Traditional Art it\u2019s\nthe creation of art through the use of Traditional Mediums or what I like to\ncall the \"Mother Mediums\", Pencils, Pens, Inks, Paints, upon Paper\nand Canvases. I like to use a lot of Historical Themes and self developed\ncultures in my works and concepts as homage to our past, hopefully to get\nchildren interested in their history as well as, preserve that history at the\nsame time through my characters and art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhy Traditional rather than Digital you may ask? Well I feel\nthat it\u2019s another way for me to preserve our past and origins as artists and\npeople. As the years go by, Traditional art is becoming more and more rarer as\ntime passes, ever being replaced in all fields by digital works and dominating\nArt Schools. But I believe there is a certain something special about art done\nTraditionally. The very thought you get when Holding the Actual Paper in your\nhands that the Artist worked and sweat over for hours, the very paper with the\nhuman errors and mistakes still slightly visible, the very paper that the\nartist held in their hands before sending it off with love to its new home.\nThere is a certain intimacy you just cannot get from a piece of paper with ink\nprinted from a machine in a few seconds time at your home, or too often just an\nimage viewed on a computer screen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhy such fantastic subject matter? Why Anatomy and\nIllustration? It\u2019s my belief that Art should be an escape from reality and take\nthe viewer to places which they would never have seen otherwise. My passion is\nto make the unreal, real and to do this I have delved deep into studying both\nHuman and Animal Anatomy which both extremely interest me. Figuring out how a\nfantastic creature would look move and act if brought into reality and design\nand portray that through my designs and concepts is half the fun! To find that\nperfectly believable and beautiful mixture of Human and Animal which isn\u2019t too\nhuman or too animal is my ultimate goal!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut the foremost reasons I create art, the most paramount of\nall reasons are to make people happy, to bring that idea they\u2019ve had in their mind\nfor so long out onto paper, to bring an Author\u2019s characters and world to life\nso that their words and my lines can dance together in the most beautiful of\nways for all to enjoy and marvel at. This my friends, should be the goal of\nevery artist, to ultimately involve ones selves with other gifted people in\norder to help them succeed alongside you. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo please if you donate even the littlest amounts to support\nmy work and my dreams I would be eternally grateful, from the single $1 to the\nimpossible distant amounts only fathomable in my hopes and dreams you will\nallow me to continue this journey of mine. You will allow me to continue\nvolunteering myself to larger projects so that I can help bring others success\nthrough my success and your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI thank you all so much for even the consideration of this\nand the gratitude I would have for you if you do decide to participate and\nsupport me cannot be placed in words! You are all Shinning Lights in the\nDarkness my Friends. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~\u0026lt;=================~O~=================\u0026gt;~\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;===~I~===\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003eV\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
