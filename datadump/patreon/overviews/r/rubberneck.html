It\u0027s been an interesting experience meeting people (some very special), growing with other people and staying connected with other artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve floated around some sites over the years, but my main squeezes are my\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rubbbernecking/\"\u003e Instagram\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://linda-mota.newgrounds.com/\"\u003eNewgrounds\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://babylarvae.deviantart.com/\"\u003eDeviantart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSome of you may know me for bringing back an \u003ca href=\"http://www.theduckwebcomics.com/M4dness_Operation_/\"\u003eold madness fancomic from 2011\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOthers might recognize me with some of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/694461\"\u003ecollab videos I\u0027ve done with Spencer here\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr the Zinefest Houston collab books (specifically the Zinefest 2016-2017 issues)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOR some may remember the 2011 Marble Hornets Madness with all the fanart and fun me and a few other groups had back in the day. :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a struggle getting some of these comics out, or even getting some art into the galleries. I have a rejection pile higher than the inked pages of My Cherubs comic. Hell I\u0027ve been wanting to finish drawing out and printing the last 3 issues of THE UNSPOKEN DIALOGUE zines and get it\u0027s spiritual sequel out, but having the printing costs along with some bills at home have been getting in the way! We need to save up for a new AC and some other little things like flood insurance, better health insurance, and groceries. Had to go through some saving to cover costs of car, food, and vet/house bills and supplies that have had me put the inking and printing of the big issue zines in the back burner.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBecoming my Patron you\u0027ll help get a bunch of these comics out and printed and cover the costs of the paper and paints I use.

You help would get these things faster and take care of some things in my life I have to take care of such as vet bills, car dealies, the last class of my master\u0027s degree, and basic art supplies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I\u0027m working on my teacher\u0027s certification, and a job that\u0027s giving me more hours. Any little bit helps, and with each increase will mean some special rewards for backers that include handmade pins, first access to new volumes of zines, preview of entire chapters of The Cherub Brothers before it\u0027s out, and more! I really want to collect all the issues of THE UNSPOKEN DIALOGUE and it\u0027s Sequel into one big book and you guys can help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny little bit helps, but everything I post will always be free for everyone to see! Thank you so much for reading what I have to say! For more support you can check out my store for some of the other things I make!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE!
