All I want to do is tell\nthe visual stories of the things most of us miss: those brief moments when light\nfalls across a wall, a sign, the sky, a face. For as long as I can remember, I have thought in\npictures. Some of those pictures I turn into words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Constant creation is my full-time job\u2014and I love it. One\nof my favorite things about this job is when people tell me how much my work\nmeans to them. \u201cYour photos make being online worthwhile,\u201d they say. Or, \u201cThat\npiece you wrote the other day was just what I needed to keep going when I felt\nlike everything was falling apart.\u201d Now that\u2019s satisfying: something I put out\ninto the world brought someone a little joy when they were in a difficult\nplace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor\na while now, people have been asking me about setting up a patron campaign. You\nknow, something with rewards for a monthly pledge, kind of like the patronage\nsystem of the Renaissance (except without all the Medici intrigue and espionage\nand murder). I thought about that for a long time, almost two years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cWhat?\nLet folks show me how much they enjoy my work? Give them special new pieces in\nreturn for their money?\u201d The entire concept felt strange, at first. But the\nlonger I thought about it, the more sense it made. These people value my words\nand photos. They look forward to my new stuff because it adds something to\ntheir lives. If they wished to support me directly, I\u2019d be honored.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo,\nhere we are. Take a look at the various support levels. See what fits best for\nyou. Even if you can\u2019t pledge, keep checking in. I\u2019ll be posting some free\npublic content on the Patreon page, stuff you won\u2019t see elsewhere. And I post a\nlot of material on social media\u2014so keep on liking, commenting, sharing, and\ntelling your friends about my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank\nyou for cheering me on, for supporting my work in whatever ways you can and do.\nYour encouragement means so, so much to me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you again. I love you\nall. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nR.S. Williams\u003cbr\u003e"
