    "summary": "Hello there,\nand welcome! We are RedGamingTech, the partnership of Amata (real name Amy) and\nCrimsonRayne (real name Paul).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have been\ndoing our thing on Youtube since 2012, plus our \u003ca href=\"http://www.redgamingtech.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e. We have been doing RGT seriously now for about two out of those four years, but we have\nalso been working full time jobs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNaturally,\nthat heavily limits the type of content we can do, and there are just some\nideas we don\u2019t have the time to execute (but we\u2019ll get into that later). That\nis why we have decided to take the plunge and start devoting more time to RGT\nand cutting our \"day job\" work hours!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd that is\nwhy we\u2019re here on Patreon, so we can fully dedicate ourselves to bringing you\ntop quality content, plus all sorts of things we just haven\u2019t been able to do\nwhile working full time as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat type of content do you do, and\nwhat new content will there be?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt the\nmoment, our content is gaming and tech (graphic cards, monitors, CPUs and so on) reviews\nand previews, graphics and frame rate analysis, gaming news, technology news,\ntechnical analysis (such as breakdowns of GDC and game industry presentations) and\nlet\u2019s plays. There\u0027s also a weekly podcast, which has been going for a while now. We also strive to get\ninterviews with folks in the industry, such as AMD,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.redgamingtech.com/the-vulkan-interview-exclusive-interview-with-the-khronos-group/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKhronos Group\u003c/a\u003e (the folks behind Vulkan) and BitDefender. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we want\nto do is simple: \u003cstrong\u003eless news, more\noriginal content. \u003c/strong\u003eThat doesn\u2019t mean the news will be going anywhere,\nthough. Plenty of people enjoy that content and appreciate a handy source for\nall the best news in once place. It will\nsimply mean the news will be collected into a \u003cstrong\u003esingle, round up video \u003c/strong\u003ewith some exceptions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything more complex that can\u2019t be\nincluded will be given a unique video, that will be less about the news and\nmore about our opinion on it. We would also be able to generally increase the\nproduction value of our videos, with information slides, images and other such\nthings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the\noriginal content we want to do at the moment (as we will probably have more\nideas as we go) are more \u003cstrong\u003eSimplified\nvideos \u003c/strong\u003e(\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/G1aWXjNNwzE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elink here\u003c/a\u003e), more in-depth tech analysis, more in depth\nanalysis and opinions of the games industry and more tech reviews. We already\nproduce some of that content (such as this \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/bt2NdM3lG1c\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eXbox Scorpio analysis\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/7dCTIER7Kqs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePS4 Pro analysis\u003c/a\u003e, and this discussion on \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/F-gOXGmeJds\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ein game nudity\u003c/a\u003e) but sadly, we haven\u2019t had the time to\ndedicate to doing it as much as we\u2019d like. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaul would\nlove to produce more technology guides, tutorials, and help people understand\ntechnology. Amata\nwould personally love to dedicate more time to unique, interesting content that\nis not only an analysis of the industry and the hot topics currently happening\nthere, but games themselves and elements of them. I have explored this briefly\nback in the \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/sRGfPwT7gWs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eearly days\u003c/a\u003e of RGT, but a series I would love to bring back is my\nexamination of what makes good characters, storylines and mechanics in games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also want\nto give the RGT website a complete visual overhaul, as well as build a forum\nfor you guys to talk outside of the hive of scum and villainy that is Youtube\ncomments. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are so\nmany ideas we both have, that sadly working a full time job will not allow the\ntime for. Our audience\nhas come to know and respect us for our honesty and unbiased opinion in both\nthe PC gaming and console gaming space, and it is that we wish to bring to you\nbut in its full glory. There are many complex topics and videos we would love\nto take on with that RGT flourish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there you\nhave it, in a nutshell! I don\u2019t want to waffle on too much, so if you have any\nquestions, feel free to email us at \u003ca href=\"mailto:contact@redgamingtech.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003econtact@redgamingtech.com\u003c/a\u003e or throw us a message on social media (it\u2019s always\n/redgamingtech).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eSo why isn\u2019t ad revenue enough?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYouTube and\nwebsite ad revenue has taken a hit in the past few years, and while bigger\nchannels are okay, smaller, niche channels such as ours really feel the burden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile we do\nreceive hardware to review, often it is needed to be returned to the companies\n(as they are review samples) and so with your help we can keep our hardware and\nequipment updated too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWill you be doing rewards?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe aren\u0027t planning on doing loads of rewards and tiers, as we don\u0027t want to gate off content or anything like that. We will be having\u00a0 a couple of tiers to simply show our appreciation for any higher donators, but we want any funding we receive to be because you want to fund us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe milestones we have are longer term goals aimed at covering production costs, as well as paying the bills and keeping a roof over both of our heads. However, we\u0027re a small channel, so don\u0027t take those milestones as an expectation, they are simply what we would \u003cem\u003elike\u003c/em\u003e to achieve at some point in the future. No matter the amount, even if it\u0027s $1, is incredible and highly appreciated. This channel has always been our passion, and it will stay that way - we simply want to give ourselves completely to it, and create more content for you to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eSo what can you do to help? \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDonate what you want for as long or as little as\nyou want. Every penny is very appreciated and goes towards helping us make the\ncontent we love to create financially\nviable, as well as keep a roof over our heads as we go into the uncharted seas\nof full time Youtube. If you don\u2019t\nwant to, or aren\u2019t able to commit to a monthly donation, then we also have \u003ca href=\"http://tinyurl.com/l4v3zoq\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePayPal available\u003c/a\u003e as an option if you wish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019re\nunable to help out with donations, just know we still are incredibly thankful for\nyou supporting us, whether that\u2019s watching our content, sharing our links with\nour friends or talking with us on social media - it all helps, and we are always grateful for your support.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo everyone, be they a viewer and of our content or a Patreon supporter - thank you so much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
