    "summary": "First off,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/sqi5zwwtkqmogjj/Patreon%20Promo%20Thing.pdf?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere is a link to the Thing created in the above video\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, to restate what I\u0027ve put in the Thing and in the video -- I\u0027m a father of two who lives in Boston and who has had a lot of different fingers in a lot of different productive and creative pies. I\u0027m a singer, I\u0027m a church musician, I\u0027m a composer, I\u0027m an arts administrator, I\u0027m a historian, I\u0027m a networker. I\u0027m also an activist, an advocate, a commentator, and a speaker. The common thread for a lot of these activities is writing, and while I don\u0027t really consider myself an artist as such, I have written -- and published! and even been paid! -- professionally in a lot of different contexts and in a number of different genres. I\u0027ve published fiction, non-fiction, and poetry; I\u0027ve produced stories, essays, newspaper articles, and even a couple of drafts of a screenplay or two. I\u0027ve written on history, technology, drama, humor, religion, music, tech theatre, education, politics, and more. Some of I\u0027ve done at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.leitourgeia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy own personal blog\u003c/a\u003e (which has been kind of moribund during the last year as I\u0027ve been trying to get some stable ground under my feet; life happens, folks), some of it I\u0027ve published in magazines and books, some of it I\u0027ve written as a guest columnist, but the point is, as a writer, I\u0027ve got a voice and a portfolio, I\u0027m good at it, and I can produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would feel really lame setting up a Patreon to ask people to support a blog, though. Anybody can tap out a blog post in Wordpress, and there\u0027s not really any added value I can come up with to justify a Patreon if that\u0027s all I\u0027m doing. So I\u0027ve come up with a different idea, and you can see the idea in the video and in the link above. I suppose we could say that it\u0027s an adaptation of my sensibilities as a medievalist who works with manuscripts to the ways we\u0027re used to creative people producing in the internet age. Basically, if you support my Patreon, what you\u0027ll get are videos of me creating as a writer -- a Thing shows me writing in a notebook with a fountain pen, and I\u0027ll also record a voice track reading it aloud. (It will usually be better than the recording in the promo video -- my voice was really croaky that night.) You\u0027ll also get a .pdf of the manuscript. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put it another way, your support will get you a front-row seat to me creating my drafts. These drafts may wind up being polished into things that show up elsewhere, in which case you\u0027ll have a unique view on the work\u0027s creation, and since I\u0027ll be engaging with you on the Patreon page, you might have some participation in the work\u0027s development, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m calling myself \"The Journal-ist\" to try to convey that what you\u0027re getting is an inside look at the writer\u0027s notebook. I suppose we could also call this \"jotcasting\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m offering a monthly subscription rather than a per-Thing amount, and what I want to do is follow the following schedule:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDaily: a group of four jokes.\u003cbr\u003eWeekly: An essay of some kind.\u003cbr\u003eMonthly: Something else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can think of it this way -- if you sponsor me for a $1/month, you\u0027ll pay a quarter for the essay, a quarter for the Something Else, and then fifty cents for the jokes. That\u0027s cheap, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s a minimum. I\u0027d like to do more, but it\u0027s going to depend on how this all goes. I\u0027ll also take requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, support me. I\u0027ve tried to come up with support levels that encourage lots of signups; I want to be inexpensive to encourage as many people as possible to be reading my stuff. Some of it will be good, some of it will be not as good, but I\u0027m at least trying to make this an interesting approach to what I\u0027m doing, and if it\u0027s interesting, if nothing else, I\u0027ll call that worth it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll see what emerges.\u003cbr\u003e"
