My best friend Andrea and I are about to embark on a long-time dream of hiking the Appalachian Trail South Bound from Maine to Georgia. We\u0027ll be starting around June 11th and aim to be done in plenty of time to have Thanksgiving dinner with our families.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, I would only have enough personal funds to last the first 1.5 months or so (out of roughly 4.5 months total). The timing is perfect, though, because I am about to graduate college, and my best friend/favorite hiking buddy is willing and able to go with me. It\u0027s too good of an opportunity to pass up. So, here we are. I\u0027m asking for a little help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the trail, I will be documenting our adventures with watercolor comics. (I also have plans for participating in Inktober from the trail!) The comics will look slightly similar to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg7IAJUBEdt/\"\u003eanother project\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eI\u0027m in the middle of, though the AT adventure will very much have its own flair to it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInvesting in this project is a win for everybody: I get to accomplish a life-long dream of being able to hike every day and explore new places and make cool connections, and you get to see unique and interesting comics from the adventure! The more funding I get, the more of the trail I hike, the more cool comics I\u0027ll be able to make and share with you all. Any extra funding will go directly into publishing the comics as a book and starting on my next project. While a few of the comics will be available to the public on my instagram (@rotucomics), patrons will have exclusive access to special secret comics that won\u0027t be available to others unless they purchase the book after I finish the trail (MORE ON THE BOOK LATER!!!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re able to help at all, I would be super grateful, but even if you can\u0027t, please feel free to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rotucomics/\"\u003efollow the journey\u003c/a\u003e!
