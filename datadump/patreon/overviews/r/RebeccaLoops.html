    "summary": "If you\u0027re looking at this page you probably watch my videos and already know what\u0027s up. Patreon is an awesome website that lets you the viewer say, \"Yes, this channel is worth a dollar a month to me,\" and it allows me as a creator to actually make some money off the time spent making things. It also builds a community; this is the first place I go for feedback on what songs I should cover, what direction I should go with the channel, that kind of stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your money:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomeday I hope that I\u0027ll make boatloads of money from YouTube and other endeavors so that I can make better stuff and pay it forward to new artists who are trying to do the same, but I\u0027m not there yet. When you do cover songs on YouTube most of the ad revenue goes to the copyright holders, and my viewership isn\u0027t high enough yet to get a regular sponsor. In other words, I spend hours on each video and make less than one dollar per thousand views (at 990 views my California Love cover has made a whopping eight cents).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, I\u0027m living out of a suitcase traveling between my mom and sister\u0027s homes; our family is dealing with some pretty challenging stuff, and I\u0027m happy to struggle financially so that I can be with them, but BOY does a few extra bucks here and there make things a lot easier. On a related note, if you want to take music lessons with me via Skype/FaceTime, hit me up at RebeccaLoops@gmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFULL DISCLOSURE: I\u0027m still figuring out Patreon. If you pay for a google hangout and you want a google hangout, I will give you one. It might be like that awkward party where you\u0027re the only one who shows up and then you feel like you have to stay so I\u0027m not there by myself, but hey, you wanted this party! Patreon is another type of social media- I\u0027m not great at posting regularly, but I always respond! And as more people join, I\u0027ll be more likely to remember to post. So sign up, give me a dollar, and tell me what you think would be awesome and worth sticking around for. I\u0027ll listen and hopefully we\u0027ll make something cool here together.\u003cbr\u003e"
