In return, you the patron, get access to exclusive content and rewards not available anywhere else! For my patreon, this means uncensored photos of yours truly, exclusive photo sets, and behind the scenes photos and videos! I will also occasionally share some of my other artistic creations from time to time, including but not limited to drawings, paintings, sculpture, and dance videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Please note that Patreon charges patrons (you) on the 1st of each month. I will be sending out rewards on the 5th of each month after cards have been successfully charged. For example, if you become a patron on March 2nd, you will receive your rewards on April 5th, and so on.\u003cbr\u003eDo not fret though! There will still be some content available to view instantly while you wait :)\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you would like instant access to your rewards for the current month that you joined, please message me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Much of this content will be shared through my patron only blog. \u00a0Photosets will be shared through password protected galleries through Pixieset.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore about me\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen I turned 18 and was on the hunt for a job as a \"starving college student\" I stumbled upon art modeling for a figure drawing class at my local college. \u00a0I was shocked at first to find out I\u0027d be NUDE (gasp!) but being the adventurous sort that I am, I jumped right in! \u00a0When I was younger, I used to have recurring nightmares that I was suddenly naked at school, but the day I turned that into a reality, the nightmares stopped! It was magical! \u00a0Being an artist myself, I immediately fell in love with the creative process that I shared with my fellow artists on the other side of the canvas, and soon branched out into modeling for photographers as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am now going on eight years of being a professional muse and I am loving every minute of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Glimpse into that Crystal Ball\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI plan on modeling, dancing, creating, and traveling as long as I am physically able!\u003cbr\u003eMy goals for Patreon are to be able to fund these endeavors as well as give back by donating to various charities calling to my heart. \u00a0I have always had a huge love for animals, so I am going to start there! Check out my current goal for some exciting plans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you, thank, THANK YOU!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join me on my epic, naked artistic journey!
