i want to add as much value to your experience here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhat about long term plans for /risen/?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei\u2019m already looking into exhibiting/selling my work through various events like vegan fairs, tattoo conventions and other events with a focus on sustainability or alternative lifestyles (one i\u2019ve had my eye on is the \u2018dead punk flea market\u2019 where i feel like my work would really go down well).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ei have two work mentors, one through the prince\u2019s trust (who i have been seeing for over two years) and the other via the job centre ( this is currently in it\u2019s infancy but their goal is to help me reach new customers and approach retailers in the hope of them stocking some of my branded products). my plan long term is to be making a living off my work as well as providing information for people and guide them into a sustainable lifestyle, in much the same way as i\u2019ve done previously with veganism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethanks so much for your time and consideration in supporting me and my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(there\u0027s a video on the way!)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
