I\u0027m sure you can guess what I do with that one. In addition; I make rants on certain subjects in the gaming or anime community called \"Wait a Minute\", I\u0027ll be starting a side series called \"Faceless Reactions\", and there\u0027s the occasional gameplay video every now and again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy making this content for the simple fact that these are the things I am passionate about. But no matter how passionate I am about them, it takes time and money to make. Eventually, I\u0027d like to (and will soon have to) upgrade my equipment in order to produce content with much more of a professional quality. This will also include help in editing, having different artists on ECB, possibly producing some animation and so on. I\u0027d like to put out some merchandise for you guys (if you\u0027d like). I\u0027d even like to do some livestreams and some chill sessions with you guys. But once again, that requires better equipment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m doing this not just because I love to analyze characters or create amazing melodies, but because I want others to see, hear, understand, and hopefully experience the love I have for them as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZqCehcu8Ek\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWhy are you funding this Saitoshi guy?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWell, I\u0027d hope it would be because you want to and not because you (somehow, idk) feel obligated to. Reminder: My content will ALWAYS be available to you guys immediately and without charge on YouTube (or Twitch or whatever) whenever I upload a video. I will NEVER expect you to put your money into Patreon if you don\u0027t want to. If you do so, you do so out of the kindness of your own heart and for that, I thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the platform where I\u0027m looking to expand my channel into something bigger for you guys to enjoy. And although the ultimate goal is to make enough to support this passion full-time, I do this for others to enjoy and gain a love and understanding about what makes a character amazing and what makes music the possible driving influence of a series. Overall, I want to be able to provide you guys with quality (and consistent) content.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
