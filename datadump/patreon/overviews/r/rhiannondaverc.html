By falling in love, a noblewoman and a servant make the ultimate mistake. She is tossed out of her noble family and forced to live as a slave. He is abducted in a cruel city where he can\u0027t ask for help - because if he does, he\u0027ll be arrested himself. In this world, everything anybody needs to know about you is inscribed on a collar around your neck, including your value as a human. They have just lost theirs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because I need funding to write, largely because (as much as one wishes) you can\u0027t live on\u00a0air and good will alone. I\u0027ve done the struggling writer thing and now I actually get paid to write non-fiction. But I\u0027d love to spend more time on fiction, and bring this novel to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal. I\u0027ll carry on writing, adding instalments monthly.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@rhiannondaverc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou carry on reading\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. If you like what you read, please consider pledging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more support I get, the more time I\u0027ll have to write. As we bust through the goals, I\u0027ll be writing more often. I\u0027ll spread the love to other artists by commissioning illustrations. Somewhere down the line I\u0027ll have my own website where you can read each post easily, and a mailing list for updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I don\u0027t expect all of this for nothing. I\u0027ll reward you too. I\u0027ll let you influence my work with polls and prompts. I\u0027ll show you my creative process and my scribbled drafts. I\u0027ll post\u00a0chapters\u00a0here first\u00a0so you don\u0027t have to read on Medium. Later on, there will be more exclusive rewards, unlocked as we progress through the goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound good? Click the button and pledge to support my work - rewards start from just $1. If you can\u0027t spare the money, please consider sharing this page to your social networks and to your friends to spread the word."
