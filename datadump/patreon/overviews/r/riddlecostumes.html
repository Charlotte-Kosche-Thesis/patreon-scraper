    "summary": "Hey! My name is Lani Riddle, perhaps you might know some of my cosplays from the Internet or Facebook. I am a Cosplayer since 2004 and I love sewing long dresses with many details and crafting armor and weapons from Anime, Games, Movies, Fantasy and more! With every new costume the work gets more intense and the project gets bigger and bigger. Under my name \"Riddle Costumes\" I am working for a few years now for other cosplayers making their costumes and weapons and wigs as commissions - only to have the money to make my own Cosplays come true! Since 2016 I am trying to live from only my passion and dreams as a costume-creator! But because now I need all these commissions to pay my appartment I can\u0027t work on my own costumes and what is even more important: I am in need for more time to make new tutorials because I love to share my knowledge with you and help with all I experienced! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support allows me to tackle more own projects, put out new content more frequently and raise the quality of what you receive!\u003c/strong\u003e Such things include \u003cem\u003eprogress pictures of current work or things I tried, tutorial videos of my cosplay works\u003c/em\u003e,\u003cem\u003e posing tips\u003c/em\u003e for cosplayers as well as \u003cem\u003efirst tips\u003c/em\u003e for photographers and visual artists (I used to study photography and graphic arts and I am working with a lot of photographers), even \u003cem\u003emakeup tutorials\u003c/em\u003e for different characters! Maybe you can get some \u003cem\u003eBehind The Scenes\u003c/em\u003e from some photoshoots, too ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have some huge projects I would love to finally realize and share my experiences with you! Also there is a huge thing I would love to get done, my \u003cstrong\u003efirst book\u003c/strong\u003e for other creators to help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003espread the word and help me help others \u0026lt;3 I would love to do so many things, creating new costumes and pictures and tutorials are only a part of all my ideas!\u003cbr\u003e"
