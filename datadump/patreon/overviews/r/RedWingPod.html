This project has been a huge undertaking. It took me 2 years to write season 1 of RedWing, and it has taken 4 months to specifically put all of it together. I am currently the only person doing the editing, but the team is growing. Nico of We Talk Of Dreams has joined our team and had made \"RedWing\u0027s Theme\" which will be posted on here so you can listen and appreciate it as much as I do. ClickArt Studios is making amazing art for the characters. Currently, I\u0027m the one putting their money into this and making it happen at the moment, but I need your help! I want for this to become a full universe, with amazing merch, spin off shows, more writers, as well as so many other things. I would like to bring this to you, and I can do that with your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance, thank you for your support, thank you for listening, and thank you for all the support y\u0027all have given me thus far. I love you all. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
