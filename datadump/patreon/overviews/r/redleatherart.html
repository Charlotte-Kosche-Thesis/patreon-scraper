    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eRed Leather Art\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello there, thanks for checking out my Patreon page. I am a 3D artist that \nhas many full \nimage sets/comics available free as well as previews of newer sets on my site, \u003ca href=\"http://redleatherart.com/wp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eredleatherart.com/wp\u003c/a\u003e. Normally, I make a main story set every two months. I use the off month to make additional types of content, such as animations and small games. If you enjoy my work, which I hope you do; you can choose to support me here on Patreon. I have recently finished work on a game I have been working on for a few months, \"\u003cstrong\u003eSalune\u0027s slave training\u003c/strong\u003e\"; (Free demo available here: \u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!3ptwQRpL!qTMVM2Z53uD_ZRCjjKSf1Szjksdp-MhSVQGCGdQeFbs\"\u003ehttps://mega.nz/#!3ptwQRpL!qTMVM2Z53uD_ZRCjjKSf1Szjksdp-MhSVQGCGdQeFbs\u003c/a\u003e) and I am now restarting work on the story sets. (Game preview image gallery and more info about it are on my site.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI send normal rewards out via Patreon messages near the start of each month, after payment clears; usually around the 10th or so.\u003cstrong\u003e I also have now opened the option for new patrons to be charged up front, this means that you can pledge at any time and I will send you the relevant rewards message for your tier for that month (if it has gone out) within a day or so, instead of having to wait several weeks to be included. \u003c/strong\u003eI check my email frequently, so you should not have to wait long, barring any extenuating circumstances; such as pledging early in the month before that month\u0027s main rewards messages have been sent yet. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eTo pledge anything to my Patreon, and/or receive any rewards from it you must be at least eighteen (18) years old.

This means you will get access to most games once they are out of beta (if it even had a beta) and/or are \"done\". (Early is in quotes because some games may be freely released way down the line, but as of right now that is not planned.) Current subscribers to this tier also receive a 5% discount on commissions from me, if that interests you. \u003cstrong\u003eCurrently one 20 something image small VN is available in addition to my 70+ image new full game, \"Salune\u0027s slave training\" along with any main image sets that have not yet been freely released. (The first chapter of the city arc is out now, more coming every two months.)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\n $15 tier will get you everything the low tiers give plus some Patreon exclusive mini-sets (generally some kind of sex scene featuring at least one of my girls) that I will post each month. This tier also includes access to high quality versions of most animations and beta access to some games that I make. (Not all games will have beta access; beta access may also be given for major content updates to existing games.) The $15 tier and above will also get access to special \ndiscussions and \npolls to help me decide what to put in future normal sets/comics/games/animations/mini-sets. These polls and discussions can range from\n character choices and sex position options to even major plot choices in \nupcoming story sets and give you a way to see more of what you want from my \nwork. (Note: the lower tiers may get very rare access to these polls as well.) This tier also gives you access to concept \nart, early or unused renders, and whatever else that I post in the \n\"extras\" category.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Current subscribers to this tier also receive a 10% discount on commissions from me, if that interests you.\u003cstrong\u003e Just to clarify - as of May 2018, this tier currently includes the new mini-set from April, and the two mini-sets before that; none of the older mini-sets are included anymore. However, future mini-sets will be included until the list resets again in six months. (The list of included mini-sets reset as of this month.)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\n $42 tier will get you all of the above plus a standard commission each month! Check the commissions page on my site for more details, but do know that this does \u003cstrong\u003eNOT necessarily \u003c/strong\u003einclude any add-ons; if you want any of those, you need to either add to your pledge and/or pay the difference through paypal. (I may do an add-on or two for free if you are a return customer and/or I really like your idea, but this is not guaranteed.) Again, check my site for details. This commission tier is being offered at a slight discount due to being combined with my normal Patreon rewards and slots are very limited, so first come, first serve here. Current subscribers to this tier also receive a 12% discount on commissions from me, and this can be used on add-ons for the commission included in this tier, if you need and/or want any.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\n $60 tier is a bit different; instead of getting a standard commission, you get a custom commission each month! Check the commissions page on my site for more details, but\n do know that this does \u003cstrong\u003eNOT necessarily \u003c/strong\u003einclude any add-ons; if you want any \nof those, you need to either add to your pledge and/or pay the \ndifference through paypal. (I may do an add-on or two for free if you are a return customer and/or I really like your idea, but this is not guaranteed.) Again, check my site for details. This commission tier is being offered at a moderate discount due to being combined with my normal Patreon \nrewards and slots are very limited, so first come, first serve here.
