    "summary": "Hey! My name is Andy Kyte and I\u0027m a full-time composer based in London, UK. My work includes songwriting projects through to classical concert music and film orchestration. While I love what I do, I\u0027ve got a huge passion for the Church and seeing Jesus celebrated through music. For over ten years I have been writing church music, helping to develop musicians/bands/songwriters and exploring how we can push the boundaries of music to help people in their faith. Out of this, I founded a record label called Rawr Like a Lion Records.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO A PATREON PAGE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe label currently has two creative streams that I want to share with you. Here\u0027s a brief explanation of each one and why you should get involved:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodcasts: Melodic Meditations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bible encourages us to meditate on God\u0027s Word day and night; but I personally struggle to. I figured that if I struggled to then others probably do too. So, I started Melodic Meditations; a morning devotional where we journey together, reading a bible passage and then singing new refrains that I\u0027ve written out of the scripture we\u0027ve just read. The refrains get stuck in your head and you spend the day meditating on God\u0027s Word; pretty cool!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a patron to enable me to give part of my working day to the podcast and upload more regularly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic: Rawr Like a Lion Records\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRawr Like a Lion is a record label that exists to celebrate Jesus through music and celebrate music through Jesus. We\u0027ve already released a Christmas album, a spoken word with live orchestral music underneath and an Indie Rock album with full band and strings. We\u0027re working with loads of great musicians and diverse songwriters. We\u0027ve got the appetite to do an even greater range of bigger and better releases, further pushing the boundaries of music in a way that glorifies Jesus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a patron for access to all our music, exclusive worship nights and recordings only available to subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always look to create music, podcasts and develop songwriters; and if you do choose to become a patron then we can produce more music on a bigger scale. So, check out the rewards and consider becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for all your support so far. I\u0027m excited about journeying together and seeing what happens next. Andy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
