I was once sponsored by 5 companies that supported me in doing what I love through Youtube. Due to an incident that involved my channel closing and having to make adjustments with my return, I had to end every single one of those sponsorship deals. I currently do Youtube for fun, to entertain and continue everything I did before however, as you would understand I make significantly less with just one income source. I appreciate every single one of you that pledge to my Patreon to allow me to continue this journey with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started Runescape back when hyper cam 2 unregistered was popular and \"let the bodies hit the floor\" was everyone\u0027s go to music.\u00a0Gaming has been with me all my life. Creating videos and streaming has always been about the fun aspect of sharing my game play with others and providing an entertaining format for those to interact. As well as this, the feedback and following I have accumulated has been tremendous and I have met some amazing people along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything ounce of content I place online is free for everyone to watch and whilst this will never change. Even if this does not work out and I cannot make ends meet, I can at least say I tried to do what i thoroughly enjoy. This is an opportunity for my supporters to give back for the several years of viewing or maybe less and receive specific perks [scroll down]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to be a Patreon today, you are allowing me the freedom to produce content. This could either be a frequent streaming schedule allowing you to have something to turn on to watch most of the time, an expansion of Youtube content and more time to put in towards one video. Hopefully you understand the purposes and motives behind this Patreon and that is for the good of providing the best I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for reading, \u003c/em\u003ePaul\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
