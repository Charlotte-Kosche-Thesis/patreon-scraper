    "summary": "MFR has been a professional writer for four years, covering all things geek for sites like Moviehole, IGN, The Splash Report, and- most notably- Latino-Review. His passionate and insightful takes on things have inspired a dedicated following- one that he\u2019s continued to cultivate through his weekly show, the El Fanboy Podcast. Yet, while he\u2019s only written about these things since he was 30, he discovered he was a geek when he basically snapped into consciousness one afternoon in 1987 at the Elmwood Theater in Queens, watching Superman IV: The Quest For Peace at age four. Everything prior to that moment is lost in the ether. Everything after it is why he loves movies and superheroes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJon Crabtree is a financial analyst at a Fortune 500 company by day, MBA student \u0026amp; family man by night, influencer business blogger by later that night, and nerd-culture commentator by even later that night. Through all of that, Jon has an insatiable urge to watch movies, listen to audiobooks, and write about himself in the third person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen asked what they want RTF to be, here\u2019s what they came up:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cRevenge of the Fans is a nerd-leaning news, analysis, and enjoyment project. The site was started in early 2018, in the dark days before anyone on the Internet had anything to say about comic book movies or pop culture. The site was the idea of Mario-Francisco Robles, a man with his finger on the pulse of the comic book movie industry, and Jon, a person who we aren\u2019t completely sure isn\u2019t a figment of Mario\u2019s imagination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile they come at all of this from a place of love and fun, it\u2019s important for them to make RTF a place where fans can be heard by creating a site that lives and breathes with its readers. We\u2019re at a fascinating point where Geek Culture has never been more popular, and where fans\u2019 hunger to be heard has never been more insatiable. Welcome home.\u201d"
