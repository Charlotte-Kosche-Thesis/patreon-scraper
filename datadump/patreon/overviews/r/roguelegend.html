    "summary": "Rogue Legend 2 is a sorta Harvest Moon meets Zelda meets Recettear meets\n building meets roguelike. I have a real interest in procedural games \nand advancing them beyond \"interconnected boxes with randomized spawns\" \nthat tends to be the common result. Something as polished and varied as a\n Zelda or Dark Souls dungeon, but made procedurally and endlessly\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XYuJb7N.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn a normal RPG or D\u0026amp;D there\u0027s a full cycle in play: Explorers map \nthe land and discover the dungeon, merchants sell the party gear and \nsupplies, adventurers clear the dungeon and get the loot, and sell to \nthe craftsmen that make the gear.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s lots of games that \nexplore these concepts on their own, but nothing has really tried to \nbring it all together. Imagine a game where you can run a shop, and sell\n goods to adventurers. Or you can be those adventurers, and go into \nprocedural dungeons to collect loot to bring back to town to sell to the\n traders. Or you\u0027re a trader, buying and growing components to craft all\n new gear and supplies. Or just explore and live off the land. All in \nthe same world, and you can do one or any of these things at any time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KkiRZEM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe\n benefit is everyone can play in the same world together without needing\n to be interested in the same things. Maybe combat and dungeons aren\u0027t \nyour thing, and you\u0027d rather set up a farm and raise animals, or brew \npotions, but still play with your friends. So one of you can be playing \nplaying Zelda, while the other Harvest Moon, and both your contributions\n are meaningful and helpful to the other. And I love Harvest Moon, it\u0027s \nthe ultimate chill-out game, and it\u0027s inspired almost every game since \nto feature farming or raising animals. Though you gotta admit, your \nanimals are just sort of input machines. They sit in the barn, input \nfood and brushing, output produce. I always wanted to take them wth me, \nnot just riding around on a horse, but what about raising a Cow Warrior \nto go with you on quests, and more breeding options and stuff to do with\n them like Chocobo racing in FF7.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xG3IZkZ.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s essentially 4 game modes \nin one. Harvest Moon style chill out farming and building, grow crops, \nraise animals, build stuff, and sell it. A merchant game where you run a\n shop, buy inventory, sell your goods, play the market. Explorers hunt \nfor rare components, find exotic locales, and live off the land. \nAdventurers buy goods, complete dungeons, and return to town with \ntreasures in tow. Each should be its own adventure, without requiring \nyou to grind out time in the other stuff.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re just interested in buying the game or something else, you can do so right here: \u003ca href=\"http://kassoon.com/rogue-legend-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://kassoon.com/rogue-legend-2/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wfPG5Ze.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe there\u0027s something you\u0027ve got your eye on and it\u0027s more than you can afford right now, or maybe you prefer a more long-term sort of support and want to do a smaller more regular thing.
