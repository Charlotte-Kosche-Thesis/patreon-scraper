    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRetro Warriors is a weekly retro gaming podcast hosted by Justin Baker and Chris Saturn. While other podcasts seem to focus on the historical aspect, we treat our show as more of a celebration of retro gaming. Anyone can read a Wikipedia article, we aim to give listeners something that\u2019s both fun and informative to listen to. But mostly fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve been podcasting together for around five years now, and Retro Warriors is now well over a year old. It\u0027s by far the most popular show we\u0027ve ever done, and we\u0027d like to continue that growth with your help. We\u0027ve dabbled in just about everything with Retro Warriors: YouTube videos, Twitch streaming, even a full-blown magazine. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon Campaign?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe spend a lot of time working on endeavors for Retro Warriors, but life continues to get in the way. Babies, marriages, jobs, mortgages, bills, and all kinds of things mean we have limited time to work on what we love. Additionally, the show in its current form actually costs us money to do. As it stands we pay yearly costs to maintain our domain, monthly hosting costs for the show, and occasional equipment costs. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn short, it\u0027s becoming increasingly difficult to warrant (to both Justin\u0027s spouse and Saturn\u0027s employer) spending so much time on something that continues to leave us in the red. We absolutely love Retro Warriors and we will always find a way to continue to do it regardless of the circumstances, but with your help it can become something much, much bigger. We can do the show for free, and if we\u0027re extra lucky, reach our milestones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Not Just Run Ads?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s not that we\u0027re against ad revenue per se, but we don\u0027t think it\u0027s a fit for the kind of show we do. We don\u0027t want to become beholden to any corporate entities, and we enjoy being able to say whatever we please about any product or company we encounter. We want you to know that you\u0027re getting our full, honest opinions on the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do this because we\u0027re passionate about it. Any money we get for it should go towards supporting the show and making more content for \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love doing the show, we\u0027re ready to grow, and we want to take you along for the ride. As we begin this new chapter our weekly podcast will continue, ad-free, and we will begin integrating new features and content as we reach our milestones.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut, don\u0027t just take our word for it. Go check out our show and our magazine! Both are free and ad-free, and can be found at our \u003ca href=\"http://retrowarriors.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
