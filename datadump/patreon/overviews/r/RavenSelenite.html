I want everyone within the Patreon community to be able to have some amount of access to me, more so that through just YouTube, so you will all gave a link to my Facebook Group and well as the Patreon Community board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be offering different types of YouTube Coaching, where you will get a weekly check in email from me personally, be able to ask me direct questions or ask for community advise through Mastermind Groups, Channel Reviews and monthly 1 to 1 coaching sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the payments set to per Patreon Dedicated Video (1 each week) but this does not mean that you have to pay 4x your pledge amount each month if you can not afford it. You can set a limit on your donation to an amount, such as $10 or $4 and Patreon will not charge you for any other videos after your limit is reached, but you will still get all the rewards for the donation tier you are in. I have done this to give you some flexibility with how much you can personally afford, but I ask you to remember that my time is also valuable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
