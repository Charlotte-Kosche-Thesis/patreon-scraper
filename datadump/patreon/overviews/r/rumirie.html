I also have a hand made jewelry and accessory shop called Nature Tales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram was the first platform where I learned that it was ok for me to show my artwork to strangers and be accepted for what I loved to create. I was able to meet great and supportive friends and artists also going through the same struggles I was going through in terms of creating work. Displaying my art this way also allowed me to create an environment where I could exchange with others everything that ive come to learn about drawing and painting as well as gain inspiration that would help to turn me into the artist I am today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was also through this exchange that I learned about Patreon and the opportunity I could have to extend my artistic outreach even further and hopefully connect with an audience who could help me grow even more as an artist. Thank you in advance to all of you who are so kind and generous enough to join and support me as my patrons! I\u0027m excited to share my work with you and delve deeper into my artistic journey! Also, thank you to those of you who have always been there for me! You are all a huge support and I appreciate it greatly!"
