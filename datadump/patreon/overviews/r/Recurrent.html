I am just a friendly artist who likes to try her hand at \nall sorts of things, including digital artwork, animation, comics, and even crafting fursuits! I have considered myself a furry since a young age and a couple years ago I became much more open about being a part of the fandom and it has made me a much happier person since then. I greatly enjoy drawing furry artwork and bringing people\u0027s fursonas and fantasies to life through my artwork. I have become obsessed with drawing transformation artwork (usually turning people into furries/ferals or furries into other animals) more recently and I hope to draw a lot more as I continue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goal\u003c/strong\u003e for this Patreon is to help fund being able to continue living comfortably while allowing plenty of time to continue doing artwork. With these funds I will be able to spend more time on my artwork and try some new bigger projects I don\u0027t currently have time to. One of these bigger projects I would like to try to start would be a simple flash based furry game, either with a transformation theme or sexual theme (or why not both?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e for this Patreon will be to do sketches and\n colored sketches. Which will be offered with a theme at least once a \nmonth. The themes will vary from particular types of characters, species, body part focus, and even fan art themes. Each theme will be chosen in such a way that is can easily be used for transformation artwork or for just standard furry art as well. The sketches may be traditional or digital and will vary from sketch to sketch. Each subscriber will receive at least one sketch as specified by their tier per month and pontenially bonus sketches as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii560/the_recurrent/Patreon%20Sketch%20Examples_zpschymqsxn.png\" style=\"width: 854px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
