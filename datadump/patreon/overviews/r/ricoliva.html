    "summary": "I was fortunate enough to have many wonderful guitar teachers in my life. One of them, Tom Brown, wanted desperately to live in a world where music was free.\u00a0Music is just vibrating\u00a0air, right?\u00a0His friends and family (and students) would say, \"that\u0027s great, Tom, but you still have to eat!\" At the time of his passing in 2009 he was still only charging $12 per hour for lessons. I had the good fortune to teach private guitar lessons for 18 years and spent several years teaching at both the West Bank School of Music in Minneapolis, MN and McNally Smith College of Music in St. Paul, MN. I have a B.M. from Berklee and my M.M. in Music Education from Boston University and\u00a0although I am no longer teaching, I still have a passion for it and wanted to find a way I could honor Tom\u0027s memory by giving \"free\" lessons. The videos will be posted online free of charge, and if you find them helpful and would like to continue to support the creation of more please sign up to be a patron of my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also getting back into writing and performing music. I semi-retired a few years back as finding work/life balance was difficult when doing 100+ gigs/year. Your patronage will also help me to hire musicians to record and play my original tunes, which I will then share with the world. This will be a secondary focus of this page, but I still wanted to throw it out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by and for your continued support!\u003cbr\u003e-Ric\u003cbr\u003e"
