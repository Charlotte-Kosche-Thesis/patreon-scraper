While working both physically and remotely I have experienced everything that goes into operating a small office from daily/monthly reports, customer service and interaction, office supply purchasing, technology evaluation and implementation, renewals to the yearly 5500. I am now committed to 100% remote processing and remote assistance in the Insurance Industry. I continue to evaluate new technology and how it can be implemented to make workflows and the insurance industry a more efficient, effective and most importantly a more profitable place to be by eliminating useless hiccups in a workflow. Lastly I love to LEARN!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you ready to infuse your Agency with new techniques, technology and fresh ideas? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTemp Agency employees typically have very little experience in the Industry and unfortunately lack the attention to detail required when completing important tasks to daily insurance routines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother option is hiring a new trainee which comes at excessive logistical and financial costs such as health insurance, workers compensation, training, 401k, vacation days, commutes, family emergencies, the list goes on!\u00a0They distract your fully functioning employees from completing their tasks each day as they ask questions to learn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of your workflows are undoubtedly antiquated and require a little bit of technological love to get running right as rain. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo any of your employees print an application and fill it out by hand, re-scan it to email or worse mail or fax it to a company for quoting?\u00a0It would save significant time if it were digitized so it could be filled in on the computer. Sometimes applications come from a company or brokerage  as a Microsoft Word document and as you fill it out the layout gets bamboozled. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you want some tasks just DONE by a seasoned industry professional without the extra baggage?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere can you hire an experienced insurance industry professional tasked for just a few hours every month? These are professionals and expect full blown salaries and may not necessarily live near you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook no further, review some of the tasks I have experience with below that can help infuse your Agency with bursts of excited energy every month.
