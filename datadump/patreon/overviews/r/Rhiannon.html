We have an apartment now, but we are still on government assistance, and I HATE it.\u003cbr\u003eI intend to get my family off of assistance completely, and fully support us (keep us well fed, clothed and happy) with my art sales by May 15, 2015.\u003cbr\u003eI paint every single day. Motivation is not my problem, exposure is. I need money in order to spread the word about my art.\u003cbr\u003eIn return for making a pledge, I will not only make my daily videos for you to see my paintings in process, but I will also give to each of my supporters, a high resolution digital file of each of my paintings. This will enable you to make prints of my paintings and use them for anything you like, as long as you give me credit for the original - remember my goal is to spread the word and make art sales!\u003cbr\u003eThe world will be a better place with my art in it, help me to get it out there."

I made art whenever I could, but I had my hands pretty full with my job as a stay at home mom.\u003cbr\u003eAfter my third child was born, my husband started drinking very heavily and became abusive toward me. I left with my children while he was at work and for five months we lived in a shelter.\u003cbr\u003eIn the shelter I had a small watercolor set and a 9X12\" pad and I painted every single day. I found an apartment in May of 2011. Even though it was project based housing, I was so happy that my children and I were no longer homeless.\u003cbr\u003eI started pouring all of my time and energy into painting, and to this day my entire day, every day is spent painting and trying to market my art. To this day, I work extremely hard not only on my art, but on improving as an artist, getting my art into the world and of course taking care of my family (which now includes my fiance and his son). \u003cbr\u003eWe all live in a nicer apartment now, but we are still on government assistance, and I hate that feeling. I don\u0027t want to be a taker anymore, it feels like I\u0027m being a drain on society.\u003cbr\u003eI am making more money with my art each year, but not enough to support my family. I will make a full time living with my art, I\u0027m determined.",
