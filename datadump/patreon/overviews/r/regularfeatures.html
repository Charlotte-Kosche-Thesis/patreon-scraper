    "summary": "Hello reader,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are four men who do a free podcast show on the internet called \n\u003cstrong\u003eRegular Features\u003c/strong\u003e, and we would like your support. Hey-ohhhh.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur names are Jon Blyth, Gav Murphy, Steve Hogarty and Matt Lees, and we\u0027ve been doing our podcast for about three years. \u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s over 100 episodes, or one episode roughly every one and a half weeks. Given an average length of 45 minutes per episode, the time we\u0027ve spent recording Regular Features amounts to 300 man hours. That\u0027s more than twelve days, or one quarter of a bee\u0027s entire life. Between sleeping in his bee bed, shagging the queen bee and spunking out bee honey, that\u0027s \u003cem\u003eall of the bee\u0027s spare time taken up\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3yoKYvX.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven knowing about the bee thing, we\u0027re probably not going to stop making a free podcast any time soon. \u003c/strong\u003eWe like doing it too much and it\u0027s lots of fun. But it\u0027s recently become more difficult and expensive for the four of us to get together. There was a golden age when we all worked in the same office and could abuse the recording facilities by being friendly to the receptionist, but that\u0027s all changed now. We\u0027ve been spread out across the globe, like the kids in Captain Planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLog\u0027s moved to Nottingham and requires constant ferrying back and forth. Then there are more boring things like microphones, hosting and the miles and miles of bunting we insist on setting up before each recording. Some of these are one-time costs, others are on-going. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd\u00a0because we spend a lot of time preparing, writing, recording and then (for one of us, we take turns) a whole evening editing, we have less time to do other jobs that actually pay our bills and rent. We\u0027re busy, like the bee from the second paragraph.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe would like you to support us in creating more episodes if you feel that what we do is worth paying for. \u003c/strong\u003eOur goal is to continue making a weekly podcast published every Thursday, exactly like how a professional podcast does it, and to help us achieve that we are asking you to pledge as much or as little as you like towards each episode. Patreon works a bit like a rolling Kickstarter. You decide an amount to pay per episode, and you only pay when the episode launches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s it.\u003c/strong\u003e You don\u0027t even have to pledge, you\u0027ll still get Regular Features either way, but by pledging you\u0027ll be helping us make better features more regularly. We\u0027ll even have special privileges for those who donate, such as priority access to our live shows, entry into a monthly on-air tombola prize draw and personalised birthday cards we\u0027ve touched with our lips, just so those who \u003cem\u003edon\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e pay feel even worse about themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThanks for reading\u003cbr\u003e\nx\n\u003cbr\u003e"
