I\u0027ve been an avid movie lover since I was 10 and have been overjoyed to share my enthusiasm with my daughter as she has grown up. We don\u0027t just watch movies for the entertainment value, we watch them for the lessons, the insights, and the emotional value they offer. In short, movies can teach us by providing an experience that we normally wouldn\u0027t have - the excitement of a daring adventure, the grief of losing a beloved character, or the joy of a happy ending. We love these experiences - it\u0027s our favorite topic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRay\u0027s Reel Review is our outlet for reviewing new and old movies, recommending gems you may have missed, and discussing news and rumors on upcoming releases. Our goal is to take our passion and make it our lifestyle. Celeste is also looking to use this channel as an educational tool as she learns more about making and editing her own videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support helps us spend more time doing what we love.\u00a0We couldn\u0027t do it without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
