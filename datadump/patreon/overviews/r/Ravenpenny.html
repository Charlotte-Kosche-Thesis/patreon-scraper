I haunt the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteve Jackson Games\u003c/a\u003e forums.\nRPG.net forums, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGURPS\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Discord as \u201cGhostdancer,\u201d where I answer questions about\nmy favorite game engine(s) that folks may have. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to get in touch with those who\nfollow my work on Patreon, to see what sorts of things they\u2019d like to see me\nproduce \u2013 for them, \u003cem\u003ePyramid,\u003c/em\u003e my blog,\nor even their personal use.

The more\npatrons I have the more often I\u0027ll release a Patreon Special. Think of them as\nmini-supplements (because that\u0027s basically what they are). If I hit specific\nreward tiers then these specials will eventually become available to everyone\nand patrons will both decide what is released and get early access.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nReal Talk:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e if you\u2019re wondering, \u201cwhy not\njust keep them available?\u201d I have done that in the past and the result is that\nsome (not all) patrons do a \u201cdine and dash.\u201d They grab everything from the\nprevious months, cancel their patronage, and I\u2019m left hanging in the wind.\nThat\u2019s soured me a bit. I like to think that\u2019s a rarity and that if you\u2019re\npatronizing me it\u2019s because you want to see me succeed, but this is the way\nit\u2019s got to me be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn a personal note,\nmy sole source of income is what I make freelancing. Being diabetic means that\na good chunk of that money goes into supplies that I need to stay healthy and\nalive \u2013 so please, consider becoming a patron and supporting my blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
