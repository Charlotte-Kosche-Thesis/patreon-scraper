He made a move into urban farming after purchasing a house in\nIpswich Queensland in 2002. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\ninitial water saving wicking bed gardens quickly expanded to include fruit\ntrees, chickens, composting, vermiculture, and aquaculture and aquaponic\nsystems. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith\nfamily still living in New South Wales, Rob started to share his urban farming\nactivities through his Bits Out the Back blog site and videos posted to his\nYouTube channel Rob Bob\u0027s Backyard Farming. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn\nas little as 5 years his YouTube channel subscriber base had grown  from just family and friends, to over 70,000\nviewers from all over the world \u0026amp; his urban farming videos have received\nover 11 million views..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRob\npassion for food sharing has expanded to the group Share the Seed Australia, a\nseed saving \u0026amp; sharing group on Facebook. The aim of the group is to share\nseeds people save from their own plants with other like-minded Australians. The\ngroup encourages people to start growing their own food or to support those\nthat are interested in growing plants they never would have thought to grow\nbefore. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough\nthis group, Rob was proud to assist the creators of Share the Seed America in\nsetting up their own Facebook seed sharing group. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRob\nhas a qualification in Permaculture Design from Geoff Lawton and uses his\nexperiences and knowledge to apply these principles where he can. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
