What started with a child\u0027s fan-fiction followed by the inevitable dive into high-fantasy epics (or at least, what seemed like epics at the time), has turned into a complete obsession for stories of all kinds. It has become so engrained in me that a part of my life feels empty when not immersed in writing of some sort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/c6lm0gvhoacrb4u/Patreon%20Banner%20-%20Why%20Short%20Stories.png?dl=0\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nShort stories let me take a break from my larger and more intensive projects and simply let my creativity run free. They let me practice and hone my skills. They\u0027ve let me finish things and release them. But perhaps most importantly, they\u0027ve given me the opportunity to spread my creative wings a little and try new and different things. Genres and writing styles, tenses and story-structure, if any element helps to reinforce the theme I want to communicate, then I\u2018m not afraid to use it. I may even branch out more, and do some small multicast productions, or something else entirely. It all depends on the story, so be ready for anything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ciframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/166389777\u0026amp;color=ff5500\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/wcvqo225vzsh3pu/Patreon%20-%20Blurb.png?dl=0\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/7q2vn73m9fzrvzl/Patreon%20Banner%20-%20Why%20Audio.png?dl=0\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve always enjoyed listening to things, and I know I\u2019m not alone. The immersive qualities of music and sound is undeniably powerful when combined with the telling of a good story. And as for me, coming from a background of  running sound for stage dramas and other local events, adding audio to complement my stories just seemed like the natural progression. Why not? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve heard many people say that the age of audio dramas is over, and specifically, that film has completely replaced our need for them. I don\u2018t believe that. I believe audio stories are making a resurgence, and the flexibility of being able to listen while on the go, or while multitasking solidifies it as a medium that will never truly become obsolete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/f9puhlsj4idwmde/Patreon%20Banner%20-%20%20Why%20Patreon.png?dl=0\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tUnlike other crowd-funding websites, where you pledge a lot of money upfront, Patreon is a website where you make small recurring pledges every month (or in my case, each time a story is released) to an artist or creator that excites you (again, hopefully me). While I did briefly consider using Kickstarter for my larger budget projects, as soon as I discovered Patreon I knew I was home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tTo pledge your support (and a big thank you for even considering it), simply hit the \u201cbecome a patron\u201d button, set the amount you wish to give each time a story is released, and, if applicable, select a corresponding reward. You are also given the ability to set a monthly max, so you won\u2019t go over budget if I somehow miraculously mange to release multiple stories in a month (99.97% chance of never happening).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI would also like make clear that I\u2019m not charging for these stories, they will be free to listen to no matter what. I\u2019m merely asking that if you enjoy what you hear, you would consider supporting me, and we\u2019ll see if we can\u2019t get you some extra goodies along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- - - - - - -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThank you for reading and even considering supporting me, and for those who can\u0027t or won\u0027t pledge anything, I hope that you will at least stick around and enjoy some free audio stories! Money\u0027s great and all, but it\u0027s the people we meet and the friendships we make on this strange journey called life that are by far the most important things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
