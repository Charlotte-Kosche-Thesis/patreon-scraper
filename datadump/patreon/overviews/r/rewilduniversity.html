There\u0027s nothing like taking people out into the woods to practice these life-changing skills for themselves! Yet we\u0027ve found that our videos\ncan have a very far reach, and can make powerful\ndifferences in people\u0027s lives. Of course, we never have and never will put advertisements on our videos. We want people to have an ad-free experience where they can solely concentrate on the video\u0027s messages. We don\u0027t get money from YouTube or Adsense or affiliate links. We are supported solely by people like you.

Although we ask people to pay for the course if they\ncan, we also happily offer it for free to anyone who asks.
