But I\u0027ve spent the last several years doing freelance and odd jobs and it is a constant hustle. You\u0027re usually spending half your time doing jobs that vastly underpay, and the other half looking for new ones, just to make rent. It\u0027s not an original story, and it\u0027s one many of us live, but it\u0027s also one that makes it very difficult to find time to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I give you money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I have a cute dog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s18.postimg.org/ph0sn3fi1/Screen_Shot_2015_11_24_at_1_22_33_PM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so...what does my pledge go towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, the simplest answer for this is \u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e. I have steady freelance gigs I do on a weekly or monthly basis, and I have projects that come up every few months (and pay...sporadically), but the less time I have to spend combing through freelance sites looking for a bunch of $30 jobs to make up the difference for my monthly expenses, the more time I can spend writing instead.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIdeally, I\u0027d love for Patreon to become a way to fund projects I want to create myself, rather than fund my basic living situation. That won\u0027t happen right away, but the more time I can spend hustling for writing jobs that get me somewhere rather than odd-jobs-that-pay-the-bills, the more likely this will be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eUm. But how do we know you\u0027re actually writing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of the writing that I do is screenwriting, which makes it really weird to have a Patreon, because you may not see the vast majority of things that I\u0027m working on for months or years, or maybe ever, unless I also find funding to turn them into films or series. But at the very least, they are things that make me better at writing, or that get me jobs, which turn into things you see.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, I do write a fair number of short stories and drabbles just for fun, or as a way to work through script ideas I have before I actually start writing the scripts themselves. I don\u0027t usually post these anywhere because they\u0027re often a little unpolished or things that are likely to be expanded on in the future, but I\u0027m going to include them as a perk for patrons. PROOF I\u0027M DOING SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re a writer, why is there a YouTube channel linked?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve also started going back to directing things very recently, and I would like to continue to do that. When I am able to (read: have the funds), these things will likely go on my channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, sometimes I just like making random YouTube videos for fun, and I hope to be able to do more of that in the near future. In a sense, if you\u0027re funding my time, you\u0027re also funding that, but it does come in third priority to writing and trying to launch new scripted projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9idyoAOgfs\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you a terrible person?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSometimes. But hopefully that makes my writing more interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
