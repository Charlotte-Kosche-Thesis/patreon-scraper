    "summary": "Hey there, come on in. \u00a0Pull up whatever looks comfortable. \u00a0I\u0027m ryivhnn, it\u0027s pronounced kind of like river with an n at the end. \u00a0The lack of vowels gets some people, so you can just call me fyn. \u00a0There\u0027s no vowels at all in that one but it\u0027s easier on the brain :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on this universe inside my head, have been since 2002 when it exploded into being. \u00a0It spans about 2000 years at the moment, give or take. \u00a0There\u0027s a lot of characters with a lot of stories in there, and I want to tell them all. \u00a0It\u0027s been slow going as I\u0027ve been working around a lot of things (running a business part time with the best sibling ever, homeschooling three kids and trying to run a house, occasionally pretending I\u0027m a sociable person with a social life), and I\u0027d like it to move faster so I can get these stories out of my head and into other people\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current \"block\" I\u0027m working on is two seasons long. \u00a0First season has been written and I\u0027m currently making all the 3d, and will then need to source some voice actors. \u00a0Second season is in the works. \u00a0It involves some Royals and Royal Guard, some thieves and vigilantes, some drug lords, encounters and explorations of familiar issues and wars of various scales. \u00a0It\u0027s set about 2000 years in the future, with technology not too far out of reach of where we are at the moment, and thanks to a solar flare and a passing comet a number of people look quite different to what we\u0027re used to (and some look exactly the same). \u00a0I\u0027ve been told it\u0027s along the lines of dramatic sci-fi with possible fantasy elements but I\u0027ll let you decide :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to put anyone out too much, so if you can spare a dollar to help me work on these stories, I would be really very quite grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I need to do this? Experience (okay so it took way too long as I am a helper not so much a helpee) has shown that I can\u0027t get anywhere fast doing what I have been doing (and this is even without the number of times I have rewritten scripts, redeveloped characters and redone base models because \"this one is better!\"). \u00a0With your help I can spend less time on trying to make money doing other things and spend more time on this, which means I may be able to get all of the stories done! That would be awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you? Warm fuzzies aplenty! And the patreon-only feed. \u00a0It\u0027s where the good stuff is. \u00a0See, all these stories are going to be freely available for anyone to watch/read (I think some of them might end up being comics, at least one is hypertext, most are probably going to be animated), and I freely post works in progress to my blog and various art sites. \u00a0The super special top secret patreon-only feed however will have much more frequent updates, including detail screen shots, test renders, animated samples (when I get to them), extracts from \u003cem\u003eThe History of the World \u003c/em\u003e(that would be the 200+ page document that I had to convert to a wiki that timelines the lives of all the characters and major events that have shaped cultures in my head-universe) and dev notes. \u00a0All this raw, molten hot stuff straight out of my head. \u00a0Or at least in a much less refined form than it will get released in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, how many other opportunities do you have to be involved with/privy to an animation series from the early stages?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you are able to contribute to the higher level tiers, you get also get commissions from me and the option to design outfits and/or crowd/background characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInterested?
