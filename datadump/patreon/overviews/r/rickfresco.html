A soundpack is a pack of 16 or more audio samples specifically designed to work well together and ready to be used in many ways (live performance, live remixing or just finger-drumming fun!). In other terms you could say a soundpack is almost like a song in which all the instruments have been separated, and you get to re-arrange them your own way! Each soundpack will be released in many formats so that EVERYONE CAN USE THEM, so don\u0027t worry, if you don\u0027t have a midi controller you can still play my soundpacks on your iPad or your iPhone... or even on your computer keyboard!\u003cbr\u003eOf course creating these soundpacks requires an incredible amount of time and efforts that anyone can\u0027t afford on his own, unless he\u0027s doing it on a professional level.\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work and have fun playing my stuff, and if you\u2019d like me to keep on making it, please consider giving me a dollar (or however much you like) for each soundpack that I make!\u00a0Any money you\u0027ll pledge will give straight support to me and my work, letting me to spend my time doing what I really love to do: making music and designing soundpacks for you guys!\u003cbr\u003eI will be releasing a series of originals, remixes, and mashups as Rick Fresco or BAD iDEA (my duo project), as well as video tutorials and some other cool stuff. However your donations will only be claimed on my soundpacks, the ones I know you truly love! I\u0027ll be uploading a couple of soundpacks per month, sometimes more, sometimes less.\u00a0Don\u0027t worry though! If you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget,\u00a0there\u0027s an easy way to set a monthly maximum for yourself when you\u0027re entering your payment info,\u00a0so that you never donate more than you can afford!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you sign up to be a Patron, you\u0027ll get plenty of cool rewards!
