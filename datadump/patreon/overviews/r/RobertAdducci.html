Every member at every pledge level will get 1 Scavenger 2 hour game to learn about and experience the world. In addition, all members at the $10 level and above will have the opportunity to play in open world Scavenger games (subject to availability).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO, what is Scavenger? Scavenger is a setting for 5th edition. From the mind and artistic skills of Alexandru Negoita (a video game art industry veteran with Electronic Arts, Gameloft, \u0026amp; King), Scavenger is a beautifully illustrated artbook and campaign setting for 5th edition set in a ravaged world with a gateway to other dimensions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlexandru and I met after I saw his amazing art, he mentioned that he wanted to create this world in art and needed someone to write it. We struck an agreement and I am taking the lead on designing the world setting and 5th edition rules for it. Alexandru has agreed to let us use the setting in an open world campaign to flesh it out and let you, my patrons inflict change upon the world in a way not seen before. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will this work?\u003c/strong\u003e Essentially we\u0027ll create a small \"west-marches\" style game where the players lead the action and follow the plots they want to explore. There will be intrigue in the city-state of Raddak and exploration in the alien Relic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho can play? \u003c/strong\u003eAll patrons will get a taste of this game when they first sign up and then patrons of $10+ will have the opportunity to play up to 4 hours of content a month as seats are available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho will be DMing?\u003c/strong\u003eI will be running some of these games, two 3-4 hour games per month, but we\u0027ll need more than myself to handle all of the players. I need help from you, my patrons, to step up and DM. Not only will you be DMing, but you\u0027ll be contributing to the campaign and the setting as a whole. For each hour of game time run you\u0027ll get an hour of game time to play in any Patreon game be they my AO\u0027s/LostTales/AL Campaigns/DarkSun or Scavenger games. Time spent outside of DMing (such as organizing the campaign) will also net you play hours. I\u0027ve already been talking with Tadd (a patron) and he\u0027s agreed to help and DM. If you\u0027re interested, please shoot me a message through Discord or Patreon. If you haven\u0027t run games on Fantasy Grounds before, don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll have some how to sessions and slot 0 games for you as a DM.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen/how will these games happen?\u003c/strong\u003eThese games will start in January, the effective day for the patron changes for this patreon since we charge monthly.
