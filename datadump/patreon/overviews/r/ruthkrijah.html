    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello dear one \u003c/strong\u003e\u2665 \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m honoured you are here and welcome you to this little family of hopeful dreamers and wild souls on patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you are completely new to my art: My name is Ruth, I\u0027m 28, I live in Vienna (Austria) and create portraits of dreams and wild women. I haven\u0027t always called myself an artist, in fact it took six exhausting years of cultural and business studies, a slightly toxic relationship and chronic illness for me to make the cut and come back to this teenage dream of mine in 2014. Since then I have embarked on a journey of inner healing, figuring out how dreams work in real life and staying consistent with what feels good. My art is just about that - infusing our deepest dreams and desires with the blissful, loving energy we need to make them happen and what it means to become a fully embodied woman in the process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis patreon campaign is meant to support both of us\u003c/strong\u003e: Your pledge supports me with transitioning into making art full-time - and I share inspiration, real talk and small sweet pieces to lift you up and give you hope and courage to take your next step. Patreon is a new way of crowdfunding for creatives, but unlike Kickstarter and Indiegogo it is set up as an ongoing project. It allows artists to have a stable financial foundation that ensures their best work - and their loving fans to connect on a deeper level and be part of the whole process. Basically, it works like a subscription service and you can opt in and out any time that feels right to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ruthkrijah.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/patreon-minigrafiken-1704-01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe art is about connection, empowerment and healing - both for the artist and the appreciator. And this kind of art should be accessible to everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is not a paywall - a lot of the finished pieces, sketches and learnings will always be free to view on my website,\nblog and social media. Whatever reward you choose - \u003cstrong\u003eas my Patron you ensure that I can keep making art\u003c/strong\u003e and for that\nyou have my deepest heartfelt gratitude. Your support means that I can create freely and do not have to depend on anyone else but the people who need to see and have this kind of art in their life \u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTo show you\nmy appreciation I host patreon-only activities and there are gifts just for\nyou\u003c/strong\u003e. Dreams love the company of other Dreams, so this is the space where we can talk about all of it. You can check out the monthly rewards on the right sidebar, they include updates \non my creative journey, links to resources I find useful, you can get \nexclusive sneak peeks and early access to art I create, downloads to \nbeautify your everyday life and make focusing on your dream easy and \nwonderful, plus more.  Whenever we reach a milestone (see \"goals\", left sidebar) we will be\nholding a patrons-only celebration with little treasures for you to\nkeep forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy\nintention for this space is for it to be nurturing and supportive of all our Dreams. Let\u2019s make them happen \u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ruthkrijah.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/170214_web-kl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou can sign up for your favourite reward on the right sidebar by clicking on the button \"get $__ reward\". You can always change the amount of your pledge later. It\u0027s a monthly subscription and rewards are posted during the month (sharings) or early the following month (most of the downloads). Join in and opt out whenever you feel like. This is an ongoing\nproject. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me: hello@ruthkrijah.com. Can\u0027t wait to hear from you and walk part of the journey with you *.*\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
