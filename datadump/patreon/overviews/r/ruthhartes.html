    "summary": "I grew up trying to think of anything I could be besides an artist, and especially anything but a painter. Even when I came to art school, part of me still hoped I\u0027d find something I loved more than painting that was also maybe a little \"practical\". Years later, still a painter (and an abstract one too) but something did change. Now I never want to be anything else. Finding Patreon was an incredible thrill, I love having my own little gallery. So many things in my artwork have developed in ways I never would have guessed simply because I have a place for my work. People like me owe everything to groups like this because they give us a real chance to live on what we love. I never dreamed I\u0027d have that chance. Thank you to Patreon and all Patrons!"
