    "summary": "Basically,\nI\u2019m seeking patrons to continue the wide range of literary cultural work I\u2019ve\nbeen involved in for more than two decades. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince\nthe early 1990s, I\u2019ve been an active writer of poetry, fiction, essays,\nreviews, creative non-fiction and interviews. I\u2019ve had thirty trade books\n(poetry, fiction and non-fiction) produced in half a dozen countries, and I\u2019ve\nperformed and published internationally. The work is incredibly rewarding, but\nhas become financially more difficult to sustain. Obviously, I consider the\nwork required to discuss new work to be important, as well as the ongoing\nengagement required to produce original literary work. As a working artist, the\nstudy of art itself is life-long, and constantly evolving.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nhaven\u2019t (nor have I ever sought) teaching in a University or any other type of\ntraditional employment. I write; this is what I do. The only way I understand\nhow to produce the best work possible is to be completely immersed in it, and the\nshift into full-time parenting in the fall of 2014 has done little to reduce my\noutput, per se, yet has focused my attention.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nObviously\nI am a writer first (after being a parent, obviously), and everything else\nsecond, but still wish to be doing what I see as the essential work of\nreviewing, interviewing, critiquing, publishing and promoting the work of\nothers. And of course, my own writing as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince 2003, I\u2019ve posted hundreds upon hundreds of book and chapbook reviews,\ncritical essays, author interviews and other daily notices over at my blog:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.robmclennan.blogspot.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.robmclennan.blogspot.ca/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince\nSeptember 2007, I\u2019ve also been conducting numerous interviews, such as the\nhundreds of interviews with writers of poetry, fiction, non-fiction and graphic\nnovels through my \u201c12 or 20 questions\u201d series:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.robmclennansindex.blogspot.ca/2009/06/12-or-20-questions-second-series.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.robmclennansindex.blogspot.ca/2009/06/12-or-20-questions-second-series.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs\nwell as a series of \u201c12 or 20 (small press) questions,\u201d featuring literary\npublishers:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.robmclennansindex.blogspot.ca/2010/03/12-or-20-small-press-questions-third.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.robmclennansindex.blogspot.ca/2010/03/12-or-20-small-press-questions-third.html\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ongoing bibliography of Ottawa-area literary magazines and presses:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.robmclennansindex.blogspot.ca/2015/07/bibliography-of-ottawa-literary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.robmclennansindex.blogspot.ca/2015/07/bibliography-of-ottawa-literary.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFurther\ninterviews exist on the blog for the poetry journal \u003cem\u003eTouch the Donkey\u003c/em\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.touchthedonkey.blogspot.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.touchthedonkey.blogspot.ca/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy\nextensive series of critical pieces, for example, \u201cCommentaries on Canadian\nPoetry,\u201d appeared online at \u003cem\u003eJacket2\u003c/em\u003e\nduring the first three months of 2015:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://jacket2.org/commentary/rob-mclennan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://jacket2.org/commentary/rob-mclennan\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been curating a weekly \"Tuesday poem\" series over at the dusie blog for a couple of years now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://dusie.blogspot.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://dusie.blogspot.ca/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOne of my spring 2016 projects included interviewing as many of the forty years\u0027 worth of writers-in-residence at the University of Alberta as part of their anniversary year:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.robmclennansindex.blogspot.ca/2016/01/university-of-alberta-writers-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.robmclennansindex.blogspot.ca/2016/01/university-of-alberta-writers-in.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also blogging a monthly \"spotlight,\" featuring new work by a variety of poets:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@robmclennan\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/@robmclennan\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd blogging monthly for Ploughshares:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/author/robmclennan/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://blog.pshares.org/index.php/author/robmclennan/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile\nI see this kind of cultural work essential, most of this work is, of course, entirely unpaid.\u003cbr\u003e"
