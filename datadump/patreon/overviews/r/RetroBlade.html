This is why most comics have teams of people working on them, and big corporations funding them (at least up until recently). Indie comics are only recently starting to gain traction, and it\u0027s all down to fan support.\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Day jobs\u0027 and spending years working long hours in crappy minimum wage jobs just to survive has been one reason RetroBlade has taken so long to get rolling.\u00a0I\u0027m giving it my all to finally get this off the ground, and it\u0027s going really well so far, but this project will need some help to be sustainable for the long term!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, paying for web-hosting, buying equipment and software, getting to conventions- those are just some of the things that Patreon helps towards. Creating this comic is my dream, and I\u0027ve waited a really long time to be able to start this. I was never in a privileged enough position before, but now I have the tools and ability, I\u0027m so grateful to have gotten this far at last. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m offering RetroBlade for free on the website because I know what it\u0027s like to be too broke to even tip.\u00a0I\u0027m not making this to get rich (lol, obviously), I\u0027m doing it for the sheer love and enthusiasm I have for this project, for indie comics in general and for the freedom to share a more unique perspective than the mainstream. Creating and sharing this story brings me joy and meaning and I hope it gives others the same thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://retrobladecomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Magnus2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027m also doing it for the blingin\u0027 gold armour.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging on any of the tiers to the right, you directly support RetroBlade\u0027s production and help to ensure it\u0027s future update schedule.\u00a0Any amount pledged, for any length of time- it\u0027s all good \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what are the Rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron, not only are you supporting the comic, you\u0027re also eligible for rewards!\u003cbr\u003eThese range from \u003cstrong\u003eearly page updates, behind the scenes sketches, inks, higher resolution pages without text, \u003c/strong\u003eand\u003cstrong\u003e credits on the main website\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003ca href=\"http://retrobladecomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.retrobladecomic.com\u003c/a\u003e).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges are monthly and RetroBlade updates weekly, so it\u0027s a pretty sweet deal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eALL patrons will receive \u003cstrong\u003ediscounts on future print books\u003c/strong\u003e of RetroBlade, the first one is planned for release this year (2017).\u00a0I usually include bonus rewards every month as well.
