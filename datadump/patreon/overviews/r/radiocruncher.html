    "summary": "Hi and thanks for viewing my Patreon page. I\u0027m very new to this so it\u0027s a work in progress. I have been producing videos on YouTube since February 2016. Mainly concentrating on repairing and restoring vintage radios. I hold a full Amateur Radio license so expect some content to reflect this. I do deviate from time to time depending on what is happening in my life. My partner and I live in North Devon, England in a tiny village. My channel has grown quickly with subscribers eagerly awaiting new instalments. At the end of September 2016 my contract at work came to an end. This is sad as I have really enjoyed working there but due to restructuring they no longer need me. The good news is that I am hopefully able to try to make a small contribution to the household bills via my YouTube channel. I will have a lot more time to produce lots of fresh content and have a huge collection of old radios to repair and restore. Parts and consumables are getting more expensive so I need my channel to be totally self sufficient. With this in mind I\u0027m looking to my viewing public to help out by supporting my channel. I\u0027m excited about this new venture and in return you will get unique content and sneak previews of what\u0027s coming up. Thanks for reading all this and see you on another video soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGraham"
