We work to bring the best in live broadcasting, edited podcasting and plenty of other ways to inform and entertain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, as many know, creating such media can be expensive. The equipment is costly, the programs are costly, and the education is about enough to crush someone\u0027s entire life. \u003cstrong\u003eWe are currently working in a monthly deficit\u003c/strong\u003e because we must keep Soundcloud Pro up. If we do not, previous podcasts will become lost. We have already lost some to this issue, and we don\u0027t want this to happen again. We work on a shoestring budget of basically nothing, and that\u0027s why we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating media is a part-time thing for us. We do it on the side when we can and no other time. However, we would love to do much more than that. We would love to bring you multiple podcasts a week, archive the podcasts on YouTube to grow an audience, archive them on SoundCloud for ease of play whenever you want, and bring you the best E3 coverage and analysis you could ask for, but we simply can\u0027t with the budget we have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help change this! You, oh Internet savior, can be the first step to making everything about ResetPress completely awesome simply by donating just a few dollars a month to get us the gear we need, to make sure we have the premium account we need for SoundCloud and plenty, plenty more. Check out what we do, enjoy, and consider throwing a few dollars our way.
