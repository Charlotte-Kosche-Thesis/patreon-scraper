And I \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e helping people bust sex and relationship myths that keep them from getting what they truly want out of life and love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an equal-opportunity hedonist and I value \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e forms of pleasure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that \u003cem\u003etrue\u003c/em\u003e pleasure improves us. Not the kind of quick, disposable rush given to us by a dopamine addiction, but the kind of deep, abiding pleasure that fills us up with energy, insight, and playfulness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether it\u0027s savoring a good cup of tea and conversation, or sex for fun (or sex for connection or sex for love-making), physically connecting with other evolved people is one of my favorite pleasure-savoring activities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a polyamorous woman. Polyamory means \"many loves\". I have a handful of play partners, some of whom I\u0027m dating, some of whom are friends with benefits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is something amazing about truly connecting with another human being and seeing who they truly are in order to deeply love and appreciate them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then to have them look back at you the same way? \u003cbr\u003eExquisite.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been blessed to have lots of sexy adventures in my life, and it\u0027s time to write them down, speak them out loud and share them with those of you who are eager to hear!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m ready to expand and help more people discover both the pleasure of sensuality and what it can add to their life, and show them how to communicate and negotiate the kind of partnerships that they have previously only fantasized of but never thought was actually possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... it\u0027s time for the book I\u0027ve been covertly writing and the podcast I\u0027ve been \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e-so-covertly recording to begin to see the light of day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the current vision:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e The Book(s)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is not a sensational, tell-all confessional.
