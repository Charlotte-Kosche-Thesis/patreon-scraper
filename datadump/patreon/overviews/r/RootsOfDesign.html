    "summary": "Hello, my name is Jeanette Wummel. I am the creative mind behind The Roots of Design. I create art, graphics, and fun coloring pages that help to satisfy your inner child. I currently have 9 self-published books and a bunch more to come out before the end of the year. I have been featured in many coloring book collections as well. I have created books for the publisher, St. Martin\u2019s Press. I have created some of their zendoodle books and color by number books.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Passion:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been on a life-long journey to share my art and imaginative passion with the world. I am at my best when I am able to express my creative side. I\u2019ve been creating art for as long as I can remember. I enjoy expressing my creative side by painting, drawing, coloring, or anything that has to do with art. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Purpose:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo create a digital coloring page subscription for the coloring pages I have design. I have been designing coloring pages since September of 2015. It started when I was trying to sell my black and white art prints and finding out everyone really wanted to color them. Since then I\u2019ve been hooked. It is a great outlet to express my creative side and I love seeing my art being enjoyed. This patron will also help to push myself as an artist. It will allow me to keep my skills fine-tuned and keep pushing me further to come up with new fun ideas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you get? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the level you choose you can get stickers, digital downloadable coloring pages, bookmarks, postcards, and even a special swag bag of fun items that change each month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the usage rules for the coloring pages?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs part of the coloring page subscription, you are granted permission to print out these images for your own personal coloring use only. Do not share the file online, or sell the PDF file or printed copies for profit, or any other commercial use. If you would like to obtain a license to use them for commercial use please contact me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat type of coloring pages do you make?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you look at my banner that will give you a good idea of some of the pages I make. You can also check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rootsdesign.etsy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e to see more. I like to make fun and sometimes silly pages. I really like to play with line weights and will use both thick and thin lines in my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a crowdfunding site like Kickstarter, but instead of pledging large donations to fund one massive project with a definite end goal, you make small monthly donations to an artist you love so they can work on fun projects you want to see!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon Work? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPeople give a monthly pledge to creators. You pick the reward level you want. For example if you pick the $1 level each month, Patreon would take $1, just like a subscription. If for some reason you aren\u2019t able to keep it up, you can cancel any time. I won\u2019t judge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou won\u0027t be charged until the 1st of every month, and it usually takes a full 72 hours for all pledges to process! You\u2019ll receive an email that will indicate whether your pledge was successfully processed or declined. Then I get to work on that month\u2019s rewards, which will shared for links to download here on a private blog just for your eyes or shipped out no later than the 25th of each month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat I\u2019ll use the money for:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo help keep my business going. It would help pay for hosting of my site, Facebook post boost ads and other business needs. Getting tools and materials needed to further my business so you will have more fun things. My current goal is to get a binding machine so that I can professionally bind some of my mini books myself. I want to have more free time to create new things for you to enjoy. A long term goal would to be able to hire a helper, since sometimes things get crazy over here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for any support you can offer if you decide to, and thank you so much for being a reader!\u003cbr\u003e"
