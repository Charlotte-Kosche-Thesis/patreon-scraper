    "summary": "Hello there! My name is Jeff and I am pursuing the closest thing I\u0027ve found to a calling yet: filmmaking! I\u0027ve only made a few comedic shorts so far, but I\u0027ve had a very positive response and I enjoy it more than anything else I\u0027ve tried in the past, which is actually a pretty long list of failures, each with their own existential crisis and unique journey into self-loathing. Here are just a few things I have learned are not me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ecook\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ewildland firefighter\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emartial arts instructor\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eband front man\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003epot dealer\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand many more!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I quit trying to have a day job and started writing, acting, and shooting as much as possible. I\u0027ve taken some community college classes and learned a good amount, but not as much as I have through the modest experience I already have, and I am hungry for more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time for me to expand my audience and to try to make a little money. It\u0027s obviously setting me back not working (I live with my girlfriend who has discouraged me from seeking traditional employment again and encouraged me to pursue this, but we still end up in the red each month because our city is fucking expensive), so I would like first to break even at the end of each month and then be able to spend a little more time and money on better videos, many of which are already written!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t seen my videos, here is my youtube channel:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaak39Dezo2aagNXgRSQi1Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaak39Dezo2aagNXg...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the only thing I feel good at, please support it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Jeff\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOwner and Founder of Riotworthy, LLC"
