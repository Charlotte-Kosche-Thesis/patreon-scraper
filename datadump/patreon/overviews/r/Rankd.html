We are a husband and wife team who do this because we just simply love it. Our biggest priority is \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003equality\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e in all aspects of RANKD. Therefore, that means that the story must be well written, the graphics must be there, and the editing should make it easy for viewers to follow along. We do this not only because we love it but because our viewers are very important to us. The videos we make center around crimes and the details in each case. We use only news reports or credible sources who have made the effort in interviewing those actually involved. We want to tell the entire TRUE story, we spend a lot of our time trying to decipher between false reports or click baits from the actual real stories. We do all of this to save our viewers the time in trying to find out the truth in this big world we call the internet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I have gotten that out of the way.
