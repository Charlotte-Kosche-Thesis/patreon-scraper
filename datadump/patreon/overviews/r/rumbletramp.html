We write a lot of songs about intimate dreams we have or roadkill in the gutter. We write about prison abolition, worker unionization and police violence. Sometimes we play as a duo and sometimes there is another person or two in the mix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is a way to support what we are doing and being put on a list to receive the stuff we make whenever its available. We make all of our own merch - print our own designs on CDs, print our own t-shirts, mail everything ourselves, etc. These donations help us continue to be able to do that, keep merch donation-based at shows, and to re-up our merchandise when we run out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrowdfunding isn\u0027t exactly an alternative to capitalist production, but as far as the economic exchanges we make in our daily lives goes it\u0027s pretty radical.
