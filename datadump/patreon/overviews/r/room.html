    "summary": "Sabrina Ward Harrison and I have been friends since Karen Mealiffe\u0027s high school art class. After high school we lost touch for several years. Sabrina published some pretty fantastic books and I... did stuff too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDuring a holiday break we happened to both be visiting our home town at the same time. We caught up for a while and decided to collaborate on a project that became the Room in the Trees. You can read more about it at our website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://roominthetrees.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eroominthetrees.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast is continuation of a discussion that began in and with the Room in the Trees. We hope this will grow to be more than just conversation. Our primary interest is to find ways to help you make stuff - and make big messes. To start. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn order to grow this conversation we need your support and involvement. It takes a significant about of time and expensive equipment to produce even a simple podcast. We want to bring in guests, produce video, take the conversation outside, introduce you to all our favorite people and things.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider subscribing, getting involved in the conversation, and joining us in building the Room in the Trees.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

We began at the high school where we were both students and became friends in fourth period, advanced art 2. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt had been over a decade since I had last caught up with Sabrina. Years she had spent traveling, publishing books and teaching. Years I had spent mostly in schools studying art and teaching. I had moved back to California to escape the cold of my third February in Chicago. Sabrina was visiting family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe talked at length about how little we actually knew about the city we grew up in. Someone found that place and began creating. There were explorers and settlers. People fought over water, stumbled down canyons, named streets, planted orchards and raised families. We went to high school in the 90\u2019s.\u003cbr\u003eIn the school\u2019s back parking lot by the choir room there was an old discarded theater set. It was a single green papered wall with a hearth, very likely old enough to have witnessed the years we walked the halls as teenagers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoping the flimsy green wall onto the top of my aging beige Toyota Camry felt like the right thing to do. Of course we did. We had decided to make a monument in honor of, in remembrance of, in spite of, in gratitude for, in defiance of the city we had grown up in and the memories forever tied to it. This old theater set would be the start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a hillside overlooking the whole of down town LA were three trees. It wasn\u2019t chance that led us to those trees but it wasn\u2019t predetermined either. The triangle of trees seemed the perfect set of standards to support a space. The wall we saved from the high school fit exactly between the first two trees. A second wall was made from a roll of canvas I had used to cover my bedroom wall many years ago. Sabrina had a collection of found objects and pieces of past project that became the final wall and roof. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce complete the room sat ready to be occupied. One little puff of grass sprouted from the ground as a center piece waiting to be surrounded. As the sun set Sabrina\u2019s dad came by to see what we had done. The three of us sat in the room in the trees to finish the conversation and set a pattern for what would ultimately lead us to create this podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Room in the Trees is a space made from the scraps and accumulation of stories and places. Built for conversation, it was cleared out, set up and stands waiting for the raw materials of life and experience to be combined into something both spoken and material so story and expression can continue. \u003cbr\u003e",
