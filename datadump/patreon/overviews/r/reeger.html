    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eDearest Listener,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA guiding principle for me in my life is whatever\nI desire in life, I always begin by giving that \u201cthing\u201d away. \u003cem\u003eWhat you give, you receive.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf I want to have happiness in my life, I begin by helping\nsomeone else experience happiness. If I want to be healthy, I first help\nsomeone else be healthy. If I want love, kindness, and friendship, I start by\ngiving love, kindness, and friendship to those around me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2013 I wanted to listen to a podcast\nabout bariatric surgery but no one was doing it, so, I\nstarted a podcast about bariatric surgery. I gave what I wanted to receive. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI did not launch my\npodcast because I wanted money.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy podcast has never been about making money. Which is why I\u2019ve\nnever had sponsors, ads, or commercials. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, the reality\nis my podcast costs me money. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach month I pay for web hosting, podcast hosting, and email\nlist hosting. There are also equipment costs and general maintenance expenses.\nBeyond that, my website is in desperate need of updating but I cannot\nrationalize spending more money when I already spend money each and every\nmonth. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll of this brings me to why I have asked you to come here,\nto my Patreon page. I have thought about different ways to help\ncover my podcasting costs. Ironically, the one method that feels the most\ninline with my values is also the most awkward for me, because it involves me\nasking you, my listeners, for financial support. Up until\nthis point, I have only been willing to spend my money. I have not been\ncomfortable with receiving money. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut the greater irony is that if I claim my\nguiding principle in life is to give what I wish to receive but I am unwilling\nto create an opportunity to receive then I am only living half my values!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou see the truth is\nif we are willing to give, we must also be willing to receive.\u003c/strong\u003e We cannot\nhave one without the other!!! In order to be a giver, one must have a willing\nreceiver; In order to be a receiver, one must have a willing giver. That\u0027s how\nit works.  That is life in balance. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTherefore, in line with my values of giving and receiving,\n(deep breath) I am creating an opportunity to receive financial support for my\npodcast. I am asking for\u003cem\u003e your\u003c/em\u003e support to keep the podcast going\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDear listener, if you feel that what I am creating gives to you and you\nwant to give back, then please consider becoming a patron.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd no matter what, never forget, I believe in you, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nReeger\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPS: If my words of giving in order to receive resonate with\nyou, I want you consider what it is you desire in your own life and how you\nmight begin by giving that \u201cthing\u201d away as your first step in receiving. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, if you are going to try this life principle, here\nis an important truth to understand, what you give you MUST\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003egive unconditionally.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\nMeaning, you must give freely, with no strings attached, no expectations of\nwhat might be returned to you \u003cem\u003enor when\u003c/em\u003e. You must give because \u003cem\u003egiving\u003c/em\u003e is the right thing to do. Period.\nThen \u003cem\u003eand only then\u003c/em\u003e do you create the\nopportunity for what you give to come back to you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
