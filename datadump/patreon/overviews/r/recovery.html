This is a lofty goal that we plan to achieve one video at a time. We have developed a production process that will allow us to turn out 1-2 videos per month. But we need your help. Watch our first two videos and if you believe that the work we are doing is worthwhile, please pledge to sponsor us--offering a small sum for each video we produce. By doing so, you will help us sustain our efforts and reach our goal. Ask yourself: does watching a PYR video have for me the value of a cup of coffee or a candy bar? For that level of investment, do I want to empower Nick and Ned to keep creating?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNed Presnall\u003c/strong\u003e is Executive Director of \u003ca href=\"http://www.claytonbehavioral.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClayton Behavioral\u003c/a\u003e and Adjunct Professor at Washington University in St. Louis.
