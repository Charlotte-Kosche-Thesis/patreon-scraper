He is the guy that you will miss shortly after he has left the room. He is an entrepreneur based in Cluj-Napoca, Romania and he built all his businesses while making lasting friendships. Most of his current business partners are friends that he easily made while enjoying success and his life.\u003cbr\u003eHumble, motivated and consistent he delivers every time he has to. That does not mean \u201cevery day\u201d. Because we all need some resting time and nobody can really give 100% every single day without underperforming. And Remus believes in High Performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe has started off with a 4 year career in IT, thinking that computers are his dream job and life. After he met his current girlfriend (soon wife) he realized that life is much more than living on a monthly paycheck and \u201cgoing through the motions\u201d. He realized that life is about being your own boss (with all the benefits that come with this) and helping others reach the next level in their life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelping people was always the center piece of Remus\u2019 life, and being around people and care about them was always his passion. So, the Networking Coach career was something natural and obvious for him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Networking Course available on his website is one of the most advanced courses on this topic and the free training and videos provided every single week bring real value to the people following him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemus is also doing a daily VLOG on his \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/remusvargas\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e (in stories), which is inspiring, funny, creative, and also brings joy to his audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe has delivered speeches on gratefulness, changing your life through sport and improving relationships (both personal and business) on many occasions and in front of different people.\u003cbr\u003e",
