We also scrutinize self-made pundits and influencers across Twitter and other social media platforms, as well as newsletters circulated under the radar by conservative organizations and Congressmen. And of course, we keep our eye out for trending fake news, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur hope is that\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.redfortheblue.com/\"\u003eRed for the Blue\u003c/a\u003e will help bridge the widening gulf between the political right and left and arm readers with the knowledge to facilitate constructive, face-to-face political discourse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re so happy and grateful to have found so many interested subscribers since we started this endeavor a month ago. We\u0027re also thrilled to have received some great testimonials from important people and our first feature in the press by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://baristanet.com/2017/03/montclair-red-for-the-blue-newsletter/\"\u003eBaristanet\u003c/a\u003e. But as you know, Red for the Blue is a labor of love. Since we\u0027ve started, the costs have started to add up. We\u0027d love nothing more than to keep this going, but we also want to make sure we can pay for some modest expenses, including our MailChimp account, our website on Squarespace, and the generosity of the friends who have offered to help out. Any support, no matter how big or small, is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
