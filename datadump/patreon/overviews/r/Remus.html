But time passed and I got more experienced with editing and my love for making videos kept growing, same for my channel, especially when I started making videos with League of Legends. I have made over \u003cstrong\u003e700 videos\u003c/strong\u003e for over \u003cstrong\u003e6 years\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe views are mostly constant and they kept growing to a point, now there are great months and not so great ones, so my payment from YouTube depends on many factors, it\u0027s never the same, and not as big as you may think it is. Plus, the recent changes with the algorithm made me and a lot of people get less views on everything, as well as less subscribers and the ad boycott removed a lot of the monetized views, thus making everyone earn even less from views only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why \u003cstrong\u003eI need your help\u003c/strong\u003e, I want to be able to keep making videos forever!\u003cbr\u003eMost of my videos take a very long time, guides or parodies or a video like \"Races in League of Legends\", and it depends if they make decent revenue or not. I always try my best and do a lot of editing to make my videos as pleasant\u00a0as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the years I did a lot of \u003cstrong\u003eRP and Games giveaways\u003c/strong\u003e, sending $5 worth of Riot Points to a lot of people almost every month, so it would be nice to also receive something back from my followers for all the \u003cstrong\u003ehundreds of free videos I\u0027ve made and my regular giveaways\u003c/strong\u003e! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will offer\u003c/strong\u003e behind the scenes videos/images to my patreons, access to my secret Discord group, send you a champion drawing of your choice and for bigger supporters, add your names at the end my videos! Even a dollar can go a long way, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
