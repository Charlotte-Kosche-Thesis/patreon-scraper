I love finding new ways of telling stories, and Imaginary Advice is the perfect sketchpad. It\u0027s a place where I can take chances, in an environment where I have complete creative control. I write every episode, and self-produce about 90% of it.\u00a0Since it began in October 2014, the podcast has grown to become the most important thing I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo of my favourite episodes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ross-sutherland/17-six-house-parties\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA romantic rivalry, told over six consecutive fancy dress parties\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ross-sutherland/17-six-hous...\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ross-sutherland/11-answer-in-the-form-of-a-question\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy visit to IBM Yorktown Heights, to sit in on a very special episode of Jeopardy\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy use Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like Imaginary Advice, help me keep making it! I really want to keep producing the podcast, but in order to do that, I need your help. Production takes a crazy amount of time, and currently the podcast receives no advertising support or external funding. I want to produce a new episode every two weeks, but I can\u0027t do that without your help.\u00a0Supporting me through Patreon would mean I could keep producing Imaginary Advice on a regular basis. You would be helping to\u00a0keep the podcast online, as well as making it as good and exciting as it possibly can be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long will the show run?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a slate of ideas for Imaginary Advice that will take the show right into 2017. I hope to continue the show for many years! You can support it for as long / short as you like. When the show finally stops, I will remove this page, cancelling any patrons. If you just want to support the podcast for a few months, that\u0027s great! You don\u0027t have to sign up for a particular length of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor UK / European supporters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a US company. That\u0027s why all the amounts are listed in dollars. Patreon will automatically convert the pledge amount when it leaves your bank account. Check the conversion rates if you\u0027re not sure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you are based inside the EU, your pledges will have tax added on top of the pledge amount. This means if you pledge a $5 donation, the actual amount (including the tax) will be $6. Check on the final screen to see how much tax is being added! \u00a0This becomes particularly important when it comes to larger pledges. Double-check before clicking yes!"
