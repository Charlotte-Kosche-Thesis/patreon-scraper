Inhale, exhale. Make a short note in the sketchbook as a reminder for the future and put it aside to get back to work ) Needless to say, this specific \"future\" is so rare to come!..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a hope and a mean to redirect more and more of my time and inner resource on my own setting that keeps my true \"essence\", sense of aesthetics and symbolism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and support the world that has been living in my mind for more than 10 years will finally blossom and show itself to you! First in the form of illustrations, articles and comic strips.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLater \u2014 as artbooks and world guides, completed stories and, hopefully, even games and goodies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Here you will find all the finished illustrations, concepts, wips, sketches and information on this head-world as soon as new content appears!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what Headworld are we talking about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst and foremost, it is \u003cstrong\u003eRaekterrna\u003c/strong\u003e, a semi-futuristic, fantasy/ sci-fi world.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRaekterrna in general is a dualistic world with two layers of reality co-existing and interacting with each other: Maol realm and material world. \u003cbr\u003eAn aether sun, Numen, is shining over it and aether permeates the world\u0027s whole existence and all the living beings, residing on Raekterrna.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAether\u003c/em\u003e is a world energy. The townsfolk often regard it as \"magic,\" but its nature is much broader: it is not only fuel and cause of supernatural (in our perception) phenomena, actions or beings, but is also associated with the notorious bio fields, energy of different areas of the material world, and etc. Thanks to aether, many phenomena, that would be considered fiction or scientifically not proven on Earth, are a part of common everyday life on Raekterrna.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMaol realm\u003c/em\u003e is a metaphysical layer of the world which, in its turn, has own layered structure. But in general it is a realm for all the metaphysical beings. \u003cbr\u003eOne of the most notable of them are \u003cstrong\u003eAnimas,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ea class of symbiotic aether creatures. It\u0027s common for them to form connection with human partners and give them specific abilities in exchange for first hand experiences and information of the mortal world, as well as an opportunity to further explore the intricacies of anima-human relations and many other things. Animas are also using this information later to shape the image of Maol realm.\u003cbr\u003eSimilarly to people, each individual anima has own personality and experience, but at the same time they are like scientists, reformers and informers of Maol.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor people of Raekterrna, existence of Maol and its inhabitats and laws of aether is a common knowledge that was long ago implicated into their culture, religion and overall mindset.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAside from Raekterrna, there is also a young fantasy world \u003cstrong\u003eMekiyah\u003c/strong\u003e, home of Lungaroux, mekiyan harpies, dragon people and the curse of Saroh...\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e...and, of course, \u003cstrong\u003emy personal characters of the Vilous universe\u003c/strong\u003e, created by \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mick39/posts\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMick39\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Tenteraten\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKiki-UMA\u003c/a\u003e \u2014 Gaeddar (featured by his short name in one of the official Vilous manga stories), Alba and others who live in my heart but which I never had an opportunity to get featured yet.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
