    "summary": "Hi, my name is Elton McManus and I set up what would become RogueTwoMedia in 2009. Since 2008 I\u0027ve been listening to and creating podcasts. Over the years I feel that I have become quite good at it, I\u0027m certainly not perfect but I am, in my opinion, getting better the more episodes I put out. \u003cbr\u003eIn \u002706 I moved out of the London area for a much better life for my wonderful, growing family. That year we moved house, had our second child and I changed jobs which meant spending a lot more time travelling in a van. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point I had already acquired a taste for spoken word radio but I was finding it harder and harder to either get a solid reception or find a set of programs to help me through the day. \u003cbr\u003eThis is where podcasts come to the rescue. I was heavily into the tv program LOST and found the LOST Initiative with Iain Lee, it was a SkyOne production and within the first episode I downloaded, I was hooked. I started looking around for other shows and found Movies You Should See from \u003ca href=\"http://www.simplysyndicated.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSimply Syndicated\u003c/a\u003e, ended up joining their forum, from there I was put in contact with Mr Scott Copperman with whom I recorded many, many episodes of \u003ca href=\"http://bombastpodcast.podbean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAn Apotheosis of a Bombast\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://rethinkinglost.podbean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRethinking LOST\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime I had recorded four short episodes with my better half and had been bitten by the bug.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is the idea behind this Patreon page? Well, I love recording these shows whether it be as the host or the guest and I want to build on what I am doing. I\u0027ve slowly turned the show Shonky Lab into a LIVE experience and would like to build on the \u0027call in\u0027 opportunities I have here but getting the time is sometimes tricky so if I could use this site as part of or as a wage then I will have more time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore time means more episodes and hopefully new shows. What I would love to do in future is expand Shonky Lab into a regular show two nights a week where we have the topic discussions one night and a solid call in show the other.\u003cbr\u003eYou never know, I might be able to pull it off so please do consider helping me out.\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks."
