He\u2019s working on series in both epic and urban fantasy, and likes to write fast paced books that take the reader on an adventure that they can see in their mind. His books reflect influences from novels, comic books, manga, and other cartoons/media, and he joys in blending in these elements in his books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAuthor, Christian, Husband, and Father, R.J. Batla enjoys everything outdoors and takes as much time as he can with his family. When he\u2019s not writing, you\u2019ll find him outside (thinking about writing), working out (and thinking about writing) or various other places (all while thinking about writing).",
