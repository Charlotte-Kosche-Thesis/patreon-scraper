So I use cannabis and cannabis products to allow me to have basic quality of life. Even with the Devil\u0027s Lettuce, it takes me a full two days to recover from any activity more than two hours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I live on disability actually less than $600 a month after my rent is paid. I am completely unable to work even part time. But I can still write, so any monthly commitment can improve my quality of life from food, to medication and all the other things I need to get by. I am asking for your support if you feel my sharing of my life is important and offers help to others who read it. \u00a0Does the last few things I can still do with joy merit support of me? I hope you can \u00a0help me find a place for my voice and these gifts will improve a life more than you think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You Everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSteven Schwartz"
