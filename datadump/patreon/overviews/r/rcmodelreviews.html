    "summary": "I am perhaps the world\u0027s only full-time promoter of RC flying and the only full-time, 100% independent and unbiased RC product reviewer.\u00a0 Every dollar that is pledged goes towards increasing the number and variety of videos I can publish to help educate, inform and entertain those who enjoy this wonderful hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your support via Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause, unlike many others who post \"reviews\" to YouTube, I am 100% independent and objective in my reviews. \u00a0 \u003cem\u003eIf it\u0027s crap, I\u0027ll tell you\u003c/em\u003e -- no matter who makes it or who sent it in for review.\u00a0 I accept no sponsors, there are no affiliate links associated with my reviews, I do not accept payment from manufacturers or distributors to review or promote their products,\u00a0 nor do I sell products of my own -- I only create videos.\u00a0 This way you can be sure that I work for \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, the RC model flier.\u00a0 To ensure my absolute impartiality, I rely solely on the paltry revenues from\u00a0 YouTube\u0027s advertising and kind donations from viewers to support this full time operation.\u00a0 I refuse to sell-out and be bribed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s my background?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an electronics, software, mechanical engineer and occasional lecturer who has been flying model aircraft ever since I first started school.\u00a0 My goal is now to pass on my knowledge, understanding, experience and passion for this hobby to others -- by way of my YouTube channels RCModelReviews and XJet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will your regular Patreon pledge help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause my two existing revenue sources (YouTube and donations)\u00a0 both tend to vary wildly from month to month,\u00a0 it has been very difficult to budget and plan for the future so I\u0027m hoping that if enough people are kind enough to pledge a regular contribution, I\u0027ll be in a much better position to continue what I\u0027m doing whilst providing for the very modest lifestyle my wife and myself enjoy (rented house, 25-year-old truck, no holidays).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you can spare a small monthly amount it could make a huge difference to the work I do on your behalf.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother concern, and something which weighs heavily on the minds of all YouTube content creators, is that YouTube could pull the plug on its advertising share program at any time and without notice.\u00a0 This would leave my wife and I up the creek without a paddle (so to speak) so your Patreon pledge will allow us to sleep a little easier at night and justify the investments I have already made and have planned for the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, as you\u0027ll see in the goals section, I will be making some extra content available to those who pledge more than the minimum amount.\u00a0 This will be published weekly or monthly as stated.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u0027m also going to try and clear some of the mass of products that presently cover my studio floor by perhaps occasionally sending some of it to those who donate $50/month or more.\u00a0\u00a0 No promises and no guarantees but if you\u0027re one of those people -- don\u0027t be surprised if one day, out of the blue, you get a box from New Zealand with some excellent RC goodies in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon contributors will also get to interact with me through the pages of the Patreon website and that probably means you\u0027re more likely to get a response than if you just email me.\u00a0 I get several hundred emails a day (plus spam) so sometimes stuff falls through the cracks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most of all, you\u0027ll be able to tell the world that you\u0027re one of those who support RCModelReviews, for the benefit of the entire model flying community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a monthly pledge and not a \"per video\" one?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always felt that quality was more important than quantity so I\u0027d rather resist the temptation to \"knock out lots of videos just to make more money\" as might be the case if I was charging on a per-video basis.\u00a0 Most videos take a lot more work and time to make than you might think and I\u0027d rather be certain the quality was maintained or enhanced.\u00a0\u00a0 A flat monthly pledge ensures that I can do this but, if there\u0027s enough in the pledge tin each month, I plan to hire someone to help me out.\u00a0 This would allow for better quality \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e increased quantity at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e"
