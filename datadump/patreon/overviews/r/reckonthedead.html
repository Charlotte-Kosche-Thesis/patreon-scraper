Now we\u2019re turning to you, dear potential patrons, to help us make even better roleplaying content. We have an aggressive production schedule: one-page scenarios every week, and full-length, fully produced scenarios about every two months, like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/229314/Plague\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"PLAGUE.\"\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of this Patreon like a tip jar.
