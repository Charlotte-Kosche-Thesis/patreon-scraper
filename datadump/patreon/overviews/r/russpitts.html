It\u0027s not even about ideals, really. You literally have no choice but to slash content that radically opposes a high pageview-to-cost model. So even when you start a thing with good intentions of doing quality over quantity, if you\u0027re tied to the ad-driven content model (which all websites currently are) you\u0027re going to eventually focus on quantity over quality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s ... basically the opposite of what I do.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
