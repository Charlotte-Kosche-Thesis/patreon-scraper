    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--NXWQXXA5t4/WjGrb7QQmHI/AAAAAAAABys/B3OooaBJhsE63-jmTX50jm5bEz4ClElrwCLcBGAs/s1600/Spinward-Fringe-Banner-1-12_banner_vith_others.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is the purpose of my Patreon Page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon page is a content hub, where I can release everything from articles to Podcasts, to huge sections of books that may take years to write. I\u0027ll also be using this page as a new community hub where people can contact me through the comments section and members of Patreon can reach me directly through private messages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you moving to Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I answer that, I\u0027d like to say that the community Facebook pages that exist right now, and the blog will still be around, but for new updates and everything else, they\u0027ll point to Patreon. I\u0027ll still participate in the Facebook and Twitter communities, but the main content, the stuff you probably want to see most, will be available through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003eFor years readers have told me that I charge too little for my books, but I\u0027ve always maintained that I charge what I think they\u0027re worth, and the market reacts well to independent authors who offer their works for a low price, and very poorly to someone who prices their work closer to $10.00. If I want to do this for a living, I have to play by the same rules as all the other Indie Authors with regards to business practices. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in. If you feel you would like to contribute more to supporting me, here\u0027s your opportunity. I can also offer extra benefits to you in exchange for your financial help.\u003cbr\u003eThen there\u0027s the hard truth. I want to write Spinward Fringe novels, but I also want to work on other books, because that can\u0027t be the extent of my career. Unfortunately, writing those other books doesn\u0027t pay well, so I\u0027m really only living on one book a year, the Spinward Fringe releases. I\u0027ll happily write one or two Spinward Fringe novels a  year, I like writing for those characters in that universe, but I\u0027m going to need support while I work on projects that I want to write for you that don\u0027t pay well (yet). By expanding my horizons I become a better writer, and I get to offer you a broader scope of entertainment.\u003cbr\u003eDark Arts, Brightwill, Highshield (the rough draft of that is available here in its entirety), and Chaos Core were projects that I learned so much from, and I brought that knowledge back to Spinward Fringe, enriching the series. I want to keep that going, to build on the Dark Arts, Brightwill and Chaos Core settings, but that\u0027s becoming more difficult, because they\u0027re books that release between Spinward Fringe novels.\u003cbr\u003eSomeday the Spinward Fringe series will end. All good things have to, and if I want to do this for the rest of my life (and I definitely do), I\u0027ll need people like you who enjoy what I write in and out of that series. Your participation in Patreon will help me finish the Spinward Fringe seires, start the next series in that universe, and build other series at the same time, like the Dark Arts series, or the realm of Brightwill. There are thrilling projects you haven\u0027t seen yet, and you\u0027ll be the first to experience them as my patron. So, Patronize me, and I\u0027ll write for you. Thank you for coming, listening, and for your Patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRL\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
