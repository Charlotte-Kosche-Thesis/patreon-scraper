She received her BA in Math at SJSU, where she tutored and taught math programs that helped first generation college students in STEM majors.  While getting her masters in Transformative Leadership at the California Institute for Integral Studies, she focused on math education and the assumptions underlying how we teach math. She developed a model which helps guide teaching styles, and has helped others learn to identify where learning breaks down in math and understand how to better support students.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeth spent several years as The Reading Clinic\u2019s Director, where she had the opportunity to work with hundreds of students in reading, comprehension, expression, writing, and math. She also spent a summer working at LindaMood-Bell Learning Processes. She attended the Slingerland Institute in 2010, studying under Nancy Cushen White, and has attended multiple other trainings relating to multi-sensory interventions and remediation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeth is very active in the Bay Area educational community, and continues to give many talks on the learning process, teaching for the Educational Therapy program at UCSC Extension Online and working on a blog about what she has learned in her 20 years which you can read here:\u003ca href=\"https://remediationatoz.wordpress.com/\"\u003ehttps://remediationatoz.wordpress.com/\u003c/a\u003e.",
