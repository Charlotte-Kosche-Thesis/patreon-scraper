    "summary": "Hello friends! My name is Kendal Osborne. I am an audio engineer, mix engineer, studio owner, musician, and podcaster. I\u0027ve had a recording podcast called \u003cstrong\u003eThe Recording Lounge\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0since 2009, and since that time I have gained \u003cem\u003ethousands \u003c/em\u003eof fans from all over the world, listening in to my podcasts every month to learn about the art and science of recording, mixing, and producing music. This podcast is completely free to the public and is easily downloadable from iTunes or from the RSS feed. I answer \u003cem\u003etons\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eof emails every week from listeners asking questions, I listen to their mixes, I give them advice on their room acoustics, and I take their podcast requests. I\u003cstrong\u003e truly love\u003c/strong\u003e all of my fans and hope they are learning more and more every time I publish a podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u0027s the thing - \u003cstrong\u003eI NEED YOUR HELP! \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m an audio engineer first, not a blogger or podcaster. I\u0027m in the studio 60 hours a week, every week, working with clients and making records. I have little spare time to make the podcast, and although the podcast is \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely free\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003efor you, it\u0027s not free for me! I spend many hours making each episode, and pay out-of-pocket for the website, the hosting and bandwidth, the HD music player, advertising, etc. I want to grow the podcast, I want to make more episodes, and I want to continue putting out quality content on the Youtube channel and on my blog, but I can\u0027t do it without your help!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me on this journey, and consider contributing to \u003cstrong\u003eThe Recording Lounge \u003c/strong\u003eto help keep the podcast alive! I appreciate your kindness, your fandom, and your friendship. Thank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Kendal Osborne\u003cbr\u003e"
