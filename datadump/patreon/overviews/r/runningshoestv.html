I used to be overweight, unhealthy, and lazy. I lost 155 pounds, and along the way, I figured out how to lead a healthy, active lifestyle without losing a bit of the geek I\u0027ve always been. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGhKvW9Szj309n0tNkZ6ggg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e and series of videos ties into that. Beginning with what I call \u003cem\u003ePath to the Dark Side\u003c/em\u003e, I am vlogging my way to the runDisney Star Wars: The Dark Side half-marathon (as well as the 5k and 10k races).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up as the fat kid, and now I\u0027m the fit guy. At some point, according to one of my former students, I went from being \"a fat dude who lost a bunch of weight\" to \"that guy whose in great shape.\" That\u0027s awesome. \u003cstrong\u003eI want that to be you, too\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like talking about running. I like talking about running shoes. I like talking about nutrition and racing and the running community and GPS watches and...well, you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also like talking about Star Wars and Zelda and Mario and Captain America and Ninja Turtles and Duck Tales and...again, you get it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to motivate you into living a good life and being happy, not scare you into one or give you some kind of fake quick fix to health and happiness.

I did a successful Kickstarter for my debut novel \u003cem\u003eBirthright\u003c/em\u003e a few years ago (155% funded, woohoo!), and it was great. Mostly. The downside was that I spent more time on logistics and fulfilling rewards than I did getting to talk with my backers and actually work on the novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, I love the internet. Just love it. I love making friends and being\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/geektogeekcast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epart of a community\u003c/a\u003e, and that\u2019s what Patreon is about. It\u2019s perfect for people like me who love people, love the internet, and love making new, awesome things for people on the internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOU GET FROM ME\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, all the content that is made for the channel is going to remain totally open and free. Forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see,\u00a0I am looking at this Patreon from a very simple perspective: \u003cstrong\u003eyour support for this project is giving me the freedom to focus on what I care about--helping people.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent creation is a hard way to make a living, and your patronage of this campaign literally gives me the financial freedom to focus my time on putting out more awesome stuff.

I get that. The idea of crowdfunding really is a kind of postmodern panhandling. It gets tiring. I know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I want to use this Patreon as a way to really provide something of value that needs to be created. I want you to know that every single dollar put toward this campaign will directly support the regular creation of awesome content that helps someone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can sling even a dollar my way, it will be greatly appreciated.
