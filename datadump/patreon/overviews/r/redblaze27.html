As of October of 2014, I returned to art and have been consistently spending my spare time honing my skills to finally share everything I have been lovingly crafting for so long. With the support of my friends and fans I have accumulated since then, I have made great progress to making my dream a reality on some level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The basic goal of this Patreon campaign is simply so anyone that wishes to support me monetarily have an avenue. All proceeds from this campaign I receive will go towards ensuring I can continue to make what I love, as well as finding its way back into the art community in some form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ezero-intention\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e of withholding my content from those who are interested, as I am endlessly grateful for the support I have received thus far, and would not even wish to humor the idea of leaving those of you who cant pay out of this continuing journey of mine. I\u0027d much rather have everyone be able to benefit from the generous efforts of those who can and choose to pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I may from time to time create content in honor of my patrons, but even such things can and will be publicly view-able.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThank you for your consideration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
