    "summary": "Three years ago, I left gainful employment as a draftsman at an engineering firm to pursue my dream of being a full-time writer and stay-at-home Dad to our five kids. My wife dreamed of being a jewelry designer and together we wanted to be able to be home for our kids, while being able to support ourselves. We dreamed big, and a conservative estimate of potential business indicated that it might work out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I didn\u0027t know and couldn\u0027t have foreseen or accounted for, was I was suffering from depression. A few months of low sales very nearly put me over the edge, and after ten months of trying to make it work, I hospitalized myself, got treatment, got medicated, got into therapy... and everything kind of went to hell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started scrambling to earn enough to get by. Friends and family helped us out as much as they could, more generous than I could have ever hoped for. My wife began doing less jewelry, trying to help me get better and keep our family on track. Depressed, I couldn\u0027t find it in me to write. Financially things became very difficult for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started a (very) small business, salvaging items that would otherwise have gone into landfill from donors, garage sales, thrift stores, dumpster dives, estate sales, whatever and wherever we could find things to sell. It helped keep the wolves at bay for a while, but after a year of struggle, we came to realize we had no choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe discussed bankruptcy with a couple of financial advisors. They told us we couldn\u0027t even qualify, that\u0027s how bad things were. In the end, we had no choice but to go on welfare, and apply at a local food bank. My wife took on a part-time job which, in addition to trying to keep the family on track, help me with my mental illness, and learning and trying to find the resources to deal with the fact that our pre-schooler son has special needs that lie somewhere on the A-spectrum, quickly burned her out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have discussed alternatives. I could go back to work. She could try to find a full-time job. There are pros and cons of both, but we fear that either would once again lead to a burnout for either, or both of us, or worse. Realistically, for the emotional well-being of both of us, and for the family, we need to keep working at this. And hopefully one day return to our dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, we\u0027re seeking alternative revenue streams, and this is one of them. Even a few dollars a month would help enormously, and provide a tangible form of proof that people actually want to read my writing (which was of the lies I believed due to my depression). If this surpasses our wildest expectations, who knows what we might achieve?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks. Your support is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
