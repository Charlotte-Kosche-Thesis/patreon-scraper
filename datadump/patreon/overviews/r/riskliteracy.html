    "summary": "On this page we are all grown ups, and we need help getting ahead. What I do is select and curate stocks in Motifs for my own account. I share my actions with you as they occur. Sometimes I do quite well. My corporation Cafe Cat has been in the business of consulting and coaching since 1990. I have expenses and fund and educate people who have almost no money, so if you like the idea of this please try to contribute something. Scroll below to the PayPal link or do ongoing support by using the \"Become a Patron\" button. :-) I take privacy very seriously. If you email me you only hear from me. Period. No exceptions- total privacy. Your trust will not be monetized.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 You want to make money in the stock market and you don\u0027t want to pay anything for advice or learn a lot of stuff that is hard to understand. No problem; keep it simple my friend! Do exactly what I do- if it works for you show your gratitude later. Follow along, see what happens ask other people what they think of this. I don\u0027t really market or promise anything. I invest my own money in a platform that is available to the public. I don\u0027t care if you win or lose, I care if I win and I don\u0027t intend to lose. If you do what I do, you will get the same results. Think you\u0027re smarter than me- have at it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My goal is to show people how I get results by investing in the stock market. I train brand new investors in simple investing techniques- first with small amounts and then by mirroring my more sophisticated trades on the social investing site motif.com I also use robinhood.com Both of these sites offer the lowest commission option. I supply my personal judgment and share what I do publicly.\u003cbr\u003eI offer only one disclaimer-your results will match mine. If you don\u0027t like risk or believe someone else is responsible for the risk you are taking-PLEASE- just go away. Like you I\u0027m fighting for my financial life and I can\u0027t afford to work as a baby sitter. Study what I do over time and then- well you\u0027re either in or out. If you score enough and consistently, become a donor. You\u0027ll always know what I\u0027m doing as I do it! \u00a0Easy peazey!! Your first step is to sign up for an account on www.motif.com - don\u0027t sign up for BLUE yet and you have either trading, ROTH or regular IRA\u0027s to choose from. You can also sign up for www.robinhood.com if you just want to do individual stocks- I rarely use this option.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0"

By pledging $1 per month you are directly funding the live investing of a candidate who is trying to learn how to master the principles of investing with actual money. I used to pay a buck an idea for any magazine(Remember magazines?) I subscribed to. You will find at LEAST one idea to invest in every money. A buck a month is like buying me a quarter of a cup of coffee! This money will go into a fund that is either a personal training account that distributes profit or into an investment club where groups of people pool their wisdom to execute trades. The results will be occasionally mentioned on the website. Think of this as a \"straight up gift\" to a person who wants to get ahead and better their financial standing by learning how to invest.
