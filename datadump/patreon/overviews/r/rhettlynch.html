     "about": "Rhett\nlives and works in Alameda, New Mexico. In his forty plus years as a\nprofessional artist, he has found expression in a variety of mediums:\nhand-woven tapestries, sculpture, drawings, monotypes, paintings in oil and\nacrylic, writing, acting in films, and developing the motion picture production\ncompany, Heap Big Films. Always seeking to expand his visual vocabulary, Rhett\nconsistently experiments with various materials in order to bring more power,\nlife, and intensity to his art. Rhett\u0027s broad range of subject matter: the\nhuman form, animals, landscapes, icons, archetypes, myth and legend, are\ndepicted realistically to pure abstract, whimsical to mystical. Rhett refers to\nhis work as a visual journal, recording his experiences as a tourist of life.\nHis work is a testament to the deeply powerful symbols found in the well of his\nIndigenous heritage. His work conveys a universal message, which crosses all\ncultural boundaries. Although varying greatly in medium and subject matter, all\nof Rhett\u0027s work contains a common thread, intensity of color interwoven with multifaceted\nintent. His paintings and writing are deeply personal, complex and moving,\nsometimes disturbingly so. Viewing Rhett\u0027s works provides an interactive\nexperience provoking thought, evoking emotion, and leaving a lasting imprint on\nthe psyche. Rhett\u0027s work, which has appreciated consistently in value over four\ndecades, attracts a broad range of collectors, veteran as well as neophyte,\nfrom entertainment and political personalities, to church parishes and\ncorporations such as CNN.",
