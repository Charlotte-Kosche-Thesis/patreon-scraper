I have been in the convention scene going on 10 years. I make it a priority to bring the fun to any convention i go to. Bringing something a little different to my images and to my parodies is is my goal. I also have started a new cosplay website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://coscapture.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.CosCapture.com\u003c/a\u003e . This has been something i have worked very hard for to bring these cosplayers to life. They work so hard to show case what they have made. Making my job so much easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat We Need\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are a couple key elements that can take our music videos parodies from good to amazing. That\u0027s where you guys come in. Travel expenses is one of the biggest obstacles.  To get to each city to make the shoots happen. We also still need a couple key pieces of equipment, some special FX work and a makeup artist.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave you ever wanted to be involved in a parody video? This is your chance! Want a personal video shoutout or signed prints from the cast of the parody? \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf goal is not reached. I will put as much effort in getting all the parodies completed. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Impact\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen going to these conventions, doing something for an attendee and going the extra mile, makes a world of a difference. That is what I want to do with these parodies. I want go that extra mile to make sure not only does it have the quality  these cosplayers deserve but also put smiles on peoples faces, even if its just for a few minutes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSo far I have directed 3 the Walking Dead parodies that have had amazing response. With casts consisting of 9 all the way to 25 cosplayers. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI promise that I will put my heart into these parodies. Attention to detail is key. Making The Walking Dead fans proud but also put a smile on someone\u0027s face that may not be a Walking Dead fan. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRisks \u0026amp; Challenges\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe real challenge is getting all these cosplayers in the same area. Most come from different cities around the United States. Conventions would be the best solution. That is where they gather together as a family. That family environment is what is going to make these parodies amazing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOther Ways You Can Help\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI understand that some people just can\u0027t contribute, but you can still help by sharing the fundraiser to friends. That really does help! \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWE provides easy solution to sharing, one click and you are done. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThank so much for supporting me and the cosplayers I work with. We put a lot of time and energy but its worth every hour and days that we do it! \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR GALLERY FOR SAMPLES OF OUR FINISHED PARODIES\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
