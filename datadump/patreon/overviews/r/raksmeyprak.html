Otherwise, I go by Raks mostly or Autumn (which is my alias cosplay name @ AutumnVirus Cosplay)! I\u0027m 24 years old, and I\u0027ve been cosplaying for about 7+ years now! I\u0027m a huge gamer and I stream on Twitch! Anyone is welcome to join my Twitch stream and have funnsies with me! :D:D I love cosplaying because I get to create and build ANY character that I want, and I\u0027m able to become that person. \u0026lt;3 The support I get from you guys mean the world to me, and I appreciate every single one of you individually, I do. \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027m also a coffee addict, but I prefer lattes! You love coffee too? We\u0027re already friends! \u0026lt;3 I\u0027M DAT STARBUCKS WHORE. Like Science? Cool, we\u0027ve been friends then, you just didn\u0027t know it. :3 I have a B.S. in Biology, so if you wanna talk that nerd science talk, my ears are for you. C: If you want to know more about me, continue reading! Otherwise, just ignore the essays below. :P It won\u0027t hurt my feelings, I SWEAR.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003e----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My 1st anime convention was Otakon 2010 and has been my favorite con since! I am an Asian-American for people who are wondering because I tend to get asked that a lot because people can never tell what I am. :P\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027ve been playing games since I was a little girl....my first console I owned was the Nintendo 64, and the 1st game I EVER played on it was The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time! Thank god for that! So, I\u0027m a huge Zelda fan! After that, I\u0027ve been a huge gamer! The consoles my siblings and I own are Dreamcast, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Gamecube, Wii, Wii U, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Nintendo 3DS, and my own PC! I never really owned any of the Sony/Playstation products because my family went team Nintendo/Microsoft. :P If you have any questions about any games, feel free to ask! Although I game on consoles a lot, I converted to PC gaming and I do Twitch stream! So, check out my Twitch also if you\u0027d like (link on Patreon page)! On a random note, my favorite video game is Phantasy Star Online which was originally on the Dreamcast, but I played it tons on the Gamecube, and I also play PSO 2 on the PC! I could talk about games for days, but let\u0027s get to the real point. \u0026lt;_\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Aside from gaming, my true passion is most definitely cosplay! I\u0027ve always been a hidden Otaku and nerd! No one really expects me to be one which I\u0027m not sure why, but oh wells. D: I collect manga (over 150+ books), anime DVD\u0027s, a lot of anime figurines, and anything else that\u0027s super kawaii desuu sugoiii tsundereee! Those things are my obsession. \u0026gt;_\u0026gt; In any case, back in 2010, I went to my 1st con because I always wanted to try it out, but I never had anyone to go with, but finally found people! I had so much fun and enjoyed it immensely! My 1st cosplay was Farah from the Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones! My cosplay seemed to be a huge hit that con, so ever since then, I just wanted to keep doing more and more! Cosplay is seriously the one thing that I love in the entire world. It makes me extremely happy to be able to showcase my creations and have people appreciate how much time and effort I put into each cosplay. The cosplay community is also so friendly which is why I\u0027m always able to be my crazy Otaku self. If you don\u0027t know me, I\u0027m extremely weird (you have no idea) and super nerdy, so if you see me at a convention, please don\u0027t be afraid to say hello or take selfies because I\u0027m down for anything (almost) and I\u0027m super outgoing! :D:D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/hNLRWk/whypatreon_zpsddhzwbqm.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the past years that I\u0027ve been a cosplayer, I have definitely seen huge growth since the beginning of my journey. It\u0027s hard to get motivation to create cosplays sometimes, but I keep at it! Granted, cosplay does create stress, but it\u0027s the good kind of stress (in a way)! I\u0027m creating a Patreon because cosplay is literally the one hobby I just want to continue doing forever and all the time! I want to be able to create cosplays and pump them out as much as I can and show you guys! The cosplay community is super friendly which is why I want to continue being part of it! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As everyone says, cosplay is an extremely expensive hobby. With all the support that I get, I want to be able to give too! I love giving, and I would love to give you guys everything if I could for the support! I want you guys to be able to live the work in progress as I build a cosplay. I want you to be there to give critique, advice, compliments, etc. I am eternally grateful for any support that you guys give, even at a $1 tier! You literally have no idea what your support means to me, truly. I could go on and on, but I don\u0027t want to bore you guys. You guys will have access to everything that I do before anyone else, and even stuff that I won\u0027t post on my public cosplay page. You guys deserve every bit of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I want to be able to make cosplay/twitch streaming my full time job. This is my one true dream that I never thought was in my grasp, but I\u0027m starting to see results, so I want to make that happen. You guys aid me along the way as that happens, and I appreciate each and every one of you, I really do. Each and every one of you make a difference in me, so please remember that. I am the person I am today because of people like you. \u0026lt;3\u00a0All in all, I appreciate any of you coming to check out my Patreon page and visiting!
