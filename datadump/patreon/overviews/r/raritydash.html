    "summary": "Hey everyone. Rarity Dash here, and since 2014 I\u0027ve been making reaction videos on Youtube for my\u00a0 40,000+ subscribers. Originally reacting exclusively to My Little Pony stuff, I\u0027ve since branched out considerably, providing reaction to all sorts of cartoons, anime and related content. I also do weekly let\u0027s play videos and have experimented and plan to experiment more other formats of content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, reaction videos are not the most difficult thing to create--anyone can do it really. The process of running an active reaction channel like this one is time consuming though, and the return on the time invested can be small given most of my best videos cannot be monetized due to copyright. By supporting me on Patreon, you will provide the encouragement for me to put both more time and more effort into providing the content you enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
