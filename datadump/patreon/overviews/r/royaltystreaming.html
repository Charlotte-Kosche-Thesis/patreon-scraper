    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for taking the time to check out our page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOn October 15th, 2016 I created the Royalty Streaming Community with a vision in my mind of creating a place for growing content creators to get their chance. Times are evolving, and the newer generations are relying more and more on technology. This puts a dramatic shift on the job field of young adults, and with the rise of websites like Twitch, YouTube, and many others, this puts the love of many into a chance to make a living; playing video games. This oppertunity is unique and this mindset is growing almost as fast as the websites themselves. Twitch sees on average over 110 million monthly concurrent viewers. YouTube gets over 35 million visitors to their site, every single day. With this sudden rise in popularity though, newcomers to the scene are left behind. It gets harder and harder for new content creators to get noticed while they are in the shadow of the \u0027big dogs\u0027. My\u00a0organization\u0027s main goal is to bring content creators\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eof all sizes\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e and viewers of them together, regardless of the games they play or watch. We pride ourself with our services being completely free\u00a0to use, no matter what. No content or help of any kind is locked behind any pay walls or anything like that. As we have grown though, the\u00a0financial output has grown and grown. I am currently using my own funds to pay for the website hosting, the domain for the website, royal streamer payments, special promotion offers in the community, amongst other small things used to improve the experience of Royalty for everyone involved. You might think I\u0027m trying to say I\u0027m going bankrupt next week and I\u0027m going to be living out on the street if you all don\u0027t donate me all of your money. That\u0027s simply not the case. The whole point of me making this is to bring community support into Royalty. Donating will get you recognition for helping out the community,yes, but it will not grant you unfair\u00a0privileges against other people who don\u0027t have the money to donate. Which is another reason why I\u0027m not going to sit here and beg for donations; I understand no one person\u0027s\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003efinancial situation is the same. Some of you might not even have the money to be spending on something like this, and I get it. Thats why supporting the Royalty Streaming Community on Patreon is completely optional, and again, donating will not put you at a better advantage at \u0027ranking up in the server\u0027 or other things like that. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and any support received is greatly appreciated!\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKevin AKA DuaLVll\u003cbr\u003eFounder of The Royalty Streaming Community\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
