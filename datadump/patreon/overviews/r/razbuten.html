Honestly, the fact that you have enough interest in me to even click this page is astounding. So, thank you. I appreciate your support, and no matter how this Patreon works out, I will continue to create stuff that I think you will enjoy. Ultimately, the purpose of opening this Patreon is not to change \u003cstrong\u003ewhat \u003c/strong\u003eI do but rather to do \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003emore \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eof it. I\u0027ve been creating videos for the past four years about games and other stuff that interests me, and I have only really been able to treat it as a hobby, meaning my release schedule has been far from what I wish it was. And that is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext year I will be moving to a new city, which means that I will be looking for a new job. This Patreon will help me determine what exactly I should look for. With support from you and other people who are interested in what I do, I will be able to focus more energy on making videos and devote less time to other endeavors. Regardless of whether or not that becomes a reality, I will continue to make the same kind of content that I always have, so no worries there. I just want to see if I can do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as payments, it will be on a per video basis, and I won\u0027t charge for more than 2 videos a month (this is all subject to change as my production schedule shifts, but I will give you ample warnings before I change anything).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, look, if you want to see me make more stuff, consider supporting this Patreon. If you can\u0027t, that is cool too. Consider sharing this with someone who might be interested. Or not. Honestly, you do you, boo. I love ya either way."
