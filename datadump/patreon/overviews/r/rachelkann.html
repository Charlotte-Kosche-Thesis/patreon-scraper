I am in the process of shooting and editing the video for this poem with my dear collaborator, Student Oscar-nominated director, Rahat Mahajan. Stay tuned for the results!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy unique interests and experience give me a distinct perspective and a wild variety of traditions to choose from when addressing reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis comes out in my expression of self, including but not limited to my poetry on the page and on the stage, as well as in videos...poetry videos are the main thing I am excited to share with you, but that\u0027s just the beginning...which is why I love this Patreon concept, (thank you for existing, Patreon!) It allows me to express myself in a diversity of ways, which is the absolute best for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*I\u0027ve performed my poetry at events like TEDx and with artists and leaders such as daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra, Marianne Williamson, Saul Williams, and Rahzel, at venues such as Disney Concert Hall, Royce Hall, The Broad Stage and The San Francisco Palace of Fine Arts, as well as spiritual and sacred spaces like Jewlicious Fest X aboard The Queen Mary, Agape Spiritual Center and Sinai Temple, conferences such as Women\u0027s Visionary Congress and Visionary Convergence, and festivals like Lucidity Fest and the Vans Warped Tour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*I am a teaching artist. I am a poetry workshopper and editor with experience around the world from the Middle East to Europe and back again, as well as here in the USA, at places like UCLA Extension Writers\u0027 Program, UC Riverside Palm Desert\u0027s Low Residency MFA, Cal Berkeley, Cal State Long Beach, and the State of California\u0027s Juvenile Correctional System, to name just a few.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*I love learning new stuff in the realms of science and the mystical, as well as human behavior, and I love sharing my discoveries.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*I got this wounded healer thing on lock. And while it hasn\u0027t always been a bed of roses for me, I am super grateful for the perspective I have been afforded. I have background experience in energy healing, movement healing, Jewish mystical traditions, and apprenticeship experience in ceremonial work from the Shipibo lineage of the Amazon Rainforest. Long story short, what I am saying is I love helping you heal. And I love giving (solicited) advice. Love it. LOVE IT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Get this: on top of all those shenanigans, I teach Zumba and my classes are a ridiculous blast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission in allllll these different areas remains the same: To Set Your Soul Loose. To Help You \u003cem\u003eGet Free.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I am excited to create new poems: in written form, audio form, video form, and through live performance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am excited to workshop with you one-on-one. I am excited to tell you about the latest things that are blowing my mind. I am excited for you to open your heart and to respond in kind with heartfelt advice. And I am excited to dance with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is gonna be great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eRachel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS That profile photo is by my beloved collaborator, photographer extraordinaire, Tess.Lotta\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tesslotta.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.tesslotta.com/\u003c/a\u003e"
