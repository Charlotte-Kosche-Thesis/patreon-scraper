So if you don\u0027t like what you see and want to pull out, $1 is all you\u0027ll have dropped.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the time being I simply go by Ren the Dragon, Ren or RTD for short. I\u0027m a furry artist from Miami who mostly does adult work ranging from either vanilla to very kinky themes. Lately, I have been trying to dedicate my efforts towards cleaner work, stuff I can potentially build a professional career off of one day. Besides digital images, I dabble in 3D modeling from time to time, and hope to jump back to that media again in the foreseeable future. Possibly even make game assets or a game itself. But for the time being, I\u0027m going to stick with what I\u0027m more comfortable with, and until I have lightened my workload. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far back as I can remember, I have always loved drawing, just creating and fleshing something out from my mind brought me so much joy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since kindergarten maybe, whenever I wasn\u0027t playing video games, I was always drawing, either at home or in class. I have never been to art school, almost everything I know is self-taught. I first began following the furry fandom in-around 2003 or 2004, following sites like VCL and Furnation until coming across FurAffinity. I began drawing my own furry art a year later, it was until five years later that I finally started drawing everything digitally, and only maybe two or three years ago that I started to finally take paid commissions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to 2017, and boy have I come a long way since I first began drawing.The support from all my watchers and friends is infinitely appreciated. I\u0027ve had people ask me if I have a Patreon, so they can support me better, and after almost a year of nudges and pokes for one, I caved and finally decided to begin one. \u003cbr\u003eSince I haven\u0027t been able to open up to commissions for a while, and since hours at work have been cut (we\u0027ve all felt this one), this has put me in a bit of a bind, and with bigger projects like Not Your Sky 2 and other unlisted ideas in mind, I think Patreon may be ideal for it. This way, I can sort of make up for the time my workplace cut me from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith NYS2 on my plate, you\u0027re going to see a lot of aeromorph-related material, but don\u0027t worry, you will see different themes in between in the coming future.\u003cbr\u003e"
