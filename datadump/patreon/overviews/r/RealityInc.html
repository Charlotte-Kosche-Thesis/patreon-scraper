You\u0027re used to how-tos, describing how to perform a particular activity (e.g. how-to install blackout curtains), but you may not be familiar with why to perform it (e.g. to prevent sunlight from stirring you out of a self-induced depression).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy-to provide examples of why-tos:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSome learners like to see concrete examples that illustrate concepts in order to best understand those concepts.

In the end, I may even have a better idea for why I am alive in the first place!

In the form of text, audio, video, virtual worlds and animated .gifs, this information slowly builds humanity\u2019s collective intelligence and awareness. The hope is, one day, that the schizophrenic hivemind that is the collective experience will congeal towards something a bit more productive, organized, egalitarian, happy, healthy, and, let\u2019s say, fun. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo contribute as best I can to this endeavor, I have proposed a collection of why-tos. By reaching out to the world, across the jumble of wires, it is my hope that those who share a similar interest in why to pursue activities will help push me along. Financially, it would be great to have a dollar or two thrown my way, but, more importantly, I\u2019m hoping that those of you connected to me Internetically will drive me from a morale perspective. For every experiencer of my why-tos that is out there, I will be that much more motivated to write why-tos and to pursue activities on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy-to publish why-tos on another platform:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will be publishing these installations on my own website because Patreon does not support the formatting necessary to really get the most out of the why-to process. Patrons will be given special links to private posts located on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://therealityinstitute.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Reality\u2122 Institute\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, as I explore my own why-tos, I hope to curate a collection of why-tos from the world at large. Because we\u2019re in this together and building the collective consciousness, the more perspectives on why to pursue activities the better. So, throughout the writing of why-tos, maybe we can build the ultimate collection for understanding the pursuit of life itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy-to compile why-tos:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as it may feel like it, you are not living life alone in a vacuum, separated from every other individual through a thick jelly of subjective experience. Though reason may reach its limits at the edges of your own perception and sensation, the truth is that everything that surrounds you is actually no insignificant part of your own being. Emotions swirling throughout those in your proximity may, sooner or later, come into contact with your own skin in the same way as a drought in California may affect the quality of fruit at a grocery store on the other side of the United States.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e In fact, we are all a part of an intricate and organic network of being, throbbing and bobbing as the cosmos expands, only to possibly retract and expand all over again. Perhaps more interesting is the fact that, for all intents and purposes, we all have our own consciousnesses, our own unique perspectives on this throbbing mass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://therealityinstitute.net/2017/07/why-to-sing-by-adria-bregani-submission/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u0027s one example\u003c/a\u003e of a why-to submitted to this project.
