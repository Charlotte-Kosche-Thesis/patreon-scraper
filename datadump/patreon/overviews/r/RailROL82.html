I couldn\u0027t do it without you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my YouTube channel (RailROL82) I specialize in filming abandoned railroads, abandoned railroad bridges, abandoned drawbridges, industry spurs, historic railroad crossings and trains. As of March 2018, I have 370 videos and 3,129 subscribers. I have a deep appreciation for the railroads that helped build this great nation; some of which have sadly been abandoned and they\u0027re just sitting there being reclaimed by mother nature. My mission/passion is to document as many of these as possibly for posterity; short lines, spurs, crossings, switches, etc. Many people don\u0027t care about the history, but I do. I try to document as many of these as I can so they can live forever. I\u0027ve documented the FEC Oversea Railway bridges, the ACL railroad in the Florida Everglades, countless industrial spurs, and crossings. I\u0027ve pretty much exhausted the South Florida area of abandoned rails. My dream is to travel state by state (dividing each state into sections) and document these abandoned rails/crossings. I receive some ad revenue from YouTube, but it isn\u0027t enough to cover traveling expenses. I\u0027m not asking for a huge contribution... Rather if everyone contributes $1 or $2 monthly, it would at least cover some costs. I\u0027m not trying to become a millionaire or looking for a quick pay day. I just need some help with travel funds. Again, I thank you for your time, interest, and support!\u00a0"
