Over time I caught up with the 70s bands and now I listen to the new bands around who create the style of music I love too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust like in the 1980s, nobody seems to give enough time to these fantastic bands, still making great new music and touring relentlessly to bring their music to our doorsteps. So\u00a0I wanted to make a show that celebrated these artists\u0027 pasts and applauds their persistence to still be making the music they love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I get the chance to talk to my idols about the old days and the now and share these often intimate conversations with you, the true fans of their music. I\u0027m so lucky to be able to do this and I hope you enjoy the results of our labours.",
