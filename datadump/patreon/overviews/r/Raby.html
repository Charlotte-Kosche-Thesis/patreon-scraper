Thanks to the internet I\u0027m able to work with some of the best talent in the world. Hobotech is mixing my album!!!

Fans say she sounds like, \u201cCyndi Lauper meets Portishead at a Dirty-South witch\u2019s rally\u201d.\u003cbr\u003eIn the tiny sea of female Pop producers, Raby\u2019s spellbinding style is formalized by poppy synths, folky guitar, divalicious vocals, enchanting operatics and audacious lyrics bent on saucy sorcery. A known shape-shifter, she channels glamorous characters into fantastic atmospheres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRaby has garnished grande aplomb via performances at some of the world\u2019s largest transformational music festivals including Envision Fest 2016 and Lightning in a Bottle (2013 + 2014) where she roused revelry with her cheeky rap tunes and shamanic clown characters. She is currently producing her anticipated debut album from a remote fishing village while caring for her old mariner Grandfather. Ableton Live guru and musical genius, Jon Margulies, a.k.a. Hobotech is performing the mixing as Raby sends tracks from her mobile recording studio on the Gulf Coast, \u201cThe Diva Trailer\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRaby hallmarks an entirely new genre, Wizard Pop, with salty communions and dreamy grit shamelessly dedicated to magic. She hopes to inspire massive planetary healing and creative liberation through the poetic power that comes through compassion, communion and brazen sass. Raby hopes to hit the festival circuit again one day soon and tour the world while teaching vocal magic workshops.",
