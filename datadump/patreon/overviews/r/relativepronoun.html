    "summary": "Hello and welcome. I\u0027m Rowan, i.e. R. E. Morris/Relative Pronoun, that person who writes\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://relative-pronoun.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethose weird things on Tumbl\u003c/a\u003er. I studied English literature at university for six years before mental health problems and general disillusionment with academia brought my scholarly career to a halt. My areas of interest range from Old English poetry to Victorian telegraph romances. I\u0027ve always taken a heavily historicist approach to literature, and at the moment I\u0027m reading far more history books than novels. I\u0027m fascinated by polar expeditions, \u003cem\u003efin de si\u00e8cle\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0occultism, anything to do with WWI, and illness/medicine in nineteenth-century Britain. I especially like consumption. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Weird and Wonderful in history and my several years studying English literature are the primary influences on my writing. And all of that is overlaid with a healthy dose of irreverent Catholic imagery due to my own aesthetic/heretical Catholicism. (Is Jesus/Judas or Jesus/Satan a better pairing, I can never decide. And what about Satan/Michael. That is also a good thing.) My writing usually takes the form of vignettes, or micro-fiction, as well as more traditional short stories which I sell as chapbooks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of aforementioned mental health problems, I\u0027m not really a great candidate for a Regular Person Job, and so at the moment writing is my only source of income. My lovely parents have allowed me to move back in with them, and they have been very good about not making me pay rent, and making sure I don\u0027t get all gin-mad and commit self-murder \u003cem\u003e\u00e0 la\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O681922/the-maniac-father-and-the-drawing-george-cruikshank/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea George Cruikshank engraving\u003c/a\u003e. However, I would like to be less of a drain on the people around me and pay for my own medication, pitch in for groceries, etc., which is where your patronage comes in. And, let\u0027s be honest, if I have a little more money of my own making, I can justify buying non-necessities like books about bees, tarot decks, and needles for my Victrola. Being well-medicated and having access to Weird and Wonderful things is what allows me to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are the kinds of things you can expect from my Patreon feed: extra vignettes that will not be on the blog; excerpts from longer pieces that I\u0027m working on; posts about my writing process, inspiration, influences, etc. The Relative Pronoun tumblr will go on as usual, with three vignettes posted a week, and I will still be offering chapbooks and mugs and whatnot through my store. Becoming my patron is just a way to get some extra neat things while helping me to write more and generally be a more functional human being.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Morris is a writer of slipstream and historical fiction. He is an immensely small thing and hardly takes up more space than his travel typewriter, over which he spends much of his time hunched. He enjoys writing about history, queer identities, and heretical Catholicism -- if he can fit all three into a single, 60-word vignette, then that\u0027s just dandy. A pair of sweet old lesbians performing black masses in their back parlour during the reign of Queen Victoria is exactly Morris\u0027s aesthetic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen not writing fiction, Morris enjoys penning letters to his correspondents, watching and occasionally petting bees, reading gay superhero fanfic, sewing, and sending love notes to the ghost of John Keats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://relative-pronoun.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttp://relative-pronoun.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e",
