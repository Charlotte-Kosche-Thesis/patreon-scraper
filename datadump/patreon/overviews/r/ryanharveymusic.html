    "summary": "I have been working for 15 years putting my songs and albums out to the world, usually completely for free on principle. I have toured 21 countries on my own dime, playing thousands of shows and raising the money to tour through manual labor, CD sales, and door-money from small shows. When I\u0027m home in Baltimore, I work (often 2-3 jobs) in construction, bar-tending, and whatever other side-work I can find to make enough to pay the rent, get food, and buy bus/plane tickets for the next tour. Due to my frequent tours, it is hard to keep the money up enough to make things happen, which often results in half-ass recordings, an inability to establish solid mail-order for merch, tours that could have been better, and plans that often don\u0027t materialize. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that, I am hosting this Patreon to build a monthly-sustainer \nprogram! Even if you can only offer a few dollars, that added up could \nmean a lot for me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEUROPEAN / U.S. TOURS\u003cbr\u003eWith $2,000, I can buy the tickets/gas I need and have the general economic-padding needed to setup and pull-off a tour on either continent without needed to worry *constantly* about the turn-out and pay-outs from shows. I like to play small shows, house shows, protests, etc, and it\u0027s good to be able to do these without making a tour less viable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMUSIC VIDEOS\u003cbr\u003eWith around $3,000 I could pay friends in the video/editing industry to help me make more professional videos of my songs. It is very obvious these days that a good video takes a song much further than a simple MP3 does - people share videos far, far more frequently. I have always avoided making \"real\" videos because of the costs associated, but recent explorations into this field have produced good results, convincing me both of the need but also the artistic importance of using visual elements to emphasize the meaning and imagery of a song. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTOURS ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD!\u003cbr\u003eI want to tour South America, parts of the Middle East, Australia \u0026amp; Indonesia, and anywhere else! Unfortunately, getting the tickets to these places can be really expensive compared to Europe or places in the U.S., and due to economic factors, it\u0027s a lot less likely that I\u0027d pull enough money from shows and CD sales to make the tour viable. I want to take my songs to new places, learn new ideas and perspectives, and bring those stories and songs on to the next destination. With $4,000, I can take more risky and ambition tours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePROFESSIONAL RECORDING AND NEW MUSIC\u003cbr\u003eI am currently doing an album with Kareem Samara, my main collaborator, Oud player, and multi-instrumentalist. He lives over in London, and we record in LA. Our current project has been self-funded, which means money for plane tickets and studio could have been spent making a tour happen has been spent recording things that won\u0027t be heard for many months. With $5,000, we could easily return to our friend Carl\u0027s studio and make some beautiful tunes next time we are ready, and maybe even rent a vehicle so we don\u0027t have to spend 3-4 hours on the bus each studio day :p \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time and your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRyan\u003cbr\u003e"
