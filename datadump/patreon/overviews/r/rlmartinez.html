    "summary": "I\u0027m R. L. Martinez and\u00a0I write mutant stories \u2013 you know the kind that are a little of this and a little of that \u2013 that have dark edges and corners. But it all generally falls in the science fiction-fantasy type of genre.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have published short stories through \u003cem\u003eLuna Station Quarterly\u003c/em\u003e, poetry through \u003cem\u003eWitches and Pagans Magazine, \u003c/em\u003eand the first two volumes of \u003cem\u003eThe Witchbreed\u003c/em\u003e (my heroic-fantasy series) are out through Lakewater Press.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe focus of this Patreon page will be a novel I\u0027ve been working on for some time, \u003cem\u003eDragon Tears\u003c/em\u003e (the first in a new fantasy series).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \u003cem\u003eDragon Tears\u003c/em\u003e about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, it\u0027s a fantasy novel about a woman with a shady past who stumbles on a dragon in need of rescuing. Only, this dragon is not what he seems and the woman finds herself embroiled in a civil war and a prophecy three-hundred-years in the making. The first chapter is available to everyone so you can decide if you really want to continue on this journey with me. This is a fantasy-romance so there will be a strong romantic element as well as explicit sexual content. There is also adventure, magic, intrigue, rebel scum, tyrants, dragons, exotic foreign lands, and kick-assery.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I set up a Patreon page\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, I\u0027ll give it to you straight - I set up this page mainly to kick myself in the pants. I don\u0027t anticipate making any money from this, but I thought it would be a good way to motivate myself to write on a more regular schedule. See, I\u0027m a hardcore procrastinator and, while I don\u0027t live off my writing (I have a full-time day job and a husband who works too), it is a very important aspect of my life. I love to write and I so want to share my writing with people. So, I thought this might be a good way to keep my creativity flowing and share my work in a controlled environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work enough to actually contribute I am stunned and humbled. That means more to me than I can possibly say.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do YOU get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI only have one goal at the moment and that is to reach $400 a month. If, by some miracle, we DO reach that, I will hire an editor to get\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDragon Tears\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0edited and ready for publication. I won\u0027t bother with a traditional publisher, but will publish it myself as I already have an amazing cover. As my patrons, you will get the first glimpse of that cover - but only if we reach that $400/month goal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the process of helping me reach that goal, I have an abundance of ways to thank you. Access to the \u003cem\u003eDragon Tears\u003c/em\u003e chapters, of course, but also poems, artwork, extra \u003cem\u003eDragon Tears\u003c/em\u003e material, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said above, I\u0027m not expecting to make any money. But I would be over-the-moon to gain some new readers (and I certainly won\u0027t turn away any $$ thrown my way ;P). In any case, thank you for checking out my page. Be well and do no harm."
