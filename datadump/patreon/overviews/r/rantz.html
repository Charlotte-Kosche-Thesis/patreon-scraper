    "summary": "So this is where I tell you why I am here, and why you should support me...well...I am here for two reasons. The first reason is rather obvious, and that is to make, for me, extra income for the craft that I love. But honestly, it is really about the second reason. And that is, to provide YOU, the fans, exclusive content that you won\u0027t be able to find anywhere else. Because without you guys, artists like myself, would not have a career at all, and this is \u003cstrong\u003eMY\u003c/strong\u003e way of giving back to you, that have supported me over the years, and for the newly acquired fans. And for that reason, I intend to have small, affordable monthly pledges, that make \u003cstrong\u003eYOU \u003c/strong\u003efeel like you are getting more than your money\u0027s worth. So with that, let\u0027s get to the nitty-gritty, shall we? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eSo, what do you intend on doing with all these millions of dollars that you will be getting each month?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Well for starters, retiring to a small island...but since THAT will never happen, I\u0027ll instead be using this money to travel to more conventions, paying for printing of new material for sketchbooks, and art books, and keeping the internet, and electricity on...and beer...mostly just beer...But seriously, being a freelance artist is hard, and unpredictable. It is also tough to get out to more conventions, because all of the expenses come out of my own pocket. So with your help, not only will I be able to make it out to more conventions to meet you all in person, I will also be able to get more material into your hands - and more eye candy for your visual stimulation!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, yeah - what\u0027s in it for ME? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e....nothing....well, maybe not \u003cem\u003eNOTHING\u003c/em\u003e...I guess I can throw in some exclusive stuff for you guys and gals...Hahaha. So, like I said earlier, I want to reward YOU for supporting me. So, I will post exclusive materials, give you the behind the scenes stuffs, as well as reward those that can stick it out for the long haul - which will include an exclusive materials, such as a\u00a0sketchbook from some of the materials posted, or early bird shots at new items being released, or even, for the higher tiers, your very own personal commission of a character of your choice...if you can put up with me for that long....\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo...if you have made it this far, and this sounds somewhat intriguing....pull up a chair, click on one of the support tiers that you want, and more importantly, can afford each month, and let\u0027s have some fun, shall we?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
