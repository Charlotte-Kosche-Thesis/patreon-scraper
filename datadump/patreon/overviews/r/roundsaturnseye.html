The purpose of the ministry is to share Christ in new and innovative ways that combat the current rise of Luciferian spiritual deception. All of the occult you are seeing in the media just inadvertently proves the only truth of Christ, the Messiah, our way Home. Showing the truth of salvation, with real world evidences surrounding you every day, one video at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eWhat R$E is doing is something called contextualization, like Wycliffe does.

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support. Primarily your prayers are what is needed - that the Lord might make the paths straight of this outreach and that many might hear the truth of the Gospel and the seeds might fall on fertile soil in their hearts. If you feel like you do want to help with equipment costs and the expansion of this work, then that would also be very much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExpand the Outreach\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExpanding the outreach includes funding ways of taking this much needed work further (ie. through paid advertising of the content on other social media platforms, breaking through into mainstream press, to print cards that are being distributed to the public on the street, funding the ongoing costs of hosting the official website at \u003cem\u003eroundsaturnseye.com\u003c/em\u003e). The entire goal of this is to bring the hard hitting reality of truth to a lost world and presenting the gospel in a way so relevant that cannot be ignored.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImprove Content\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eContrary to what some people like to spread, the work involved in many of these Christian end times outreach efforts video ministries does not stop at \"hosting a video on a free site that requires no funding\". Sadly everything from computer equipment, audio equipment, music licenses, editing software are all very expensive. I have very often funded my own, where possible, other than the generous help of some others to which I have been incredibly grateful. To give you an idea - if I was to purchase the editing software I need I would need to spend $700. However to cut costs I have opted to use a really basic version for around $15 per month instead. The microphone, mixer and other audio equipment cost $400. There is an incredible amount of time, money and effort involved in the technicality of video production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiving Needs\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUnfortunately we live in a world that living does not come too cheaply. If I could build a log cabin and live for nothing in the woods and hunt my own food I would opt for that. But I cannot make outreach videos in this circumstance. The work and attention needed to dedicate to this project is almost full time, sometimes creating one video alone can take 30+ hours over the course of a few days. This is my job and I desire to work in an outreach for the Lord Jesus Christ.",
