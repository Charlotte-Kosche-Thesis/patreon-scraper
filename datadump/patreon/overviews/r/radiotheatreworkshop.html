Not just as a faithful fan adaptation of a game world you all loved as much as I did, but to the characters, stories, performers and music that made it such a success. With your help, series three was an incredible success and I\u0027d like to invite you to take part in the creation of series four - where the story we started together comes to a dramatic conclusion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in. However much you can pledge provides funds to get the series made. Whether you want to contribute $1 and be a part of things, or pledge $8 per episode and join in with private post-show discussions, I appreciate each and every donation that helps get this show on the air. It\u0027s not going to be exclusive - Escape Velocity will still be released as a free podcast. But every supporter at $4 and above will have access to a download of a high bitrate version of the show. (The podcast is released as 128kbps mp3, while the private downloads are 320kbps).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo have a listen to \u003ca href=\"http://laveradio.com/EscapeVelocity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eprevious episodes\u003c/a\u003e, watch the video, chat with me here or on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CommanderThane/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e and I hope you\u0027ll decide to support us on this incredible adventure.
