    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my page, and for being a patron, if you are or decide to be one. To tell my stories, to write courageously, fearlessly, honestly, to give to the world the books that I have been hiding within me for the last ten years or more, that may not be \"commercial\" at all, but exist purely because they tell the truth and share it with others: that is my mission. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have in the past published at least three books that took an immense amount of courage, and a willingness to risk all I had: \"The Revised Kama Sutra: A Novel\"; \"Impressing the Whites\"; and \"The Killing of an Author.\" In each of these cases, I had some support, some backing, whether it was from my wife, for my first novel, credit cards for the second book, and credit cards as well as friends for the third. I knew those books had to be written and published, with as litttle censorship as possible, or else I would be a lesser man. I wouldn\u0027t respect myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut since 2008, when I published \"The Killing of an Author\", my life has gone so downhill, financially and to some extent healthwise, that I lack the time and concentration to complete and publish even a single important book. Because I am often scrambling to make my rent, my living expenses in the next ten days, and my medical expenses, so my focus is on looking for editing jobs or quick sales--a huge diversion of energy and a dilution of spirit and focus (though a few of my editorial clients have become my friends, and I am so grateful to them for having saved my life--physically). But now, I can just do one thing at a time: either be a writer or a freelance editor, and too many of my semi or nearly completed books are at risk of never seen the light of day if something should happen to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is why I have no option at this time but to tell the truth: I need around $1400 a month to live in a fashion that allows me to concentrate on writing. $1800 a month will buy me a new desk and a digital monitor (I now work on a laptop screen) and allow me to move to a slightly larger apartment in a quieter neighborhood (karaoke and loud music assaults me from 3 corners for something like 10 hours a day, and construction noise sometimes disturbs six other hours during the day). Most of all, I can concentrate on bringing out the books solely on their truth, without being concerned about offending others. But even a small portion of my goals, if met, do improve my life and decrease my stress and the possibility that I will live to complete at least a few of these books. They also encourage me to think that my mission is valued by people out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect you to agree with everything I write. If you did, what would be the point of my writing? I have to make mistakes, follow my hunches (even if they are wrong and sometimes excessively passionate). There is only one writer in the world like me, and that is me, and I have a duty to be that person, not to veer off into insipid banalities that meet with other people\u0027s approval. Please help me focus on writing once again.\u003cbr\u003e"

Passionate writer who was also described by Kurt Vonnegut as \"very funny.\" One of my essays has been published and republished many times in American textbooks. Fiction, essays, autobiography, memoir, commentary on social issues, political, humorous and satirical writing: I do all of these. I am at the moment forced to edit other people\u0027s books for my living, but I would rather spend my time completing my own many books in progress, because I sense I don\u0027t have much time left. All I need is to have my monthly expenses and a bit of a safety cushion, if possible, for travel and medical expenses. \u003cbr\u003e",
