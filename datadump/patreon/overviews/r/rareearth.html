Sometimes, people even like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week we put out a new video on a unique topic we found somewhere in our travels. If you donate, please note that we charge every Saturday, but no more regardless of output. If we happen to put out an extra video in the week, you won\u0027t pay. That\u0027ll be on us. If you\u0027d like to set a lower monthly cap, or to make it a single payment rather than weekly, we\u0027ll simply extend the length of your donation period and send the tier as soon as you\u0027re able to hit it. For example, if you want a show souvenir but don\u0027t have the very steep $25 a week, set a cap of $25 per month and we\u0027ll send it after 4 months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most importantly: For those who\u0027ve taken part, from watching and subscribing to joining our Patreon, thank you sincerely. While I greatly prefer that you donate to one of the charities/non-profits we highlight before considering us, I could not be more grateful to those who spend their hard-earned paycheque on our little documentaries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll try our absolute best to not let you down. Thank you for taking part in all this. We love you just for watching.\u003cbr\u003e"
