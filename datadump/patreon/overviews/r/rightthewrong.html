    "summary": "My name is Robin Edgar Haworth, and like everyone, I struggle on\na daily basis to meet the challenges of the daily grind, but before I go to\nsleep I give thanks, knowing tomorrow will be a better day. I have a warm bed\nto sleep in, coffee for the morning pot, and plenty of candles to keep the\ndarkness at bay. My four-legged friend Koda, an Aussie Shepherd, and myself\nlive a simple but wholesome life, totally off the grid\u2014not even a cell phone or\neven a clock. I am not the absolute Luddite, for I do own a 25-year-old transistor\nradio with the dial set to CBC. The sun sets the schedule for work and play,\nand when I am not at my table working on my art, Koda and I walk the trail of\nthis \u201cplace to live forever,\u201d as the Ooknakane people call it, greeting each\nday with a smile and a prayer of thanks. It\u0027s a tranquil little world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe long darkness of the winter solstice is a good time to\nruminate on our lives, reflecting on all things good and right, rejoicing in\nthe blessings bestowed upon us. But life\u2019s cup of goodness is also balanced by\nits cup of sorrow, the wrongs that also exist. We have to look with clarity at\nour failures, hidden in the dark, and give them equal consideration.  They take us out of our comfort zone, but if\nwe look with a critical eye and open heart, we may be able to see the human\npotential in ourselves to make change. Each of us is a beacon of light and hope\nas we are each empowered to make our space a better place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I step out of my little world of tranquility, I am saddened\nby some of the things I see around me. It matters not which direction I look, I\ncan see where some things are not quite right, but I can also see things that\nare plainly wrong. The greatness of this country will wane away if we do not\nstart to address some of these wrongs and injustices. Fixing these wrongs has\nalways been a struggle, both in seeking a better way, and then in actually\nrolling up ones sleeves to enact change. If we choose to close our eyes to\nwhat\u2019s wrong, or hope it will melt away like the snow in spring, we will only\nsuffer more sorrow in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis coming year is one of choice as we are asked to vote for a\nleader whom we will empower with the responsibility and resources to correct\nwhat might be wrong. As the candidates vie for our votes, we will hear about\nnew spending and promises of a better future. I would ask all who seek our votes\nnot to make big promises for the future or new money for new projects, but to\naddress the present day issues and to put some of the new money toward the\nunderfunded or the ignored existing wrongs in all our communities. From coast\nto coast to coast, in all parts of this great land, something is in need of\nrepair\u2014if I give you my vote will you use the authority divested in you to\ncreate change by righting what is wrong? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf our country and its elected officials continue to\nprocrastinate or ignore the present day needs, we will all suffer, and the\nshining light that is Canada will glow a little dimmer. It may even be death by\n1000 cuts for some, or outright extinction for others. This paints a pretty\ngloomy picture as I look at the greater world outside my tranquil little bubble,\nbut I can still see the glass as half full. We must start asking the right\nquestions, visualizing the goal, and have the fortitude to make it happen. We\ncannot and will not give into fear, doubt, or complacency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am but one lonely voice in the wilderness, but I believe my\nconcerns are not mine alone. Each and every one of us can work in our\ncommunities and see what needs to change. Some of our problems are quite new\nand can be reversed with a pen stroke, while some of our problems are\ndecades-old and are in need of some major attention and capital. If we continue\nto go down the road with blinders on and refuse to acknowledge what\u0027s holding\nus back from the true greatness we could be, we all suffer. We cannot leave our\nproblems to the next generation, or just hope they will go away. The inequities\nwe do not fix today in our society will only compound themselves and saddle the\nfuture with a bigger capital debt, and with continuing social decay. Do we want\nour children and grandchildren to be asking why we left them such a broken\nspace?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis coming March 26 marks the beginning of my 63rd year. I\u0027ve\nwitnessed many changes in our society. For the most part, the changes have been\nbeneficial for the social environment and the human condition, but on the other\nhand, deeply embedded ideas resistant to change hold us back from our full\npotential. Change can only come with awareness. Rational exchange and discourse\nis the first stage in how to create what we wish to achieve. We can continue to\nignore the needs of our society and follow those who view the world through\nrose tinted lenses and suffered the consequences, or we can start a dialogue as\nthe first stage to make change. I do not want to sound like the prophet of doom,\nbut I do want to stimulate conversation that the status quo no longer suffices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor this reason, my dog Koda and myself will start a journey on\nfoot cross-country to our nation\u2019s capital. I plan to walk almost 5000 km, and\nstop in the communities along the way to share my concerns for the future. I\nwould like to invite all who are up to the task to join me on this walk, which\nI have christened, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eRight the Wrong\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Strength in numbers is hard to ignore, and by\nthe time I get to my destination I hope for thousands of like-minded to stand\nwith me on the steps of Parliament, demanding that our elected officials use\nthe power divested in them to act positively to the wishes of the people. If\nyou share any of my concerns, please join me and let your voice be heard. We\ncan leave a better place for our children if we band together, demanding a sustainable\nand balanced social environment for all in our great land. We can \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eRight\nthe Wrong\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, let\u0027s make it so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere is a list of some of the things, in no particular order of\nimportance, that I see that need some attention and real action:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eGutting\nof greenhouse gas and carbon emissions regulations;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMuzzling\nof the scientific community;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe lack\nof clean potable water for many communities;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo\nfederal inquiry into the missing or murdered Aboriginal women;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGutting of\nfisheries research and regulations;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIncreasing\nunfairness and difficulty in voting procedures;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNeed for regulation and inspection of pipeline and rail services;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInadequate\nequipment and training for the RCMP;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLengthening\ngap between the rich and poor;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo label\nregulations regarding GMO\u2019s in our food supply;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnderfunding\nfor food inspection;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGutting\nof environmental oversight;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe lack of protection for endangered species;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eObscene\npension plans for MPs;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIncarceration\nof people based on policy, not criminality;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInadequate\nminimum wage;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLack of an\naffordable day care system for all families;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe\nSenate, and the gong show that is question period;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe aquaculture\nindustry and its effects on wild Pacific salmon;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe\ncollapsing infrastructure across the country;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnderfunding\nand other shortfalls of Aboriginal education;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe\nfinancial cutbacks for our national treasure, the CBC;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe cutbacks\nfor home mail delivery;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExporting\nraw logs instead of processing them in Canada;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCorporate\nwelfare and subsidies for large companies;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInadequate\nfunding and medical care for our vets;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe talk\nabout having no deficit\u2014but what about the debt? ;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHigh cost\nof food and basics for northern communities;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLack of\naffordable housing for all people, including the poor;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLong wait\nlists for people seeking medical care.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will be leaving on March 26 and will launch from \u201cthe Peach\u201d in\nthe city of Penticton in the beautiful Okanagan Valley.

     "about": "\u201cMy art really began in grade eight with\nencouraging words and praise from my art teacher; Mr. Nichol. It was not the\nstyle of today\u2019s art; I used different tools with different mediums. It was\nsimple enough to see form develop through hands and eye. Drawing was always my\nfavourite, maybe because I could take it with me. Dragons, castles and eagles\namong the trees seemed a common theme then. Fifteen years later I find myself\nin the big smoke back east, Toronto. After a lifetime of doodling and dabbling\nI settled fulltime into my craft with the encouragement of my wife and biggest\nfan, my newborn daughter. Over the past years my drawings finally evolved to\none style, which would categorize as West Coast design \u2013 Native/Aboriginal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI trace my lineage to the Tsimshian people\nfrom southeast Alaska and Northwestern British Columbia, Skeena River Country.\nMy Wilp or house is Lac Gyboo of the Wolf Clan. Members of my family spread\neast up the Skeena Valley to Hazelton and Kispiox and northwest to Ketchican\nAlaska. There are many places to view and feel the energy of the poles, masks\nand paintings that are abundant with the many artists that call this place\nhome. My village up the Kispiox is renowned for the poles standing by the\nriver.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhere the loggers have not left their\nscars, the land from ocean to mountain is home to the finned, feathered and\nfurred. The mythical creatures lie under green wave of the inlet or deep in\nhidden valley. These are scenes that breathe through the art as ink is spread\non paper. Form flows from ovoid, continuous and connected until the elements\nconverge and reveal the one. My images are all surrounded by a double-hatched\nbackground within an oval, symbolic womb of the Mother. The corners contain a\ncircle surrounding the medicine wheel. I put a small split \u201cv\u201d negative at the\ntop of most ovoids, I do so with apologies to the purists, but I like it.\nExcept for the straight lines and circles, everything else starts free hand in\npencil and finished with two coats of ink applied on a 140# cotton hot press\npaper. Every piece is one of a kind and no prints will be made. I\u2019ve had public\nshowings in Toronto, Victoria, Salt Spring Island and Prince George.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter twelve years in Toronto, the city was\nstarting to lose some of its shine and glamour so I have returned to the\nvalleys and mountains of the west. When not occupied by my art I can probably\nbe seen with my faithful friend Koda walking or riding the back roads and\ntrails of Turtle Island north, or floating on the waters that surround.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLook not out to the heavens above but\nrather into thy heart and we will find for what we search.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n~ Meguetch, Robin Edgar Haworth",
