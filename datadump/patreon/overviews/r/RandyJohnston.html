    "summary": "First of all, I want to thank all of you for looking at my Patreon page and for considering becoming my patron and co creator on my fun and interesting journey of making music! Many of you are already familiar with my creations in the past which include songs, tunes, albums, videos, concerts, and guitar lessons and master classes in many places around the world. To my many longtime fans, I invite you to join me here on Patreon where I look forward to providing you with greater content and value than you have gotten in the past when we both had to deal with record companies, publishers, and so on.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo new folks just hearing about me for the first time, Welcome! Let me tell you a bit about what I do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am one of the most widely travelled and recorded Jazz and Blues guitarists in the world today. I have played concerts in over 60 countries on 6 continents of the world. I have been written about in publications as varied as \"All About Jazz\", \"The Great Jazz Guitarists\", \"The New York Times\", and \"Virginia Living Magazine\". I have recorded 13 albums as a band leader for several record labels and played on dozens more as\u00a0a side musician. I currently have my own band, The Randy Johnston 3, which plays about 150 concerts and club dates a year internationally. In the past, I was part of several legendary Jazz and Blues groups, among them the Lou Donaldson Quartet, Lionel Hampton, and Larry Coryell\u0027s Strings attached. I have a published catalogue of over 40 original tunes and songs and my singing has been favorably compared to that of Ray Charles. I produced albums for several labels including Sony Music. I was an endorser for several well known musical instrument companies including Gibson and Fender. I taught music and guitar at New York University, SUNY Purchase New York, and University of Hartford, Connecticut, and conducted seminars and master classes in places as diverse as Tokyo, Japan and Bologna, Italy. I managed my own career for over 30 years in the intensely competitive environment of the New York City music scene, booking tours and gigs, negotiating record contracts and leading a band, and made a good living doing it, even managing to put my son through college with no student loans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I feel that I am in my strongest, most original, and most creative period, I want to share it all with you, without the middlemen, without the Bullshit, without the drama (unless it is the drama we want)!!\u003cbr\u003ePlease take this Journey with me....\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "It is very exciting to me to be on Patreon and bring my music directly to my many fans without the added hassle and expense of middlemen such as publishers and record companies! For the people who have worked with me before, listened to my music, watched my videos, studied music and music business with me, I look forward to providing more direct access to me and to my work than in the past and also much better value and more content than with the old delivery models that I dealt with in the past. For new folks WELCOME!\u00a0Please let me introduce myself and tell you a few\u00a0things about my long and varied career and what you can expect to receive if you are kind enough to support me with as little as $1 per month:\u003cbr\u003eI am one of the most widely travelled and recorded Jazz and Blues guitarists in the world today. I have played concerts on 6 continents and in over 30 countries. I have recorded 13 albums and a band leader for 6 different record labels over the past 28 years and dozens more as a side musician. My vocals have been favorably compared to those of Ray Charles. I was a member of the legendary Lou Donaldson Quartet for 18 years,one of the many top level world class groups that I have been a part of. I lived in New York City for 34 years and was a vital part of the music scene there. Now I live in Charlottesville, Virginia where my band is based. We play about 150 live concerts and club gigs a year regionally and internationally. I have supported myself playing and booking my own gigs for many years and put a son through college (no student loans!) doing so. I have also been a top level music educator for many years, and have been on the faculty of New York University, University of Hartford (Hartt School of music), and State University of New York (SUNY) Purchase, New York, in addition to releasing\u00a0 instructional videos that are watched and emulated by dozens of guitarists. I have conducted music seminars and workshops in Bangkok, Thailand and Birmingham, England and just about every place in between.\u00a0 My recent performances include gigs in Seoul, Korea, New York City, and Bologna, Italy.

     "description": "We will get together for an hour in a live video chat and I will consult with you on managing your career in the music business. I have been booking myself, hustling record deals, talking to club owners, booking tours, etc. for over 30 years and have learned more than a few \u00a0things about doing these things, making a living in New York City and putting a son through college \u00a0in the process. I learned these things through hard knocks and perseverance, but I think I can save you some time and heartache with a consultation or two! You won\u0027t learn this in music school!!",
