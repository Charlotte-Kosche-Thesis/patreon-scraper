    "summary": "Hello Everyone! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am building this game, Mass Attraction. \u003cbr\u003eMass Attraction is a interactive novel and a parody of a pretty famous game. And its about strong girls and bulging muscles!\u003cbr\u003eYou\n take the role of Commander Joe Shepherd in his spaceship, the \nNomanLand! The girls are acting strange and you must find what is \nhapenning before its too late!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe original scope of the game features:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-6 Characters(2 growth levels for each girl; Each level contais differents graphics, biceps flexing and FMG scenes)\u003cbr\u003e-2 acts\u003cbr\u003e-3 different endings\u003cbr\u003e-A special section where you can see extra events and arts. Also, you can see graphics and scenes of the main campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am using flash to build the game. It can be executed on most browsers and devices, less Android I guess. The\n game will be distributed for free, I will host it on my portal, DeviantArt and I will \ngive downloadable versions also. The release of this first version will \nprobably happen on this year yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a lot of work and thanks \nto the awesome support of Camel, I managed to push the game production forward and I am pretty close to the 50% mark. The big part of\n the work is the graphical part, developing and animating the scenes. Now I need help to finish the game with the features above. If you help, I will put your name in the game. Also, you will have access to test versions, arts, sketchs, etc. Depending of the level of the support, I can add more characters and additional chapters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, now. You must be asking yourself \"why he is asking for money if he will deliver the game anyway!? Is he crazy?\". First, I don\u0027t know, I never visited a psychiatrist or a loony doctor. Like any person, I have bills to pay, replace computer parts, eat, do others stuff rather than drawing muscular girls for hours, etc. I am working in this project since last April,\u00a0 one year already! Think like this: You are helping me to make this experience the more confortable and enjoyable as possible. The work will proceed faster, I will be able to fill the game with more content. And of course, you will be a part of the production. Working alone is pretty sad!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see the last BETA \u003ca href=\"http://blackkheart.deviantart.com/art/Mass-Attraction-Beta-5-3-609530150\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  \nYour help is greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS- I am also doing a gallery with exclusive arts(+25 pieces so far) and a comic(12 pages and counting).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
