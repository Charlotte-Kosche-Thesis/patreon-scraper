Patreon helps me by giving you a direct way to support the content I provide to keep you entertained. If you like what I do and would like to help me keep doing it, consider this a tip jar. \u00a0This is a learning process for me and with you, it can be done much more streamlined and easily without the burden of worrying how my next bill is paid, or if I can afford stupid things like batteries or cheap retro games, everything you give will be catered towards allowing me to better connect with you, and all my patrons will have there name credited in upcoming video uploads. \u00a0I will also feature upcoming videos strictly for Patrons that"
