    "summary": "I\u0027m rvbomally, and I have been creating and posting alternate history and science fiction timelines on AlternateHistory.com and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rvbomally.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e for several years. I tend to work with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, although some of the work I do could actually be replicated on Microsoft Paint. I am setting this account up because I will be graduating from law school next year, and in anticipation of the expenses that come with that I have decided that it would be a good idea to let people who enjoy my work reward me for it should they choose to do so.\u00a0I\u0027ve received a modest amount of acclaim for my work, so I figure that maybe \u003cem\u003esomeone \u003c/em\u003eout there is willing to make a donation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to think of this as a virtual tip jar, so donations are welcome but will always be purely voluntary. I will never make any of my work exclusive to patrons only, because I want people to see my work and I don\u0027t want to pressure them into giving me financial compensation in order to do so. My philosophy is that this is a hobby of mine, so while I am doing work, I am also getting enjoyment out of it and most of the time that\u0027s compensation enough.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also set up this profile to only pay me if I actually do submit something. The monthly pay system doesn\u0027t sit right with me, because while I do expect to be generating enough content to warrant it, it feels like I\u0027m being paid to exist. If I\u0027m going to be paid, I want to be paid for the work that I do, not for simply being. On that note, I will only submit the work that takes a lot of time, effort and skill to make - in other words, maps made in Photoshop or Illustrator. I will never charge for the \u0027Oneshot Scenarios,\u0027 as they are easier to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not going to set up any milestones because I honestly don\u0027t think I\u0027ll receive that much money from this, and I don\u0027t want to make any commitments I cannot keep. Like I said before, I treat this as a tip jar for work I already do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, thanks for visiting this page, and an extra thanks if you\u0027ve decided to become a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
