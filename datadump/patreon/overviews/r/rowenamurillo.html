    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBorn in the 70s to a Puerto Rican revolutionary and a hippie farm girl, I was raised on a steady diet of art, science fiction, social justice and the occasional tiger\u2019s milk carob bar. My whole life has been about stories, beliefs, questioning, and creating. I attended NYC public school, majoring in studio art at LaGuardia High School, then got a bachelors degree in English/Creative Writing and a masters in progressive teaching, specializing in integrating the arts into education.\u00a0I went back to the NYC school system to teach the same kids I had once been. I taught English, Humanities and Art to teens in the alternative school district and developed workshops and classes for both teens and adults in creative writing, poetry, art, and empowerment. I developed a workshop called WE: Women Empowered Through Creativity and Reflection, that was truly transformational for all the women and teen girls who took it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the years since then, I\u2019ve focused on my personal art and writing and also on raising my two kids. We now live in the country in the middle of Florida, where I can focus on my personal work in my studio at the edge of a tiny farm town. I have multiple science fiction and fantasy novels in varying stages, and a whole heap of art, as well as a nonfiction Art and Transformation book about writer\u0027s block.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been keeping a blog now for almost 15 years, starting with essays, moving into creativity, parenting, crafting, art, sliding along with life into science fiction and fandom for a while, and now coming back to creativity and writing in specific. Warriorgirl chronicles my journey as a new mom as I dove into creativity again. On Pinterest, I keep boards for all sorts of inspiration, with over 1.5 million followers. And over on tumblr, I answer a lot of questions about fandom, tv shows, science fiction, story telling, writing, creativity and life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is what I do. I create. I use art to empower. I help others to find their voice and power. I use my own journey as lessons to help others through their journeys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a creative almost guarantees you an economic struggle, unless you have independent wealth, a day job, or someone supporting you. Committing to your work full time means there is always an anxiety floating over your head about being able to have any measure of security. You\u2019ve got to hustle. And the hustle isn\u2019t necessarily conducive to the deep work that you\u2019re doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been creating seriously for 30 years, and I either do my work in private or I give it away for free. Which means; I find other ways to support myself and my family and these ways very often do not allow time or energy for the creative work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt and stories help others find their voices and become empowered, and sometimes it just makes the struggle more bearable and enjoyable. Because we have the stories the world needs. This work gives value to our society and deserves to be reimbursed. The very act of claiming that worth is a statement about what is important to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nArt is important. Artists are important. The love for art and stories and our belief in its value is not a reason for why we shouldn\u2019t be paid. I\u2019m hoping patreon will help me support my creative work just like anyone who provides a service to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get when you become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst you get access to the journey of art and transformation, where I use my creative process as a guide to illustrate how you can explore your own creative process. I\u2019m not teaching anyone how to write or draw, I\u2019m helping people to become creative and use their creativity to empower their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe will face fears.\u003cbr\u003e\nEmbrace the darkness\u003cbr\u003e\nEmbrace the light too, don\u2019t you think I don\u2019t know we\u2019re not all afraid of our potential.\u003cbr\u003e\nAccept our struggles and flaws.\u003cbr\u003e\nAddress those demons we bring with us.\u003cbr\u003e\nEnjoy being creative and remembering how it feeds us.\u003cbr\u003e\nLearn about ourselves and become who we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have 20 years of content and curriculum that I am looking to provide my audience, as well as constantly evolving new work. This is a new journey I\u0027m on. Come with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining. I look forward to the adventure.\u003cbr\u003e"

You also get one high definition art work a month, that you can download and print out for your own use. AND you get a surprise gift in the mail every month. It could be bookmarks I\u0027ve designed or paper dolls. \u00a0It could be a small creativity kit or a felt pin. But it will be made by my hands for you.\u00a0 This level gets you a monthly one hour scheduled consultation with me, by phone or facetime or message if you prefer, where I can work one on one with you on your creative project and we can hash out your struggles or help you move to the next step. This level can also be used as a tarot consultation if you prefer that. Or both.",

I would like to start doing videos, perhaps with some process videos or creativity conversations or mini workshops to start.
