Here\u0027s why:\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write as many of my own pieces as I can manage, but I write for a living and so paid work often takes precedence. I live lean in a small house in a small town where my entertainment is mostly open spaces and cooking from scratch. Yet, there are still bills. I WANT to write more of my own stuff, but the dogs still keep bugging me to be fed (didn\u0027t they just eat??), the electricity is due every month, and apparently I now need things like glasses and multivitamins. UGH.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, no lie, a bit of money to buffer the time spent creating would be fabulous, but more than that I need a little boost in morale. Patreon is a great platform to put everything I write and draw and ponder together and make it available. Even better, a group of people (no matter how small) supporting my work for $1 a month equals a singular patron with expectations. You are telling me... \"\u003cem\u003eGo, Grasshopper... Go make what you will. Just don\u0027t forget, I\u0027M SUPPORTING YOUR WORK\u003c/em\u003e.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd if you\u0027re supporting me. I definitely won\u0027t forget it.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
