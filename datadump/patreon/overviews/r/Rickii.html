    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Erica Caines. I am a writer/ freelancer, self published poet and author of\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/2ExZRbPWoi\"\u003eAll In Love Is Fair\u003c/a\u003e (2014).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\u0027s next?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am set to publish my 2nd book, a chapbook collection of personal and relatable experiences about finding your way in the world as a Black woman, at the top of the year. \u00a0The chapbook, entitled Quenched Soul, is full of empowering prose and melancholy haikus and a few other styles of poetry.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the meantime, I am creating a zine with a few Young Black and Gifted women collaborators (writers, photographers, artists). The purpose of the zine is to not only help me\u00a0expand creatively and grow from\u00a0writer to content creator, but to showcase the talent of Black women I know and promote my initiative Liberation Through Reading (a program that helps get Black centered books to Black children to encourage representation and reading).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis patreon is to help me get started on creating my first FULL Zine with contributors. Because I\u0027m working with other creators, as a creator, I would like to offer payment. This will allow me to pay for contributions to the zine including artwork and original stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is also to assist in the self publishing costs of my second poetry book, Quenched Soul, and the children\u0027s story I wrote,\u00a0inspired by radical Black women, that I hope to see become published.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut more importantly, this will also give me an opportunity to jump back into writing more frequently and doing more long form pieces. As well as practicing and perfecting prose pieces and navigating my tone of voice in my writing.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll be using Patreon to not only raise funding for creative projects, but to showcase my creativity as well. There well be lots of long form posts on inspiration not limited to people or things, but music and other arts as well. I intend to make this an extension of/ a platform for my creativity so there will periodically be themed Mini Zines (5-10 poems) available as a PDF download for patrons. Some posts will include free book links.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere will also be fun posts on my interests in books, skincare, make up and other random musings!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I update?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAside from my initial post, all new postings will be made twice a month with some exceptions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons may receive special exclusive posts from time to time as a thank you.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope you decide to jump on board, but if not\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to tip!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cash.me/$RickiRyan \"\u003ecash.me/$RickiRyan\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
