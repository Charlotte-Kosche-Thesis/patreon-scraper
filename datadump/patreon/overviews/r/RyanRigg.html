    "summary": "After working for 6 years in a community college and doing IT work, I decided to start my own business a few months after my contract ended in 2012. I graduated with a master\u0027s degree in computer science in that same year and felt I was on my way. I had actively began uploading YouTube videos for fun and it grew, over time, into so much more. With my Son and I both actively making video content and being a small business owner, I\u0027ve decided I want to make more of a career with YouTube and attempt to make it a full-time job and take that next big step! As some of you know or may not know, making money on YouTube is not easy! The cost of equipment, time invested and dedication does not offer much in the form of being able to pay your bills unless you\u0027ve grown into something quite large; I haven\u0027t yet though.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI want to begin to vlog daily with more daily activities, travel and new places. I\u0027d like to eventually upgrade my equipment and create an in-house studio to be used between our 5 YouTube Channels. In order to attempt to make a living so I can support my Son, pay Student Loan payments and monthly bills I need your help as a Patron. Your contribution, small or large, can really help offset the lack of income coming from YouTube Ads and will help to contribute to my work; our work!"
