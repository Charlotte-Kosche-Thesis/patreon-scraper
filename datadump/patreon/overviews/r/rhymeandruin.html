Okay now that we\u0027ve got the basics out of the way, lets go a little deeper...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make art as a way to translate my subjective experience into something hopefully both attractive and relatable. I tend to be drawn to darker themes: isolation, disconnection and a search for equilibrium, but my goal is to translate them into something that leaves the viewer feeling hopeful for the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I love experimenting with new techniques and mediums, my first loves are Copic markers and Oils. Pretty disparate I know, but theres really no accounting for taste. My focus lately has been on building up a body of illustrations and solidifying a style that is fun to create in and recognizable as my own. Ultimately, its about the practice for me; I love creating art and I hope that I can continue to do so in some form or another throughout my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by\u003cbr\u003e",
