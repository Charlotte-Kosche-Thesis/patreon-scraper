    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Roogna?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been crafting and creating in various media since I was a small child. Honestly, I\u0027ve always loved taking on challenges and thinking outside the box, and art is a great way to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the mid 1990s, I helped pioneer the customizing / modifying of My Little Pony toys. Since then, I have been continually refining my skills and expanding my horizons. This includes cleaning and restoring vintage ponies as well as rehairing, painting, and sculpting to create new, original ponies as works of art. Every time I create I try to better myself, which often includes trying something new and sometimes research.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy customs have won People\u0027s Choice awards at the annual MLP Fair and Convention and have been featured on some wonderful blogs. I love sharing what I know and getting others into customizing; as such, I am happy to answer questions! I have hosted panels on MLP Customizing at GeekGirlCon 2012, Yama-Con 2013, and MLP Fair and Convention 2014.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently expanded my art to include Littlest Pet Shop customs and doll face-ups (mostly Ever After High). I am looking forward to continuing to experiment with new mediums and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m happy to answer questions, and I take commissions. I hope you will enjoy this journey with me as I create and share my love of ponies and art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a full gallery of my completed customs please visit my DA page \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://roogna.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://roogna.deviantart.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for what\u0027s currently for sale, check my etsy page\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/roogna\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/roogna\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy be a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main job is running a traditional martial arts school. It\u0027s a small business that is managing to support itself, but doesn\u0027t support me or my art. Art is something I always find a way to do because it is part of my essence. Something about reimagining and reinventing little ponies is just good for my soul.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a Patron means you are helping me purchase supplies and allowing me a little \"breathing room\" in my budget. I do post updates to my Facebook page, but here I will include all the behind-the-scene updates and previews before I post anywhere else, and many of these will be exclusive looks. I also love getting inspiration from unexpected places, so I\u0027ve set up my rewards to allow you to inspire me as well as have opportunities to receive a piece of artwork at a discount or free!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to use your donation to fund experimentation -- trying new techniques, playing with new media and supplies, and finding new ways to be creative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy monthly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my pieces take weeks to months to create. I also work on several at the same time. So some months will have no completed works but lots of progress, and other months will have more than one completed work. It allows both of us to budget. :) My current plan is to post updates at least every Tuesday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
