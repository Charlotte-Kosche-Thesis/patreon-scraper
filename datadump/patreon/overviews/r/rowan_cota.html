    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Rowan. You may know me from such things as contentious social media posts or blog entries about feminism. You may also know me from game design, or my work with Indie+. (Or both! Or neither!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. Patreon. I went back and forth for a while about setting one of these up. I went back and forth on whether blogging, collecting resources for people, helping with inclusivity and community policies, and education was really work, since I don\u0027t have any kind of degree or license for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then, I thought, \"Hey! Some people really like my work! Some people have shared with me how much they benefitted from my work! I\u0027d love to be able to turn that appreciation into help with continuing to do that work.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is deliberately simple. If my work benefits you, if you find that it has helped you or made a difference in your life, and you would like to express appreciation for that in monetary form, this is here! I only have two \"reward\" tiers, one unlimited and one limited. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m doing here is a pretty radical feminist experiment. There\u0027s a lot of weight on the idea that women should do unpaid labor, and that feminist activism is one of those kinds of labor they should be doing for free. While I\u0027ll continue to practice feminism (because it\u0027s part of my identity), I also believe it\u0027s fair to ask people who benefit from my practice to consider supporting it.\u003cbr\u003e"
