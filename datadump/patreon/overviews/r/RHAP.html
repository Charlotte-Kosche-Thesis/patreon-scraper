Myself and many other RHAP personalities are also active members of the patron Facebook group which is a great way for the RHAP community to feel part of the show. I like to do regular Facebook Live broadcasts through the patron group which allows patrons to ask me questions and see what goes on behind the scenes of the show. Patrons get early access to tickets for RHAP events like Live Know It Alls. I try to make the patron Facebook group a real portal into the world of RHAP. We post about shows, news in the reality show community as well as opinion polls that influence show content. I post podcast question threads in the patron Facebook group to give patrons additional access to my podcast guests. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eCommunity\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, becoming a Patron of Rob Has a Podcast invites you to be part of a community of superfans just like you.
