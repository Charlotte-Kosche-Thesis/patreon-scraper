    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe problem:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGetting mainstream media attention for Canadian roots\nartists has never been more difficult, especially for emerging artists and\nthose who play traditional styles.\u00a0 That means finding coverage of Canadian roots artists in the mainstream media is also getting harder and harder. Over the past decade, more than a dozen major newspapers\nhave folded, as readers and advertisers migrate on-line.  Those that remain have cut staff and content\nto the bone. Increasingly, we\u2019re relying on a single media outlet,\nPenguin Eggs, to cover Canadian roots music.\u00a0\u00a0We need more than that.\u00a0 We need a home for Canadian roots fans online. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe solution:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u2019s bring back RootsMusic.ca!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFounded in 2009 by Andy Frank and David Newland, RMC served\nas an on-line community space for Canadian roots music for around five years,\nwith record reviews, artist profiles, song and video premieres, and much\nmore.  It was \u201cedited\u201d by a loveable\nmoose named Gordy and had a great community vibe.  More than 5,000 people still follow its\nFacebook page. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nLast year, I (Heather Kitching) purchased RMC from Andy and David, and I\u2019d\nlike to revive it as a sustainable on-line media outlet for fans of Canadian\nroots music and a place where those of us with projects to promote can reach\nthose fans with news about our projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe pitch:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m asking you to help me crowd-fund RootsMusic.ca to the\ntune of $1,200 a month Canadian.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat money will pay the overhead costs of the site, such as\nthe domain registration, server space, and graphic design.  It will also pay me or one of my associates\nto spend one day each week working on the site: \nposting content, answering emails, dealing with technical and design\nissues, promoting the site, and doing whatever else is needed to keep it\nrunning and keep the fans coming back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn essence, I\u2019m proposing to run RMC in much the same way that\nmany successful roots institutions already run: \nvolunteers make the magic happen, but the essentials are taken care of\nby one or more paid staff members (in this case, one very part-time paid staff\nmember).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019re a label, publicist, promoter or anyone else who\npromotes multiple artists or projects, please consider supporting the site at\none of the organizational sponsorship levels in exchange for your own login and\nposting privileges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh!\u00a0 And if we exceed $1200 a month, we\u0027ll start paying the writers who write for us!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should we trust\nyou to run this, Heather?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a 20 year veteran of the Canadian roots scene, I operated a successful roots music publicity business for more than a decade,\nand I also happen to be a qualified journalist and editor, so I have the\nbusiness background, the journalistic know-how, and the passion for folk music\nneeded to do this job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMany of you already know me as the publicist for artists\nsuch as David Francey, Alex Cuba, Jim Byrnes, Linda McRae and Steve Dawson.  Some of you know me from my years as the\nnational sales and marketing coordinator and in-house publicist at Festival\nDistribution.  Some of you also know that\nI studied journalism at Carleton University, that I\u2019ve done a significant\namount of freelancing for SiriusXM, the CBC and others, and that I\u2019ve spent the\nlast three and a half years filling in regularly at the CBC, where my work has\nincluded reporting and editing for their digital platforms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI see reviving RootsMusic.ca as a great way to combine my\npassion for music and my skills in media, while offering a service that the\nroots community desperately needs right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will the new\nRootsMusic.ca compare to the old RootsMusic.ca?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn many ways it will be the same.  The new RootsMusic.ca would continue to\nfeature reviews, artist profiles, new music, and other thoughtful items of\ninterest to roots fans and roots artists. \nThose contributions would come from volunteer writers (In fact, some of\nthe talented writers who contributed to the site before have already stepped\nforward to write again!), contributions from industry supporters, and artist\nsubmissions.  I would also repost\ninteresting items from around the web and contribute original content as needed\nto keep the site fresh.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill we be able to\nbuy ads?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow will you promote\nthe site?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe primary means of building audience online is to post\nregular content, share it on social media channels, and encourage sharing by\nothers.  Consequently, my main\npreoccupation will be keeping the content on RMC fresh and shareable.  Those who contribute financially to the site\nwill also qualify for RMC merchandise, with which you may help spread the word\nabout the site. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill RMC have a radio\nstation again?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt this point, the priority is to use the modest financial\nresources I\u2019m asking for to build a solid web site with regular posts.  The site will feature links to existing roots\nmusic programs and podcasts from stations such as CiTR and CKCU.  In addition, I\u2019ll explore creating Spotify\nplaylists as a way to showcase new music to Spotify users. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill the site have\nlistings?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u0027s the plan.\u00a0 I have acquired some calendar software that appears to be up to the task of managing listings and serving calendars for multiple different cities.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill Gordy the Moose\nstill be involved with the site?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYes!  In fact, he\u2019s\nalready moved in with me.  If anybody\nknows how to get hoof prints off a sofa, please let me know.\u003cbr\u003e"
