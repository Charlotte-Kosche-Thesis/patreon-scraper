As you guys know, commisions are my main source of income, you know, the life of a freelancer. Some may say it\u0027s a bit too stressing but hey, someone has to supply the big buff wuff demand ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e So this is why I\u0027m here. I need a more steady income so I can focus more into making my drawings so people can enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e This doesn\u0027t mean I will quit working on commisions, but i need to feel more stable."
