    "summary": "Hey, Retcon Raider here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first started making videos in April of 2017, primarily to help spread the word of a video game crowdfunding project that I was following. The response to my first few videos was so positive that I\u0027ve continued making videos ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently uploading an average of five new videos a week, and you can expect to see me upload a mixture of gameplay videos, game reviews, lore analyses, and videos showcasing upcoming indie games - with a heavy focus on role-playing games, strategy games, and turn-based tactical games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still pretty new at a lot of this, but I\u0027ve learned a lot over the past few months, and I like to think that my videos have improved in quality over time. Unfortunately, things like software, equipment, and a high-speed internet connection can get pretty expensive, and it\u0027s become increasingly obvious that I can\u0027t rely on Youtube\u0027s revenue system to cover those costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to be able to keep producing content, especially if I can keep taking steps towards improving the quality of that content, but I need your support to do that. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I can\u0027t afford much in the way of rewards, so you\u0027ll really just be supporting my ability to continue producing more content. But hey, even if you decide not to become a patron, just know that I\u0027m still grateful you even considered it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides, either way I\u0027m still going to end up talking about the video games that I love to play!\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ve already managed to make some improvements on my own, but I\u0027d love to be able to afford things like original art and music assets as well as better recording equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and games! I\u0027d love to be able to afford more games as well, because I need those to make more videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePulling in $100 a month would be a great step in the right direction. That would cover my recurring internet and software costs, and leave me with a little left over to buy some extra games. Or maybe food. But probably games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s definitely not enough to do everything I\u0027d like to do, but it\u0027s certainly a good start!",

I\u0027ve managed to cover the costs of my upgrades so far, but this is the sort of thing that\u0027s going to end up costing a lot more money in the long run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can pull in $250 a month, then I\u0027ll be able to start making steady, incremental improvements to my computer and recording equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s mostly boring stuff like computer upgrades, backup hard-drives and better soundproofing, but it\u0027s all stuff that needs to be done if I want to continue improving my videos.",

You guys are incredible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, with the channel growing, so are the expenses for keeping it running. With that in mind, I\u0027d like to start setting aside some money for other important expenses associated with running the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, this is mostly boring stuff like taxes and more expensive upgrades, but I\u0027d also like to start setting aside some extra money for games. There have been plenty of games that I\u0027ve \u003cem\u003ewanted \u003c/em\u003eto talk about over the past few months, but I can\u0027t always fit them into my budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can hit this goal, then not only will I be able to make slow but steady incremental improvements to my recording area, but I\u0027ll also be able to pick up at least one or two new games each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get to play more games, and you get a wider variety of videos.
