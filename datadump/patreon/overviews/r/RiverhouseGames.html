    "summary": "Hello friends! I\u0027m Taylor, and I run Riverhouse Games. We do a lot of fun RPG stuff, including producing two podcasts and writing plenty of games and RPG supplements.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur main show is Game Closet which focuses on queer \u0026amp; LGBT+ tabletop gaming. I also run The Leviathan Files, a D20 Mass Effect Actual Play. In addition to the podcasts, I write micro \u0026amp; nano games as well as work on some larger game projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://theleviathanfiles.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/tlf-show-art.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;h=298\" style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://riverhousegamespodcast.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/12794509_975509462531958_803567454085975615_n.png?w=300\" style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of this is great and I would love to be able to do it with no stress. However, this whole shindig isn\u0027t free. I\u0027m fine with paying out of pocket for some of this stuff but I only have limited resources. Plus, I can only work on so much at a time if it\u0027s just me. The more people and support we have propelling Riverhouse Games forward however, the sooner I can get content out. Not only that, but the content that does go out will be of such better quality and professionalism than if I were paying for it alone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe that artists should be paid for their work. Right now I\u0027m paying to make my work. The goal of this Patreon is to meet somewhere in the middle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat will your money go to? Right now we have some pretty clear expenses, including hosting sites to pay for the web page and podcast hosting as well as\u00a0art and layout fees to make the finished Riverhouse products look polished and professional. My three main goals in terms of fundraising are to be able to cover:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHosting fees for the podcasts \u0026amp; website\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArt \u0026amp; layout for the games\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProfessional quality podcast editing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat will you get for supporting Riverhouse Games? At the basic levels you\u0027ll get my thanks and early access to everything I\u0027m making for free right now. That means you\u0027ll have advance access to both the games and the podcasts. At higher levels you\u0027ll get development journals \u0026amp; notes as well as REALLY early access in the shape of playtest documents. The highest levels will get you the final finished documents of all of my games, which will include all art \u0026amp; layout, before they go live to the public.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CvAzaWpVUAA6A0a.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI absolutely love making the things that I make, and I\u0027m bummed that I can\u0027t afford to make them at the quality I know they deserve, but that\u0027s where you can help! If you\u0027re a fan of the shows or the games, please consider helping contribute to making them the best they can be. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd, as always, please remember to\u003cbr\u003e\nShare and Enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e"
