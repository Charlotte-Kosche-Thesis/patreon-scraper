We aim to reduce food waste, campaign to make our food system fairer and more sustainable, and support our local community.\u003cbr\u003eIn the UK 15 million tonnes of perfectly edible food ends up in landfill each year, some of it before even reaching supermarket shelves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are we going to do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur mission is simple \u2013 to feed bellies, not bins!!  We do this by working with local supermarkets, businesses, shops, food producers and farms \u2013 intercepting food that would otherwise be thrown away, reducing needless landfill and feeding hungry bellies with delicious food instead.\u003cbr\u003eRandom Cafe is something really different for our town,  it\u2019s about inclusion, community and sustainability.  We want to hold some pop up events in and around Watford.  We want to create a cool pop up  cafe and food boutique, where the food and atmosphere are great, a place where people want to be, where all of the meals just happen to be made from waste ingredients, and served on a pay-as-you-feel-basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupporting People\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to create a social spaces for Watford with a great new concept; pay-as-you-feel.  At The Real Junk FoodProject Watford, absolutely all of our food is eaten on a pay-as-you-feel (PAYF) basis.  PAYF means that customers can offer a financial donation to the project of what they feel a meal is worth, give whatever they can, or can recognise the value of a meal by donating their time, energy, skills and support. The aim is to make a truly inclusive community space that will value the contribution of those who have little or no money \u2013 people before profits.\u003cbr\u003eThere are currently around 8 million people in the UK who are in poverty so deep that they can\u2019t afford enough food, let alone access healthy, nutritious food.  At the same time huge amounts of perfectly edible food is wasted. We think this is bonkers, and we want to fight to change it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupporting Our Planet\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRandom Cafe\u2019s aim is to reduce food waste, and its huge environmental impact.  Around 15 million tonnes of food is wasted each year in the UK alone, and the vast majority of that food is perfectly edible. When we waste food we also waste land, water, diesel used in farming, packaging, energy to refrigerate and so much more. The lowest carbon, most sustainable thing we can do with food that is going to go to waste is put it in a belly, any belly, rather than a bin, any bin (landfill, anaerobic digestion or compost).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can visit our website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://randomcafewatford.com/about/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
