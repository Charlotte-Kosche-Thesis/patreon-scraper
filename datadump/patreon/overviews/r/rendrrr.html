    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/6a5a4bb23c96a833d89972669f0a828b/tumblr_o7thzsQl9c1rrmt8so1_540.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nI am a Cartoonist, Concept Artist, Illustrator, but all in all I am a Generalist, who also specializes in 3D CG, Animation, Graphic Design, Motion Graphics and VFX from time to time. I\u0027m an artist that enjoys having the freedom to experiment and express my creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nArt has always been a passion of mine in which I like to immerse myself in more than one type of medium. Sounds pretty clich\u00e9, but it\u0027s something I really love doing and I want to keep doing. But reality says, \"Hey, wake up! Remember that cash is needed to survive?\"\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s where I turn to you and Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s so much that I want to do, but I am constantly interrupted due to priorities to keep me and my family financially afloat. I want to be able to create and do art as more than just a hobby. Moreover, I want to be able to keep expanding on what I am capable of doing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eIf you\u0027re a\u00a0well versed\u00a0digital artist, why don\u0027t you work in the art industry?\u003c/h4\u003e\nWhen it comes to working in the art industry, the truth is that you can easily become fixated in one position in one field of art. For example, you can be a part of a few projects, but you\u2019d still be in charge of the same thing every time. In addition, these projects would be client based. Although you might be able to implement some of your own ideas or give feedback from your area of expertise, you are severely limited in what changes you can make. This hinders the artist\u0027s liberty. For me, it\u0027s a bit frustrating, because I want to be able to work on multiple projects with no creative restraints.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn short, I want to have the freedom to be able to create content where I am able to express my creativity with no limitations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHow will the money be used?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI really wish I didn\u0027t have to resort to asking people for money, but we all know that money is essential in this society. Again, the money will be used to support myself and my family for necessities so I can continue to do what I love: art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eVision?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI want to be able to work on multiple projects that I have in mind, ranging from music videos, to an animation short, to a visual novel, to a web comic, and many others. You might think I\u0027m spreading myself thin, but I am a hard worker and would genuinely enjoy working on these projects. I think of my vision as a small piece of the puzzle, because my ultimate goal is to share my artwork with an audience. And that\u0027s a true reward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eProject(s)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u3010\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u304f\u3093\u30aa\u30aa\u30ab\u30df\u3055\u3093\u3011Red-kun to Ookami-san (Red and Mr. Wolf)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 80px; text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t+An original web comic\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/126b82244d4355e2929c7a196534a6bc/tumblr_o7thzsQl9c1rrmt8so3_1280.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eStaying Connected\u003c/h4\u003e\nOther sites where you can find me:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://retaliationgraphics.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantart (art gallery)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://retaliationgraphics.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr (art and doodles)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rendrrrrr/media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter (art and other shenanigans)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAny amount is much appreciated and as always, thank you for your support.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/814d37bcfbacf527e11779e347ff777b/tumblr_o7thzsQl9c1rrmt8so4_540.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
