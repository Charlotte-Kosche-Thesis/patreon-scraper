Thank you so much\u003c/strong\u003e, every pledge helps and the goal is $500!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, my name is Resonance22 and I have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Resonance22Channel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/resonance22\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch Channel\u003c/a\u003e where I create videos for Age of Empires 2 and a wide variety of other Strategy or Nintendo games. My content is extremely approachable and intended to get new players into the competitive scene. Thank you so much to all of my fans and patrons!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR: The more funding I have on Patreon, the more time I can spend on YouTube \u0026amp; Twitch. The less funding, the less time I have for videos, as instead I must spend all week on job interviews and applications. Your pledges keep the channel active during my job hunt!\u00a0:D They also grant you EXCLUSIVE REWARDS!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI was full-time streaming from November - February, and starting in March I began my full-time job hunt, 5 full days a week. Now I need your support more than ever to keep the channels active! \u003cstrong\u003eI\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ef we can keep the funding level between $450 - $550 then I will have more time to continue producing videos and streams during my interview process, which may take many months.\u003c/strong\u003e The job hunt is always a lengthy process and your support will keep my channels active while I do everything I can to get employed. I really appreciate it! If you\u0027re a supporter of my videos, now is your chance to really make a difference and rewarded for it too. \u003cstrong\u003eOnce I get employed, my channels will be much more active than before so please keep still keep your pledges as I can finally invest that money back into the channels for more and better quality videos (like new emotes, better overlays, better editing, sound, art, etc)\u003c/strong\u003e. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor context: Unfortunately I was caught up in a larger series of lay-offs at work and staff cuts do happen and so I wish my old coworkers and company the absolute best! In the short term though, this does put me in a bit of a financial pickle. For my old full-time job I moved to a new apartment, left my previous job at Forgotten Empires (volunteer now), and I really thought I\u0027d be working under my initial manager there for years to come. This has made it very difficult to get a job. While shocked, I do see this as a valuable opportunity to create more content for my fantastic YouTube \u0026amp; Twitch communities that I am glad I have stuck with for 6+ years across 2 channels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support is really appreciated as right now all of my income is from YouTube \u0026amp; Twitch. Even as little as $1 a month can make a huge difference. Not only will all contributions help pay the bills but they will also improve the quality of content I do too. I\u0027ve always wondered what we can accomplish if I had the time to invest in it, so let\u0027s give it a go! Thank you so much for the support everyone. I have a lot of projects planned I think you\u0027ll all enjoy if I can keep the electricity on until I get a new job. Then once I get a job, I will use the Patreon money to improve the channel with things like new art, new emotes, sounds, and editing. The possibilities are endless! Cheers! ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon Goals heavily revolve around my Patreon Supporter ($5+) and Twitch Subscriber Discord. That is where Patrons and Subs vote on games, play with me, receive coaching, and get most rewards. To connect, open your Discord App, in the bottom right next to the mic icons there is a gear icon for user settings. Click that, go to Connections, and connect to Patreon. Then scroll down a bit to click the Join button for my server. \u003cstrong\u003eI really appreciate you all keeping my channel alive! I look forward to producing more and better content.
