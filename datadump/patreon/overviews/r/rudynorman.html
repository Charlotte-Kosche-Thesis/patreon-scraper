Some kids used a blank sheet of paper to draw pictures of rainbows and family portraits, but I loved a clean sheet of white canvas because it meant I could form the words in my head into some kind of story that got my imagination moving in all directions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat never changed all throughout my life, and today I still have that same desire to write and let my imagination run free. However, writing is easily boring and stale unless it\u0027s shared with someone, and quite frankly I\u0027m thinking my wife is wishing I\u0027d find new friends who are willing to read my stuff so she wouldn\u0027t have to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working towards writing a book that\u0027s about a family in a post-apocalyptic world, trying to survive against the powers of the day. The brother and sister will be the main focus of the story, and they\u0027ll encounter some challenges along the way that will test their loyalty, strength, bravery, and desire to keep their family together at all costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to share the book with you as we go, and give you the very first, raw, unedited versions of the chapters. Eventually, you\u0027ll be among the first to actually read my first book, which will hopefully be published in short order after the writing process is finished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to provide some feedback along the way, it\u0027d be much appreciated as well."
