    "summary": "Hey there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Game Master in some tabletop roleplaying games, you often need to provide scene information visually, be it on peace of paper, pre-printed grid or fancy 3D terrain with miniatures. Another option would be to do it on your computer and display it on external display or video projector. There are some adventure management applications out there but I found them cumbersome to use and not very intuitive. So I decided to develop my own with a tight scope on keeping it easy, fast and fun to use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to ready-made maps and tokens, RPG Scene includes option to load maps and tokens from the internet as well, giving you limitless opportunities to create your scene full of adventures. Easy to remember keyboard functions make it easier to move tokens around. Adding text makes it nice additional information on the map and to prevent spoiling the scene on initial view, adding blind spots that can be later revealed is also included.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am developing this on my free time and will offer this service for everybody totally free of charge. Why? Because I enjoy making other people\u0027s\u00a0lives a little bit easier and as we all know, Game Master\u0027s task is not easy. There are tons of things Game Master must control and RPG Scene makes the whole experience more enjoyable and free of stress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRPG Scene can have multiple usages. You can display it on external monitor at the dinner table while playing with your friends or share the browser window to players on Skype or Google Hangouts. How about displaying game progress at a con by projecting the scene with a projector? Perhaps the coolest idea I have heard of is laying a flat TV on the table and use it to visualize the adventure for your players. Sky is the limit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron, you support me and my two little goblins at home and make it possible for RPG Scene to evolve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can try out RPC Scene at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://beta.rpgscene.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRPG Scene BETA site\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely yours,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtur Gajewski\u003cbr\u003e"
