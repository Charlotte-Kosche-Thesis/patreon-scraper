    "summary": "My name is Rain Dove. Rain like from the sky, Dove, like the bird. Most know me as a model and an activist, but the modeling does not pay the bills because I am a queer and aesthetically nonconforming model. Which means there aren\u0027t as many opportunities and the opportunities that are there often pay way less than for softer spoken conforming models. I want to continue because it is giving a platform for our activism and for your voices with the exposure and press. But I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m going full throttle into the activism like never before and as a consequence have to choose between having a roof over my head or continuing this path to create change at the level I\u2019ve been doing or higher. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI fight hard for many causes, amongst the many forms of activism, I make videos, write legislation proposals, blogs, meet with bipartisan individuals to find solutions, speak at rallies, do social experiments, and much more. As an example, last year North Carolina made it illegal to use a restroom that doesn\u2019t correlate with your birth certificate. So, I flew out to the capital and worked with local organizations and individuals to perform several actions to fight this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I published a video called \u2018What happens when you go to North Carolina without your birth certificate\u2019 the video was self-funded and I received no sponsorship but it went viral with an incredible 19 million views. In the video, I shared a loophole in the law I had discovered, which many wrongfully accused and trans people, used in their legal defense. Because of this activism, and our work together, police could no longer stop people from going into bathrooms without facing a lawsuit. The impact and result were worth it but this activism took about 6 months of savings from my modeling work to complete. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I could do so much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing I like to do is social experiments. They are a lot of fun and they create a tidal wave of dialogue that has changed lives! In these experiments I test how society reacts to different scenarios or types of people- then I document it and publish it in articles and on social media to raise awareness. I spend most of my free time in schools speaking to high school and elementary students, educating, responding to people on Instagram who question their identities or their children\u2019s identities, in some cases even helping to prevent suicide, volunteering at organizations to give them visibility and time, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what, I\u2019m an activist first. I won\u2019t stop the work I\u2019m doing and I won\u2019t stop modeling because of the exposure it gives our voices. My life is dedicated to making your world better for you. But I need your help to make this movement really move at a more impactful pace. From as little as 2 dollars per month, we can together make this world safer for many. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003eRain\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
