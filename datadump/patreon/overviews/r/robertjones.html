    "summary": "Thank you so much for checking out my page! We have limitless potential to create amazing projects that benefit our world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Robert, an author, researcher, developer, animal\nrescuer, green business innovator, and cancer survivor. I develop projects that\nmake a real difference in our world. I have been given a second chance at life,\nand intend on paying back this opportunity tenfold. Being my patron means being\nan active participant in a truly diverse portfolio of interests, projects, and\ntangible acts that make the world around us better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, where to begin\u2026..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy company, SmashParks, Inc, has now finished the\ndevelopment of Smoggle Smash. A fun and free tapper/tower defense game, Smoggle\nSmash saves real-world land into conservation while users play. The app even\nallows users to log on for the sole purpose of our conserving land through our\nSmashParks Initiative. SmashParks is all about daily activities that have a\npurpose and allowing entertainment to mean something greater for the world at\nlarge. Smoggle Smash is the first step of many that allow a daily routine to\nhave a great impact on our world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy co-founded nonprofit, Wildlife Resources and\nEducation Network (WREN), has taken part in rescuing more than 2,000 injured\nand orphaned wild animals in just two years. WREN also educates at no cost,\nspeaks at venues on proper human to wildlife interactions, has taken part in\nhosting two symposiums for the education of wildlife rehabilitators, donated\nthousands of dollars toward the care of injured and orphaned wild animals,\ndeveloped a large volunteer transport network, and developed a free-to-use app.\nThe Your Wildlife Counts App allows users to count deceased animals along the\nroad. Users can make a small pledge per animal so that their life can mean\nsomething and go toward the treatment of another injured animal within the same\nlocation. The data from Your Wildlife Counts will eventually help us identify\nareas of concern along the roadways where we can possibly help in the\nprevention of so many animal deaths. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love to write fiction and have had two books accepted for publication. \u003cem\u003eGargaphia:\nWhere History Means Murder\u003c/em\u003e is available now in paperback or kindle format.\nThis is a suspense thriller that takes the reader\non an unexpected ride where studying the past can bring about a devastating\nfuture. \u003cem\u003eStaterus: The Sons of Time\u003c/em\u003e immerses\nthe reader in a fantasy journey where fallen heroes are conjured to use their\nnewfound magical powers to balance a world teetering on destruction. Both\ntitles are pieces of their own series. I write for therapeutic purposes, so\n100% of my personal royalties go to various charities. I focus most of my\ngiving on cancer, Parkinson\u2019s, wildlife, domestic animals, and children in\nneed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAcademically, my research focuses on\nancient military history. I am published in ABC Clio\u2019s \u003cem\u003eConflict in Greece and Rome: The Definitive Political, Social, and\nMilitary Encyclopedia\u003c/em\u003e. I give lectures on the Greco-Persian Wars and am\ncurrently undertaking my PhD at the University of Newcastle in NSW Australia.\nMy research will take me for field work in Greece scheduled for June of 2018.\nThere, I will use a combination of drones and geophysics to discern markers\nfrom the ancient Battle of Plataea. I have also lectured heavily on multiple\nbusiness topics, where I hold a degree in corporate finance, a certificate in\nstrategic marketing, and an MBA. My primary concentrations are entrepreneurship,\nsustainability, marketing, green business, and management. I prepare lectures\nand give consult through WREN, but also work with the public and multiple\nnonprofits at no cost. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy personal farm acts as a sanctuary for\nseveral animals rescued from dire circumstances. Cows rescued after bouts with\nbloat or coyote encounters as calves, a lame horse taken from a rough\nsituation, and a chicken taken from abuse highlight the rescued animals on the\nfarm. We have also fostered and gotten proper homes for nearly a dozen other\ndomestics, and are heavily involved in the sponsorship of senior dogs at\nrescues, where we provide all the costs associated with their care. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy other business ventures focus on\ngreen innovation and making a difference to the world. One of my companies, a\ngreen equipment profit share, estimates a saving of more than one million\ngallons of gasoline through its various operations. In addition to\ngreen-focused companies, I have also taken a historic 1820\u2019s tavern on the\nverge of collapse and completely restored/renovated it. Thousands of documents,\nand relics of historical meaning, have been preserved in museums and library\ncollections. Additional plans are aimed to produce projects in history and\narchaeology. I am constantly thinking of ways that produce sustainable projects\nthat provide a positive impact on the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we can create and bring unlimited positivity to our world! Also, being my patron gives you tangible rewards that let you know you are accomplishing something wonderful each month!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
