    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rubiee, and I\u0027m the Tea Maven of Dryad Tea. I\u0027ve been at this for over two years now and I\u0027m learning more every day, I also like making shiny things out of gemstone, clay and metal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love tea. You have probably noticed that by now. Tea is my life, it\u0027s taken over and I wouldn\u0027t change that for the world. I am a small business owner, I do pretty much everything by myself unless I have volunteers of assistance. It\u0027s great to be the CEO, Boss, etc... but what isn\u0027t great? Numbers. Money numbers mainly, I\u0027ve learned a lot in the first two years... One of those things is that in order to keep prices low, you pinch every penny you can so you can buy the extra supplies for new blends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where you all come in. Yes, I\u0027m asking for your support, your help and for you to believe in me and in Dryad Tea.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBy supporting me you are allowing me to do what I love more freely. Mainly blending new teas.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m hoping that by having patrons who believe in me and what I do that I will be able to create new loose leaf tea blends, work on tea blending and research, more pottery more often and work towards creating a cookbook using my tea blends!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupporting me means that you\u0027ll get the heads up about any new blends! And even vlogs or live streaming! \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is \u003cstrong\u003ePer Month\u003c/strong\u003e. It is not like Kickstarter where it\u0027s all or nothing. This is a monthly support that will allow me to create greatness. You\u0027ll also get really fun things for it too!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support with $1 a month that is totally awesome! If you want to support with more I will *NEVER* complain! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to use Patreon as a way to talk to me too. I love talking to people that love Dryad Tea!"
