    "summary": "Hello Humans! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rebecca Elizabeth Webber and I am on an adventure to live a more sustainable life. I graduated from Western Washington University in 2013 with a degree in Anthropology and Social Studies. Since then I have been researching and testing minimalist and mindful styles of living. I have now come to the part of this journey where I would like to share what I have learned in an effort to learn more! When teaching, I like to focus on three key components of sustainability - financial health, conscious social impact, and environmental responsibility. As I have worked day in and day out over the past 5 years to improve my life and that of the people around me, I have had the opportunity to develop organizational methodology and a nutrition system. With these tools I hope to help as many people and organizations as I can create a life that is simple, satisfying and and sustainable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my biggest projects, Sapient Nutrition came about in 2015 when my husband Thomas and I lost access to healthcare and I endeavored to treat his Junior Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) on my own. Thankfully, I was successful. Thomas is now off all prescription medications and feeling really good. I have become somewhat of a novice healer since then and continue to expand my knowledge of holistic healthcare practices, both modern and ancient. There is wisdom to be found, if you only stop to look. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy guiding mission today is to create a professional life for myself that will allow me the freedom to work from home or from wherever opportunities take me! I am currently recovering from an environmental illness and autoimmune disorder which momentarily silenced my activism, kept me home bound and dramatically reduced my quality of life for years. It has been a battle, one which I currently feel that I am winning. I am now ready to teach what I have learned so that my students can get their lives on track and ultimately flourish at whatever they choose to do. I am certainly better off having implemented these methods in my own life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are ill, concerned about the environment, or simply ready to take your life to the next level, I hope to have the opportunity to work with you. Meeting someone where they are at and working with them to create a plan to get them where they want to go (what I call a \"here to there\" project) is a real joy for me. Thank you for taking the time to check out my page. I hope that we get the chance to collaborate soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Rebecca E. Webber"
