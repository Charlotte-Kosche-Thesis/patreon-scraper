    "summary": "Hello, action figure fans. I\u0027m Robo. I\u0027m just a dude who likes action figures and decided to ramble about them on the internet. Well, \"decided\" is a strong term. More like \"I had the extra time to start learning to make videos for the website, essentially drawing the short straw.\" But over the years I\u0027ve grown to love sitting at the desk or standing in front of the green screen and just blabbering about toys, especially the 1/12 (6-inch) scale super articulated variety. And that love has gotten me more and more comfortable with the camera as time passed. Sometimes it gets silly, sometimes stupid, but I hope it\u0027s always fun. Mostly fun? And it\u0027s only going to get better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr worse, but in a good way. Fingers crossed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m not going to beg you for money. I\u0027m just here because making videos takes time and resources, and it can get expensive, but I won\u0027t get too far into that. If you\u0027re down to support my efforts, I thank you. Truly I do, from the bottom of my little hillbilly heart. But if you\u0027d rather not or can\u0027t, hey, that is perfectly fine too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour eternal soul will do in a pinch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m kidding. There is no \"Soul\" option on the card swiping machine. At least not the one I\u0027m using. But I still appreciate you taking the time to check my stuff. And by \"stuff\" I mean my videos, or this page, or my various social media posts. Not \"stuff\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still working on incentives and such so this may look sparse for a bit. Maybe we\u0027ll decide together. I\u0027ll continue to grow this thing and morph and evolve and see where it goes. Which is essentially the basis for 90% of my videos. Hit record and see where it goes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s also my stance on life. Give it a try and see where it goes. See? It\u0027s not all about action figures. It\u0027s also about our existence and how we connect during our short time here. The deeper meanings behind our words. How we react to trials and tribulations. The memories we make and the ones we leave behind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027s mostly about action figures.\u00a0"
