    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does Patreon work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, unlike Kickstarter that pushes all funding and donations towards one end goal; Patreon pays the creators for each piece they release -- or monthly, depending on the amount of content released in a given month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges given help show Patreon Creators that their audience wants them to continue working on their projects. It also helps tide the Creator with day-to-day struggles such as food, transportation, or sometimes supplies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can donate as little as $1, or higher. And don\u0027t worry! You can set a monthly budget for yourself, so no matter how much your favored creators create, you will never pay more than the limit you set -- ensuring you don\u0027t overextend your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m an aspiring writer from Staten Island, New York. I\u0027ve been writing for almost ten years now.\u00a0I grew up in a quaint little home, and stayed mostly stationary throughout my life. I live with my brother, my parents, and a cute little munchkin demon-dog called Daisy. While my parents have pursued practical careers, my brother and I have (aside from taking part-time jobs) pursued artistic ones. I, the writer and he, the musician.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a part-time job that helps bide me, and I go to college. I\u0027ll be getting my Bachelor\u0027s in English soon (Yay) and I hope to successfully pursue an MFA in English Writing sometime after.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love going to Cons (Comic-Con and Wicked Faire particularly). And I\u0027ve a serious love for all things Geeky; Star Wars, Warcraft, Anime, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, Dragon Age/Mass Effect, the list goes on, and on, and on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReally though, I love to read and write. More of the latter, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my journey?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEver since I was eight or nine I\u0027ve always had my own ideas and stories branching off of media pieces that I saw; Star Wars was my start. At first all I knew was how to draw; so I doodled poor images and other scraps to pass the time and to tell my stories. That is, until I discovered writing around the age of 13.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was during the age of 13 or 14, my English professors in high school began to stir something in me. My methods for creation were sparse beforehand, and I had given my time to playing video games, mostly MMOs that really ate my social time. However, it was in these MMOs that I discovered Roleplaying and was encouraged to create my own characters and backstories that told who they were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the next 3-4 years, I struggled to write. Every weekend my parents brought me to a little home in the deep forest of Pennsylvania where I had an old computer with no internet connection. I wrote on a terrible little txt. pad. Did I mention I struggled? I did. Young as I was, my concept of grammar, punctuation, and spelling was horrible - and with no proper word document to check for my mistakes, I often returned with my flash drive to my internet-blessed desktop and uploaded my fanfictions of my original characters without editing the documents first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the years went by, I slowly began to grow as a writer. I always felt (and still often feel inadequate). I constantly struggle with my writing, whether or not it is good, if people will enjoy it. I did very little reading and just wrote, believing it to be the cure-all to my problems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I reached college, I was a shy and awkward boy, still stuck in my high school youth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took time, but eventually I evolved - as a person and as a writer. Various wonderful professors helped articulate my skills. I began to read more, not out of necessity, but out of pleasure. I took my writing more seriously. I began to write mock-drafts of novels in the length of hundreds of thousands of words and hundreds of pages. Still, I struggled, but I felt more confident.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNearing the end of my college years, I feel as though I\u0027ve learned as much as I could and I want to try my best to write fiction and put it out there. It\u0027s all I can do, while I work on bigger projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so many ideas running around in my head and not enough mediums to put them on. Which is why I\u0027ve turned to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I posting?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m posting short stories, mostly. Short stories that I can\u0027t post anywhere else, or don\u0027t know where to post. These stories range from Fantasy, to Sci-Fi, to horror, and thriller - those are the genres I put heavy focus on, in that order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, I\u0027ll post what updates I can about how my other, larger projects are going. I\u0027ve invested a lot of time in writing larger novella/novel pieces and I\u0027ve every intention in going through traditional publishing methods to have them published. That being said, I also have some smaller ideas that I want to self-publish. Ideas that I think, would do better in a more direct market.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for reading! And thank you for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
