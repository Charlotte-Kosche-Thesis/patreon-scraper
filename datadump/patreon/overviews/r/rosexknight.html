    "summary": "Hello all and welcome to my Patreon. I am RosexKnight, but you can call me Kristian! I have quite a few projects that I try to work on regularly as a hobby. These projects consist of ask blogs, fanfiction, some original works like normal fiction of my own as well as a webcomic that\u0027s in the works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is that because of restrictions with my schedule due to work, school, and general life, I usually have to focus on keeping myself afloat and stable. By helping me out, you will ensure that not only will the blogs update quicker, but the quality of the blogs and projects will be much better! If you\u0027re interested, read about the blogs I run, check them out, and lend me a hand! Every penny counts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt Blog -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://breaktimedoodles.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBreak Time Doodles\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWriting Blog -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://breaktimewritings.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBreak Time Writings\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.rosexknight.tumblr.com/blogs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFull Blog List Here\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pre10.deviantart.net/709d/th/pre/f/2016/151/5/6/rook_39_by_rosexknight-da4gv98.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsk Knight and Dustlight. It was my first blog, and probably the one I\u0027m most excited to continue. Knight is a pegasus pony driven by a code of honor and chivalry. But when his flutterpony companion, Dustlight, is kidnapped by a mysterious black unicorn, it\u0027s up to him to pony up and save her.

This blog is still young, only about to go into it\u0027s first storyline, but it\u0027s probably the one I\u0027ve had the most fun with. Doctor Whooves has found himself as another regeneration in another universe, where every living organism takes on the likeness of a toy. Even the architecture looks like playsets! But everything isn\u0027t what it seems, and The Doctor will learn that the hard way when he finds himself outside the house.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ask-windupwhooves.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCheck it out!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pre00.deviantart.net/3d9e/th/pre/f/2016/151/a/9/jenny_pony_30_by_rosexknight-da4gv4n.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContinuing on with the theme of Doctor Whooves we have Time Explorer Jenny!

This follows the adventures of the 9th Doctor as a bat pony. He\u0027s just ran into an odd child with the face of a gas mask in a place that\u0027s supposed to be the Grand Galloping Gala.
