    "summary": "\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eCALIFORNIA DELTA IN PERIL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the Delta Counties Coalition, \u201cFailure to protect the Delta will result in the loss of historic communities and will stifle local and regional economic growth and sustainability.\u201d There you have it. A brief but powerful statement brought to you by the Delta Counties Coalition that comprises Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Contra Costa, and Yolo counties. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTry to imagine what will happen to Delta families if the threats facing the the region go unchecked. For instance, if the so-called California Water Fix - the twin tunnels - is allowed to proceed, not only will the region\u0027s agriculture be all but doomed, but so will many generations\u2019 way of life and the livelihoods of the people who call the Delta home. Altered forever with no recourse. \"Tidewater Tales\u201d is encouraging folks to share their stories before it\u2019s too late. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor its entire existence, the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta has been thought of in terms of hydrology, geography, edaphology, agronomy, ornithology, ichthyology, zoology and political ideology. Seldom mentioned are the approximately one million people who live there. This project deals with that neglect by featuring everyday Delta people in photographs and conversations published in a digital magazine format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we allow the Delta, this amazing place, to be mismanaged into oblivion we all lose something that can never be replaced.  Let\u0027s try to take good care of it, and, along the way, meet the everyday folks who contribute to its uniqueness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"TIDEWATER TALES\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis project about the California Delta is long overdue and here\u0027s why:  If you were to Google this topic you\u2019d find nearly 3 million references for it. If you add photography to your Google search you\u2019ll find over a million more hits. You can find out all you want to know about the proposed twin-tunnel project, or the tides and levees, or the types of crops grown, the water wars and political wrangling, or anything else of interest. And you can find lots of photography, too, including on my own website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u2019s what you will not find in your Googling of the Delta: a comprehensive collection of portraits and profiles of people in the region. Not just the leaders or major stakeholders or newsmakers. No, \u201cTidewater Tales\u201d is an ongoing magazine-style project here on Patreon that will grow into a book and traveling museum exhibit that allows everyday Delta Denizens to talk about this real place where they live, work, raise their families, and play. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is launching on the heels of the success of the \u201cDelta Grandeur\u201d traveling museum exhibit and coffee table book. It is imperative because \u201cGrandeur\u201d celebrates the place but \u201cTales\u201d celebrates the people of the place. After all, it\u2019s the PEOPLE who make the Delta what it is. Bountiful. Recreational and food producer for the world. And a downright neighborly place to visit. A project such as this has not been done before. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis 1,100 square mile region comprising over a thousand miles of navigable waterways is practically invisible except for the fact that it is thought of as an endless water supply to Southern California, a haven for wildlife, or a great place to water ski. The rich character and culture - and the people that call the Delta home - are seldom considered. \"Tidewater Tales\" addresses that inattention with portraits and stories about the folks who live and work in the region.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor instance, you would love to meet Juanita, the four-foot-something woman who, in the 1950\u2019s, immigrated from Mexico to the Delta with her husband, Gilberto. After twenty years of farm work they opened their own restaurant at a lonely intersection of a highway and country road in the northwestern Delta. Now in her early eighties, she still manages the small kitchen where the amalgamated aromas of simmering soups, sauces, and braised meats are simply irresistible as she greets the visitor with a sincere hug and a smile that will melt your heart. She and her husband raised 7 kids  and one of their cousins who have all gone on to higher education and successful careers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there is the fellow, now in his early seventies, who was raised in Clarksburg and devoted his career to agriculture and higher education. In his self-effacing and easy-going manner, he credits much of his success to having attained the rank of Eagle Scout as a member of Troop 83. He later became Scoutmaster there and served in that capacity for nine years, assuming the duties from the man who was his Scoutmaster when he attained that rank. Of all the boys who start scouting, the national average of those who become Eagle is one percent. In the small Delta town of Clarksburg it is fifteen percent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are only quick outlines of conversations that, with all the rest of the people \u201cTidewater Tales\u201d is celebrating, commingle to create an endlessly rich cultural and historical heritage that is the California Delta. You - and I - will learn much more about these and many more Delta Denizens when you hear their stories, plus a photograph or two of each, when you subscribe to\"Tidewater Tales\" here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEXTRA STUFF\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor a slightly higher subscription cost you will have access to \u201cDelta Diaries\u201d, a weekly posting of a photograph from the archives and a short story about it. Think postcards but better. Subscribe at this level and you gain access to the first tier, as well.\u00a0 The next tier is \"Delta Grandeur\" chapters posted monthly. This is the 140 page coffee table book with over 100 photographs in 14 chapters. Subscribe at this level and you will have access to the above two levels, as well. The next two tiers reward you with yet more good stuff. Check those out elsewhere on this page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid I mention that this site is free of advertising?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWell, it is. And this is where you can partner with me. For a very low monthly subscription cost we can avoid those annoying pop-up ads you find everywhere else in the online world. However, I do want you to know who my corporate sponsors are but only their logos will be shown in a banner at the bottom of posts. I promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re a patron, you\u0027ll get automatic notices of new posts. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA BIT ABOUT ME\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSome forty years ago I discovered and fell in love with the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta when I moved to Stockton to work at The Record newspaper as a photojournalist. I\u2019d find myself heading home at the end of the day and, seeing an indescribable quality of light in the direction of the Delta, decide to follow it with my camera. Long after I left the newspaper to open my own fine art and commercial photography studio, the Delta still has its hold on me. My Delta work has been curated into many exhibitions and a book titled, \u201cDelta Grandeur\u201d. That material was ultimately condensed into a traveling exhibit that has been hosted by UC Irvine, San Joaquin County Historical Museum, UC Merced, Museum on Main in Pleasanton, Hayward Area Historical Museum, and CSU Chico. The latter\u2019s Gateway Science Center has installed a semi-permanent exhibit based on \u201cDelta Grandeur\u201d. That tour is still in progress and we expect \u201cTidewater Tales\u201d to be at least as well travelled. The non-profit organization, Exhibit Envoy, that manages the exhibit, estimates 12,000 visitors will view \u201cTidewater Tales\u201d over its three-year run. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, my Delta photographs have been shown at the State Capitol, The Wallace Stegner Environmental Center in San Francisco, and numerous galleries and one-person shows. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is a membership platform that makes it easy for artists, creators and Patrons to join forces to create meaningful work at various and affordable levels of participation at monthly recurring patronage levels. Think magazine subscriptions but with rewards. And you can cancel at any time. These days traditional journalism outlets have their hands full just keeping their doors open, let alone doing projects like \u201cTidewater Tales\u201d that are exclusively about a single topic or area of study. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in. For a a very low monthly subscription you can be the early recipient of chapters of the new book that will be curated into a traveling exhibit. All that and some pretty cool perks at varying levels, too. Give it a shot, it\u2019s hassle free and risk free so select the tier level that is right for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy such a nominal cost? The California Delta is too important to ignore. For a long time I\u0027ve shared my Delta art and stories as far and wide as possible in an effort to raise public awareness of the region. Patreon is helping me do just that and I intend to keep the cost as low as possible to spread the word as far as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you will be the first to see new chapters of \u201cTidewater Tales\u201d - unavailable anywhere else - before they become the traveling exhibit and book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO I DO THIS? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you love something, you want to protect it. By sharing what I can about this amazing place and stories about the people who make it so, I hope some of my affection for it convinces my readers of the fact that the California Delta region is worth protecting. You may even learn a thing or two about this amazing place. I know that by creating them I always do. So please feel free to bookmark this site and return often.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy gaining exclusive access here you are partnering with me in this endeavor at a nominal cost. Thank you for taking into consideration becoming one of my patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s take some trips through the Delta and meet some interesting people along the way. Together we might convince some more people that the California Delta is worth protecting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s what others are saying about this project:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Exhibit Envoy exhibitions travel throughout California and beyond, hosted by a wide-ranging network of museums, libraries, colleges, universities, and botanical centers. We particularly strive to bring relevant exhibitions to underserved areas with culturally diverse audiences, and \u201cTidewater Tales\u201d is one of those timely and important exhibitions. As evidenced by the success of \u201cDelta Grandeur,\u201d visitors see a strong link between the story of water in California and their own lives; \u201cTidewater Tales\u201d will further strengthen visitors\u2019 understanding of the Delta, its history, and its people. Envoy estimates that 12,000 visitors will view this exhibition during its three-year tour, and that host venues in rural, suburban, and urban areas will be thrilled to bring this exhibition to their communities.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-- Amy Cohen, Executive Director, Exhibit Envoy\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWhen the Delta is not ignored completely, it is usually thought of as a water conveyance, a natural resource, or a recreational area. Seldom are the rich history and culture\u2014or the people that call the Delta home\u2014considered. \u2018Tidewater Tales\u2019 addresses that oversight. The San Joaquin County Historical Museum is proud to launch Rich Turner\u2019s exhibition and the book, as we did with \u2018Delta Grandeur.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-- David Stuart, Past Executive Director, San Joaquin County Historical Society\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cTidewater Tales\u201d can only continue happening with your involvement.
