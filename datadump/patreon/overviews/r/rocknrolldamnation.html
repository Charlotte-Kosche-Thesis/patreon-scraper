    "summary": "For as long as I can remember, music has been one of the most important factors in my life. \u00a0At a very early age, I vivdly recall playing records with my family, falling asleep while laying in front of our oversized floor speakers. \u00a0A few years later, I started making mix tapes on blank cassettes for friends, family, \u0026amp; myself. Sharing music was always a wonderful way to connect with others. This continued for many years, until blank CDs became readily available. \u00a0The format changed, but the mixes kept coming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany factors influenced my love of music \u0026amp; mix making. \u00a0However, nothing had a bigger impact on me than the film Pump Up The Volume. \u00a0Hard Harry played the best songs \u0026amp; used this music as a driving force to break through his shy, introverted, face-to-face demeanor. \u00a0After seeing this movie, I knew I wanted to be a DJ. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward many years, I was working in a bar/dance club. \u00a0A few of the employees convinced the owner to let us take over a slow night \u0026amp; spin rock n roll records. \u00a0The headphone jack on the mixer didn\u0027t work \u0026amp; the turntable lights were completely burnt out. \u00a0As we struggled with guessing where each song began, barely seeing the record grooves with nothing but our cell phones for light, I got the itch. \u00a0A few years later, I was working at a music store. I used my discout to purchase the basic necessities and began DJing on the regular. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving grown up playing records, I knew I wanted to keep the true spirit of the DJ alive \u0026amp; spin vinyl exclusively. \u00a0Watching someone hand pick music from records, knowing that they had to track down each piece, is more entertaining than seeing someone turn a few knobs behind a computer screen, as a program does the majority of their work. \u00a0The convenience of a digital format is certainly more appealing in many ways. \u00a0It\u0027s something I welcome it when it comes to making DJ mixes. \u00a0However, I will be permanently attached to physical media. \u00a0I will always spin vinyl when providing the soundtrack for a live DJ event, \u0026amp; each mix I make will also be availabe on CD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy launcing this Patreon account, I hope to continute enjoying my love of sharing music by: introducing you to a band, artist or song you may not have heard on your own; reminding you of a long forgotten favorite; or by simply connecting on an emotional level, through a mutual love of music.\u003cbr\u003e"
