    "summary": "I am a full time freelance Fine Artist and Illustrator. I work solely in traditional medium, such as Acrylics, Oils, Charcoal, and Graphite. I have dedicated my life to the advancement of my skills as an artist. The majority of my work has been custom personal commissions for individuals of fan communities. Though I have had the pleasure of doing book covers, posters, advertisement illustrations, album covers, and illustrations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have not seen my work, here is my website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.raccoonarts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.raccoonarts.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nwant everyone to know what I use the funds I am given on my Patreon\nfor, and to realize that your support is not going to waste. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe art supplies I use are top end,\nartist quality, and archival. Such supplies are not cheap! My average\nbill to the art store is $120 - $200, for paints, brushes, and Gessoed Artist Baords. To some\nthat may not sound like much, but to a freelance artist like me, that\nis a fortune!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, when I take commissions I do not\ncharge what they are really worth, pricing my commission as half what\nthe market suggests so that my customer base and fans can afford it. I usually eat the shipping cost, and the taxes.\nIn the end the little profits I make go to keeping my rent and\nutilities paid. Usually, leaving very little for the expensive art\nsupplies. That is where Patreon comes in. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI encourage anyone who can and wants to\nsupport my art, to give to my Patreon. Those who do become a Patron\nwith as little a $1, get perks: such as first pick of items, and a 24\nhours heads up when I open for commissions before I post such notices to other sites. The money will go to\nkeeping my studio stocked with much needed tools, paints, and\nsupplies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank\nyou for any support you can give *Bows*\u003cbr\u003eRyngs\u003cbr\u003e"
