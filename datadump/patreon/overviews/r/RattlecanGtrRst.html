Everything that happens on the channel does so \u003cem\u003ewithin the confines of that budget\u003c/em\u003e: instrument acquisition, tool and material purchases, even video production costs. Many of my videos show me trying to manually do a task usually done with a big expensive power tool. When I run out of money, I finish the month with what materials I have and an endless abundance of curiosity and creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8101/29752988951_078f4755b7_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA benefit of this budget-driven mindset is that I have a high regard for using \n\u003cstrong\u003ereclaimed materials\u003c/strong\u003e in my projects as well as in my workshop and the jigs that I build. I HATE to see useful items headed for the landfill. My main shop table is made from two reclaimed fir beams nearly three inches thick and sixteen inches wide. I paid $15 for them...SCORE! A number of my hand tools are from second-hand shops and estate sales. I have made stunning rosettes and headstock overlays from book-matched spalted maple/ash found in a firewood pile.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7774/29214538183_762770a67f_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDid I mention that I have no formal training in either woodworking or instrument repair/construction? The entire series is me discovering facets of the luthier skill set (\n\u003cem\u003eluthier\u003c/em\u003e is a fancy word for people who build stringed instruments) from the point of view of someone with no experience in the field. So, I screw stuff up. \u003cem\u003eFrequently.\u003c/em\u003e I learn something, you get to laugh, everybody wins! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7522/29839485665_3e1c02e12a_z.jpg \"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m on Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nBudgets are great when everything goes as planned. My budget was set in 2013 before I began making \n\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube\u003c/strong\u003e videos and back then, the entire budget went to buying broken instruments to experiment on and the tools I needed. When I began making videos, the production costs (software purchases, computer upgrades, lighting needs) came out of that original budget (and still do). When a hard drive crashes and needs to be replaced, the money comes out of the guitar budget. Right now, that budget is......$200 a month. So you can see how having to replace a 4-terrabyte media drive can slow the shop to a crawl in short order.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8541/29726739032_a5373cc665_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your help here on \n\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, I want to start funding those production costs apart from the project budget for constructing, repairing and restoring stringed instruments.
