I\u0027ve been recording and streaming video game content, as well as other varied entertainment videos for about six years now. I\u0027m known for taking on all kinds of ridiculous challenges, uploading playthroughs of any and all types of games. My specialty, of course, is platformers (especially hard platformers!) With this Patreon comes a promise that I must deliver content in return for your awesome support! I will also be more active and consistent with uploads and streams aside from the goals here. Thanks to everyone for your support!"

We will conduct a Yugioh tourney centered around utilizing Turtlebird in your deck. There will be a surprise and definitely there will be some kind of prize for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place which have yet to be determined yet. All matches will be best 2/3 as well as there being a loser\u0027s bracket to get another chance at winning. \u00a0Also you\u0027re not allowed to use any meta and Turtlebird has to be utilized in someway shape or form. All decks must be submitted to our referree who will verify that\u00a0your deck is in advanced format, isn\u0027t meta, and that it has 3 Turtlebirds in it. I will also play a variety of Yugioh games using a Turtlebird themed deck. All matches will be recorded and we will use devpro which is a client that isn\u0027t resource intensive. Show off your amazing creativity and if you\u0027ve never played Yugioh before it\u0027s quite easy to pick up make a deck and have fun.\u003cbr\u003e",
