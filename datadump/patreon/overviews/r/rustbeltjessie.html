I currently write the ongoing zine series \u003cem\u003eReckless Chants\u003c/em\u003e, as well as producing several one-shot zines per year. Other recent publications include \u003cem\u003e10 Poems By\u003c/em\u003e (an e-chapbook published by Hello America), \u003cem\u003ekinda sorta valentines\u003c/em\u003e (a mini chapbook of short love poems), and \u003cem\u003eIt\u2019s Like The \u2018Watch The Throne\u2019 Of Tender Punk Poems\u003c/em\u003e (a split chapbook written by myself and Misha Bee Speck). I have been performing spoken word across the U.S. and Canada since 2001. I was the 2015-2017 Poet Laureate of Racine, Wisconsin. I\u2019m a two-time Pushcart Prize nominee for fiction, and a one-time Best of the Net nominee for poetry. My writing has garnered comparisons to Jack Kerouac, Ammi Emergency, Aaron Cometbus, Lydia Lunch, Patti Smith, Diane Di Prima, and Francesca Lia Block. I\u2019m the owner/editor of \u003ca href=\"http://www.boneandinkpress.com/\"\u003eBone \u0026amp; Ink Press\u003c/a\u003e, a small press with the aim of publishing limited-edition chapbooks of poetry, non-fiction, and experimental genres, written by marginalized writers. I run an occasional video series called \"Poetry, Prose, \u0026amp; Prompts with Jessie Lynn McMains.\" I also teach workshops on memoir, poetry, and zine-making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my goals with this Patreon is to enable myself to contribute to my family\u0027s finances (I have a partner and two children\u2014a six year old and a newborn) while also spending as much time as possible working on my creative projects and putting them out into the world. I have a lot of stories to tell, a lot of visions to share, about gender and sex and resistance, about mental illness and heartbreak and home, about adventure and identity and music. I have the compulsion to constantly create, and I want to be able to share what I create with as many people as possible--because they just might need it, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy other goal, as a small press owner and teacher of workshops, is to help other people tell their stories and make their art. I teach workshops on memoir writing, poetry writing, and zine-making/self-publishing. I am soon going to be creating online versions of these workshops. I would like to make enough money through Patreon that I can offer my in-depth courses on a sliding-scale basis, so as many people can take them as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently started a small press, Bone \u0026amp; Ink Press. Ultimately, Bone \u0026amp; Ink Press will publish limited-run chapbooks of poetry, creative non-fiction, and experimental forms, as well as themed compilation zines and chapbooks.\u00a0It will focus on sharing the work of marginalized writers--women, writers of color, LGBTQ+ writers, writers who are mentally ill or disabled, etc. I hope to make enough through Patreon to fund the running of this press and the publishing of the chapbooks--meaning, enough to be able to pay the writers, hire graphic designers/artists, and get the chapbooks professionally printed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to know more about who I am and the kinds of things I do, you can visit \u003ca href=\"http://recklesschants.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://rustbeltjessie.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e, or send me a message with any questions you might have.\u003cbr\u003e"

I am also a spoken word performer, musician, visual artist, small press owner, teacher of workshops, occasional DJ/podcaster, and former burlesque and sideshow performer. I am genderfluid/non-binary--I prefer they/them pronouns, but at this point am still okay with she/her pronouns as well.\u00a0My interests and passions include music, adventure, gardening and permaculture, home-brewing beer, tarot, witchcraft, mythology and folklore, dancing, diners, playing dress-up, my friends and family, and my five-year-old kidlet. I collect souvenir pennies and stick and poke tattoos. I am perpetually melancholy, restless, and nostalgic. I\u2019m in love with the undying spirit of punk rock, and I believe in the power of storytelling to both transform and heal.",

     "description": "It is no longer viable for me to print my zines the way I\u0027ve been printing them for the past 20+ years, as it is too expensive and time-consuming. I now need to have someone else print them for me. I\u0027ll be able to get a good deal, but only if I order at least 150 copies of each zine at a time. Which means the initial outlay will cost me more. If I hit $150 per month here on Patreon, I will put $100 of it in a fund specifically for my zines, and be able to start getting copies printed. The other plus side to this is, once I start having my zines printed in bulk this way, I will be able to slightly lower the price per copy.",

(More details to come.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThese are all massive undertakings. I need to do more research for the non-fiction book, which requires both time and money. I need the time to write and complete all of these books, and in the case of \u003cem\u003eTGWTMC\u003c/em\u003e, I need the money to pay an editor and the money to print it. And I need the time to look for an agent (or more than one). I really, really need an agent--I spend so much time I could spend writing looking for publication opportunities, and it drains me. I can\u0027t do it on my own anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that doesn\u0027t even include all the other stuff I do, like my \"Poetry, Prose, \u0026amp; Prompts\" web series, my biweekly TinyLetter, my zines, etc., etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I hit $1000 a month, here is my plan: I will designate $250 each month for Bone \u0026amp; Ink Press. The remaining $750 will help cover any expenses I incur while working on all of this stuff (including research, editing, etc.), or will go towards my family\u0027s finances. This will enable me to spend my time working on these projects, rather than having to hustle to find side gigs. It will also free up brain space that would otherwise go to worrying about how I\u0027m going to pay the energy bill or the rent. And some of the money will go toward childcare, so that I can have occasional uninterrupted writing time.\u003cbr\u003e",
