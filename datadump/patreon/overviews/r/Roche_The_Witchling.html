    "summary": "Hello, this is Tom\u00e9 Roch\u00e9. Obviously this is a handle, and many of you may know me by other handles, most of which are in some way related to squirrels. I enjoy writing and drawing in an anime-ish style and was hoping to turn that into a source of income for the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I am starting this I\u0027m fairly down on my luck, unemployed without much in the way of prospects. I say this not as a means of guilting others into donating, as hopefully that problem will end. Either with donations or finding a reliable job, but rather to let you know my situation. Without income, I can\u0027t really focus on creative works, as feeding myself and keeping a roof over my head is more important. But as I have to worry less about money the less I am distracted away from drawing or writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy best talent is, of course, my ability to draw. I do love it, though I would like to write more as well and welcome opportunities to do so. And with the help of this patreon, and all of you who donate, I could begin work on becoming better and hopefully make a career of one or both of these talents. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot everything on this patreon will require donations to access, though some definitely will. Things I create on my own can be one or the other, and commission pieces will be accessible only to patrons unless the requester specifies otherwise. But some things may simply just be blocked for a limited time, and will be freely posted after some time has passed. While I do wish for more donations, I am aware that not everyone can or would want to do so, at least not before seeing if my work is worth their hard earned money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who want to see more of my work that is open to anyone here is a link to my profile on Questionable Questing: https://forum.questionablequesting.com/members/master-of-squirrel-fu.5/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank all of those who want to support me, either by donating, or just by reading and enjoying my content. \u003cbr\u003e"
