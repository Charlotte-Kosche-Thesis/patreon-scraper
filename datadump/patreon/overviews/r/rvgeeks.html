    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHello and welcome! We\u0027re thrilled to have you here with us. We\u0027re Peter \u0026amp; John, better known as\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe RVgeeks\u003c/strong\u003e, hosts of one of YouTube\u0027s most popular channels about RVing. We specialize in How-To videos about RV maintenance, repairs, systems, upgrades and driving. Chances are you\u0027re here because you already know us... but just in case, we put together the video above as a brief introduction\u00a0to who we are, what we do, and why we\u0027re here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA\u00a0couple of \u201cDo-It-Ourselves\u201d techno-geeks, we\u0027ve been living on the road full-time since 2003. We started making How-To RV videos in 2011 to help friends learn how to manage their RV\u0027s systems when they bought their very first rig (which they did after we shared our love of RVing with them on an epic 10-day road trip). It was a complete accident that we ended up with over\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/rvgeeks\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e100,000 YouTube subscribers\u003c/a\u003e. We were literally just trying to help friends get off to a great start in their new RV (we probably felt a big responsibility, since they\u0027d bought it because of us)!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat theme of \"helping friends\" carries on to this day, as our\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/RVgeeks/videos\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elibrary of over 200 videos\u003c/a\u003e continues to grow, helping fellow RVers manage their rigs themselves. Whether it\u0027s learning the basics of operating RV systems, performing routine maintenance \u0026amp; minor repairs, becoming a better, safer driver, great destinations,\u00a0or installing useful mods \u0026amp; upgrades, we cover a little bit of everything.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe also created a website,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.thervgeeks.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTheRVgeeks.com\u003c/a\u003e, where we share our favorite RV resources and feature special discounts we\u0027ve arranged for our viewers on some of our very favorite RV gear.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile we\u2019re not RV technicians, we\u2019re pretty mechanically inclined and have learned a whole lot about RV systems over the years. We handle most of our own minor service, repair and upgrade work on our 2005 43\u2032 Newmar Mountain Aire diesel pusher. We also maintained our 2002 39\u2032 Fleetwood Bounder Diesel during our first 2 years on the road.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe hope our experiences can help other RVers go DIY, saving time \u0026amp; money while experiencing the satisfaction of a job well done.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe\u0027re Just Like Many Of You\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile some people assume we\u0027re retired and/or rich because we have a big rig, we\u0027re actually just like most other working-age people. We have a full-time job (running our website design business), and have a sizable mortgage on our only home, which just happens to have wheels.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreating videos that have such a positive impact is very rewarding, but our time for planning, scripting, shooting and editing them is somewhat limited, considering how seriously we take our obligation to our website customers. We do earn a modest amount from YouTube ads and \n\u003cem\u003eAmazon Affiliate\u003c/em\u003e sales, so we feel lucky and grateful that some of the costs that go into making videos, like tools, equipment, supplies, camera gear and editing software, are covered.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe receive lots of requests for additional content, including personalized training to help others learn to manage and operate more of their RV systems. But at this point, we simply can\u0027t afford to devote any more time to our videos and YouTube channel. We\u0027re fortunate that the website business is good, so we\u0027re not complaining! But it does keep us busy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve had many people express surprise that we take the time and effort to create (hopefully) well-produced videos on a wide range of RVing topics, but don\u0027t charge anything for them. We\u0027d like to be able to take more time off from our day job and create more content. Patreon provides a venue where content creators can receive support for their efforts, and based on the positive comments we\u0027ve received, it seems that there\u0027s a demand for RVing expertise... which we\u0027ve got!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides providing us with a platform for new types of content, and new opportunities for our viewers, Patreon also offers a great way to support the scripted videos we\u0027ve been publishing publicly on YouTube for years (which we will of course continue producing).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter that,\u00a0who knows where things might go? Special guest experts broadcasting with us to answer your questions live on the air? Live broadcasts of an actual repair or upgrade? More features that we haven\u0027t even thought of yet? We expect things to evolve here, and your ideas, input and feedback are welcome.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s good to note:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re not already on Patreon,\u003c/strong\u003e you\u0027ll need to sign up as part of joining us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledges are paid per\u003cem\u003e\u00a0Live Q\u0026amp;A Broadcast\u003c/em\u003e only,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0which we currently plan to do about once each month.\u00a0Everything else is included, along with our public scripted YouTube videos (which you are supporting here, too, thank you so much)!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can set a maximum monthly amount,\u003c/strong\u003e just in case we start doing more live Q\u0026amp;As, due to popular demand! ;-)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf we don\u0027t do a live Q\u0026amp;A in any particular month, you don\u0027t pay \u003cem\u003eanything!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven if you\u0027re not planning to attend our live Q\u0026amp;As\u003c/strong\u003e, or watch the archived broadcasts,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eyour support here on Patreon helps fund our regular videos!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re honored and humbled that you\u0027ve taken the time to read this far.
