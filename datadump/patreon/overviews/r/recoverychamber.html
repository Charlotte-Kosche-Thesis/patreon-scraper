    "summary": "My name is Joshua Taylor and thank you for joining me on Patreon. You are supporting my efforts to bring a new order of healthcare within reach of the public, through education and application of the ideas and research of many scientists and professionals I have learned from, not only in the health and medical sectors but in many fields of science. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support as my Patron, will give you a platform for easy access to my ideas and suggestions regarding critical issues and management strategies as well as a degree of input on the topics you would like to see added to the guide as it develops - your support helps you today - and the world tomorrow - as patron support allows me to spend more time doing what I do best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an accredited exercise physiologist, avid traveller and controversial biohacker. 2 years ago a trip to Europe revealed some interesting things to me which I didn\u0027t understand until after returning home. I now prefer to refer to myself as a human physiologist first, rather than my specialisation in exercise, rehabilitation and management of chronic disease. I have learned that the boxes health professionals stick to in our careers such as exercise, diet, mental health or medicine tend to limit our understanding of life and health, and your understanding never benefits from having a \u0027scope of practice\u0027. Science is continually altering and updating our view of health and the world, and our best scientific observations are only an approximation of reality at a particular point in time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
