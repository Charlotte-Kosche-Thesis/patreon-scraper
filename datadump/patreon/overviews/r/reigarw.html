We strongly believe in enhancing our viewers fascination \u0026amp; creativity through the unbelievable \u0026amp; extreme ideas from the mind-blowing perspective of our universe itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe in doing something no one in Youtube has done before, something unique, something exceptional! Yet doing something simple and similar to the appeal of a \"Top 10\" list for example, but showing new perspective, themes and scale rather than a practically copy paste recycling everywhere on the web. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe our viewers should have the pleasure of being free from the incessant \"This video is sponsored by...\" and we aim to maintain it that way for the respect of our viewers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe future of list creativity \u0026amp; comparisons is changing and YOU, as a viewer and supporter, can help to make a huge difference. Please consider supporting if you have faith in our channel going far rather than for the rewards. Your financial support will enable us to hire more researchers, graphic designers, 3d animators and professional narrators to enhance your video experience and pleasure! \u003cbr\u003e"
