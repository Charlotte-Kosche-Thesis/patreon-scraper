We run a 5th Edition Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons campaign in the \"West Marches\" style. With a dedicated and great community of players and volunteers, we\u0027ve created the Ruins of Wrath world. If you\u0027ve gotten here by some other method than being in the actual game, you\u0027re probably lost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we want to do is to create a grand adventure for our players. It\u0027s our hope that through them, new players and veterans alike can join in and experience a living, breathing world together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why the Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith your direct support, we can keep our services and games running longer to continue to provide great games for everyone to participate in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would the money be going to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile all our GMs and players volunteer, there are some costs associated with running the campaign. A lot of creative work and labor goes into the creation and maintenance of the games themselves (not to mention running them!), but there \u003cem\u003eare some real financial burdens\u003c/em\u003e. We need to upkeep our \u003cstrong\u003eRoll20 Pro subscription\u003c/strong\u003e in order to keep our API scripts and fancy features rolled out, and other \u003cstrong\u003ethird party tools\u003c/strong\u003e that need to be paid for are often used to compliment our campaign. As \u003cstrong\u003emore rulebooks\u003c/strong\u003e are released, we\u0027d like to continue collecting them and adding great new content as soon as it\u0027s available. The funds from this would help alleviate that burden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, THANK YOU. Your support means a lot to us, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful. You can help by contributing to the Patreon - even as little as a dollar a month can help us continue creating content that you enjoy and we love making. And you\u0027ll get a fancy Discord title and color ;).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you aren\u0027t up for supporting directly, thanks for participating in our adventures! It means a lot to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
