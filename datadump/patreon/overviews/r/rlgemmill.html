    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\u003cbr\u003eAre you sure you want to know the answer to that question?  I\u2019m not even sure I want to know.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWell, okay.  Let me\nexplain, but I think I\u2019d better start over.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHey! \u00a0 I\u2019m R. L. Gemmill,\nand I\u2019m a fiction writer, which means I write Iies for a living.  Please don\u2019t get me confused with a\npolitician\u2019s speechwriter; I write different lies.  I write lies about weird, scary,\nimpossibly-possible, exciting, mysterious things.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI write lies about monsters, demons, evil nasty human-types,\napocalyptic funzies, dystopian confusion, underground floating trains, and all\nkinds of nightmarish and nerve-racking events. \nThe lies I write come straight out of my imagination, but I like to\ncombine them with conspiratorial thinking to keep you guessing, keep you\nreading, and maybe even keep you up at night listening for the approaching\nfootsteps of an intruder in your home. \nPerhaps you should pause in your reading now and check to see what might be sneaking up behind you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHave you heard of \u003cem\u003eThe Demon Conspiracy\u003c/em\u003e? \u00a0I wrote that book.  It won an award that made me feel good, so I\nwrote another book.  The second book told\nmore of the story, and people liked it, which made me feel good all over again. The series is a long one, so\nI wrote three more books, and I\u2019m still not done.  Good news, though, there are only nine additional books to go, so I\u2019m practically on a downhill run.  Practically. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt the moment, I write one book at a time, and I usually finish\nout the day working on an outline for the next book series.  I\u2019ve got five more series to write, so that\u2019s\na lot of outlining.  But, you know, I\nfeel confident I could write \u003cem\u003etwo\u003c/em\u003e books at a time and still outline\nothers if I had a few ounces of an essential commodity in my life.  Yes, you guessed it.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI need TIME, about 17 ounces to be exact (feel free to double-check my math).  As you undoubtedly know, I can only gain that\nmuch extra time by collaborating with informed, intelligent people like\nyou.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSO, WHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAre you sure you want to know the answer to that question?  Just kidding, if you\u2019re still reading, you\nwant to know.  \u201cPatreon is a membership\nplatform that makes it easy for creators to get paid.\u201d  I stole that from Patreon, but it\u2019s\ntrue.  Typically, I only get paid when I\nlaunch a new book, which is about twice a year. \nDo I make millions because I write books?  LOLOLOLOLOL.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI don\u2019t make millions or even thousands.  Once, I made a few hundred when my high\nschool let me do a book-signing in the library. \nOnce.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve spent way more money on professional editing, book cover art, and marketing courses than I\u2019ve\nmade from sales.  Do I hope to make a lot\nof money from my books someday?  Of\ncourse, I do.  It\u2019s every writer\u2019s dream\nto live comfortably off his/her work, but doing that takes a great deal of\ntime for marketing, and I\u2019m not a marketer; I\u2019m a writer.  I write. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause the big publishing houses do little more than screw over\nwriters with their 10%-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e90% deals (guess who gets 10), I decided to go the small\npress/indie author route.  I keep control\nof all my rights (film, foreign language, audio, etc.) and have the last word\nin how my books read.  But it also means\nI have to find ways to sell my own stories, a.k.a. market them.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHonestly, these books are my Harry Potter series but made for television.  They will eventually make money, though not\nunless they\u2019re published, and that takes (\u003cstrong\u003eTIME FOR A\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ePOP QUIZ!\u003c/strong\u003e)  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nA. Trees \u00a0 \u00a0 B. Dogs. \u00a0 \u00a0 C. Cats \u00a0 \u00a0 D. Money\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWait!  Hold it!  You thought this was all about a few ounces\nof time?  Now I\u2019m talking money?  As Benjamin Franklin might have said\n(skeptics disagree), \u201cTime is money.\u201d  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI need additional money so I can buy the extra time (reminder: \u00a017 ounces) to be able to:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. Write two books simultaneously.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2. Build another book series with outlines.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n3. Afford to have the books professionally edited. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n4. Pay for professional cover art. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n5. Market them (I know how to sell books now, but guess\nwhat?  It \u003cstrong\u003etakes\u003c/strong\u003e\ntime AND \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecosts\u003c/strong\u003e money\u003c/strong\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe best way for a writer to buy time these days is by\ncollaborating with readers and patrons. \nYou get something from me, and I get something from you.  I\u2019m proposing a trade of values.  If I can pay to have some of the tedious,\ntime-gobbling marketing chores done for me, it will open up no less than 10-15\nhours per week.  PER WEEK!  OMG! \nThe possibilities are astounding! \nMy new book production could almost double. \nInstead of finishing the first series in 4+ years, I could do it in\n2.756631 years, allowing for random moments of rest and recovery.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen you become my patron, I might not have to take that job as a\nWalmart Greeter and work on weekends, thereby losing even more time. \nBut you\u2019re probably wondering, if you DO become my patron, what\u2019s in it\nfor YOU?  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMwa-ha-ha-ha-ha.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLies, lies, and more lies! \nI mean, fiction, fiction, and more fiction!  I\u2019ll send you eCopies of what I write far\nahead of any launch dates, and I may also give you a cool digital monster\npicture painted by a professional artist.  I have other surprises too, such as asking\nfor your expertise about how a chapter reads or if a name fits a particular\ncharacter.  I could even request your\nopinion about an upcoming plotline, which would be like looking into the future\nof the series.  You could be a fake time\ntraveler.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy supporting this Patreon (me), you\u2019ll help me buy those 17 ounces\nof time and thereby allow me to write more stuff faster and better.  Guess whose name will be mentioned in my\nbooks in honor of his/her patronage?  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo, you have to guess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I rough-draft 300-pages in about a month,\nbarring interruptions from L-I-F-E. \nImagine me producing twice that many pages!  I\u2019m giddy just thinking about it.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow\u2019s it sound? Wanna be my\npatron and partner in fiction writing? \nYou\u2019ll help me buy a few ounces of time, and I\u2019ll give you volumes that\nyou\u2019ll finish reading too fast and then shout, \u201cI must know who dies in Book\n9!  Where\u2019s Book 9!\u201d \u00a0Hey, I\u2019m a sure bet.  I write nearly every day, I\u2019ve already\npublished four books, and I never get writers block.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI thank you in advance for your patronage and support.  Giving even $1 to a total stranger just\nbecause you like what he creates is a heart-rending act.  I get a little mushy just thinking about\nit.  Seriously, the older men get, the\nmore in touch we become with our emotions whether we want to or not.  I\u2019m beyond 60, and stories about generosity\noverwhelm me.  Imagine how I\u2019ll react\nwhen your generosity is aimed at me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
