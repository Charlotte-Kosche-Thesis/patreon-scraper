    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eMy Story:\u003c/h3\u003eHello and welcome to the official RAD Rendering Patreon page! I created this as a way for you to directly support the production of all the content you desire with the highest production quality possible! I am mostly a 1 man team with a few friends helping me out here and there. As great as my current content creation is, all my videos need improvement. I want to continue to improve the content creation by hiring more artists, creating better sets, gaining access to better camera lenses, and most importantly being able to focus on one project for extended periods of time without having the lights turn off. There are countless other aspects that the support goes toward. The bottom line, all of this money goes back into the business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRAD Rendering is an incredibly small company made up of one hopefull content creator who can\u0027t help his passion for storytelling. I aspire to give you the highest quality in video game entertainment, as well as creating sweet merch at radrendering.com!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not expect or assume that you will contribute anything more than simply watching my videos, but if you feel passionately enough about my content you can contribute here! I am already more than grateful to everyone who watches my videos and buys the merchandise. I cannot thank you enough for all the support and care you all have shown me over the years. However, by contributing, it allows me to create better content to make your days a little better. At the end of the day, all I care about is trying to make everyone\u2019s day a little better through the videos. My goal is to entertain others to help them get through their tough times in life through my content creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eThe Content\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRAD Rendering is my entire business that encompasses the YouTube channels and merchandise you are familiar with. By supporting our Patreon you will gain access to any of the exclusive content, communities, or early access content posted here. That does not mean any videos are withheld from the main channels. Instead, I add more behind the scenes information here for those who are curious. The video content comes from the channel RADAUSTIN27.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe posters and merchandise will be supported by this campaign allowing me to reward donors with merch! I tried to kept the tiers relatively low because I want you to be able to save up for those big ticket items in your own life. Eventually, I hope to find a proper subscription model on my website, but that is still in the far-off future. Bottom Line your donations allow me to continue to post videos for your entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor further clarification on tiers:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou automatically receive a role in my discord server using the discord app. To link you Patreon account to your discord check out the article\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266\"\u003e here\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo Topics will be submitted on a post I make toward the beginning of the month. Here anyone with a burning question or desire for exploration can comment their idea. I will look through all of them to pick the video I think has the most potential for interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe open lobby preference is explained in detail multiple times a month in two posts that inform you when the open lobby is happening. If you show up during the lobby you will get in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMerch is sent out multiple times a year to all patreons at the Ultimis tier.
