It\u0027s thanks to solvers like you that I\u0027m able to keep my blog going, and for that, I\u0027m eternally grateful. I\u0027ve even gotten published in GAMES Magazine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, puzzle-making is not a job that pays often, especially for a freelancer like me. (As an example, my first two sets of puzzles accepted by GAMES were published over a year apart) So if you decide to become a patron, you are pledging to donate a monthly fee (however big or small you want) to help support the creation of my puzzles,\u00a0and in return, I\u0027ll give you rewards and bonuses as thanks for helping me out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, you probably want to see what kind of puzzles I make, don\u0027t you?
