    "summary": "Internet is full of people who share their creations worldwide. A lot of them makes a living from their videos, music and art and even become rich doing it. \u003cbr\u003eI am a guy from Montmel\u00f3 who lives for the music. I love it since i was a child, i learned to play some instruments like piano, guitar or violin, but i didn\u0027t like none of them too much. The only thing i always loved is to create my own melodies, my own music, because i always been pretty choosy with the music i listen. \u003cbr\u003eBy the way, life is a bitch. I always have been poor, so i never could and even nowadays i can\u0027t afford decent gear. I make all my music literally from nowhere, using virtual instruments and making them sound as real as i can. Sometimes it\u0027s enough, but sometimes not. It limits my creativity, what i can write and what not, and i wanna change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making music for 3 years now. I never had much views on youtube, and marketing is not something i\u0027m not capable of doing (i\u0027m very shy) so i got like 100 bucks for all those years. I never had the intention to make money from my music, i just started to share it because it\u0027s a need i have inside, but music production needs an investment to do the things right at a certain point, and that\u0027s why i\u0027m asking you to help me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t promise that i will always make a song per week, i can\u0027t even promise that i will make all the requests from my patreons. But i can promise one thing: i\u0027ll always keep making music. It\u0027s my life.\u003cbr\u003e"
