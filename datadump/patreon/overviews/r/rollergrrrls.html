To do this book\njustice and to create a series that delivers an honest portrayal of roller derby [representing strong female story-driven characters that also supports the community\nwe love and importantly allows the art work to maintain the high quality and\nstandards] we realised we needed to do this ourselves and commit near\nfull-time. The drawing and colouring of the production is the most intensive\npart of the process: Gary\u0027s detailed derby artwork includes individual character design\nand visual story-telling is time intensive and Yel Zamor\u0027s amazing\ncolour is deserving of her top rate. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Why not ask a publisher to print ROLLER GRRRLS instead or include\nadverts?\" Basically publishers expect/demand editorial input and sometimes\neven creative control of the book and the same considerations need to be\nconsidered when choosing the right advertisers. We feel ROLLER GRRRLS needs to\nbe as independent as our characters. The stories we want to tell, often\ncontroversial and challenging, have to be free of any commercial influence and\ncorporate ties. We also know what the derby community expect from us. This book\ndeserves to be independent... and with your support it can be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://33.media.tumblr.com/b1676cebb4f2b247a240067abf2d768b/tumblr_na97l0OtgB1r5hqv4o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAny support will be gratefully\nappreciated. There are various options offered for how involved you wish to be\nand you can change your donation at any time. We aim to create a conversation\nwith our patrons, and build a community in much the same way as roller derby\nis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe will have blog posts every week for pledges over $5 with updates on the series, new\ncharacter profiles, sketches and various Behind The Scenes and WIP\npage previews you can see before anyone else, including some Patreon\nexclusives. The blogs will be informative and fun to\nread and the sneak peaks exciting! There will be the capacity to interact with\nthe creators and ask us questions about our story and character choices. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere will be additional rewards of\nportrait commissions, digital sketchbooks and opportunities to win original\nartwork in our monthly draw for patrons pledging over $5! Further\noptions will include the opportunity to create your own personal character\ntrailer or choose to appear in the crowd scenes of\nthe next issue.  We hope that you will enjoy\nthese opportunities to be more involved with the ROLLER GRRRLS series.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGary\u0027s drawing\nspeed is limited to a normal 12 hour day. No more working for days on end with\nonly coffee as fuel! A quarterly schedule for ROLLER GRRRLS is absolutely\npossible within these limits should we reach our budget. We have BIG plans for the series and hope to be\nable to reach a goal to allow us to franchise the book out: we want to see\nother trusted writers and artists work with the book and create their own\nstories specific to their area. Imagine ROLLER GRRRLS BRAZILIA, ROLLER GRRRLS USA, ROLLER GRRRLS OZ or ROLLER GRRRLS ASIA? We would love to write EVERYTHING but there are\njust not enough hours in the day to do it properly... but with other similarly\npassionate and professionally creative derby fans we feel that ROLLER GRRRLS\ncould be read and loved EVERYWHERE and be more true to our readerships.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your support.

     "about": "ROLLER GRRRLS is created by Anna Malady [the collective derby name for Mhairi Stewart and Gary Erskine] They both share a mutual love of roller derby and have already designed bout posters, team logos and promotional pieces along with various other concepts for the derby community and ROLLER GRRRLS also sponsor their local team: Glasgow Roller Derby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGary is an industry veteran and has worked for MARVEL, DC Comics, Vertigo, Dark Horse Comics, IMAGE, IDW and provided motion comic work for Madefire, collaborating with writers Warren Ellis, Mark Millar, Garth Ennis, Grant Morrison, Brian Wood, Alex De Campi and James Robinson. He has contributed to characters and books including Captain America, Judge Dredd, The Avengers, WARHEADS and the Grindhouse series, and worked on the Doctor Who, Star Wars, Star Trek, The Terminator and Transformers licences. He also hosts the Design Your Own... workshops for schools and libraries, is a mentor to film students at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and provides storyboards and concept /character work for the games industry [including Spider-Man and Pirates of the Caribbean] His most recent sport related work\u00a0 was with Team GB British Cycling creating illustrated versions of Sir Bradley Wiggins and other top cyclists!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project is more of a departure for Mhairi whose work has been in the field of Narrative Non-fiction, biography and blogging, particularly in the field of science communication. Her work has included science comics for a general readership. She is also the writer of Deanna [to be published soon]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Anna Malady, they have come together to produce an independently published book featuring strong, positive and diverse female characters, qualities they both believe are not represented, or worse, misrepresented in mainstream comics. The ROLLER GRRRLS sketchbook released in 2012 was an instant success with a second sketchbook now available through Shopify. The [quarterly] series is due to be released.\u003cbr\u003e",
