    "summary": "Hey, my name is Robin. I am 23 years old and I live in The Netherlands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this time I\u2019ve been on YouTube for over 5 years already. I was 17 at\nthe time I started. It all began with doing the\nUncharted 3 Top 10 Plays and by now it has become so much more, it really is a\nthing I put many many hours into every day. I\u2019ve made\naround 1000 videos already, can you believe it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I know I\u0027m not your typical\nlet\u0027s play guy or crazy personality in front of the camera and therefore I\u0027ll\ndefinitely never gain a real substantial number of viewers that will go in the\nhundreds of thousands. I\u0027m just me, I\u0027m a foreign guy with an accent and an opinion\nabout games that I love sharing with you all, but that said I\u0027m still really\nhappy that there are people like you, the more core gamers that are willing to\nlisten and appreciate everything I share with you. The channel is now over 100,000 subscribers strong, and so many people like you watch my videos which is something that is still mind blowing to me. For that I can\u0027t thank you\nenough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to talk with you about the future. In 2017, I graduated from university and got my Software Engineering diploma. \u00a0After that I had two\nchoices. The most logical would\u0027ve been to use my degree, get a job in programming\nthat is very safe, pays well, but requires a lot of time. That would mean I\nwould barely have to put into videos and you\u2019d slowly start seeing my channel\nfade more and more into the background. I will be completely honest with you: That is not what I want my future to be. I want to chase my dreams. I started\nrealizing more and more how much I love doing what I do now on YouTube and\nwhat the possibilities are. I want to try and see where I can get with what I\nhave been doing now for so long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course you probably all know that YouTubers\nmake a little bit of money that comes from advertisements on videos.\u00a0The\nreality is that this system is just not viable anymore whatsoever.\nAdvertisements barely make money nowadays, and on top of that 70% of viewers use ad block (don\u0027t worry, I don\u0027t blame you because I do too. Ads are just annoying). What it comes\ndown to is that you literally need millions and millions of views every month\nto make a decent amount of money. And what if YouTube decides to randomly take\ndown your channel for copyright issues that you were never warned about or any other random thing happens that means you don\u0027t have control over the situation anymore at all? You can see there a lots of\nrisks involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why you see more and more creators asking their\ncommunity for help and that\u2019s where you come in. For those of you who dont know what this is, Patreon is a site\nwhere you can support creators like me with a certain donation per month that\nyou get to completely decide for yourself, while having full control so you can also stop it at any\ngiven time. In return for that you get certain cool rewards that are displayed\non the site. Really though, it is most of all simply meant for support. If you\nenjoy my videos and you want me to keep improving with better quality audio,\nvideo, more games to review, more frequent high quality content and all that type of stuff, this is the way to help me out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether it\u0027s 1, 2, 5, 10 or 25 dollars, any donation is much appreciated. Your support will make it possible for me to spent my time working on YouTube videos, instead of working at an office doing something I don\u0027t nearly feel as passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt has been over 5 years now and I\u0027m still having just\nas much fun. It\u0027s great to havea job that still feels like a hobby, to have a small but dedicated\nfollowing like you all and I\u0027m hoping for many more years to come. If you decide to pledge any amount on this Patreon page, realize you are one of the people that is making this all possible. Thank you for that, it truly means a lot to me.\u003cbr\u003e"
