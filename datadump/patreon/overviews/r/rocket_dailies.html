    "summary": "Hey guys. My name is Alec Simone, and until now I\u0027ve never really told you my story. I think it\u0027s about time I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last few years I\u0027ve been working in web and social media marketing/development/bullshit, and The Rocket Dailies started as a passive income scheme I cooked up. I figured I\u0027d throw some ads on a page, then every day I\u0027d just post a few Rocket League plays and let people vote on them so they\u0027d have a reason to keep coming back to the actual site. Seemed like a fun way to make a few extra bucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it didn\u0027t take long for you guys to suck me in much, much\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/67928683.jpg\"\u003edeeper\u003c/a\u003e than that. Everyone knows the Rocket League community is one of the friendliest, cheeriest groups on the planet (not counting that guy you just trashed in 1v1 whose insults were much less creative than his spelling), but what blew me away is the incredible dedication, work ethic, and love for the game bubbling out of hundreds upon hundreds of people. All the casters practicing their craft in hushed tones so their roommates wouldn\u0027t think they were crazy, the players getting up early to knock shot after shot into a practice net like some kind of rocket-fueled Kobe Bryant, the tournament organizers herding all those cats into formation to create exhilarating, beautiful shows, and the adoring fans who gobble it all up like that one uncle\u0027s Pumpkin Pie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou cannot hang around these people very long without being inspired. Without wanting to push yourself to be the absolute best version of yourself you possibly can be. Without seeing a weird new way to live that tugs at little nooks in your gut you didn\u0027t even know about and puts a filter over the world to make everything so much more fun and fulfilling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all love this game, but more than that I think we all love what it allows us to be, and I know I\u0027m not alone when I say this game and this community gave me new life in a way I very much needed, and I will never, ever be able to pay all of you back for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next few weeks (let\u0027s be honest, probably more than that) I\u0027ll be putting out a series of videos that will be more marketing-savvy and will tell you why you should contribute to our prize pool and lay out some of my dreams for what we can all do together. But for right now, I just wanted to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for being one of the greatest groups of people I\u0027ve ever been privileged to be a member of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and if you wanted to donate a few bucks to the daily prize pool, I know a lot of people who\u0027d really appreciate it :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s to dreams. Yours, mine, and everyone\u0027s. May we all chase the shit out of them together. Cheers.\u003cbr\u003eMrPres\u003cbr\u003e"
