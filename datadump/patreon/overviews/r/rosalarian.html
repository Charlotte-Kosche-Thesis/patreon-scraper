I\u0027ve been creating webcomics for over a decade, as well as contributing to a lot of print anthologies.\u00a0I tend to focus on \u003cstrong\u003efemale\u003c/strong\u003e characters, with lots of \u003cstrong\u003equeer\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ebody-positive\u003c/strong\u003e content, as well as \u003cstrong\u003esex positive\u003c/strong\u003e. I like genre fiction and adventures, and strive to avoid some of the cliches that are overused in a lot of queer media. I want to actively court readers who aren\u0027t normally represented in comics. Many of my comics are completed stories, while others are ongoing, so there\u0027s lot of archives to binge and new content to look forward to. My latest comic, \u003cstrong\u003eSpectacle\u003c/strong\u003e, is being published by Oni Press and starts in October.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rosalarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sfwprev.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of my work is \u003cstrong\u003esmutty, filthy, dirty erotica\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve been contributing to Filthy Figments since it first started, as well as being published by Smut Peddler, Slipshine, l\u0027Immanquable, and others. My first smutty comic, \u003cstrong\u003eDarlin\u0027 It\u0027s Betta Down Where It\u0027s Wetta\u003c/strong\u003e, is now being serialized on this patreon and updates every Wednesday. I also post a couple pages of \u003cstrong\u003eComic Stripper\u003c/strong\u003e every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rosalarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nsfwpreview.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in addition to the warm fuzzy feeling you get from backing this patreon, you\u2019ll also get access to sketches of works in progress, bonus illustrations, bonus comics, desktop wallpapers, discounts on merch, and behind the scenes breakdowns of what it\u2019s like working in indie comics. Come see how the sausage gets made! I promise it\u2019s better than real sausage. Oh! And whenever I do a kickstarter, you all get notified about it a full 24 hours before anyone else so you can snatch up all the earlybird deals. I couldn\u0027t do it without you!

Lots of watercolor textures and such.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDesktop and mobile wallpapers\u003c/strong\u003e every month, with a little calendar on the desktop version. I\u2019m painting these on paper with watercolors, and each original will be available to purchase each month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSmutty doodles\u003c/strong\u003e for the pornoisseur.
