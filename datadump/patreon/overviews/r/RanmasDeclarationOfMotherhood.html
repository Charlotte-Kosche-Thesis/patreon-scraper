    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eRanma\u0027s Declaration Of Motherhood\u003c/em\u003e is a series of \u003cem\u003eRanma 1/2\u003c/em\u003e fan animations made by fans for fans and explores the No. 1 fan question: What would happen to Ranma Saotome if he got pregnant in his female form? This series has been in production for far longer than anticipated (nearly ten years!). Production is continuing, but the main reason why it has taken so long is limited funding. The artists are paid on a frame by frame basis, and I have already spent untold thousands of dollars. Paying for all these is three times as bad when you also need to pay for university, living expenses and equipment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to fund this project. With our combined resources, we should hopefully be able to finally get this fan series out in a matter of months. The more money you pledge, the closer we are to completion. Of course, I wouldn\u0027t ask of you to donate money without offering you something in return. The rewards are all listed i the side bar, the greater the pledge the greater the rewards. And perhaps the reward you all came here to see is RDOM itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately we aim to complete the first episode and post it here on Patreon for those who pledge at least $50 per month to see it. When episode 2 is completed, we will post that here too. And so on and so on until the series is completed and the series can be released on DVD and Blu-ray, the proceeds of which will go towards future animation projects. Until such time as it is released, we\u0027ll be sure to keep you entertained with animation tests, access to animation frames, and episodes of a few side projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe side projects include \u003cem\u003eRanma 1/2: The Unseen Stories\u003c/em\u003e, a series of manga dubs of untelevised manga chapters, brought to you in part by Tim Darby; and exclusive advance screenings for \u003cem\u003eGaming 1/2\u003c/em\u003e, the new collaborate efforts of Djclyve and myself to bring you new \u003cem\u003eRanma 1/2 Character Profiles\u003c/em\u003e chronicling characters exclusive to Ranma 1/2 video games.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "The Character artists are paid on a frame by frame basis of about $10 per base image, with alternate Photoshop layers for limb movement and facial animations thrown in. Action shots of characters running or jumping of course would require completely new base images to be drawn. A ten frame animation sequence would be $100. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA typical episode of the \u003cem\u003eRanma 1/2\u003c/em\u003e anime lasts about 22minutes, with full body animation sequences typically being around 3 frames or 8 frames or 15 frames. Using the first Ranma OAV as an example, I counted about 250 unique character animation frames in the first three minutes of the episode alone. With a rate of 250frames per 3min, that gives us about 1,834 frames per episode. At $10 per frame, this would be over $18,340 per episode. Of course, the more complex action sequences and fight scenes would add to an overall cost. To be conservative, I estimate $25,000 per episode. RDOM has little over TWENTY episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a monthly fund raise of about $25,000 per month, I could commission an entire episode every month until completion. If as little as 1,000 of you donated $25 each month, we\u0027ll be guaranteed to be set for completion. \u003cbr\u003e",
