But for my \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Subscribers\u003c/strong\u003e, I create \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive videos just for you\u003c/strong\u003e, that show a more personal look at my life and what travel is really like.\u00a0 For example, when I almost got deported from Thailand...yeah, that\u0027s just for my insiders...Or how I celebrated my birthday...I always find cool and interesting things that I only want to share with my Patreon team.
