    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://www.richardlevangie.com/patreon/welcome.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome, welcome!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you like some cheese perhaps? Maybe I should open a bottle of the Old Wynwards 1256; A very fine year! I still have a few bottles laid down by my father...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Richard Levangie, a struggling writer living in Halifax, Nova Scotia \u2014 on the edge of North America. That will mean something to a few of you, but for the rest, Nova Scotia is a rugged, romantic place that Vikings visited five centuries before Columbus. And I\u0027m thrilled that you\u0027re reading about me. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI really mean that. Thank you.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that I have stories to tell.\u00a0I\u0027m well-trained to be a writer, with degrees in science, journalism, an MFA in creative nonfiction, and thousands of bylines. But, circumstances being what they are, my heart belongs to fiction now, with the first book in a series called \u003cem\u003eKingdom of the Tiger.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have delved into fiction before. My novel, \u003cem\u003eSecrets of the Hotel Maisonneuve\u003c/em\u003e, is a middle grade mystery that won the Atlantic Writing Award for unpublished novels, and made it before the editorial boards of four Canadian publishers, ultimately just falling short.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I decided to put my extensive training in nonfiction to write a memoir.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.richardlevangie.com/patreon/finding-patreon.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe opening chapter of \u003cem\u003eRedemption is a Bottle of Red\u003c/em\u003e tells the story of a 32-year-old journalist who develops daily migraines and chronic fatigue. He runs from specialist to specialist, but not a single doctor can offer anything that will help. He gets fired from the newsroom, becomes a full-time caregiver for his disabled mother to keep a roof over his head, and tries to cobble together enough hope to keep going, eventually throwing back narcotics like breath mints. At one point, he even tries oxycontin to control the unrelenting pain,\u00a0and later endures a 6-month nightmare\u00a0getting it out of his system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd he writes nothing of consequence for 20 years.\u00a0He loses friends and hope, He tries to make a new start in a new town, but it goes nowhere.\u00a0He sinks deeper and deeper into debt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiterally near the end of his days, he finds a new doctor to review his medical history. He orders tests, and a new MRI, and determines that our boy actually has an extremely rare neuroendocrine tumor that\u0027s been ruining what should have been the best years of his life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe undergoes an experimental treatment, but the tumor has grown dramatically when the trial finishes. He undergoes five and a half hours of neurosurgery to save his eyesight and his life, but suffers complications that mean his life will be complicated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, he finds a job at a call centre and tries to write his way out it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, that feels really, really pretentious. Basically, I had intended to write a memoir about overcoming an illness and fighting my way back to health. But, several years in to my \"recovery\", that happy ending seems less and less likely. I\u0027m a former black belt karate instructor who can no longer train. A wine writer and restaurant reviewer who can no longer smell or taste. A journalist with two-decade gap in his resume, who can\u0027t find work as a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the memoir I was writing is grim, despite my efforts to lift it. A \"misery book,\" said one literary agent. Which, you have to admit, would be hard to market. Not to mention that in trying to write it, I was throwing myself into a very dark world, and breaking my own heart all over again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo one night on the way to my post-MFA writing group, I decided to read something more entertaining instead. I brought the first chapter of a novel called \u003cem\u003eKingdom of the Tiger\u003c/em\u003e that I had started and abandoned in 2008 after one chapter. It\u0027s a rousing, heroic adventure that I hope will capture both teens and adults, and will twist the genre in ways that might surprise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writer\u0027s group loved that first chapter, and begged for a chapter two.\u00a0So I wrote it, and kept writing for another 30,000 words. One quarter of the way to a strong first draft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter everything I\u2019ve endured, I finally feel like I am where I am supposed to be. I believe that I was meant to write this book. When I write, I feel like my days are rich, and thrice-blessed by adversity. I understand where I could be, and the chance that I\u0027ve been given.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am here, asking for help. I have much to do, and miles to go before I sleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.richardlevangie.com/patreon/generosity.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to put too fine a point on it, I\u0027ll be using this money to live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will pay the mortgage and the water bill. It will keep the electricity on and the internet humming. Maybe it will buy fresh berries in summer, and a few bottles of winter cider at Christmas. And It will fill in all the little budgetary shortfalls that come with living close to the poverty line: the car repairs, the vet bill, the new raincoat, the prescription not covered by my drug plan. These unexpected expenses usually feel like small catastrophes, and your generosity will help keep the worry at bay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, should patronage be forthcoming, I would use the money to write and to live. To pay down credit card debts and my student loan. I will worry less, and write more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m fortunate to make enough money to start paying debts, I will first cut back on freelancing, and then I will cut back hours at my full-time job and devote more time to bringing my inclusive fantasy to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the adventure. Thank you so much for reading.\u003cbr\u003e"
