Sadly, right now, most of these mods are down because my MEGA account died a while ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to mod games, namely sometimes making outfits, editing them, etc. Somewhere in between, I discovered I also like to mod 3D eroges a lot, which is why I\u0027ve been exclusively modding HoneySelect as of lately. I\u0027ve also made mods for Artificial Girl 3 (very old ones), PlayClub and Sexy Beach Premium Resort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the reasons I like sharing my mods is because I like making people who like the same things I do, happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to base myself in adult manga, my favorite adult manga artists are \u003cstrong\u003eShindoL (he has a Patreon, go check it out!)\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eTakeda Hiromitsu\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eMizuryu Kei\u003c/strong\u003e, and recently \u003cstrong\u003ePija \u003c/strong\u003etoo (yes, I know what that means in spanish). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also thinking on doing my own game as a side project. Progress is very slow at the moment since I don\u0027t have much time, but at least I\u0027m learning to build a character from scratch and it\u0027s going well. I\u0027ll post progress of this side project here as well whenever I have some.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support keeps me going, since I spend all my free time doing this. Your support also allows me to have my own hosting for both my site and the mod files, which is way better than using free, public file servers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my site \u003ca href=\"https://roy12mods.com\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. There you can find downloads for all of my mods. \u003cbr\u003eAlso, in case the site goes down because no hosting is perfect (sadly), I made a backup \u003ca href=\"https://r12backup.000webhostapp.com/light_template.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. It gets updated weekly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will publish every new mod in Patreon and it will be Patrons only for 5 days. After these 5 days have passed, it\u0027ll become public automatically (might take me a day to publish it in the site, but you can get it from here in the meantime).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also recently created a discord channel, you can get in through \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/dY4aSQT\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE DO NOT REPOST OR REUPLOAD MY MODS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION, I WILL EVENTUALLY FIND OUT.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get if I pledge?

So it\u0027s much better to start your pledge on a 1st.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
