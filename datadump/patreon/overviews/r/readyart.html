For starters there will only be ONE slot of this open per\nmonth. This is to test the waters and see how it goes. I get asked about this a lot and finally added it. This\nis me drawing YOU custom character art. Right now the idea is you sign up, we\ntalk, agree on the subject and I draw something YOU want. Some details:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis tier is intended for someone already familiar with\nmy work and interested in a custom, one off piece of mine.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis is a high res character piece, minimum size is 4000\npixel by 3500 pixel image.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFormat is (generally) one character with black and white\ninked art.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinal subject matter will have to be agreed on but you\nonly need to look at my current art to see where my specialties and interests\nare. If you haven\u2019t already seen me draw it or something like it then make sure\nwe talk before expecting anything.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis art is yours to do with as you please. It will not\nbe shared or discussed by me unless you want me to. Basically \u2013 this is a\nprivate drawing for you to do with as you like.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMessage me here directly if you have questions about\nsubscribing to this tier.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eQuestions answered for you - PLEASE READ!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill this Patreon affect the art available at the free site?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe free site will remain free and receive new art on a regular basis. That\u0027s not changing! Patreons receive art early and in a much higher resolution. In other words, you pledge and you get the high res versions of upcoming pages a week (or more early). The free galleries on the main site only get lo-res version of my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you take suggestions on content?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeck yah! any and all Patreons are encouraged to drop me a line here or directly!"
