    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ere:TYE is a music group consisting of music producers, lyricists and vocalists who all have one thing in common; we have a passion for anime, JRPG video-games and other related Japanese musical projects. As many fans of Japanese-based media are unable to understand or speak the native Japanese language, we specialize in adapting songs originally released in Japanese into full-length English covers that both Eastern and Western fans can enjoy! \u00a0What we do is we take a direct translation of a song and adapt it so that it sounds grammatically correct for native English speakers with smooth phrasing and rhyming schemes (we also try to retain as much of the original translation as possible).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a cool fan-based platform that allows content creators to connect with fans to deliver all sorts of exciting content in return for their support in producing new works! \u00a0Fans can follow their favorite content creators (like us!) and become their supporting patrons. \u00a0Whenever we have a new release ready to go, we\u0027ll receive a small donation from each supporting patron at a monetary value you set. \u00a0You\u0027re free to suspend or cancel your support at any time and\u00a0you can even set a maximum value Patreon can bill you per month, just in case we\u0027re a little too active and excited with our releases.\u00a0In return for the generous donation, all of our patrons gain access to our patron-only feed that has all sorts of fun goodies we\u0027d like to share with you all! \u00a0Sounds interesting so far? Check out our exclusive patron rewards below for more details! (feel free to send us any ideas for future rewards too!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order for us to get our songs in digital stores or streaming platforms like Spotify legally (all your comments on TYER were definitely heard), all of our works feature custom instrumentation and are released digitally under specific license agreements. \u00a0This allows all of re:TYE\u0027s covers to be released free of copyright violations; no more blocked Youtube videos or muted audio! \u00a0Unfortunately this also comes with high production costs for each song which reduces the amount of songs we can work on. \u00a0By becoming our patron and supporting us, you\u0027ll allow us to work on more songs then we could normally fund ourselves in even higher quality! \u00a0Your donations will go directly into the production of upcoming songs such as hiring and collaborating with musicians and music producers, securing licenses, working with digital artists and more! \u00a0On our own we could fund about one or two covers at a time but by banding together we could do so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we are planning on releasing new songs and covers of current anime and video-game series, we\u0027d also love to go back and either complete full song covers or re-release past TYER songs again through re:TYE! TYER had hundreds of videos and it\u0027s probably impossible to re-release all of them, but through your Patreon support we\u0027re slowly reworking and hopefully re-releasing more soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out our patreon page and supporting us, we can\u0027t thank you enough!"
