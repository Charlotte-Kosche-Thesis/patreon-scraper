It takes lots of time and expense to produce new music with little or no economic incentive since people increasingly expect music to be available for free. This enables the artist to invest more time and resources in the creative side of music activity rather than always having to spend time on more immediate income-producing music activities (teaching, recording work-for-hire, etc.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cem\u003eOK\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0that\u0027s it.

However, you all need to promise not to complain about this being too long! I know all about the importance of keeping online descriptions short and hereby confess I am intentionally breaking the unwritten rule! \u00a0Ha! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut honestly,\u00a0it\u0027s not really that long and actually a pretty interesting glimpse into a dilemma most independent artists face. So if you\u0027ve got a couple minutes - read on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll Dressed Up But Unable To Go\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have thought long and hard about how to present this, but the bottom line is this:  I am compelled to create and produce. It is my life long vision and calling. But I also must make a living. It is my lifelong responsibility. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese dichotomous ideas have been behind the phrase \"starving artist\" (which I refuse to accept for myself) for a long long time. This is really nothing new at all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been one of the fortunate few who has been able to make a decent living for most of my adult life using my artistic and creative talents in music, teaching, recording, and video - but after decades I\u0027m still not creating much new music on an ongoing, regular basis. I\u0027m still not doing the core of what I\u0027ve always known I must do. That is primarily because it takes time and money to prepare these projects. It takes lots of time and money spent investing up front without seeing a financial return on that investment for a long time, if ever. So I am busy using my talent for things that will bring in immediate income. And I have been happy and successful with my many musical activities such as teaching, paid recording work for others\u0027 projects, etc. (learn about my various work-for-hire music activities on my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ronferlitomusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e). But although I have the equipment, the know-how, the experience, the networking with other skilled musicians and recording professionals, and the passion - I still have not been able to create much new music because my productive hours (at least 50 or more per week) are usually all used up with necessary income producing musical activities. In addition, I am amazed and blessed to have thousands of enthusiastic followers from all over the world on my Facebook page (\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ronferlitomusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e) and elsewhere through streaming and music sites like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/18945rUVuuBtH6TpCq8KFy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itun.es/us/QYB7H\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple Music\u003c/a\u003e which provides access to the global distribution capabilities I could not even have dreamed of as a younger artist traveling around the country selling cassette tapes out of the back of our trusty little red Dodge Dart. There are thousands out there that know and like my music and are just waiting for new material! The frustrating irony is that I just can\u0027t get it to them! It\u0027s like all the difficult pieces of the puzzle are now in place, but it still hasn\u0027t completely come together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I simply have not had time. Until now. Until Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow This Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge of as little as $1 per song/item (about $2 per month = less then a fancy cup of coffee or just about $24 per year) when combined with other small and larger pledges enables me to dedicate my time and money towards completing creative works. It\u0027s as if you are collectively functioning as a large record company or book publisher and providing an advance so I can focus on creating. This is especially important now with so many people - particularly in younger generations - to whom the concept of paying anything for music is a completely foreign idea. (read more about this trend and my views on the \"new\" music industry in my recent blog entry\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ronferlitomusic.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e). Patreon is on the cutting edge of this paradigm shift away from the concept of selling creative works when they are completed toward enabling creators to fulfill the expectation of sharing their work freely. Instead of purchasing the completed works, patrons are supporting the work of the artist directly on the front end of the process when the support is needed most, and rewarded with unique access to the completed work as well as the creator and creative process itself. The pledge you make is only distributed to the artist and rewards are given back to you only after each new item is completed, on a monthly basis according to how many songs/items are completed by the artist each month. This creates a genuine financial incentive and opportunity for the artist to create new \"items\", placing creative work on an \"even playing field\" as the many work-for-hire music activities that must be done because of the need for immediate income. But don\u0027t worry - this does not mean that my wonderful work with students, recording clients, churches, schools and others will fade away! I just won\u0027t have to be as dependent on them to make ends meet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo What\u0027s In It For The Donor?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn item in this case consists of a completed audio recording of an original or existing song, a completed video for a previously completed audio recording, or a completed sheet music arrangement for piano, vocal, or ensemble of an original, classical, or other work. Each item may or may not be released later for free streaming or sale as part of an album or collection or as an individual single. Some items may eventually be released in a physical form, some may only be released in digital form. However, as even the lowest level patron, you will always have complete access to any of these items long before they are released to the general public. Higher level patrons will also receive access to the digital forms of previously released materials, and then physical copies such as CD\u0027s and printed songbooks whenever those items may be bundled into physical products later. Moving upwards, the highest level patrons will be rewarded with access to some of my teaching and live performances. Unlike the traditional model of only selling creative works and recouping investment long after they are created, your pledge compensates the artist at the time of creation, allowing the work to be freely distributed later without total dependence on residual income from sales, donations, or royalties which are increasingly shrinking in the new music distribution model.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is to produce one or two items per month. Two per month will hopefully be the most common, with some months having a higher production rate and other months having only one or no production at all. You will only be charged for as many per month as you decide to pay for if you wish to cap your donation at a certain level. Likewise, if there is a month when I am unable to complete any items due to higher workload of other projects, etc. you will not be charged at all. You can also cancel or change your pledges at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eOK This Sounds Great! Make It Happen! \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo go ahead and look over the unique gifts I have planned for you at the various levels of pledges before you hit the corresponding link to select your pledge level and enter your payment information. (Any credit/debit card is acceptable and you do not have to use or sign up for PayPal to participate if you do not want to. I just mentioned that because when I first signed up to support a few other artists, it seemed a little confusing to me and it first seemed as if PayPal membership was mandatory, but it is not). The\u00a0credit/debit card you use for your pledges will not be charged until the first of the following month, then on the first of each month continuing until you cancel.  Only at that time will you see a charge based on the number of new items posted by the creator in the previous month (the one just ended) or your maximum limit - whichever is smaller. The only exception to this is that any pledges $100 or over per item (hopefully this will affect lots of you!) will have a temporary hold placed immediately for a few days and then released before it is charged on the first of the following month and continuing like the other pledges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also a unique communication interface set up just for supporters to communicate with me and each other, so hopefully I will see you soon on the other side. And please share this Patreon site with others on your social media platforms and by e-mail and text to help get the word out. I know there are lots of folks out there that you know (and I do not) who would appreciate this kind of access to great music and who would feel privileged to be able to become a supporter! Thank you so much for giving your time in exploring all of this! \u003cbr\u003e"
