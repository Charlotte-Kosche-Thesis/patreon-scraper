    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Luke! I\u0027m an aspiring filmmaker who#s been making short films and videos of all kinds since my 11th birthday. In 2006 I joined YouTube to post videos, and in 2011 set up RazorwireReviews, the first time I made videos specifically for YouTube. I started making videos reviewing wrestling DVDs, which quickly morphed into a movie-centric channel where I reviewed and collected Blu-rays. After gathering a small following I expanded on my reviewing format and began making web shows in the form of multiple review series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI reviewed 366 films in The Epic Film Challenge, I reviewed every Batman film (up to 2012) for the RazorwireReviews Bat-a-thon, I reviewed the massive Harry Potter Wizard\u0027s Collection boxset over the span of two years for The Harry Potter Odyssey and continue to put out similar series! I unbox blu-rays and show off cool special editions, I make videos on current film news or even just about my life. I began making general vlogs in 2012 and typically cross them over to movies. I\u0027ve also even made some gaming videos on my separate channel \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BogStandardReviews\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRazorwireReviews Plays\u003c/a\u003e. The bottom line is, variety is the spice of my channel and is a reflection of all the things I love in the world of movies, sports, music, games and beyond!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 I began a yearly video event called the 24 Hour Movie Marathon, originated by fellow YouTube movie vlogger Ryan Chattaway (check out his\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/RyanChattaway\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatreon page\u003c/a\u003e). It has grown over the years to be a huge feature length video I like to call a \"vlogumentary\" where I chart my experiences watching movies for 24 hours, while also including funny skits and comedy segments referencing other films, along with guest appearances from other YouTubers! For the most part my videos follow a laid back approach, and are conversational in tone, but I do frequently add some much needed fun in to my videos also.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I love making videos, it\u0027s the feature length, vlogumentary style videos that I love to make and put out there. My ultimate goal is to make films, but I love YouTube too, and to add better production values to some of my special videos is something I really want to achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough 2015 and 2016, thanks to the support of my Patrons, I was able to upgrade my storage space! The next goal is to merely continue to put the pledges back into my channel through various ways, with the long term goal of being able to upgrade my laptop, which is now five years old and I need more speed to make videos more efficiently. That being said though, I\u0027m managing just fine as it is, and that\u0027s just a pipe goal at the minute, all the support is greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my page, every little helps, but if you are a regular viewer, feel no obligation, I\u0027ll do just fine either way :) Thanks for all the support if you have indeed supported my channel over the years or in recent times, and I hope you continue to enjoy my future content."
