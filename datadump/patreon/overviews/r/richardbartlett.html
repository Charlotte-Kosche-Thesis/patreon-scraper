    "summary": "Welcome to the \u00a0Patreon page of Dr. Richard Bartlett D.C., N.D., creator and teacher of Matrix Energetics. I developed a relationship with music at an early age, as a younger man I played bass professionally. Having collected instruments for years, I taught myself to play many of them. Not being able to satiate my desire to birth the melodies as I heard them playing in my head I moved into digital composition. Having more access and range has vastly improved my ability to produce the pieces that I am inspired to write as they come to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I am able to explore different dimensions and states through the music I make, I am able to create pieces that oftentimes themselves create altered states of expansive awareness that may catalyze changes in coherency and congruency for and within a person, as they allow themselves to experience the journey of the music. Through your contributions to this site you will effectively help me to navigate more effectively between the worlds of internationally renown healer-teacher and artist by helping me to generate a stream of flow dedicated solely to time and space in my daily schedule to create pieces that are unique to my particular brand of musical inspiration, as well as an initial platform for sharing them with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am SO incredibly grateful to and for all my many fans and supporters, all over the world, that have been there for me during my journey to this point in life and career. It has been my utmost pleasure to know and serve you and will continue to be so for so long as I may be allowed. Thank you evermore for your much needed and appreciated support, which will allow me to continue to fulfill my desire to bring forth fields that create resonance for continued expansion of consciousness and the field of the heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way to support content that you love on a per month basis  You can pledge any amount that you want  For patrons: Patreon is a way to pay your favorite creators for making the stuff you love. Instead of literally throwing money at your screen (trust us, that doesn\u2019t work), you can now pledge a few bucks per thing that a creator makes. For example, if you pledge $2 per video, and the creator releases 3 videos in February, then your card gets charged a total of $6 that month. This means the creator gets paid regularly (every time she releases something new), and you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts. That\u2019s right. Imagine you, in a long frilly white wig, painted on a 10-foot canvas on the wall of a Victorian mansion. And imagine your favorite creators making a living doing what they do best\u2026 because of you. To your point, pledging is a piece of cake! After you\u0027ve created your account, just head to the creator\u0027s page you\u0027d like to support and click the orange \"Become A Patron\" button. Follow the prompts to confirm your pledge amount and payment info and you\u0027re all set. Then... the real journey begins... 1) From a creator\u0027s page, click the orange \"become a patron\" button. 2) You\u0027ll be taken to a pledge page where you can decide any dollar amount you\u0027d like to pledge, as well as any rewards available to your pledge tier.  3) Click \"continue\" and you\u0027ll be taken to a confirmation page, where you can add a credit card or Paypal account (please note, Paypal will be disabled for any NSFW creators.) Click the blue \"pledge\" button. Click \"confirm\" at the bottom of the confirmation page.\u003cbr\u003e"
