Her voice bathes over me\u003cbr\u003eas if I have soaked myself in a healing sound-shower.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e-- Steve Lee, Glastonbury FM\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMusic has been my healer from the word go. I remember as a tiny child listening to my mother\u0027s radio and recording songs I liked on to tape, which I would then listen to over and over again throughout my childhood, singing, dancing and harmonising along. My sisters and I would sit in the apple tree at the bottom of the garden composing songs in the round, and later I would sit at my electric keyboard and pour my heart out over the keys. Music brought me joy, solace, wonder, dancing, tears... many emotions that I didn\u0027t yet have words for, born out of complex situations that I would not understand for years to come... and this continued right the way through into the present moment, as I\u0027m sure it has for many of you too. The right music at the right time is pure divine medicine for the soul, nothing else can touch that... \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of you have been with me since before the birth of my debut album, \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ruth-blake/sets/lullabies-for-grown-ups\"\u003e\u0027Lullabies for Grown-Ups\u0027\u003c/a\u003e (buy \u003ca href=\"https://www.ruthblake.com/shop/rbcd001/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e) - spurred on and funded to my utter astonishment, by YOU - and some of you have joined along the way. The very foundations of this path were built on my relationship with YOU. It was you that first nudged, supported, and prayed that first album into being, instilling in me the belief that this was the right direction to follow. It is you that has listened, felt, connected and believed in its power to heal your hearts... allowing the music in to touch and soothe those tender and difficult to reach places; it is your energy that has nurtured these first songs into being so that they can never be lost. And these songs, whilst they are for me at the moment of writing, are also yours... Because yours and mine doesn\u0027t really exist and the medicine for my heart is really medicine for the cosmic collective heart that we all share... And as I further along my path, and feel myself spreading my wings, I am being called into new places, to create new spaces that are about YOU finding YOUR voice, your empowered, authentic, creative expression. And the truth is I\u0027m totally making it up as I go along, reflecting on my own journey as I walk it, and working out how best I might share the gifts I receive with you all so that we can all rise together; united, empowered, strong. So far I am doing this through workshops, 1-1s and interactive performances that aim to break down any illusion of hierarchy that a stage creates, and instead honour the fact that we all want to share, create and play together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel this work deep in my bones, it keeps me up at night, my very \ncells vibrate with the music and offerings yet to come... And keeping on\n top of it all is without doubt a full time job. My prayer now is to \nhave the resources available to honour it as such. You may have heard the song - \"You are the wind beneath my wings\". Well...I need wind-power! As seems to be the way of things now, musicians and artists worldwide are cutting out the middle men and creating much more intimate and authentic relationships with their audiences by asking their fans for funding and patronage, often in return for wonderful creations, unique content, insights and opportunities to connect. So that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo... that\u0027s where you come in. What this incredible platform does is give you the opportunity to join me on my path and become the backbone of my music. Giving just a small amount each month will help me to create a sustainable existence in which I have a) the time, and b) the resources, to keep creating.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn truth, if you feel my music in your heart then I want you to have it, and I don\u0027t care how you get it. That\u0027s right! I don\u0027t care if you \u003cstrong\u003enever ever give me a penny! \u003c/strong\u003eI will always endeavour to make my music freely available for people, for the duration of my career, and I promise you that. But... I do need to live! So here it is: a doorway of opportunity to step through IF you feel inspired and have the resources. I really truly believe that if everyone does exactly what feels right in their own hearts in each moment, together we have all the ingredients for something truly scrumptious.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you, thank you and thank you again for all of the love in your hearts, however that manifests.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInfinite blessings,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRuth x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo understand more about Patreon and what it\u0027s all about, watch their great little \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwvUjAv6pxg\"\u003evideo here\u003c/a\u003e :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLINKS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease check out the myriad links to my music online.
