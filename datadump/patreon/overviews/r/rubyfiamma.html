I quit my job, moved cities and took a major hiatus from writing. It\u0027s been a very long and difficult road but with the help and support of my friends, I am beginning to get through it. I don\u0027t want to be the person who suffers from this anymore and I\u0027ve already taken some steps towards becoming a better me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been through a lot of struggles but it hasn\u0027t taken my love for writing away. Little by little I am trying, but time and money have not been kind. I want to be able to create more content -- and not just fan work but original work too! Ever since I was little I\u0027ve aspired to be an author but I can\u0027t continue to use my time to create works for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, you\u0027ll be allowing me the freedom to do what I love\u003c/strong\u003e. By becoming a patron, you\u0027ll have access to works in progress, my creative process, sneak peeks and previews, access to commissions, possible collaborations, live authorship and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot express how much your support means to me, I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart."
