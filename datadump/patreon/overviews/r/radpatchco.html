Embroidery art has pulled me through some truly dark times and it\u0027s what continues to keep me going (well, besides my cats). A few years ago, after being diagnosed with some chronic and debilitating illnesses, I was forced to leave my employment. I had no other choice but to attempt to support myself with my art, which had been \"just a hobby\" up until this point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmong other things, I suffer from Fibromyalgia, ME, Chronic Migraine, Asthma and Hyper Mobility. I battle against my illnesses daily, and so far, I have managed to scrape by; but honestly, I\u2019m struggling.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to keep my focus on making beautiful (or horrifying) pictures with thread and fabric, and if I sell a thing or two that\u0027s a bonus; but realistically, I also need to buy supplies, eat, pay for meds and keep a roof over my head. Having a regular monthly income via Patreon would be extremely helpful to me, especially as I\u2019ve been forced\u00a0to cut down my embroidery hours due to issues related to my illnesses.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support it, I would love for you to become a patron - every little bit helps! If you choose not to become a patron, that\u0027s ok too. I understand, I really do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you to those who support me and my work, in any way possible. I owe you, big time. Without you, I wouldn\u0027t be here.\u003cbr\u003e"
