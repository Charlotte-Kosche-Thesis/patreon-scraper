We do have a Let\u0027s Play Channel, but I assure you, we don\u0027t just slap up a 5 minute video of us playing Minecraft and call it a day. And it\u0027s not because we keep getting cyber bullied on our Minecraft server by Chuck (though that doesn\u0027t help).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn everything we do, we try to be different. If you\u0027ve seen one of our longer Let\u0027s Play series you have undoubtedly seen an odd skit involving green screens, puppets, and stock footage. We want to be a weird cross between Mystery Science Theater and Tim and Eric. And yes ladies, I am still single.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a new Podcast called Bad Toons where we discuss some of the worst accidents animation has to offer. Lately the cartoons have been so bad that it\u0027s been akin to torture, but a funny kind of torture. Like putting a rubber chicken in an iron maiden.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe feel like it\u0027s time for our channel to grow, to create new and exciting content. We have new ideas for new shows, podcasts, and stream events, but we need money to make any of those ideas come to life. Quality is very important to us, and where we sit now, we could only make an inferior product we are not happy with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
