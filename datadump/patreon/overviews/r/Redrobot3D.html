Many know me as RedRobot. I\u0027m a comic creator at Redrobot3D.com, Affect3D and Renderotica. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a 3D/2D artist working out of Austin, TX. I specialize in erotica in both 3D and comic style art genre. While many 3D artist may bring pretty pictures to the genre, I come in with a stronger sense of story telling and narrative style. I have a background in traditional illustration and I like to find way to combine the two to create unique artwork. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working in 3D for the past 9 years and have found it be both challenging and a great outlet for creativity. I\u0027m looking into creating and modeling my own original props, costumes, sets, and characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36,64,97);\"\u003eWhy Patreon:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a freelance artist, sometimes its hard to make ends meet with an inconsistent salary. There are many things that I would to work on but I just don\u0027t have the means nor the time to commit. \u003cbr\u003eWith your pledge of support I can help balance my work time and not be so stress about meeting my financial goals each month. Also I would be able to upgrade my current computer hardware/software to speed my up my creative process. Which means more art for everyone to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003eAs a 3D artist I would love to expand the stories that I have created this past year into full on going series. That would include such comics as \"Helen Black Vampire Hunter\", \"Tales of Hallow\", \"Interspecies Communication\", and many more! With your support I\u0027d be able to fund this endeavor and bring you unique and exciting original tales! \u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by and your continued support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36,64,97);\"\u003eWhat you\u0027re getting:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that you\u0027ve worked hard for your dollar. With that respect I\u0027m only going to be delivering the very best artwork that I can right to your email! Expect a ton of bonuses, gifts, wallpapers, and previews as the ball gets rolling on this project!\u003cbr\u003e"
