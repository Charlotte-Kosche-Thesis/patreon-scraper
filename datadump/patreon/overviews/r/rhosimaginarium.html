My name is Ryan, and I\u2019m a biologist turned trans human rights activist, who doodles their world. I\u2019m a non-binary person, I\u2019m synesthetic, can\u2019t tell left from right, and often bump into furniture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my Patreon page for a few different reasons\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, I am madly and hopelessly in love with nature, and want to study it, and write, draw, sing, and dance about it all day long! My artwork comes from a place of childish wonder, when I knew little about how nature works but was already in total awe of it. As a child, I encountered many creatures and phenomena that mystified me, and left a deep impression on me. I grew up, changed in many ways, but I never stopped wondering. About everything. Studying biology for many years did what science does: with every new layer of understanding, it made me ask more questions, and see more complexity and beauty in the natural world.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFurther, being an activist for human rights can be rather intense at times. I write a lot, but some things happen too fast and cut too deep to be written out. So I turned to doodling. I started letting my synesthetic brain use shape and color to express what it\u2019s not able to put into words. Not only does this allow me to express a lot more, but it is deeply therapeutic. There are closure, reconciliation, love and calm in committing the emotional whirlwind to a drawing. This gives me the strength to remain present and move forward. It gives me a way to own my experiences and resolve a lot of pain. Having financial support through my Patreon page would allow me to devote more time to art, helping me recharge my activist batteries, and discover new, creative approaches in my daily work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the final layer in the making of this page is that I am writing a story :) And this story is full of strange beings, landscapes, and phenomena. Before they are written, they demand to be drawn. One of the protagonists is named Rho, and they are an explorer\u2026for lack of a better word ;) Like Rho, I delight in whimsy and \u201cwhat ifs\u201d, in taking strange turns, whether in writing or drawing. Because of this, I want this page to be a playground, a place of discovery and wonderings - an Imaginarium.\u00a0In addition to finished drawings, I will be posting photos, interesting bits about the natural world, drawing and writing prompts, bits of folklore and other fuel for creating mysteries and adorable nightmares\u2026 and I encourage anyone who gets inspired to share their work and ideas :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a patron, you will get access to all sorts of goodies.
