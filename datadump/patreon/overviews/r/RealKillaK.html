    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI started playing Granblue Fantasy (GBF) in April of 2016 as a hobby, since I found interest in this turn-based cooperative game\u003c/strong\u003e. In late 2016 - early 2017, I decided to start streaming my gameplay on Twitch because people desired to understand how I was able to clear certain content at a decent speed, and had questions on how they could improve their own personal gameplay. Due to the demand and influx of questions I was receiving in May of 2017, I opened a Youtube channel for GBF to better fit what I thought the community needed and desired. These videos ranged from clearing the hardest raids in the game at the time with multiple elements, guides on how to improve as a player doing these raids / soloing raids, and demonstrating the true power of SR and underused SSR units in unit spotlights. I provide high quality content that people in the community use and plan to keep doing so in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSince 2017 it has been my goal to advance the GBF English playerbase\u0027s knowledge, because not many people speak about characters and/or understand pool building in the English community.\u003c/strong\u003e\nPeople have been misled due to the nature of the gacha or by some of the community that SSRs are the end all be all of the game and anything lower than SSRs are trash. Due to this, players tend to look down on SRs and prefer to leech raids, saying: \"I have no good characters for this element\"; while some of these SRs they may possess are better than some lower tier SSRs. I embrace the challenge to prove you can do it with just a bit of strategy and a decent grid, even if you didn\u2019t MVP the gacha..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow, you\u0027re probably wondering why I made a Patreon for a gacha game\u003c/strong\u003e. I am asking for your support to help me acquire more of the units / exclusives to showcase them to the community. \u003cbr\u003eThis will allow me to provide more high-quality content for you, my viewers, while slightly easing the burden on myself. \u003cbr\u003eJoin me on the journey of spreading better information within the GBF English playerbase and let us show the japanese players we are a force to reckon with!!!!!! \u003cstrong\u003eEVEN WITH OUR AWFUL PING!!!!!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
