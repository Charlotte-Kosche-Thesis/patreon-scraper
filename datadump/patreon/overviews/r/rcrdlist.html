No two days in a row are the same genre, often going dramatically different (serene opera one day, sludge metal the next). We track down the links to stream or purchase the album, or to just follow the band on social media. And we do it \u003cem\u003eevery day\u003c/em\u003e: over two years and 900 albums without missing a beat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy?\u003c/h3\u003eMusic discovery is a hard problem\u2014hence why there are so many approaches to it. The majority of these, however, rely on popularity. The more algorithmic they are, the more they depend on it. (Obscure bands don\u0027t offer many data points, after all.) Those are fine! But, we try to offer something different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRCRDList has no code powering its recommendations. We have our approaches, but they\u0027re human and fuzzy. The end result surfaces bands and artists of all stripes, including those who lack the resources to aggressively promote themselves. In fact, RCRDList \u003cstrong\u003enever\u003c/strong\u003e accepts money to feature a band.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t guarantee you\u0027ll like every band we feature, but if you stick around for a while, you\u0027ll find something you didn\u0027t know you needed. That\u0027s our mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho?\u003c/h3\u003eRCRDList (and, thus, this Patreon) is run by Zoe Landon. Along with being a drummer (formerly of The Substandards and Rabbits on the Run, currently\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mightymissoula.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Mighty Missoula\u003c/a\u003e), she ran Fairwood Studios, one of the largest independent authoring companies for the Rock Band series of video games. She also operated a one-off digital music bundle and, before it morphed into RCRDList, ran a vinyl subscription service called RCRDBox.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe curation team includes Yanir, the data scientist behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bcrecommender.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBandcamp Recommender\u003c/a\u003e; Kyle, record producer and former Rock Band Network author; and the Fur Music Collective, a team of musicians and friends focused on\u00a0electronica and heavy avant garde music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003eWe\u0027re wrapping up a rebuild and redesign of\u00a0RCRDList.com, making it a more substantial and accessible catalog of interesting and obscure music. When it\u0027s finished, that site (and emails) will incorporate ads into the design. We\u0027ll try to make them unobtrusive, but running a website and large mailing list costs money. RCRDList is a labor of love, but we do want it to be self-sustaining. Even better, we\u0027d love for RCRDList to support artists beyond the nebulous and eye-rolling offer of \"exposure\". The more support RCRDList gets, the more we can translate that into real artist support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRCRDList Press\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/tech/rcrdlist\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRCRDList on Product Hunt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lifehacker.ru/2015/01/27/new-music/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0443 (Lifehacker.ru: How to Search for New Music)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-discover-new-music-without-overwhelmed/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMakeUseOf: 5 Ways to Discover New Music Without Being Overwhelmed\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
