We have conversations with primarily females in the music industry, our focus is on promoting females in the industry. We go backstage and behind the scenes with those in the music industry we want to know on a deeper level. We find out about the relationships that influenced their work, their career-changing decisions, what motivates them, how they feel about their work, and the life circumstances that made them who they are today. We openly share our passion and opinions of music, and how it has shaped our lives. We strive to be diverse, and talk about the unlimited genres of rock music \u2013 from punk to alternative to country rock to blues rock, and everything in between. No type of rock music is off limits. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHost Bio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSommer Sharon. Owner of Rock Talk (est. 2011).
