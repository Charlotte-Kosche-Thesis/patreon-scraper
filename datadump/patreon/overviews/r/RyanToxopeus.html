I\u0027m Ryan Toxopeus, and I started my path as an indie author back in 2010. Like many artists and creators, this is not my full time work. I am the Chief Research Associate and Lab Technician at the University of Guelph\u0027s Driving Research in Virtual Environments lab. Writing fantasy is a hobby I\u0027m passionate about, and knowing that others are enjoying the stories I write is awesome! Patreon has made a big difference in my writing, and I\u0027ve made the most of the donations I\u0027ve received from Patrons. From new cover art for a short story anthology, to entering contests because my Patrons paid for the editing on extra stories, I\u0027ve accomplished a lot with their support and I\u0027m forever grateful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://prcreative.ca/ryan/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/TrilogyDesktopMed.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point, I have almost finished work on my first trilogy, \u003cem\u003eEmpire\u0027s Foundation\u003c/em\u003e. With the support of friends and family, I\u0027ve defrayed much of the costs for editing and art through Indiegogo campaigns. However, it is my hope to not run any more Indiegogo campaigns, and change gears to have my writing begin to support itself. Most authors don\u0027t reach that point until they have 4-6 books out, so I know that\u0027s a gamble with only three.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduction Costs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow much does it cost to bring out a novel? The first step is developmental editing, which is roughly $800 for the length of book I write. Developmental editors make sure the story flows well, and there aren\u0027t any major plot holes, among other things. As an example, in my latest book an entire scene was deleted during the developmental editing phase, because it didn\u0027t fit well with Eliza\u0027s character, and didn\u0027t add much to the story. I am very fortunate that line editing is covered by my aunt, who is retired and enjoys working with me on my stories. Cover art ranges in price, depending on the complexity of the scene I want: from $500 to $800.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means I need to save $1300-$1600 to produce one novel, which is daunting. With two young children to provide for, there isn\u0027t much left over to put into my writing. Whatever I make in sales on Amazon or at conventions goes back into my writing, but more often than not I wait until tax time rolls around and I can squirrel away a chunk to put towards books. If I produce anything extra, like short stories or novellas, there\u0027s next to no money available for art and editing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. I know unknown creators don\u0027t get a lot of funding on Patreon, and I\u0027m not expecting to raise $1600 to bring out a fully-formed novel. But if I can get even a few people who decide that they want to receive e-book copies of everything I write, I can get decent art on my smaller projects to help them stand out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#1) $25/month. I like writing short stories, and usually do a couple per year. At this level, I\u0027d have enough money to pay for editing and art to make them look pretty decent. The art won\u0027t be at the same level as the novels, but it\u0027ll still be professional. Check out what Harvey did for my short story,\u00a0Macimanito M\u00f4swa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://prcreative.ca/ryan/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Macimanito-M%C3%B4swa-small.jpg\" style=\"width: 214px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of my generous patrons, I have been able to get new art on my short story collection, Dawn: A dwarven creation story. I can\u0027t thank them enough! Check it out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://prcreative.ca/ryan/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cover-200x300.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#2) $50/month will pay for editing and art on novellas, on top of the short stories. These I bring out less frequently, but they\u0027re considerably longer than the short stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#3) $100/month means all my art and editing is covered, for every piece of work I do. This level of support would blow my mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#4) $200-$500/month is the stuff dreams are made of. For each $100/month increment, all my expenses for a major convention would be covered. Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton, and London - I could go to them all at $500/month. Conventions are where I do my best, because a) I\u0027m among my people, and b) the art and my enthusiasm for my work sell books. Lots of them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#5) $750/month means I could get out of Ontario and get to another convention pretty much anywhere in North America. While the idea of travelling to the US is more than a little scary to me, I\u0027d love to head out to other destinations across Canada.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#6) $6000/month is what I call \"the pipe dream.\" At this point, you\u0027re basically funding my life. I could quit my job and write full time without taking a hit to our quality of life, and attend every conference in Ontario, and one beyond.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll donation levels help, from $1 per month right up to $85. Most of my monthly goals are pretty reasonable, I think. I\u0027ve taken into consideration my rate of writing, and those amounts reflect what I would need to achieve these goals. That\u0027s not to say I won\u0027t be putting my own money into my writing, still, but anything you can give will be a tremendous help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 - Thank you. Seriously, even $1/month helps. At this level, you will receive e-books of any stories I publish (at a maximum of 1/month), and your name will appear in the dedications (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$2 - You\u0027re going to get special, Patrons-only insights into my writing. This includes sneak peeks of drafts I\u0027m working on, and a look at my writing and editing processes that help me start and end a story. Additionally, monthly posts will showcase exclusive sneak peeks at new content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5 - This might not sound like a tremendous amount of money, but believe me, it\u0027s huge over the course of a year. At this level, not only do you get my e-books and writing insights, you will also receive sneak peeks at concept art and exclusive news about the games I\u0027m developing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$10 - You\u0027re what I\u0027d call a \"big fan\" at this point. How can I repay such a large monthly gift? How does being invited to high-level patron hangouts sound? You\u0027ve got my ear, and I\u0027d love to sit down and chat with you on a regular basis! Whether it\u0027s about my writing, or anything else under the sun, you\u0027ve got it. And if you\u0027d like to see a character name pop up in one of my works in progress, I can make that happen. And of course you get all the other stuff, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$85 - I don\u0027t think you\u0027re actually considering this. This is \"super fan\" territory. This is my top-end contribution, and it\u0027s a lot. But you know what you get for this? I\u0027m going to go to a convention near you, and we\u0027re going to hang out in person. At this level, you\u0027re paying for my transportation and table fees to the BIG conventions, all by yourself. I owe you so, so much. Because I have limited time to go away for conventions, I\u0027m going to limit this to two donors. After seeing the excitement for my $100 \"Lifetime fan\" perk for my Indiegogo campaign, where people get everything I write for the rest of my life, I don\u0027t want to spread myself too thin if this attracts people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne-time donations are also welcome, although I\u0027m not sure how I would work perks for that. If you would like to support me in this way, I would suggest picking up a copy of one of my books. All money from sales goes back into my writing, plus if you like the book, a review is like gold to authors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been using Patreon since October 2016, and looking at the list of things I\u0027ve done with the help of Patrons is impressive...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Cover art for Dawn.\u003cbr\u003e2) Maps for A Hero\u0027s Birth.\u003cbr\u003e3) Editing for Narcissist, a short piece of non-fiction I submitted to a contest.\u003cbr\u003e4) Editing for Dark Ones, a short story I submitted to a contest.\u003cbr\u003e5) Cover art for the Omnibus e-book with my entire \u003cem\u003eEmpire\u0027s Foundation\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0trilogy.\u003cbr\u003e6) Editing for Carbon Concerns, a short piece of fiction I submitted to a magazine.\u003cbr\u003e7) Cover art for A Queen\u0027s Edict.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t wait to see what projects come next with your generous support!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Ryan Toxopeus, award winning writer of the \u003cem\u003eEmpire\u0027s Foundation \u003c/em\u003efantasy trilogy, has been writing fantastic tales for two decades. His first award was received in university, when he entered a short story contest with a work of fiction that chronicled a Dutch resistance fighter in World War II, who was captured by the Nazis and put in a concentration camp. The story took first place, much to the surprise of the judges who said they were not used to seeing that quality of writing, especially from an engineering student. Although he loved writing, his schooling took him elsewhere, and he did not start writing seriously again until after the birth of his daughter. Since then, Ryan has published two novels (\u003cem\u003eA Noble\u0027s Quest, A Wizard\u0027s Gambit\u003c/em\u003e), a novella \u003cem\u003e(Demon Invasion\u003c/em\u003e), and several short stories both related to his larger fantasy world, and stand alone stories including \u003cem\u003eMacimanito M\u00f4swa \u003c/em\u003ewhich won Honourable Mention in the L. Ron Hubbard Writers of the Future contest.\u003cbr\u003eWhile writing, he keeps the mantra, \"If I\u0027m bored writing it, readers will be bored reading it,\" in mind. Thus his focus is on fast-paced action and intrigue. His world and plots are rich and complex, keeping readers guessing right until the end.\u003cbr\u003eOriginally from Thunder Bay, he now lives in Guelph, Ontario with his wife, children, cat, dog, and hamster. He also works on creating games related to his writing.\u003cbr\u003e",
