The Senate was reclaimed in order to protest\u003cbr\u003ethe York administration\u2019s calculated unwillingness to resolve the ongoing CUPE 3903 strike in a fair manner. The reclamation of the Senate Chamber is now in its second month, having become the longest running action of its kind on a university campus in Anglo-Canadian history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the length of the reclamation has grown, the goals and objectives of the reclaimers\u003cbr\u003ehave also expanded. We are no longer simply interested in bringing an end to the strike. We want to take the university out of the hands of high-salaried administrators and the\u003cbr\u003ecorporatized Board of Governors. We want to contribute to the creation of a university that\u003cbr\u003eworks for students, educators, staff, and surrounding communities. In other words, we\u2019re not content with having reclaimed the Senate Chamber. We want to reclaim YorkUniversity in its entirety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters we want lower tuition fees, reduced rents for students on university\u003cbr\u003eresidence, affordable food options, and a more representative university governance structure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re building a campaign that will help us achieve these and other goals. Our efforts\u003cbr\u003eare going to involve starting up a newspaper (we\u2019re also considering the possibility of a\u003cbr\u003epodcast!), filing Freedom of Information requests, and \u2026We\u2019re going to need your help to make it all happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike York University President Rhonda Lenton, we\u2019re not friends with any tax-dodging billionaires who we can go to for money. We\u2019ll have to rely on regular people like\u003cbr\u003eyou! Please consider becoming a patron of our cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much to all who support the cause, we are currently situated in the reclaimed student and community chambers on the 9th floor of Ross North, York University. All are welcome to come check out the space and hang out.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
