    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Richard Fairgray. I\u0027m a writer and illustrator of comics and children\u0027s books, lyricist and animator, living in a haunted recording studio in Hollywood with two other humans, one ghost, a vicious cat named Major Tom and a pug named Leia who can\u0027t keep her tongue in her mouth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing when I was three years old and published my first comic when I was seven. I love to draw because it gives me a way to flatten the world onto paper, because I can\u0027t actually see things in three dimensions. I have one dead eye and one that sees about 3% of what it should. I\u0027m classed as \u0027legally blind,\u0027 but I\u0027m yet to find out how I could possibly do it illegally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017 I left New Zealand to move to Hollywood, and now I spend my days feverishly working on new books and stories. I want to tell stories for people who don\u0027t usually get their stories told. I want to work with people who bring new perspectives to the current media landscape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in New Zealand I ran a publishing company called Square Planet. It was a place for all the outsiders to gather and support each other. Through this label I was able to publish works by a lot of new creators, and promote new voices into the New Zealand comic scene. I\u0027m not in a position to do that here yet, but that is always where my interest lies. I love creating, and I love seeing new things, unusual things, scary things, because that\u0027s where the most interesting stories will be coming from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy children\u0027s books focus on kids being right, rebellion being celebrated and the impossible always being within reach. Until we tell kids they can\u0027t do something, they have nothing stopping them. I wish that sense of wonder could last longer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me here you\u0027ll be helping me to keep making cool stuff with cool people. I\u0027m currently working on a line of feminist children\u0027s books that flip the script on all those books where boys are rewarded for being outspoken while girls are taught to be sweeter and quiet. I\u0027m working with different women on each book, sharing writing and illustration roles with known and unknown creators."
