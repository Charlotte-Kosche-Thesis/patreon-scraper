I enjoy many different genres, including MMORPGs, action RPGs, adventure games, and platformers. I discovered the wonderful world of watching people play video games on YouTube and in May of 2014 I began creating videos of my own! My channel has so far included mainly let\u0027s plays and the occasional guide, but I would love to be able to expand the sort of content I create. My aim is to entertain, amuse, and inspire people through my work, and this campaign will help me be better able to do that. I want to be able to produce more and higher quality videos.\u00a0I hope to be able to focus on providing you with videos as my \nmain job, as I truly love doing this and dislike that I cannot pour all \nof my efforts into making content due to finances. If you chose to support this campaign, you\u0027ll be directly helping me be able to do more of what I love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon, and what does my support actually do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon\n allows you, my lovely viewer, to help me make videos for you! My videos \nhave always been and will always be free to watch. You can think of pledging to my campaign as giving me a tip. I would love to be able to commit more time and effort into video creation, but without financial support, that is simply not an option. If you take the plunge and pledge to be my patron, you will be giving me the means to improve and focus more on making videos. This means better and more frequent content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a monthly campaign, so each month my patrons give me a set dollar amount. For example, if you want to give me $12 per year, you would pledge $1 per month. If you wanted to give $60 per year, you would pledge $5 per month. How much you choose to donate determines what sort of rewards you unlock. Be sure to check out the rewards section for more information! Regardless of whether you choose to give or not, I\u0027m very grateful for your support! Seeing how much you enjoy my content and hearing from you is a real highlight in my life. I cannot wait to take this journey with you! Thank you very much for taking a look and for being my patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
