Those books wouldn\u0027t have happened if it hadn\u0027t been for the amazing support of so many. And what did I learn from that experience? That there are people like you in this world who LOVE to participate in creative endeavors by becoming patrons of the arts and the artist. It gives you joy to make something happen that otherwise wouldn\u0027t without your help, and for that I am forever in your debt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOU MADE THIS HAPPEN!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.ripleypatton.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/The-PSS-Chronicles-Series-Banner-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027ve finished the full\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PSS-Chronicles-Complete-Set-Books-ebook/dp/B01M32TJU2\"\u003ePSS Chronicles Series,\u003c/a\u003e I find myself wondering what I can share with all of you. What content can I bring you on a regular basis that might thrill and enthrall you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s when I remembered all my short stories, both previously published (about 30) and some yet-to-be-published. In a way, my short fiction is the story of how I fell in love with story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I thought I\u0027d begin to share a short story a month, here on Patreon, starting with the very first short story I ever had published and offering all the way through several award-winning pieces, and even some exclusive, never-before-seen tales. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, I\u0027ll release a story for the basic pledge amount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the second pledge tier, I\u0027ll offer special commentary about the magical inspiration and publication process of the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for the final tier, you get digital access to everything I write in the future. So yeah, that one\u0027s a doozy. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get started, all you have to do is decide what level of patronage you want below, enter the amount in the \"Become a Patron $ Box \" above, and click become a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new to my fiction and have no idea what I\u0027m talking about, be sure to check it and me out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ripleypatton.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.
