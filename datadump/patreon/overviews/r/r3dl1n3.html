    "summary": "DCS World is a high-fidelity combat simulator. If you are serious about fighting in the virtual air, this is the simulator for you. The manufacturer and its module makers have a keen eye for flight perfection. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat having been said, there is one overlooked factor, that of persistent multiplayer campaigns. This is not a criticism. You cannot be good at everything. Better to focus on just the one thing, which DCS World does well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInteractive Persistence\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSo this is my dream: an online, interactive, persistent multiplayer server where the players not only fly but also direct strategy and coordinate ground forces. They spawn groups and assign their missions from outside the simulator itself. Indeed, players can act for their coalition even without running the simulator directly. Instead, they run a separate application, either on a Windows computer or mobile device (Android or Apple). They can schedule groups for spawning at selected locations whenever the need arises. They can create waypoints for their groups and thus coordinate ground actions with other players. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlayers retain control of the groups they spawn. Other players cannot take control unless a player relinquishes control or no longer uses them, after say 24 hours. They then join the unassigned pool. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a working title, I call it \u003cem\u003eOpen World\u003c/em\u003e because the server opens the simulator entirely. The server preserves the state of the campaign concurrently as it unfolds. The server can restart at any time and Open World restores all the alive groups, units and static objects. Players can even schedule a timed restart themselves from the Open World app. Restart occurs automatically when one coalition takes control of an aerodrome. Players can relocate squadrons to the new aerodrome. Within half an hour, the server restarts with slots at the new aerodrome. Enemy forces have that short time to counterattack and prevent the new slots appearing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReconnaissance now becomes an important sub-mission within the campaign. Once a player chooses a coalition, he can only see enemy forces in contact with friendly forces. These contacts fade from the map when forces disengage. Recon flights and recon ground units will need constant work to mark frontlines and identify essential targets deep within enemy-held territories. Such will trigger assaults at player discretion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommit Aviation!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFly on the edge, the bleeding edge, the redline, no brakes! This dream pushes the boundaries of DCS World server capabilities, taking it to a new level. It will take not-inconsiderable time and resource to implement. This is not an easy project, not one that can be completed all at once. If you choose to support this effort, then you too share the dream. You will be supporting the work and the equipment to maintain it. You will be rewarded with commander rank and its commensurate privileges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many other ideas. They include organisation of squadrons. Commanders can recruit and lead flights on missions, players and AI mixed. Also, sending real-time notifications to mobile devices so that commanders can keep a close eye on the battle from anywhere at any time. I would like Open World to allow commanders to set up frags (fragmentary orders) to their squadron or any other players in order to launch coordinated actions. An integrated radio is most desirable, something along the lines of SRS but with realistic attenuation so that signal power grows weaker at distance and brevity codes become really important. The Open World system could be used to support other servers too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could go on. These ideas will have to wait for now. If I can find enough commanders to support this project I will work on it full time. Being a software contractor, I can flexibly adjust my time between working on my own projects and those of others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes this sound like a project you would like to see become available? Do you want to command squadrons and coordinate ground forces? Patronise the project and get ready to commit aviation!\u003cbr\u003e"
