    "summary": "There is nothing more important to a creator than those people (fans, readers, patrons) who love and support their work. I couldn\u0027t be more grateful to people who love my books (and especially those who take the time to tell me!) and at the top of that gratitude list, I am grateful to my patrons. Because these are the people who are supporting me in the most tangible way and letting me know they totally support me in what I\u0027m doing. Because of that, the writing desk feels a little less isolated. And because of that, I can spend a little more time writing and a little less time looking for other sources of income to support my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I writing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently about halfway through what you might call the \u0027origin story\u0027 of the real 18th-century pirate, Mary Read. Mary Read was an ordinary working-class woman who lived most of her life as a man. She lived as a (male) servant in London in the early 1700s, and then served as a soldier in the Duke of Marlborough\u0027s Army, fighting in Flanders in the Spanish Wars of Succession.\u00a0 She married a Dutch soldier and for a while, living for the first time as a woman, ran a tavern with her husband in Brede. But before too long she was adventuring again. She went to sea, and became a pirate.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe only have the sketchiest details of her life, so I\u0027m making most of it up (barring the historical research!). What\u0027s interesting to me is the idea that having at first been made to live as a boy by her mother (for financial reasons) she chose to live the rest of her life as a man (with a brief hiatus for marriage) in order to be regarded as a man\u0027s equal. Looking around at the world today - yes, we are a long way from the 18th century - yet woman are \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0being treated as less than their male counterparts. See #metoo for the prevalence of sexual harrassment. See the incel movement leading to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2018/05/men-talking-sex-distribution-still-assume-women-are-their-property\"\u003e an Op Ed piece in the New York Times where women are discussed as if they are commodities\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the author of two novels and a whole fistful of poems, one of which is currently on the AQA \u0027A-Level\u0027 syllabus in the UK. My first novel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-marlowe-papers-by-ros-barber-sceptre-20-8122131.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Marlowe Papers\u003c/a\u003e (2012) won\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23080170\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Desmond Elliott Prize\u003c/a\u003e and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors\u0027_Club_First_Novel_Award\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAuthor\u0027s Club Best First Novel Award\u003c/a\u003e, and was long-listed for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thewritesofwoman.wordpress.com/the-womens-prize-for-fiction-shortlist-2013/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWomen\u0027s Fiction Prize\u003c/a\u003e (the year it stopped being the Orange Prize and before it became the Bailey\u0027s Prize).

So - exciting times.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it\u0027s not easy making enough money out of literary fiction to survive, even if you\u0027re up there in the prizes and critical acclaim. \u00a0See this post on my blog for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rosbarber.com/authors-truth-money/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efull break-down of what authors can expect to receive from book sales\u003c/a\u003e! \u00a0Nor is the answer self-publishing if you write literary fiction: self-published books aren\u0027t eligible for the prizes that help an author make their name, and unless you\u0027re good at marketing (I\u0027m really not) or want to spend 80% of your time marketing instead of writing (I really don\u0027t!) it\u0027s extremely hard to get your book into readers\u0027 hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat creative people need, more than anything, is a stabilisation of their income, allowing them to concentrate on things that really matter - creating new art! \u00a0Patreon is the 21st century (crowdfunding) model of patronage. \u00a0You pledge to support a writer or artist with a small monthly amount - as little as $1. \u00a0You might think it\u0027s pointless contributing so little, but it REALLY makes a difference. Why? Because *every single Patreon contribution* adds up to make a real difference to my being able to earn a living as a creator. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on what level of support you choose, many things. I post monthly updates to let you know how things are going, and at higher levels of support, you\u0027ll get audio recordings of things I\u0027ve already published with exclusive background info explaining how and why they were written, EXCLUSIVE audio extracts of the work in progress, personally signed copies of the new book when it comes out, even your name in the acknowledgements page! Just choose whatever level you fancy from the right-hand sidebar. And welcome!\u00a0 You are hugely valued.\u003cbr\u003e"
