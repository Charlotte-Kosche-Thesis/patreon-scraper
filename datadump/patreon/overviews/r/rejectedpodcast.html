If you\u2019re reading this, it means you\u2019re probably considering supporting my podcast. So please take a moment to feel good about yourself, because \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u2019re a good person\u003c/strong\u003e. Okay, proceed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QS7e0bz.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m Maria\u003c/strong\u003e. Born and raised in Bucharest, Romania, I moved to London three years ago on a whim. I quit my job, packed my bags, said goodbye to everyone I loved, and a few others out of politeness, and started over. It\u2019s one of the most exciting things I\u2019ve ever done. However, while my career as an advertising creative was taking off, something was missing. I was craving a project of my own, something I believed in with all my heart. I always thought I would write, but facing a blank page only made my mind blank out too. Then, one day, everything changed (kind of).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/j1krmM5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne day in May 2016, during a burst of boredom, I found myself doodling silly comics about rejection. I titled the series\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.therejectedpodcast.com/comics/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2018A Million Ways To Be Rejected\u2019\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and posted it on Instagram. And - holy shit! - people loved them. They even started telling me their ridiculous stories of rejection so I could draw them up. \u2018Hold on a minute\u2026\u2019, I said to myself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/yUjcwiZ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/yUjcwiZ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yUjcwiZ.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFor the first time, I felt I was doing something meaningful.\u003c/strong\u003e I could take these stories and, with enough kindness and humour, broadcast them to the world. So we could learn from them, and, why not, have a laugh together. The first episode took me four months to produce, but since then things have only looked up. I\u0027m becoming a better interviewer, my editing skills are improving, and more and more people are interested in sharing their stories, or just being part of this podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pvKXMQh.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ve never enjoyed doing something so much in my life\u003c/strong\u003e. I feel that this podcast has the potential to be truly great and change the way we talk about rejection. But I can\u2019t do it on my own. With your help, I can bring you more meaningful stories, from the people you want to hear from. Your support would allow me to travel more, upgrade my equipment, learn new skills and, why not, create some cool merch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd \u003cstrong\u003eit\u0027s completely up to you how you want to contribute\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0You can choose to donate a sum of money for every episode I create - which comes with some fun rewards, or you can just subscribe and share this show with your friends. \u003cstrong\u003eWhatever you do, I\u0027m very grateful you\u0027re here and I\u0027m really excited to create this show together.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
