    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003e\nWhy Would You Read This, or How a Skeptic Became a Heathen\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe Rational Heathen is a wildly popular Heathen/Asatru blog.\u00a0 You can \u003ca href=\"http://www.rationalheathen.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echeck it out HERE\u003c/a\u003e and note how many hits it has. It is a snarky, sometimes irreverent, and seemingly controversial blog that points out the truths as I see them.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n am not your typical religious fanatic. Hel, I\u0027m not even sure I am a \nreligious fanatic. Why anyone would give a shit and read my blog is \nbeyond me.  I do not hold my truths as being the only truths, but I do \nfollow Tyr, the god of truth and laws, so don\u0027t be surprised if I get a \nlittle insistent at times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI do not proclaim myself a priestess, gothi, gythia, or whatever the name is when somebody speaks of them.  If you\u0027re looking for someone to lead you, it ain\u0027t me.  Deal with it.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a skeptic.  I was raised Catholic and even went through parochial \nschool for a time, but that was pretty much enough to beat religions out\n of me. One thing that did secretly attract me was Norse mythology, \nwhich I suspect was Tyr calling me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen\n I grew up, I put aside foolish notions of religion and became an \nengineer.  I worked on rockets (yes, I was a rocket scientist).  The \nmore I read from the Judaeo-Christian religions, the more I hated them. \n It\u0027s not the message of Jesus, per se, it\u0027s everything else around that\n message and the total lack of logic of the entire Christ story.  Anyone\n with half a brain could see through the arguments. The other part of \nthe Bible is full of a hateful, vengeful god. That isn\u0027t a god I would \nfollow. I will, however, follow a god who would literally give his right\n hand to ensure our existence. The other problem with Christianity is \nthat there are so many people who cannot accept science as fact and look\n to the Bible as a textbook. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI accept science as fact. Science changes because our knowledge of the \nuniverse changes, but it is the way we learn about our universe. The \nfacts as we see them today may not be the facts of tomorrow. Science \ndeals with facts and observations, but it is not Truth. The nature of \nfacts tend to be fluid, which is why people often run to religion.  They\n want something that they can point to and say: \"This is true.\"  It\u0027s \nhard to do that when we don\u0027t have all the proof to our facts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, why do I believe in the gods?  The reality is that I struggle \nconstantly with the concept that there may be gods. And the gods tell me\n in no uncertain terms that they exist.  So, I accept their guidance and\n their help, even if they may just be the figment of imagination from a \ncrazy woman.  They don\u0027t tell me to do harmful things (why should they?)\n and they know damn well I use my reason to discern right from wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love the Havamal.  In particular, I love the \u003ca href=\"https://tattuinardoelasaga.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/cowboy-havamal-full-text/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCowboy Havamal\u003c/a\u003e, which I could totally see Odin get behind.  Like everything in Heathenism, it\u0027s more guidelines than actual rules.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou may have already noticed that I have a sense of humor. I believe you\n have to have a sense to deal with our world.  If you read any of the \nstories about our gods, one feature that appears prominently is a sense \nof humor, something that the Judaeo-Christian god lacks. Yes, our \nstories have vengeance, anger, cruelty, jealousy, but there is also \nhumor, kindness, forgiveness, and self sacrifice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been known to quote from popular culture as well as from pretty \nheavy hitting sources. I blend them as I see fit. Don\u0027t be surprised if I\n quote from scientists, religious texts, and Doctor Who all at once.  In\n fact, just expect it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\nI have been called intense by those who know me. I also have the uncanny\n ability to work with animals that has been called by others \"fucked \nup.\"  (That\u0027s a technical term.) Basically, if there is a domesticated \nanimal present, it will seek me out.  Dogs and cats are more likely to \nbe attracted to me.  (Honestly, I do shower every day.) Occasionally, \nI\u0027ve had other animals -- wild animals -- attracted to me.  No clue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\nAs the old Indian said in Little Big Man, \"Sometimes the magic works, \nand sometimes it doesn\u0027t.\"  I have scars from when that magic doesn\u0027t \nwork.  (It occasionally, though rarely, doesn\u0027t.) Usually it\u0027s my own \nfault. And usually with spectacular results.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\nOh, and I have a hard time believing in magic.  So, I am really a ball of contradictions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy I Called This The Rational Heathen\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027ve read this far, I\u0027m sorry. I have no clue why I call this blog \u003cem\u003eThe Rational Heathen.\u003c/em\u003e\n Maybe it\u0027s because I hold up beliefs to the light of Science and hope I\n can come up with some clever rational explanations.  Or maybe I just \nget tired of the woo-woo and I want some facts.  Hel, I might even go \nback to agnosticism at some point. But I kind of doubt it.  Tyr is \npersistent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSo Why Should You Be My Patron/Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003eIf you like \u003ca href=\"http://www.rationalheathen.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Rational Heathen\u003c/a\u003e and like what you see on the blog, please consider being my patron.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been doing this for nearly free for a year, and though I have fans, I don\u0027t profit from this.\u00a0 To be brutally honest, I could really could use the money.\u00a0 Really.\u00a0 I make my living writing, and some days I wish money would come in from this site.\u00a0 Writing once a week takes time from writing the oh-so-exciting topics of dental care, shipping news, and the riveting subject of pest control, all which makes me more money than The Rational Heathen site makes for me.\u00a0 It doesn\u0027t take a lot support The Rational Heathen, so even a few bucks is better than nothing.\u00a0 I publish posts on average of one per week, so if you\u0027re worried about me breaking your budget, you can safely plan on about 50 posts a year (I do occasionally have things go on in my life that takes me away from the blog).\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far. If you decide to support The Rational Heathen, you have my gratitude.\u00a0 Check out the rewards section and I might have something for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
