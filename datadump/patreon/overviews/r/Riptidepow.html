One time patron or monthly, even $1 goes a long way. Streaming full time is a dream come true for me and your pledges really REALLY do keep that dream alive. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Mike Perez. I\u0027m a normal, sometimes abnormal guy. You might know me by my Twitch name RiptidePow. I host a one man show on Twitch where I play games and interact with viewers Mon-Sat, six days a week for between 7-8 hours a day (Sometimes more)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a backer you are keeping me employed, aiding in the financial aspect of the show that no one sees or thinks about. Games/consoles, internet bills, stream upgrades/repairs and that\u0027s not even including my financial responsibilities. Any and all support adds up to allow me to keep streaming full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe goal of all of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe goal of this Patreon campaign is to combine it with my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://secure.twitch.tv/products/riptidepow/ticket\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitch Subscription Program\u003c/a\u003e (Currently somewhere between 130-160 Subscribers) to ensure that the broadcasts that I do every day are the highest quality possible and that I can continue doing it full time like I do at this moment.\u00a0Any and all support will allow  me to pay bills, continue doing what I love and keep pushing towards my dream of a successful future through streaming and to live comfortably enough for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end what really matters is that you take the time to watch the show, hang out in chat and are a part of my constantly expanding community. Thank you so much for supporting what I love to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
