I\u0027ve taught songwriting in intimate settings and classrooms, and have been an instructor at the Planet Bluegrass Song School for the past three years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI grew up in Knoxville, TN listening to the radio and my mom\u0027s collection of folk, singer/songwriter and classic country music. I cried when her Dan Fogelberg tape broke until she told me that there were many Dan Fogelberg tapes in the world. I love sneakers and peanut butter. I can\u0027t remember jokes. I have a hypoallergenic dog named Dede.
