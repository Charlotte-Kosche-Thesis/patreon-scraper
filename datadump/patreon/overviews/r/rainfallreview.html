My name is Caleb and I run the YouTube Channel \"Rainfall Review\". I make videos reviewing Japanese exclusive video games intended to inform and entertain you in equal measure. I do this largely because, one: I enjoy the hell out of it; and two: there is no one else on YouTube, to my knowledge, making these kinds of comedic reviews for Japanese exclusive games. If you really want a feel for the content I produce, I recommend cheeking out my channel here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? Aren\u0027t you rolling in YouTube money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYa... about that. YouTube can be a pretty volatile place as far as earnings are concerned and earning a consistent livable income is becoming increasingly difficult. And sadly, I am not lucky enough to be a 5 year old children\u0027s toy reviewer, so...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, a number of you have requested for ways donate to or support the channel. I would love to make this my full time job and if you guys would like to help me along the way, I will grateful as hell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my money actually pay for?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon funds cover a variety of things (games, monthly editing program fees, travel expenses, food, ect.), all of which help me produce the most entertaining, timely content I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuck you, this is not a real job!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you find yourself unwilling or unable to donate, don\u0027t sweat it! It is complacently optional and you can continue to enjoy my videos on YouTube for free! Think of pledging here as giving me a \"tip\" if you enjoy my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for even considering to help fund of my videos. If you decide to pledge, thank you so much! It really means a lot. If your unable or unwilling, please still continue to enjoy my content. Having such a dedicated group of people regularly watch my videos humbling. Again, thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
