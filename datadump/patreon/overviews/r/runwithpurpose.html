    "summary": "Howdy! My name is Jonathan Flores and I am runner and film maker in Central Ohio. I am currently on a mission to run a marathon or longer in all 50 states and documenting the journey along the way. I create films from races, short documentaries telling stories of runners/races, weekly recap videos, running tips and recommendations and much more! I don\u0027t have influence from corporate sponsors to make sure that I am giving my 100% honest opinion the way I want to tell it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to continue to create motivational and value adding content for my views like yourself for free. However, these projects do have a cost and that is where you and Patreon come into play. By using Patreon, I will be able to fund future projects and continue providing high quality value adding content that I want to deliver. Your support will allow that to flourish and for your contribution you will receive exclusive Patreon only content. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about me and I hope to see you on the Patreon page soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
