    "summary": "Thank you so much for visiting Radioman\u0027s Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRadioman is New York\u0027s one and only film set mascot, a legend of the film world. For over 20 years Radio, formerly a homeless alcoholic, has been a fixture on the set of every movie made in New York and its environs, and has become a good luck charm for filmmakers in the city. He has appeared in cameo roles in more than a hundred productions - starting in Ron Howard\u0027s RANSOM, and since then in ZOOLANDER, SHUTTER ISLAND, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, THE DEPARTED, ELF, and many many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tinypic.com/r/2hq5ndl/9\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2hq5ndl.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor nearly two decades after getting off the streets, Radio lived in a small rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn that he could afford from the bits of work available to him. Nearly\u00a0two years ago he was forced to leave that apartment as the building was being torn down the building to put up a new condo development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo continue to do his work Radio needs your support and the support of the community of film fans in New York and around the world - for new accommodation but also travel, food, and basic necessities. NONE of the money pledged to this page will go to anything other than the most urgent and vital of necessities for Radio, a creator and artist of humble means and even humbler needs, to go on making filmmaking in New York as unique and exceptional as it has been since the community took him in and stood up for him in 1996, helping him get off the streets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRadio is deeply grateful for any support, and if we are lucky enough to have you join the Radioman community we will keep you a part of it every month with email, video, and audio updates of his work and adventures on set and near some of the most famous names in entertainment today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tinypic.com/r/2hq5ndl/9\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
