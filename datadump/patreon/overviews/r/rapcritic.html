However, there are still rappers who haven\u0027t joined that lyrical evolution, leaving Hip-Hop awash in terrible lyrics, confident that people are too preoccupied with a catchy chorus and a fun beat to pay attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy job is to make fun of them for doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, for the last few years, I\u0027ve been reviewing songs, praising emcees who provide great lyrics and ripping on those who don\u0027t, because it\u0027s fun, and I love Hip-Hop and to love something means not being afraid to criticize when you think things aren\u0027t going so well.\u003cbr\u003e"
