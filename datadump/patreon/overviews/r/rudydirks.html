    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eCaring for the Soul\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of our lives we focus our efforts on work, finances, family, friends and solving the problems and challenges of life. Any energy left after that is used up on weekends and vacations.\u003cbr\u003eBut when you\u2019re stressed, over-whelmed with demands, and restless - where do you go?\u003cbr\u003eFrom time to time we catch glimpses of something deeper and bigger - the peace of a quiet moment alone, the beauty of nature, a moment of intimate understanding with a close friend.  These remind us that our soul - our inner person - is critical to how we experience life and yet is so easily ignored for the urgency of other demands on our attention, time and energy.\u003cbr\u003eThere is an ancient tradition of people who attended to these spiritual issues of life, and who spent time on wisdom and caring for the soul.  They would offer this gift to others who wanted to attend to these things but weren\u2019t quite sure how.  This came to be known as \u201csoul care\u201d.  People caught up in the busyness of life had a place where they could go to get help with the deeper issues of life which, in turn, helped reduce the craziness of their busy lives!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSoul care is about restoring the energy, vitality, and purpose of your heart. You know, the place where your emotions come from; the space where you are in the middle of the night when you can\u2019t sleep and the questions keep coming; the inner place where you last experienced that deep joy and contentment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been intrigued with soul care for most of my life.  One of my life\u2019s passions is integrating the strands of my life into a more centred whole - fitting together who I am, where I live, my work, relationships, dreams, and recreation in such a way that it \u201cfeeds\u201d my soul, gives me purpose and meaning, and helps make sense out of the rest of my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my life I have found myself helping others learn to care for their souls as well. Primarily through my professional work, but also in casual conversations, over meals, on kayak trips, when cycling and hiking, and through everyday life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve decided to offer this \u201csoul care\u201d to people like you, through Patreon.  This is a new experiment for me, so to begin with I am offering one article or video per month. \u00a0I plan to increase the offerings as more patrons sign up. \u00a0Simply put - the more income I generate through Patreon, the more time and energy I can devote to putting out posts. \u00a0The focus is on helping you to attend to your soul - the inner you, the most important part of you.  I do this in various ways;  sharing a story from my life, offering a unique perspective on some common issue, connecting something I\u2019m making in my yard or shop with spiritual questions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy purpose is to help you grow in wisdom and in caring for your soul.  Also, I have found that when I offer this to others, I myself grow in wisdom and in caring for my own soul - which is a nice benefit.  And that touches on an additional value of this format for soul care - I\u2019m hoping that as a patron, you will feel free to respond with your own thoughts and questions.  While I can\u2019t promise to respond to everyone, your comments and questions help shape my future offerings. I have always valued interaction as a wonderful way to grow in wisdom together.  Who knows, perhaps we can cultivate a \u201ccommunity\u201d of soul care and wisdom.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019d be delighted if you joined me as a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Prospective Canadian and International patrons, please be aware that the dollar pledges are in US funds.)\u003cbr\u003e"
