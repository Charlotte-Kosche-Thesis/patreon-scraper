    "summary": "Hi! My name is Ryan Doherty. I\u0027m an independent musician living in the English Midlands. I write and record new ambient, blues, pop and rock tracks. The music can range from soft, peaceful chill out instrumentals, to upbeat rock and roll songs, love ballads, wistful blues to veering on hard rock songs with blistering solo\u0027s. There\u0027s something for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had my vocals compared to Leonard Cohen and Johnny Cash and my guitar style to Pink Floyd\u0027s David Gilmour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music I create is the music I love to listen to myself. When you join me on Patreon, you\u0027re going to be part of something very special and personal. You\u0027ll get to listen to my music as it\u0027s being created. New songs and videos, covers, collaborations with other amazing artists, live jams.
