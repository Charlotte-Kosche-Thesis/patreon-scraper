    "summary": "Hello, people of the internet! If you don\u0027t know me, my name is Christopher Royston. At the time of writing this post, I\u0027m 20 years old, and I live in Maryland. I work part time as a cook, I\u0027m an avid gamer and love tabletop games like D\u0026amp;D and Call of Cthulhu. I\u0027m going to college to become a writer, and with your support, I may be able to accomplish my dream of being able to write for a living!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a college student working part time, I can\u0027t exactly accomplish that, just yet. I\u0027ve published a few works in small writing magazines, but being able to write and create for a living is my life goal. For most of my life, I\u0027ve found joy and comfort in being able to write about worlds, people, and places that can only be explored through writing. I\u0027ve always dreamed of being able to publish full works such as novels and collections of short stories, but that\u0027s a little bit out of the budget and time range of someone who puts pizzas in ovens for a living.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027ve come to Patreon with the hopes of achieving that goal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the nature of my medium, I can\u0027t offer too much in the form of patreon rewards, so I will instead use this as a sort of gratuity or \"tip jar\" of sorts. Anything I write (aside from published novels and such) will be free to view. If you like my work, and would like to support my continued writing, then feel free to throw some spare change my way once a month. I will be incredibly thankful, no matter what you donate, and every single dollar will bring me closer to my goal of being able to write full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d prefer to make a one-time donation, feel free to buy me a Kofi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://ko-fi.com/rwrites\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
