I\u0027ve been working, professionally, as a game artist since 2008 and have been lucky to have worked on a number of big titles. I\u0027ve also been doing teaching and mentoring over the last 5 years, trying to help others reach their goal of working in games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a continuation of that! I want to help others get the right knowledge, skills and mindsets for being a better artist and making better portfolio. Learning to develop your base art foundation and skills, different tools, the importance of storytelling and characters, presentation and creative troubleshooting/problem solving. And more importantly, find the type of things you want to express in your art and make it a more fulfilling experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis program is only for those who are very serious about getting in the industry and are willing to put in the time, effort and willingness to take critiques to get better and have more of an understanding of what it takes to make a career out of this. If this is the profession you want to pursue, we\u0027ll work towards that goal. That said, I won\u0027t be barking at you if you miss deadlines or don\u0027t comply with critiques. That is on you. You\u0027ll only be able to take the most out of this experience if you fully commit to it. Your portfolio will be proof of that. Whether you do or don\u0027t, that is up to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a limited number of spots per month, so make sure to follow me on Twitter or email me at wattz23@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
