And while there are still things I have in store for the site that I can accomplish myself, I\u0027m also at the point where I need some help. It\u0027s time to tackle the big projects that fans have wanted for years, but were too difficult for one person to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a friend on board who is helping me translate the foreign stories that were never released in the US. He has not asked for any payment, but I feel that his hard work is worth something and that he deserves compensation for his efforts. We\u0027re tackling the German magazines first, followed by the French stories and anything else we can get our hands on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I also have bigger goals in mind for the future. I would love to find someone to produce instrumental versions of the Rainbow Brite songs and perhaps parts of the tv show\u0027s musical score. And it would be magnificent to finally have all of the German audio plays transcribed and translated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut projects like these require funding, and that\u0027s where you come in! Patreon is a fantastic way for fans to contribute to and influence the content they want to see. So take a look at the reward levels and make your pledge today. I can\u0027t wait to share these new adventures with you all!\u003cbr\u003e"
