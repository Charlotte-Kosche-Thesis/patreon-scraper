I\u0027m Mike. I\u0027m fascinated by sound and all the things related to it. That\u2019s what Reasonably Sound is about: the science, theory, and culture behind all things audio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere may be some pretty specific, and even intimidating, things that come to mind when you hear \u201cpodcast about sound\u201d: physics, music theory, acoustic engineering. But I like to think of Reasonably Sound as a show about sound for people who don\u2019t think they\u0027d like a show about sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond music, acoustics, and physics, Reasonably Sound is about understanding how audio contributes to our understanding of the world. I\u0027ve talked about what a scream is, and how they function in music versus film. I\u0027ve discussed the \"braaam\" (which you probably know as \u0027the Inception sound\u0027) and some controversy regarding its authorship. Where do accents come from? Why do people slur their speech when they\u0027re drunk? Why are \u201cdog whistle politics\u201d called that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is called Reasonably Sound because we take a broad view of what counts as \u201csonic\u201d - in the hopes of\u00a0showing that there\u2019s a lot of surprising stuff to \u003cem\u003ehear\u003c/em\u003e in the world... it just might mean occasionally\u00a0\u003cem\u003elistening \u003c/em\u003ein unexpected ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eTHIS PATREON\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRS\u2019s costs are detailed in the GOALS section, but the long and short of it is that paying for studio maintenance, podcast hosting, research and my time help make sure the show can keep growing and improving. I\u0027d love nothing more than if I could do that with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever you can support the show is endlessly appreciated. Even if its just listening, it means the world to me. If you happen to have a buck to spare: it makes a difference. Either way - there\u2019s no shortage of stuff out there asking for your attention, and hard earned cash, I\u2019d be honored if you\u2019d toss any portion of either my way."
