We provide book and recipe pairings tailored to your interests, to nourish your mind and your body together. Every Reading While Cooking advice column answers a request for book and recipe recommendations, taking all your literary and dietary preferences and restrictions into consideration.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nReading While Cooking is the brainchild of Rose Fox and David Shaw, two lifelong readers and foodies. On the book front, we both love fantasy, science fiction, and horror, and Rose also enjoys romance novels. On the food front, Rose tends to go for easy weeknight meals, while David is a molecular gastronomer. We both draw culinary inspiration from a wide variety of global cuisines and eagerly recommend books by minority and marginalized authors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo ask our advice,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://readingwhilecooking.com/request-recommendations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esubmit a request\u003c/a\u003e (as often as you like) and let us know what you do and don\u0027t like to read and eat, and what sorts of books and recipes you\u0027re looking for.

We\u0027ll also do our best to suggest books that are in print or easy to find used copies of\u2014they may be obscure, but they won\u0027t be frustratingly impossible to get.

That said, we hope you find our recommendations worth supporting, and we greatly appreciate every pledge and link. The more love we get from our patrons and readers, the more time and effort we\u0027ll be able to devote to bringing you the best and tastiest recipe and book suggestions, and the more likely it is that we\u0027ll be able to continue writing Reading While Cooking into 2016 and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyone who pledges more than $10 per column gets to submit requests via our priority request queue; 25% of our requests will be pulled from that queue.\u00a0For each individual requester, we\u0027ll answer no more than one question every three months.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you become a patron, you\u0027ll get to see our columns on Fridays, two days before they go live to the rest of the world. You\u0027ll also receive our monthly newsletter, which may contain hilarious failed recipe stories, book and recipe links we found of interest, tips about exciting books coming out, or whatever else we decide to throw in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSelections from our queue aren\u0027t random; we\u0027ll pick the questions we think we can give the best answers to. So if you\u0027re looking for children\u0027s books in French, or nonfiction about medieval Europe, we may skip your request in favor of one about zombie novels or Regency romance that we have more advice for. Once our pledges reach $60 per column, we\u0027ll bring in some guest editors to make suggestions in literary or culinary areas we don\u0027t cover.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGot any questions we didn\u0027t answer?\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://readingwhilecooking.com/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eContact us.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for supporting \n\u003ca href=\"http://readingwhilecooking.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReading While Cooking\u003c/a\u003e!
