We also spend a lot of time learning more about our tools and techniques so the work we produce is better and more efficient as we go along. We\u0027ve used Canon cameras and lenses with open source (FOSS) software for the most part until recently which has been immensely satisfying. While we\u0027re big fans of programs like RawTherapee\u00a0and GIMP, we also appreciate the advantage of using high-quality commercial software like Lightroom and Photoshop. Recently we\u0027ve also put more effort towards incorporating new accessories and methods so the future should be an exciting adventure for us all.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note: If you need to withdraw patronage do so before you are charged at the end of the month.
