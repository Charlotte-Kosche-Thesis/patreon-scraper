    "summary": "Three years ago, the New Zealand police showed up to search my house and seize my medicine. That day sucked \u2013 but it launched me on a beautiful mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA judge eventually released me from criminal charges. Then, through a wild chain of events, I became the first person to legally possess raw cannabis in NZ in 50 years. But most people don\u0027t get those privileges. So, out of my gratitude and my firsthand shock at how the criminal \u0027justice\u0027 system works \u2013 I vowed to keep working for all medicinal cannabis users to live in peace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been activist-ing ever since, in \u003ca href=\"https://www.redwoodreider.org/blog/for-our-medicine-an-experiment-in-generosity\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evarious ways\u003c/a\u003e \u2013 making noise in the media, advocating to lawmakers, organising fellow patients to get our stories out. I believe we are winning... but it\u0027s taking some doing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know many folks aren\u0027t able to engage in this work themselves but would like to support the good green cause \u2013 so here\u0027s your chance! Welcome to my Patreon community, where for a small contribution you can support my activism, and receive some tasty chunks of inspiration for yourself in return. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not making political headlines, I\u0027m a musical/activist poet who creates spoken word to uplift, soothe and ignite people who want a better world. I\u0027ll be sharing unreleased pieces of that art exclusively with my patrons here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the end of this year, medicinal cannabis will become legal in NZ \u2013 \nbut it\u0027s not clear what that will mean, as the currently proposed law is full of holes. I\u0027m working with others to try to make this law more fair and compassionate \u2013 holding our government to account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy this site?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to an experiment in reciprocity. When you join my Patreon\n community as a patron, you pledge a small (or big!) amount of financial support per \u0027project\u0027 and get thank-you gifts in return. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow it works: You sign up for a pledge level on the right side of this page. Each time I do a major project for \nthe cause, the site will charge you, and I\u0027ll send you a reward as a thank-you. This will happen probably a handful of times per year, and no more than once a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m *not* expecting to be paid an hourly rate for my activism, or anything like that. But the reality is that while I\u0027ve been working on healing myself from a life-altering neurological condition \u2013 which is what caused me to use medicinal cannabis in the first place \u2013 it\u0027s been really hard for me to balance health, activism, and making an income. So this page will be dedicated to supporting specific projects where either I need funds to do something special, or a project\u0027s time commitment is keeping me from earning an income. I choose my projects thoughtfully \u2013 initiatives where I have \nunique skills and can make an impact. \u003ca href=\"https://www.redwoodreider.org/blog/for-our-medicine-an-experiment-in-generosity\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThis post\u003c/a\u003e lists examples of projects I\u0027ve undertaken recently to help liberate this incredible plant. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of our small population, we don\u0027t have many well-funded organisations paying activists in this country. So I reckon we could all get better at supporting individuals who carry a lot on behalf of the collective \u2013 and I\u0027m excited that this site could make that possible. If you agree, please join me in this experiment! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe future\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now \nwe\u0027re in the throes of legalising medicinal cannabis, and then \nwe\u0027ll be campaigning to make cannabis legal for everyone else via referendum. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome time later, in the next year or few, I intend to turn this Patreon page into a funding platform for my creative work to inspire activist hearts and minds. I\u0027m passionate about \u0027sacred activism\u0027 \u2013 building spiritual skills in order to help us all keep advocating for the good. I want to craft more creative resources to help other changemakers thrive. I have a long history as an eco-activist and was actually never planning to be a cannabis advocate til the police personally drafted me into the movement ;).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll keep my awesome community of supporters informed as my projects evolve, so that you can give input on what you\u0027d like to see me do, and decide what you want to stay on board for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading this far, and for considering joining me on this journey! I am continually humbled and awed by the goodness and generosity shown to me as I walk this path.\u003cbr\u003e"
