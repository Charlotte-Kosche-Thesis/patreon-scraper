    "summary": "Hey guys, RavenCyarm here. I\u0027ve been a Youtube content creator for almost 7 years now and I\u0027ve had a blast entertaining you people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create satirical and humorous videos based off of professional wrestling, (most notably WWE) as well as mixing and mashing together entrance music and other popular music... an avenue that I\u0027ve had enough success in, that with the help of my fans, I landed a contract with WWE, where I created several pieces of content for their Youtube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I was honored to be a content creator for WWE\u0027s Youtube channel... the restrictions and pressure I felt caused me to not particularly enjoy creating the content I did... so I opted not to resign when my contract was up. This is one of the reasons I\u0027m starting a Patreon... you can support me as I entertain you, and I\u0027ll have all the freedom in the world when creating your content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, before you start hopping on the \"RAVENCYARM IS GONNA RIP PEOPLE OFF AND RESTRICT CONTENT\" bandwagon... this couldn\u0027t be further than the truth. Non-subscribers to the Patreon will not notice any difference in the amount of content I upload to the channel. Patreon will allow people who enjoy my work and want to support me to receive bonuses... such as early access to my content... as well as things that other super fans would enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support me, then I can\u0027t thank you enough. It\u0027s fans like you that make me enjoy what I do.\u003cbr\u003e"
