    "summary": "At the start of the very first episode of Reality Bomb, we gave our mission statement: \u201cOnce a month, more or less, we hope to take you around the world of Doctor Who\u00a0fandom\u2014to connect you with the interesting debates, share some news and just make jokes about serial codes and David Tennant\u2019s ties because we\u2019re the only people who get such things.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe did this because Doctor Who fandom is one of the smartest, one of the funniest, the most creative and one of quirkiest groups of people on earth. Doing a show about them is frankly perfect radio: articulate, intelligent and funny. Often at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s what we\u0027ve been doing with Reality Bomb for five years. Trying to do a full on, magazine style radio show (using a podcast method of delivery) to capture the incredible thought and creativity of Doctor Who fans. We hope we\u0027ve been innovative in that, delivering a program that includes interviews, audio essays, documentaries, comedy sketches, spoken word editorials, songs and much, much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReality Bomb will always be a free podcast. We do this for the love of Doctor Who and we like making radio.\u00a0We see this as a \"tip jar\" that will cover our basic expenses and allow us to buy new audio gadgetry. We\u0027re not going to provide upper tier rewards or anything like that. If you like what we\u0027re doing and can afford it, kick in a little bit every month to ensure we can provide the best possible podcast you\u0027ll hear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much!\u003cbr\u003e-- Graeme Burk and Joy Piedmont, producers of Reality Bomb\u003cbr\u003e"
