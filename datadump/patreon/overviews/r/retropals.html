    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi friends!\u003c/strong\u003e We are Retro Pals (Danny and Alex), and we produce the online documentary series\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_VYQ064I5W70FDJ02eMTqk-MZP7e_w2y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlayStation Year One\u003c/a\u003e. It covers the first wave of PS1 games released in the mid-1990s. If you want a sample, our first full-length episode is up at the top of this page. Check it out!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInspired by chronogaming projects like Dr. Sparkle\u0027s \n\u003ca href=\"http://chrontendo.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eChrontendo\u003c/a\u003e and Jeremy Parish\u0027s \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamespite?ty=h\"\u003eGame Boy World\u003c/a\u003e, PlayStation Year One examines every single game released for the Sony PlayStation during its first year on store shelves. Note that our videos are \u003cstrong\u003enot traditional reviews.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Instead, we focus on what makes our subjects interesting or important, from a historical perspective. We\u0027re nerds, so we love researching this stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe 32-bit era was a critical point for video gaming. It saw many developers creating 3D worlds for the first time, and it introduced many franchises that are still going strong today. With your help, we can explore its groundbreaking successes and hilarious failures. It\u0027ll be a ton of fun!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs fans of gaming history, we enjoy making PlayStation Year One, and we think it\u0027s vitally important that we continue. As freelance writers with limited resources, however, we need your support. Basically: \u003cstrong\u003eyour pledges allow us to make more episodes and release them sooner.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWe also seek funding for console hardware, capture equipment, and other purchases we can\u0027t otherwise afford. We\u0027ve outlined our plans for future purchases and expansions in the milestones you see on this page\u0027s sidebar. With your help, we can make PlayStation Year One the best it can be, and your continued support can bring additional documentary projects to life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eFirst off, you get long-lasting comfort in the knowledge that you\u0027re supporting the arts. Unfortunately, we\u0027re not PBS, so we can\u0027t offer you a Retro Pals promotional tote bag in return. Maybe someday! In the meantime, you might think of Patreon as a \"tip jar\" that you can use to let us know you like our stuff and that you want to see more of it. You can set a maximum amount to contribute every month, and you can lower or cancel your pledge at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe also offer Patreon-exclusive perks! By pledging $1 or more every month, you get \n\u003cstrong\u003eaccess to new PlayStation Year One episodes a week or more before they\u0027re available to the public\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, for every month you pledge $5 or more, you get to \n\u003cstrong\u003evote on which games and platforms we feature during our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/retropals\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eweekly Twitch streams\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e We love weird games, and our streams feature obscure and under-the-radar stuff from the 8-bit era and beyond, powered by original console hardware.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for reading, and thanks for helping us make cool stuff!"
