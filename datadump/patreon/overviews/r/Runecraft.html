    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eRunecraft \u003c/strong\u003eis a gameplay modification for SMP, that adds magic to the game without any commands. Runecraft is the longest running Minecraft mod, dating back to the Alpha days. Runecraft boasts over 100 runes and is still under active development. Everything you need in one, immersive, magic plugin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunecraft has been worked on by a number of different people: The current team:\u003cbr\u003eCreator: SuperLlama\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Project Lead: RivkiinShadows\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Lead Developer: lvletei\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Developers: Amuxix\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Developing Developers: jaton101, Kosyne, Lord Marshall Phoenyx, nate_Crafter, uhex, Viatorem\u003cbr\u003ePrevious Developers and Current Consults: C\u0027tri, Zeerix, Der_niabs, Fayettemat, Josiah42\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do donate...thank you. You don\u0027t have to and we\u0027re not really sure what to give. If you have ideas, let us know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome stuff that has already been discussed:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly releases! - We have an open Official Runecraft Server and we pretty much give early releases to you guys on our Discord server. So this isn\u0027t really an option.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdded to the debug list! - While we can do this, the Runecraft debug is very much revealing, it can tell you locations of bases and such and we as DEV\u0027s do our best not to take advantage of that when we are on PVP servers. As well as that, as an OP you already have access to that. In the future the server admins will be able to add people manually to the debug list without them having to be OP.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnique Runes! - All our Runes are unique and we take a look at all suggestions. In the future, you guys will even be able to make your own Runes, so not really an option.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon Rune Poll! - This was an idea from Kosyne. We could do a poll that only patreons can see. In this case, you guys decide what Runes we do next, but here\u0027s the thing, we plan on doing every Rune we can anyway. There\u0027s no push to have certain Runes out first. We kinda take public opinion.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCosmetics! - We\u0027re currently rewriting the Runecraft code, from scratch. What does this mean? It does mean that we will have a Forge version. In this version, we could give those who donate here a cosmetic item, like a hat, an aura, something like that.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBehind the Scenes Look! - This was an idea Rivkiin had because of this site. If you were to donate an amount, you would be added to a special group on Discord that would allow you to see the DEV-chat. This would mean that you could watch as we make new Runes. You could comment on what we\u0027re doing and such as well.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGlowstick! - As I was confirming this whole thing was good with lvletei, he came up with an idea. Already instated, Glowstick will give DEV\u0027s the gold color when activated, and Initiated players will be purple. We plan on a new system in the future that will play off of this, but you patreons will gain a special Patreon Color!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAgain, thank you if you do donate. It means a lot even if we can\u0027t really show it properly. You guys are what makes Runecraft what it is. We just code it. You downloading it is what keeps us doing what we do. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALSO: Any amount that you guys donate, recurring or not, will be added up. So if you donate $3, 5 months in a row, you would get a $15 reward. This is on our side rather than Patreons."
