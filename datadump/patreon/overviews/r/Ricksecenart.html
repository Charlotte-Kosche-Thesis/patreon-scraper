It culminated in high school when I became the President of the Art Club, with a constituency of two other students if I remember right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the Savannah College of Art and Design, I did what all higher education students do.. heavy doses of experimentation!\u00a0 Sculpture, industrial design, illustration, film-making, sound design, music recording, scriptwriting... I was all-consuming. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThirteen years in NYC has enriched my worldview by it\u0027s multi-ethnic community and rich history, and for me has been the city where creative inspiration never sleeps.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe things we love as children never seem to leave us, even after we\u0027ve gone so far.\u00a0\u00a0So, one day, I dusted off the ole brush and starting putting this city to canvas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe time-lapses that I will be posting to this site are a way to capture the process and also a way to convey philosophical and symbolic concepts that help define my work.\u00a0 Each painting I create begins with a concept, is enriched by the influence of past masters, and is then built with personal methods which I would love to share with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn artist is always reaching to become better.  Always reaching to see the world through many lights and sounds and flavors. Without regard to success, artists are always reaching to attain those near impossible moments when their creation seems to defy what is possible by an ordinary human hand.\u00a0 I promise to be hard at work reaching for those heights, and I\u0027d love for you to join along as I complete new pieces and post the journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin my free monthly newsletter for every new painting and it\u0027s time-lapse.\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://www.ricksecen.com\"\u003ewww.ricksecen.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you truly for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/P1Lg1ml.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
