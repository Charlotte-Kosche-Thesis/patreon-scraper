    "summary": "River Dain Kanoff was born in Washington D.C. on June 11, 1989, to Ronald and Georgina Kanoff. A Navy brat, their family moved frequently. They\u0027ve lived in DC, Virginia, Guam, and Oklahoma, though when asked where he\u0027s from, River will usually just say \"from all over.\" He is currently living in Santa Ana, CA, and soon, Los Angeles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe graduated June 2007 and enrolled at Oklahoma City Community College soon after, and is pursuing a degree in the Theatre Arts. He has transferred to Riverside Community College and hopes to finish his schooling while pursuing his career. He has obtained his A+ and MCDST Certifications in a Network Technology course at Francis-Tuttle Technology Center. He has made the decision not to pursue a career in Network Technology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike most everyone, from a young age, River set out to discover his talents and try to decide on what he would grow up to do for a living. Starting from interests such as scientists, detectives and spies, he began to move from hobby to talent, discovering his ability to play drums, alongside his love for music. This eventually sparked a small talent for songwriting, which he uses now and then for freelance film composing, and often just for something to listen to. He is currently working freelance, playing drums, guitars, or providing vocals where needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLate 2006, River took an interest in voice acting, following the works of certain voice actors, such as David Hayter and Quinton Flynn, and studying to find out how he himself could make an entrance into the world of voice acting. After a few months, he found the Voice Acting Alliance forums, and immediately began trying out for various roles. He has since been acclaimed for being prompt with recording roles, having achieved his own distinction as a voice type, and is frequently preferred by various producers when a male role is urgently needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe currently heads a small but growing group of talented voices, writers and artists called \"solidStudios.\""
