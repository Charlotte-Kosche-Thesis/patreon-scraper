I mostly like to illustrate through digital mediums, but I explore multiple other areas of interest, Naturally I use traditional mediums as well with my art, I like to make cosplay (model in said cosplays) , and I LOOOOVE videogames and streaming them for whoever likes that kinda thing. My goal for creating this patreon page is to share what I love doing best, to be part of the community, to grow and to share techniques, criticisms, or just friendly words.\u00a0I would also really like to make this into my career!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Most of my life I have been studying art and how to personally get better at it, even went to school for it as a major, but y\u0027know, Artists aren\u0027t taken all that seriously in this capitalists society, We have to forge alternative paths. With that said, I could really use the help but I dont want handouts, I want to work for it and give back! I\u0027m not in the most ideal of living situations, and admittedly it\u0027s been a tough life, and my main skills pretty much revolve around drawing, being creative and entertaining. A single dollar from you to my patreon would go such a long way and I can assure you that the content you would receive will be well worth more than $12 a year, and that would enable me to do so much more for both myself and for my patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Also! I like to push myself, So what you see now will very likely be improved upon in pretty much any time span after your initial viewing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon."
