If you know me already then you know that I wear a lot of hats. A lot of hats! I try not to put more than two or three on at a time, looks silly anyways. With my Patreon I am hoping to share more of what some of those hats have to do with my life. One of those hats being my Writer\u0027s Hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a little of this and a little of that. My primary focuses are on magical realism in multiple genres and non-fiction. I\u0027ve been published in a couple of non-fiction anthologies and I am releasing my first novella on April Fools\u0027 Day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here? I want to be able to share with my audience, my fans, and my supporters more of my writing. Through Patreon my Patrons will get access to exclusives like early releases, short stories, articles, and essays that may or may not be released to the public. A unique way for you to get into the mind of this crazy writer who is doing more projects than he probably should.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write because I enjoy it. I enjoy telling stories and sharing them with others. It certainly easier to do when I am not worried about where every penny I have is going. Through the help of Patrons I can focus more on my writing and get more done. So I guess you could say, I write for me and for YOU!"
