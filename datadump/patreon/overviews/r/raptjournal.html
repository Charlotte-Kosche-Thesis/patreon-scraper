    "summary": "Hi I\u2019m Mark, and I write adventure and wilderness stories.\u003cbr\u003e\nHi, I\u2019m Mark, and I\u2019m a landscape, wildlife, and nature photographer.\u003cbr\u003e\nHi I\u2019m Mark, and I\u2019m a graphic designer and illustrator.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nActually, I\u2019m Mark Calcagni, and I do all those things and I put them together in an online magazine called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.raptjournal.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRapt Journal\u003c/a\u003e.  Rapt Journal is dedicated to the idea of place, the interaction between people and the natural world, with maybe just a bit of science thrown in for spice. Not  place in the sense of locations to be checked off some top ten list, or as places to show off the coolest gear, but rather as places in which one can sit still and be inspired. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn order to to do this I\u2019m going to need help. That\u2019s where you, my patrons, come into the game.  Don\u2019t worry.  I\u2019m not going to stick all those pretty pictures and awesome stories behind a paywall.  The idea is for Rapt Journal to be, and remain, free to view.  I\u2019d also like to keep advertisements off the site.  When was the last time you nestled in with a good short story and suddenly had someone show up in your living room, flashing lights in your face, and asking you to buy things?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy supporting me on Patreon, you can guarantee that Rapt Journal remains ad free.  You may ask, \u201dBut Mark, why should I support you if I can get the cool stories and pretty pictures for free?\u201d  Well, the obvious answer is that if you don\u2019t,  Rapt Journal will cease to be or advertisements will start cluttering up the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s the stick, now here\u2019s the carrot.  Cool stuff.  In addition to the warm fuzzies you get from being a patron of the arts, you\u2019ll also have access to my Patreon feed where you can tell me exactly how much you love my stuff, or perhaps give me ideas on how to make my stuff better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ll also have access to exclusive content, such as photo and illustration wallpapers for your computer (or your phone or whatever crazy device you whippersnappers are using today, nagdabbit), work-in-progress sketches,  videos shot from various story locations, early access to stories before anyone else, prints, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose exactly how much you give each month, and if you\u0027re worried about overspending, you can cap the total amount given!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to write, take photographs, design, and illustrate four short stories every two months to start. Considering I\u0027ve got to go on trips to get content for the stories, that\u0027s actually a pretty quick turnaround.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for reading and I hope to see you somewhere in the woods.  Not in a scary way, you know what I mean\u2026\u003cbr\u003e"
