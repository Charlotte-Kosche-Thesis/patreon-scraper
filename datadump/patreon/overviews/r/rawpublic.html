Thanks for viewing \nour Patreon project!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the last year of my nutrition degree I launched a raw food blog with the mission to share\n my knowledge of preparing healthy, whole, plant-based foods. It was the perfect way for me to showcase my\n passion for both nutrition and cooking. It quickly became known to me that I wanted to make it into my life\u0027s work - helping people incorporate more plant foods into their diet and take their health into their own hands. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of years later I met Todd at a superfoods party and we bonded over a love for raw foods! Todd quickly fell as much in love with raw foods as myself and it has since been our goal to inspire others to give plant foods a go and choose a healthier diet and lifestyle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have stocked cafes, catered for various events, set up shop at Farmers Markets and shared our love for raw foods and plant based whole foods online for some time now. After a few set backs last year we are now ready to expand our services and offerings\n with a Rawpublic food van.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA food van is the next best step for us and the best way for Rawpublic to \nexpand and to serve the greater Perth-area with healthy, vegan cuisine!  Each time we have served our food at a catering gig or special event we are asked where our restaurant is \nlocated, or where else our food can be found.  The community have spoken and\n healthy vegan eats are what they want and enjoy! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\n\nIn order to bring this delicious dream to life and spread healthy vegan eats throughout Perth, we need your help to get out food van on the road and up and running!  We have already \npurchased our caravan (currently named Yoshi) and gutted it, but it\u0027s still a blank canvas. Here\u2019s a short list of just some \nof the things your pledge will help with: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022\tKitchen equipment inside the food van including under bench fridges, \na freezer, and sinks etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022\tThe fit out of the van, including a \ngenerator, plumbing and electrical work, flooring and paint job, to make our van look as good as our food.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Additional equipment such as blenders, food storage \ncontainers and packaging. \u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Registration fees and permits required for our vehicle to service multiple areas of Perth (and hopefully additional locations around Australia) and to meet all the codes and pass required inspections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Yoshi out on the roads we can reach more people with our food and spread a positive, healthy, vegan message to people throughout Perth and right across Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have rewards to give away for your gracious donations. Check them out on the right hand side of the page.\u003cbr\u003eThe t-shirt options we have are on our website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.rawpublic.com.au\"\u003ewww.rawpublic.com.au\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eJust head to the store and then let us know via email or message on social media which shirt you would like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1174.photobucket.com/albums/r606/ToddBudden/Patreon%20Rewards%20shirts_zpshppjt3oj.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pledges we receive will go towards the van until we reach our goal.\u003cbr\u003eFrom then on any pledges will go towards the running of the van as well as recipe development for eBooks, better quality content on our YouTube channel, better equipment for videos and images, designs for our T-Shirts and other ways we can help show people how easy it is to live a vegan lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
