    "summary": "For many years, I\u0027ve been keeping my passion suppressed and muted in order to pursue steady income and a semblance of a \"normal\" life. When I decided to take that \"safe path,\" I inevitably had to give up my love of photography and videography, due to the suggestive nature of my content. But with your help, and with the partnership you and I build, that can all change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work a desk job for a large organization. For almost a decade, my public-facing corporate life has always been at risk of being tarnished by a co-worker discovering my photoshoots and sending them around the office. I\u0027ve always had to hide this hobby from the public eye, knowing the kind of negative reaction that typically comes with this artform. But I\u0027m done hiding. I\u0027m done sacrificing. And I no longer want want to be in the position where I cannot be myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have never been more motivated and passionate about pursuing this art form than I am now - thanks to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider becoming a patron of my photoshoot adventures!\u00a0Photoshoots cost money! Some of the costs include: makeup artists, lighting rentals, location rental, camera gear purchases, travel costs, food (have to feed the models haha), model payment, gas, and ultimately, the time and effort for editing the videos on Premeire and photoshopping images - all on top of planning and coordinating the entire gig. Doing this all by myself while juggling a full-time job is very tough, so every patron is truly appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI call them photoshoots even though I will be mostly doing video because \"videoshoots\" is not a common term. However, I still will be taking photos, but these will be given exclusively to patrons and no one else. The videos that I produce will document the journey and process of working with a model, and will include all the shenanigans that happen along the way - Every shoot is different and every model and location holds surprises and adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, my goal is to pursue this full time and share beautiful and fun content with all my patrons. To my knowledge, this will be the world\u0027s first YouTube and Patreon vlog that follows a photographer along each photoshoot in an unscripted vlog-style format. Let\u0027s be part of something new a cool together and carve out a new path. I want my patrons to be active and involved in this journey. I will have exclusive photos and patron-only videos that nobody else will get to see. I want your active feedback on your prefered styles and maybe even model selection! Some model shoots will be made exclusively for patrons and I\u0027m even considering allowing patrons to come down to watch the shoots and join in the fun, if i\u0027m in your town.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s have some fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Rolls\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/roleychiu\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/roleychiu\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/roleychiu\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/roleychiu\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eModelMayhem:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.modelmayhem.com/rolls\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.modelmayhem.com/rolls\u003c/a\u003e (gallery)\u003cbr\u003eDeviantArt: \u003ca href=\"http://roleychiu.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://roleychiu.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLooking for Models:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0If you live in Vancouver or Victoria and would like a free videoshoot, message me on Facebook or ModelMayhem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin the Photoshoot Vlog Project:\u003c/strong\u003e If you would like to help grow this silly project, message me on Facebook and we can discuss how we can collaborate!\u003cbr\u003e"
