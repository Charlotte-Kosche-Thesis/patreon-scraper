     "about": "I started my career in tech, at first, as a graphics specialist and systems administrator on Capitol Hill and, later, a small government agency tasked with overseeing the S\u0026amp;L cleanup. After my stint as a systems administrator for a member of Congress, I moved back and forth between graphic design and systems administration until I was offered an opportunity to edit a technical book. It was then that I moved on to writing and editing. I have a degree in political science.\u003cbr\u003eI suspended my career as a writer and technical editor of computer how-to \u003ca href=\"http://www.rimaregas.com/books-i-revised-or-tech-edited/\"\u003ebooks\u003c/a\u003e twelve years ago to homeschool my daughter.  My job as her teacher is now done. My daughter is now seventeen and in her junior year as a Fine Arts major at one of the Cal State universities.\u003cbr\u003eMy interests have always included political science, philosophy (social ethics), and economics, though, thanks to a certain columnist I follow, I am finding that my true passion is social justice.  I am tri-lingual in English, French, and Hebrew.\u003cbr\u003eI post comments almost daily in the opinion section of The New York Times. My daily challenge is to give myself five minutes or less to write each comment.\u003cbr\u003eI am a huge fan of Jazz (Be-bop and Afro-Cuban).\u003cbr\u003eI live in Southern California with my family.\u003cbr\u003e",
