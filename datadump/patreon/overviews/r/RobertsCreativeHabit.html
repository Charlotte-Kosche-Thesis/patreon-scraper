First and foremost I\u0027m devoted to learning new creative skills via my Year of Creative Habits projects, where I create every day for 365 days in a row, and share each day with the world. I\u0027ve successfully completed two of these projects; One for digital artwork in 2014-15, and most recently one for photography in 2017! Pretty sure I\u0027ll start another for 2019.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create all kinds of artwork almost every single day. Last year I focused on learning Photography to learn how to set up a beautiful scene, and a year before that I was focused on making web comics, and currently I\u0027m doing both of those things, plus watercolor painting! I like designing characters, abstract art, and discovering new styles, techniques, and mediums. My ultimate goal is to effectively tell stories via my artwork!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003eWhy do I need patrons?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eThis is how I spend all my time. It\u0027s what I do, and it\u0027s what makes me, ME. I\u0027ve always had this desire to create and doing it full-time isn\u0027t easy. Patreon allows fans to help support what they love, and my ultimate life goal is to do this worry free. Rent, food, supplies, and leisure. Making art, telling stories, and sharing what I\u0027ve learned is how I want to spend the rest of my days, worry free. Stress free. Every single dollar helps me achieve this goal! If you enjoy what I make, and have stuck around long enough to believe in what I\u0027m trying to achieve, please think about supporting me here \u0026lt;3\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
