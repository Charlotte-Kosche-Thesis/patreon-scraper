It is printed on newsprint-grade paper, and mailed direct to subscribers without an envelope via media mail. This is as much an art project as a magazine. Retro Future was imagined by our Editor-in-Chief John Carimando, and we will do our best to follow his vision for the magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRetro Future is a completely analog publication. We will not be creating a digital version of the magazine, it will only be available via subscription through this page, or directly from Galileo Books at the conventions we attend. We will print a run based on our current subscriber base each quarter. We\u0027re starting with 1000 copies, and will scale up if the number of subscribers creates the need. There will never be reprints of the magazine, and it will not be available through retail as currently conceived.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRetro Future pays above SFWA minimum rates, and we accept unsolicited submissions. You can find out more on our submission page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.galileogames.com/retro-future/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.galileogames.com/retro-future/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eRetro Future Issue #1 cover art by Jon Deloca."
