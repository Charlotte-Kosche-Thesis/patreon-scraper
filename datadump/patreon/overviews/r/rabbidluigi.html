This page is here so you can have a more direct line of support for my channel. My goal at the moment is to move to Canada but I may have some other ideas if we reach that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards will be paid out to Patrons either weekly, monthly or on a one time basis (with the t-shirts) and only \u003cstrong\u003eafter \u003c/strong\u003epayment has been processed for that month to avoid any scammers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny of the extra content that I produce for Patrons will \u003cstrong\u003enot \u003c/strong\u003eaffect my schedule on YouTube. I\u0027ve deliberately chosen perks that don\u0027t require too much effort on my part so they don\u0027t become too much of a distraction from the main content. If you have any suggestions or would like to leave feedback about my Patreon page, feel free to private message me on this site or email me at rabbidluigiyt@gmail.com"
