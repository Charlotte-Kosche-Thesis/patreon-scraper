By doing KM better, organisations perform better, creating better outcomes for customers, clients, employees, managers, and shareholders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit over two and a half years ago, \u003ca href=\"http://realkm.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRealKM Magazine\u003c/a\u003e was founded with the aim of publishing practically-oriented articles to help managers and KM practitioners connect with the latest research and insights in KM and related disciplines such as communications, marketing, psychology, biology, sociology, and management research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that time, we\u0027ve struck a real chord! We\u0027ve published over 700 articles, our monthly readership has grown to 5,000 and is still climbing, and our \u003ca href=\"http://realkm.com/2016/02/03/components-of-a-knowledge-management-system/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emost popular article\u003c/a\u003e has now been viewed more than 12,000 times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also just published the first release of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://realkm.com/2018/01/05/release-of-realkm-open-km-syllabus/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRealKM Open KM Syllabus\u003c/a\u003e, an attempt to systematically describe\u00a0the themes and topics required for a fully-rounded education in knowledge management theory and practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, our goal is to \u003cstrong\u003eadvance the discipline of knowledge management\u003c/strong\u003e. And we would like your help to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JvoLaM_PZWQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to from here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealKM Magazine\u0027s success has been made possible by the generous sponsorship of founder and publisher \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-bounds-9211b52/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStephen Bounds\u003c/a\u003e through his consulting company, and many hours of work by editor and lead writer \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruceboyes/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBruce Boyes\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealKM Magazine is helping a lot of people, and we want this to keep happening for a long time. But relying on Stephen\u0027s financial support alone isn\u0027t sustainable in the long-term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need to broaden our financial support base, and ideally become self-sustaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t want to run ads because they\u0027re just going to annoy you, our readers, and ads that market who-knows-what will just detract from our commitment to providing evidence-based information. We also don\u0027t want to charge fees for access to articles because that would fly in the face of our commitment to open access information (too much high-quality information is being hidden away behind paywalls, denying the public the evidence it needs to make the best decisions). We do have a store, but KM is unfortunately not the sort of thing that lends itself well to saleable products, meaning we only earn a little through store sales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Patreon is perfect for our situation. Our readers and supporters have the opportunity to become our patrons, donating whatever they would like on a recurring monthly basis, from just $1/month upwards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming our patron, you can make a significant contribution to KM, and to the many customers, clients, employees, managers, and shareholders who benefit from improved KM.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow we\u0027ll use the money\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur \"run\" goal is to raise $1500/month. This will cover our website hosting and e-newsletter cost, and keep Bruce going as our part-time editor and lead writer. We\u0027ll also expand our content to produce a short video on a KM topic every month, as voted by patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur \"sprint\" goal is to raise $3000/month. This will take us to the next level of being able to increase Bruce\u0027s hours, as well as commission other writers and content producers. This will mean more articles, including more in-depth feature articles, and more video content. We\u0027ll also plan and execute a simple KM experiment each quarter and publish the results on the RealKM Magazine website. Patrons will be able to choose from a shortlist of possible research topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou, our prized readers and supporters, have made RealKM Magazine the success that it is today. Thank you for making this possible, and for hopefully joining us as a patron as we continue RealKM Magazine\u0027s journey into the future!\u003cbr\u003e"
