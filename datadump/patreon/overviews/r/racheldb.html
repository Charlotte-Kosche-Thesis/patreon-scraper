In July/August 2017, at Penland School of Arts and Crafts, I learned how to screen print my original designs onto fabric yardage. Life will never be the same!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create fabric yardage with my original illustrations meant to surface delight, whimsy, and intrigue as things are not always unicorns + rainbows. Some of this fabric is turned into functional goods via my line of canvas rolls and pouches (Bundle and Stow). Other parts of my days are spent at the Dayton Sewing Collaborative, and freelancing graphic design skillz.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately I would like to build a member-supported fabric printing studio where artists and designers work collaboratively to realize each others\u0027 visions while working toward the common goal of building-up a flourishing textile and fabric industry in Dayton, Ohio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my patron, you will receive access to my patron-only feed of monthly printables, creative inspiration, and behind-the-scenes nuggets of delight and realness. You\u0027ll see a fabric printing studio come to life from the very beginning as I make my way into the world of pattern design and fabric printing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, your pledge is without obligation, you can cancel, downgrade or upgrade your pledge amount at any time.\u003cbr\u003e"
