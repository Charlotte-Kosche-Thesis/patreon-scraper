Cartoonist, Illustrator,\u00a0EMT and dispatcher.\u00a0I am a steadfast warrior against the encrouching blahness of adulthood and maturity, and I\u0027ve been drawing in some form since middle school. Only when trapped in a security check point for\u00a0ten hours a day\u00a0did I\u00a0start seriously producing fuzzy art and comics, and I\u0027ve been at it\u00a0for about the past eight years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I Do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might know me as the artist of the webcomics \u0027E.A.R.S.\u0027 (The Emergency Animal Rescue Service) and the \u0027babies making football commentary\u0027 strip The Timeout Report!! Or you might totally not! It\u0027s all good. My fervent goal is to continue being able to inspire and delight folks with my stories, and your support will help keep me on track and continuing to draw. Through Patreon, I really want to make EARS a more regularly updated affair, as well as explore a few of my stories in longform comic form (like The Sun is In Your Eyes, seen above.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Using Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, I\u0027m using this to connect. I want to be able to grow and interact with my supporters, even if all you can give is a pat on the back and a thumbs up. That alone tells me I\u0027m not wasting my time on doodles. If the support gets high enough, I can pull a bit away from the smaller commissions that, while I very much enjoy doing them, isn\u0027t quite indicative of what I can REALLY do. I am an entertainer first and foremost, and\u00a0the fact that you all enjoy the things I put out is\u00a0an\u00a0awesome feeling.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
