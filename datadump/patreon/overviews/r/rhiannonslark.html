Purchasing professional studio headphones will allow me to improve the audio quality of all future videos. Monitoring headphones are designed so that the sound engineer (me, for all current videos) can hear the music accurately, leading to better balance of different instruments, vocal harmonies, and effects.",

When I reach this goal, I will purchase a digital camcorder that will provide the following features: increased capacity, (ability to film for longer periods of time and store more footage before beginning the editing process), better low-light performance, (I often use halogen work lights with the current camera to get a clean image!), direct audio input, (using a high quality microphone connected to the camera to record audio and video simultaneously, rather than having a separate audio recording set-up as I do now), and high definition to keep up with the constantly increasing quality of online videos.",
