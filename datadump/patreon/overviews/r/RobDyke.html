The Twilight Zone? My show Seriously Strange may be just the thing you need. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been creating one-of-a-kind content on YouTube for nearly five years. I am one of the only creators on the platform who combines comedy and true crime/horror content on one channel, but for some crazy reason, it works. I have shows if you want a laugh and shows if you want a scare. Either way, you\u0027ll be entertained.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth be told, it takes a ton of work to do what I do. I have a team of around 20 people working for me to help bring TV quality content to the internet for free. Simply watching my videos is so heavily appreciated and those who go the extra mile to become direct supporters through Patreon -- well, I can\u0027t even express what that means. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have no idea how honored I would be if you would join me on this humorous and haunting journey. Become a patron and check out the awesome rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT\u00a0\u25ba\u25ba\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The type of content I make is generally targeted by YouTube as \"non-advertiser friendly\", making it harder for me to create the content you enjoy. When YouTube does this, they prevent my content from making money, hurting my entire production and everything that I do. And given the current climate on YouTube with brands, this is only getting worse. A lot of my money goes into business expenses for my productions and without these things and my people (writers, artists, editors, etc) that help make this happen, it\u0027s just not at all possible to do how I do it now. So again, your support is incredibly helpful -- no matter what it is. You are the only part of this journey that has always been reliable and I value that above and beyond. Simply considering even giving $1 a month is very much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Rob\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I owe you so much and I\u0027ll do my best to create the content you love. I\u0027ll work hard for this. I promise you. Thank you. So much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis next goal is a lofty one, as well, but will cover many additional life and work expenses (the first goal only ensured monthly video costs). However, a majority of these funds will go towards expanding further into two things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) An actual scripted web series on my channel where I will play an actor. I already have a production team lined up for this, and having these additional funds will allow me to dedicate a lot more time, effort, and resources to it. I can explain more as time goes on and level rewards will be adjusted to include even more benefits in regards to this series, such as exclusive items.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) A horror-based video game. I\u0027ve spoken with a few game developers. I\u0027m looking to create a one-of-a-kind horror game that will cast a giant shadow over the internet -- a game that will take a new look at horror. Like with the series, level rewards will be adjusted to include exclusive benefits as we grow closer to this goal and things begin to take form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDISCLAIMER: If we can reach this goal, we will truly be moving towards revolutionizing content online. So much more than just YouTube videos. IF YouTube begins to return to some normal state and money comes back in, I will make all patrons aware of that so you can decide if you\u0027d like to continue to pledge. I will never pretend I\u0027m in need if I\u0027m not. Ever. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
