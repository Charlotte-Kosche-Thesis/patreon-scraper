    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eWant to skip the intro and get to the \u003cstrong\u003eFREE\u003c/strong\u003e rules, characters, and adventure? \u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com/product/230338/Gnosis-FREE-PREVIEW\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick here\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhE8N1BV_u0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a writer, a gamer, and an artist. I\u0027m also an educator and, most importantly, a husband and father. Gaming was a big part of my wife\u0027s and my life for a long time, but with (ugh) adult responsibilities, that\u0027s fallen by the wayside.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich is why I want to give other gamers a system that is fun, quick, and can be played in a very short amount of time.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat makes the\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eGnosis Core System\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0different from every other game system out there?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1) It\u0027s \u00a0been designed from the ground up to be easy for novices and veterans alike to learn. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2) A class-less character system allows for maximum flexibility and customization. Characters are simpler and more streamlined than other d20-based systems, but this doesn\u0027t mean they don\u0027t have options. Want to play a half-Gray librarian with magical training? Okay. A former cultists now working for the government? Sure. A faerie computer hacker fighting against corporations? Why not?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3) The Gnosis combat system is highly dangerous for both players and NPCs. It\u0027s designed to simulate a survival horror game. A lucky shot can kill you. Good planning can save your life. Even at high levels, a punk with a gun might kill you if he gets the drop on you. Combat is tense again!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4) Best of all, I\u0027m going to throw in everything you need to run a horror campaign (the best kind). That includes supplements with new monsters, magic, and character options. You\u0027ll be able to run games in a world where vast conspiracies watch your every move. Nameless cults try to summon alien horrors. The boogeyman really does live under your bed. And you and your teammates might be the only thing standing between madness and Sanity.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am very proud to share my experience as a game master and game designer to the Patreon community, and I hope you\u0027ll join me on this ride as we play \n\u003cem\u003eGnosis\u003c/em\u003e and bring gaming back to parents, professionals, students, and anyone else who has given up gaming due to time limitations. Dust off those dice and let\u0027s get to work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s how it works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSTEP 1) Create a Patreon account. It takes minutes.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSTEP 2) Decide which level of access you\u0027ll want. Every level has access to the Core Rules and everything you need to play, but higher tiers get access to more goodies, supplements, art, Q\u0026amp;A sessions, and pretty much whatever else I put out that month.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSTEP 3) Enjoy the game and become a part of the \n\u003cem\u003eGnosis\u003c/em\u003e community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBUT...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re unsure whether you want to commit on just this pitch, why not head over to RPGNow and download the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com/product/230338/Gnosis-FREE-PREVIEW\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFREE PREVIEW\u003c/a\u003e bundle?
