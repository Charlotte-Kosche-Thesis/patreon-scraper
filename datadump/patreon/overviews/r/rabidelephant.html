    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHello all!  My name is Philip Mease and I am a musician and engineer that has completely ditched normalcy in the hopes that I can give the world something special. I\u0027ve sold nearly everything I own, resigned from a stable, well-paying job in order to make this happen.... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRabid Elephant was born!\u00a0 Our goal is to make special instruments for artists to create with all the while making art of various forms of our own.  In doing so we uncovered very honest and \u0027lite\u0027 ways to live.\u00a0 In this state, we can create things that are much more connected to our personalities and that aren\u0027t driven by dishonest external influencers.\u00a0 Rabid Elephant will grow to provide alls sorts of outlets based on this liteness.\u00a0 So this is what RE is all about... Liteness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page was created because our particular explorations do indeed require funding and while much of that comes from the sale of widgets (things like instruments) or music, it does have some very binary limitations on how fast we can grow and share.  I also feel that what we are doing is truly something special.  To design the way I do is absolutely not commercially viable in the typical for-profit business sense because the amount of time going into even a single product is immense.  I hope that those with means can help me continue to do more and keep it going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to be perfectly clear, here is exactly what donating to Rabid Elephant and being a patron for us will do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccelerate the release of a rather large backlog of great modules that are already designed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIncrease the amount of modules I can produce on each production run (the modules I make sell out near-instantly and I\u0027m struggling - without taking on evil debts - to make enough!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProvide me with additional security to take more creative risks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake us extremely happy to know that there are folks that are willing to support our cause, our philosophies, and quite simply \u0027us.\u0027\u00a0 This support directly affects our emotional state in such a positive way - it keeps our design much more positive and honest, which is the only way we can make something truly spectacular.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAllow us to publish and maintain more open community documentation on lots of the behind the scenes information we have in regards to how we design and why.  This information could help other designers and potentially even inspire others to take some concepts we have developed even further that we could have!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGive us freedom for all types of output all centric around our liteness philosophy as well as to further refine these ideas.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eSo that\u0027s it for now.  I will be working on the Patreon page and adding more content as time moves forward.  I am also thinking about what sorts of donation tiers and rewards should be set up to make patrons - you! - feel more comfortable and more involved with what we are doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much!\u00a0 With love,\u003cbr\u003ePhil \u0026amp; co!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
