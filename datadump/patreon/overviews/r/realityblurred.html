    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHey. I\u0027m Andy. 17 years ago, I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereality blurred\u003c/a\u003e as a labor of love: it was a way for me to track and share links I found about my favorite television genre, reality TV.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJust as reality TV has changed since those early seasons of \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Real World\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0that we used to watch in weekend marathons,\u00a0\u003cem\u003ereality blurred\u003c/em\u003e changed, too. Instead of just links and snarky comments, I started publishing original news and reporting; interviews with reality stars and producers; and reviews to help you decide what to watch. I love discussing reality TV with people, whether they agree with my take or not. (The snark never went away.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m incredibly grateful to be writing\u2014and earning money from my writing. It\u0027s not free to publish a web site, and ads do cover basic expenses right now. I also travel to set locations, when I have the opportunity, and go to L.A. twice a year to bring you even behind-the-scenes stories. (The picture above is the set of Survivor Gabon; I paid my own way, including a $3,067.10 plane ticket, in order to bring you pre-season interviews, analysis, and details about production that no one else reported.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I also teach, which I absolutely love, though the truth is that if I didn\u0027t, I wouldn\u0027t have necessary things like health insurance. While ads and surveys generate money, the experience of online ads has gotten worse while the revenue they generate has gone way down.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, I need your help. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s why\u00a0I\u0027m asking \n\u003cem\u003ereality blurred\u003c/em\u003e\u0027s most loyal readers\u2014who include everyone from reality TV fans to journalists, network executives to producers\u2014to chip in whatever you can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI understand that for many people, contributing isn\u0027t an option. That\u0027s okay! The site will remain free and open for as long as I can produce it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can join me and your fellow readers to become a patron, you\u0027ll be rewarded with the perks listed, but also with knowing that you\u0027re supporting an independent writer and journalist. And I\u0027ll be so grateful.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003ereality blurred\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0regularly breaks news, but more importantly, it filters out the noise. There were more than 700 reality shows on the air last year. What should you check out? What should you avoid? What do you need to know?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s what I\u0027m here for. And with your help, I\u0027ll keep doing this for another 17 years at least!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
