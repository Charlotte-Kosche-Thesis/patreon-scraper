     "about": "There are literally\nhundreds if not thousands of subscription box services for magical people out\nthere. I know! I started one when I launched Beaux Magique! It wasn\u2019t enough.\nIt just didn\u2019t feel \u201cright.\u201d I had the best products I could find from local practitioners.\nI even made some of the items myself. Still didn\u2019t feel right. The prepackaged\nboxes sat on the shelves forever.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow as Beaux Magique has grown, I\u2019ve discovered a\nthing: I like making personal magical products. When I say \u201cpersonal\u201d I don\u2019t\nmean chafing cream or aftershave (I can do that too!). I mean personal magical\nscents, oils, powders, ointments and sprays. Things that no one else has, makes\nor has even thought of yet. Could I do it? Did I have the skills and the mojo\nto do it?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell yeah!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs Beaux Magique grew in 2016, I created and\ndebuted 52 new products in a single year. That\u2019s one a week! For those that are\ncounting, that\u2019s: mundane and magical research; supplies, ingredients, and\npackaging research; testing, labeling, production and et al\u2026. times 52. Let\nthat sink in for a moment. I\u2019ll wait! To be clear, I\u2019m didn\u2019t do this #newin52\ndrive to be the biggest magical/conjure store ever \u2013 just the best - possibly\nthe weirdest!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u2019s the thing! Half of those new products were\nrequests. That made me realize what was missing from my magical community and\npractice. Every Conjure Man and Hoodoo Mama can make and sell all the \u201cold\nstandards.\u201d That\u2019s like new mainstream singers that usually belt out every tune\nin that Cole Porter ever wrote. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it. Even I have some\nof the old standards! What I\u2019m doing now? It isn\u2019t like that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAt.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAll.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m not just seeing recipes on Pinterest or Tumblr\nand repackaging them. Because, no. Even the old standards like VanVan oil? I go\nback as far as I can for the source. I want to understand why it\u2019s got the\nname, where the name came from, who were the people who made it? What was it\nused for? Why would you use it today? How would you use it? Are the original\ningredients still available? If they aren\u2019t or the original ingredients are\ntoxic, endangered or just too darn expensive to use safely, I work diligently to\nreplace the parts to make the product better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo be clear, this isn\u2019t just me throwing products\nthat don\u2019t sell for me in a box and shipping it to you. Because, no. Because,\nNO. While anyone can request an item I\u2019ve made or discontinued, I\u2019m not going\nto sell you my throwaways. There may be times that I will include a little\nsomething in the package from a peer practitioner that I think is AWESOME.\nThat\u2019s on me and it\u2019ll be a surprise!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMe? I want to create something new \u2013 something for\nYOU \u2013 something accessible. What\u2019s that magical spray, scent, oil or magical\nproduct that you *wish* you had complete product for? Let\u0027s do it. I\u0027ll be your\npersonal alchemist!\u003cbr\u003e",
