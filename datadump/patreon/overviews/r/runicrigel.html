\u00a0Because I think it\u0027s important to consume the news around sex and reproduction, digest it and speak from the perspective of a woman in a non-judgmental space. \u00a0In a world where we still see so much litigation and sexual assault aimed towards women and children I think it\u0027s important that this dialogue merely exist or those interested or that would listen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is actually my first love and in addition to an existential, character driven novel I would one day love to release for you all I write articles on my Tumblr which I\u0027ll link below. \u00a0Ultimately, however my biggest medium right now is YouTube. \u00a0If you enjoy my content you would have my immense appreciation and gratitude if you offered me any level of support on or off Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTreating Mental Illness\u003c/h2\u003eI also talking about using legal cannabis oil products and deritives to treat anxiety disorders like mine. \u00a0We discuss in-depth my relationship to the world as I pursue methods to live a healthy life with a mental illness that will effect the rest of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTumblr Article Samples\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow I Started Reviewing CBD: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://runicrigel.tumblr.com/post/150414659799/cbd-cannabishemp-oil-products-what-theyre\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://runicrigel.tumblr.com/post/150414659799/cbd...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThoughts on College Debt: \u003ca href=\"http://runicrigel.tumblr.com/post/153321776109/chained-to-student-debt-to-be-financially\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://runicrigel.tumblr.com/post/153321776109/cha...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yy_SHahV8HY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMy Mission\u003c/h2\u003eI have lofty goals that go far beyond YouTube like creating a scholarship fund for victims of child abuse, a novel I\u0027ve mentioned here and also to become an advocate and maybe a motivational speaker for victims of trauma or those that suffer with anxiety and PTSD. \u00a0Every inch of support you offer helps me evolve further away from abused child to an adult creating a positive impact that is weaving something beautiful from a horrific beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you. \u00a0Seriously, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eSee you Space Cowboys...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
