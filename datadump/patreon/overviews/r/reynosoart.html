Rondall\u0027s last name began in R and Pamela\u0027s in S so they sat near each other in both English and Art. Rondall was a smart mouthed teenager so he often made Pamela\u0027s life miserable. But, in December of their Senior year they started dating and were married two years later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Rondall initially planned on following his father into law he ended up changing course. He switched from a double major in economics and philosophy and moved his family to New York City so he could persue a degree in Painting. Pamela, Rondall, and the kids ended up spending seven years in New York while Rondall finished his undergraduate degree in painting, a master\u0027s degree in art history, and an MFA in painting. During this time, Pamela\u0027s artistic vision was germinating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduate, school Rondall began teaching at the college level in Louisiana. Pamela also became very serious about her photography, during that time, both on a fine art level and as a portrait photographer. While in Louisiana Rondall started the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.faithonview.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFaith on View\u003c/a\u003e blog. One of his former students thought a blog was appropriate since he has \"a lot of opinions.\" The tag line for Faith on View is \"Musings on Art, Faith, and the Pedestrain\" which really covers just about everything. But, it does put a special emphasis on art and faith as two of the most important issues to Rondall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter several years, the family, now with five children, returned to northern California near where Rondall and Pamela had grown up so that Rondall could work on a PhD. Pamela also joined to blog to give her perspective. They both continue to make art and write and Rondall continues to work on that darn PhD!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it Works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is really simple. You pledge a monthly amount of support which Patreon collects. You are then eligible for rewards based on your level of patronage. It is that simple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Best Part\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can keep making art and writing. Both take a tremendous amount of time but we love them both and think they offer benefit to the world. But making art is costly and we live in a world that requires we pay bills and buy food for our children. Your support helps us to continue doing it all!"
