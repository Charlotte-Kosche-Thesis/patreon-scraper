    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHello! Thanks for checking out my page!!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a 19 year old artist struggling to live my dreams in Chicago!\u003cbr\u003eI was a painter throughout high school and now I\u0027m interested in printmaking, screen printing, installation, makeup, writing, and a myriad of other artistic pursuits. My work centers around my experiance in life, material studies, and my friendships and the people in my life. In fact I think the only very consistent subject in my art is my visual dedication to my friends. I pull inspiration from psychology, history, \"the human experiance\", and my own past of growing up poor. In fact my poverty is what motivates me: I see myself as a very important voice in the art community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m from Chula Vista, California, which is almost the boarder town next to Mexico. I went to Chula Vista High School where I was very involved with theater design and construction, as well as representing my school\u0027s visual arts program. I won a ton of awards for my drawings and paintings, my mom has them somewhere lol. I grew up knowing that I was going to art school; that was my goal since at least third grade. Last year I actually made it. I went to The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, one of the best art schools in the country, for the 2016-17 school year. What a ride that was. I grew tremendously as an artist and pushed myself to new limits. I made two original\u00a0screen printed, hand bound books (one of which I made 10 copies of all screen printed). I had a large scale installation at MANA in Chicago with a one-night public showing. I\u0027ve made sound work, garments, sculptures, and many other installation pieces. I\u0027m really proud of the work I\u0027ve done at SAIC, and was looking forward to three more years of exponential growth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, SAIC is expensive as hell. It\u0027s actually ridiculous. I\u0027m not kidding, it\u0027s like 60k a year. And I didn\u0027t have a savings or anything, I mean I grew up poor as heck. So in spite of my many scholarships\u00a0and grants, my student loans were still astronomical. I had long accepted the price of my dream but unfortunately loans need a cosigner and I (unexpectedly) have no one for this upcoming school year. \u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m not gonna let this stop me! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the short time at SAIC, I fell in love with Chicago so I\u0027ve enrolled in a community college for this year and plan to continue in arts next year at Columbia\u00a0College Chicago, majoring in Theatrical Design. I\u0027ll never stop making art no matter what school I\u0027m attending, and as my mom and others keep encouraging me, this is a road block, not the end of the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m driven by my passion for the arts to continue taking risks. However, looking at it practically, I have a HUGE student loan just for that first year collecting interest in my bank account every day. I will have rent and utilities and food to pay for in Chicago, with no regular help from a family that can\u0027t afford it. I have a lot of art supply requirements, and honestly screen printing emulsion is $40 and that\u0027s crazy.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m not tryna be a starving artist trope but I\u0027ll do it if it means I can be an artist in this world.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I had a job last year (that I loved shoutout to the Gene Siskel, best theater in Chicago), but it was on work-study so \u003cstrong\u003eright now I don\u0027t have any source of income. I just have my savings and an eagerness to work and do what it takes, but nonetheless my future is really uncertain. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is me, asking for help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really believed that my passion and my talent would get me though the financial hardships of attending SAIC and I was wrong; I really don\u0027t want to be wrong about it now. Help me live more than the life my birthright prescribed for me. \u003cstrong\u003eI need your help!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
