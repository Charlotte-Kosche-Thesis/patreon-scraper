I stood\njust outside my tent at Woofstock, forcing a smile as I watched the lady with\nthe camera stop at each booth and take a photo. She was obviously the official\nphotographer at the event, no doubt about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWho the hell did I think I was\nanyway? I was most certainly not a real photographer. I hadn\u0027t even had one\npaying customer yet; just a few portfolio building sessions. This was supposed\nto be my big event to launch my pet photography business and I was on someone\nelse\u0027s turf. The official Woofstock photographer moved onto the next booth, one\ncloser to mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf only they told me there was\nalready a photographer here, I thought. By the time they sent out the official\nmaps, with a list of the participating businesses, it was too late to back out.\nI had been panicking for a week, and suddenly the moment I feared most was\nabout to happen: she was walking right toward me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Hi, I\u0027m Lisa,\" she said as she\nextended her hand, \"can I take a quick photo of you in your booth?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI smiled for the camera, and then\nLisa approached the tent to examine my photos. Oh boy, I thought, here it\ncomes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I love that!\" Lisa said,\npointing to a photo of a chocolate lab, and totally shocking me. I finally let\nmy guard down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThen Lisa told me about HeARTs\nSpeak, the organization she started for artists who help animals. Members were\nmostly photographers who volunteer their services to help give homeless pets\nbetter first impressions with better photography. I learned that better photos\nmeant more interest, higher adoption rates, and, inevitably, more lives saved. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd just like that, a new pet\nphotographer was born in me. Since joining this awesome organization, I\u0027ve done\nfar more pet photography for rescues than I\u0027ve done for paid clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Can Help Me Save More Animals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBefore becoming a HeARTs Speak\nmember, I had no idea how bad the situation really is. I didn\u0027t know, for\nexample, that \u003cstrong\u003eevery 8 seconds another\npet is put to death\u003c/strong\u003e in the United States, simply because there\u0027s not enough\nroom. Perfectly good, adoptable animals, killed just because they don\u0027t have a\nhome. It\u0027s beyond tragic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince becoming a foster failure\n(the only failure in my life I\u0027m proud to tell you about) with my girl Gracie Lou,\nI don\u0027t do half the volunteer work I used to do. I just can\u0027t bear to leave her\nalone during the little time we have together. So I\u0027ve turned to my art as a\nway to be home with her, feed my creative urges, AND help homeless animals at\nthe same time. (You can read\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://reflectivephotos.net/2015/03/30/gracies-rescue-story/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGracie\u0027s Rescue Story\u003c/a\u003e here.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your support I can give back more to the organizations that are struggling\nto save countless animals in need.\u003c/strong\u003e Right now I\u0027m able to donate 10% of my\nprofits to a few of my favorite rescue groups. All of my non-pet art sales give\nback to HeARTs Speak, and all of my pet art sales and services help to support Pets Alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver time, I hope you can help\nme reach my goal to increase donations all the way to 50% of my art profits. That\u0027s\nright, \u003cstrong\u003eI want to split my income 50/50\nwith the animals\u003c/strong\u003e. That, to me, would be living the dream! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your help, I\u0027ll also be\nable to do the occasional creative fundraiser that will support the animals\n100%! Just take a look at my goals list (in the left column) to read about one project that will\nraise $2,500 for shelter pets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney can\u0027t do everything, though, and I\u0027m on a mission to change perspectives and spread the \"adopt don\u0027t shop\" mentality as far as I can reach. That\u0027s why I launched the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://myrescuerocks.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Rescue Rocks\u003c/a\u003e podcast. I wanted to share the stories that have inspired me, and my hope is that they will affect the same kind of change in others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Can Give Me More Time to Create\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI do product photography Monday\nthrough Friday to pay the bills. I\u0027m a contractor though, not an employee, so I\ndon\u0027t have vacation days, sick days, or personal days. When I don\u0027t work, I\u0027m\nnot paid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy art is a true passion though,\nso I don\u0027t hesitate to spend most nights and weekends working on it. It\u0027s just\nsomething I have to do to satisfy my soul. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour funding can help me spend\nmore time with my art and more time working on the podcast. It\u0027s not just time behind the camera and the mic that I\u0027m lacking,\nbut the production time editing images and audio, sharing on social media,\nblogging, and advertising on other platforms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOh, and Gracie wants you to know\nthat she would like me to factor in some more snuggle time with her too; awww... I love my pibble.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks in advance for even considering\nhelping me! If you\u0027ve read down this far it must mean you care about the work\nI\u0027m doing. Thanks so much for caring!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again!\u003cbr\u003eRebekah\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
