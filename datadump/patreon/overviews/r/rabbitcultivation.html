    "summary": "Hey guys! I\u0027m Rabbit from Rabbit Cultivation~ I\u0027m the translator for Poisoning the World (found on Moon Bunny Caf\u00e9), My Wayward Ex-Wife, Concubine\u0027s Stunning Daughter : Ghost Emperor Please Be Lenient, and the yet unreleased novel Evil Child Black Bellied Mother.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReading has been a huge hobby of mine, so when I stumbled on Chinese novels - and the opportunity to translate them - I was literally ecstatic. Finally, I could put my Chinese school skills to use! However, translating does take a lot of time and a lot of effort, so I have come to the conclusion that translating the four novels that I love is more work than I anticipated. Also, maintaining a website with a custom domain actually costs more than I thought... So I came here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to introduce more novels into the novel community because there are just so many good ones out there. \u003cstrong\u003eYour support goes towards\u003c/strong\u003e :\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1. Website updating, upkeep, fees for the domain, fees for hosting, payment for website maintainer\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Introducing more novels (cultivation manuals). There\u0027s SO MANY GOOD ONES that go unnoticed, and I really want to bring these cultivation manuals to the Rabbitism Sect so that we can all enjoy them!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Okay, you guessed it... Commissioned artwork! I don\u0027t know if you guys have seen artists on Twitter, but some of them are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and they accept commissions! I\u0027m looking forward to bringing you all chibi versions of MCs and MLs~\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Making us happy! I mean, this one is a little more selfish, but it really makes our day when we see another supporter or reader of our translations. It really does. And also, these translators and editors are giving up lots of time to translate these wonderful novels. Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to give them a present at the end of each month? :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get out of it? The rewards are to the side for whatever tier you\u0027re interested in~\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I will have special polls, events, and other surprises for my patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePayment format is charge-upfront, so please just keep that in mind!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note : Poisoning the World is not included in this Patreon due to Qidian and legal reasons. This means that the Poisoning the World team will not be a part of any of these rewards. While I am totally open to donations for Poisoning the World, I will try my best to give you the other rewards, but early access to chapters is unfortunately not available. I\u0027m really sorry! If you still want to support Poisoning the World anyways, thank you very much for your support~\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond Note : The Hand-Written letter will be SCANNED to you, NOT MAILED to you. However, if one of your rewards is a holiday card, those will be mailed to you. If you do not wish for them to be mailed to you, please tell me via email or Discord!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe work hard to ensure that our novels are in the best quality that we can provide, and we really do try our best. Thank you all for your support! It really does mean a lot to us \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
