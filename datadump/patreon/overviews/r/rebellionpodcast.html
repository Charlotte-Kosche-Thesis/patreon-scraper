    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eREBELLION\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a bi-weekly podcast that blows the cobwebs off of The American Revolution. Each episode tells the story of the amazing men and women who put their lives at risk for a future they\u0027d never live to see. It is my goal and my passion to reintroduce Americans to the men and women who were responsible for laying the foundation of our country.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Idea\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe idea for \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eREBELLION\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e came after teaching a lesson to my 4th grade class about The Revolutionary War. After the lesson was over, they were clamoring for more stories from that period. Not one to let down my students, and reluctant to begin my unit on helping verbs, I gathered them all at the carpet, where I regaled them with the story of Nathan Hale. Maybe they were all jacked up on cookies from lunch the previous period, or maybe it was because a school bearing his name sits just up the street, but whatever it was, my students couldn\u0027t get enough.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd so began a weekly ritual. Soon, my class couldn\u0027t wait for \u003cem\u003eFreedom Fridays\u003c/em\u003e to arrive so they could hear another story. After a month of telling some of my favorites (Sybil Ludington\u0027s Ride, John Adams and The Boston Massacre, and my boy Baron Von Steuben), it dawned on me that I could record these stories and share them with others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in!\u003c/h2\u003e\nMy fascination with the Revolutionary Era has never dwindled, so it is paramount that my research is thorough. This involves traveling to locations that house primary documents, securing rare books, and scouring the web for every bit of detail I can find on each subject. I do this all on top of teaching the best 4th grade curriculum I can. It\u0027s been a challenge to work full time, fund and manage my website, and record quality audio the best I can, all between the hours of 6:00 and 11:00 pm (and weekends, of course).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour contribution will help cover the costs of everything listed above, and allow me to continue putting out as great a production as I can going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are lending any support for me and my podcast, I will never be able to fully thank you. But I hope you enjoy the access it gives you, and I hope you continue to listen, to share, and to look back at our compelling history!\u003cbr\u003e"
