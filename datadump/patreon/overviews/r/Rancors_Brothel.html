Remember that Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons group that you played with in that one guy\u2019s basement twenty years ago?  That\u2019s us, but all grown up.  But mortgages and children haven\u2019t stopped us from throwing dice, creating immersive, entertaining experiences, and enjoying ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Rancor\u2019s Brothel releases episodes twice weekly (and sometimes more!), that alternate between ongoing, RPG campaigns intermixed with smaller adventures, scenarios, and the occasional mail-bag or interview segment.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, The Rancor\u2019s Brothel has featured the following systems: Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons 5th edition, Call of Cthulhu 6th and 7th edition, Delta Green, Trail of Cthulhu , Shadows of Esteren, Red Markets, and Slasher Flick.  We\u2019ve released full playthroughs of notable Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons campaigns Hoard of the Dragon Queen and Curse of Strahd as well as the Call of Cthulhu\u2019s Tatters of the King. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Our current plans include the pending release of Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons campaigns Out of the Abyss and Tomb of Annihilation, as well as the award-winning Call of Cthulhu adventure The Sense of the Sleight of Hand Man.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, The Rancor\u2019s Brothel will never put any of our content behind a paywall.

Hosting fees, website maintenance, equipment costs, literature, editing time, and more.  These financial burdens are capably managed by us, but they prevent us from expanding; exploring new systems, uploading more content, and giving you, dear listener, the best RPG podcast experience we can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started this Patreon because we have big ideas: More campaigns, like the ones listed above.  More systems, like Starfinder, Star Trek, The Strange, Numenera, Pathfinder, and more.  More players, allowing for a diversity in listening experience.  Merchandizing, even?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are lofty goals, and the all require additional investment of both time and money..  We\u2019re looking for Patrons to help us succeed in attaining that next level.
