    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHi there! Welcome! My name is Robin Eileen, and I\u0027m a writer, artist and situationist located in San Francisco, California. Patreon took me a year to figure out, because the work I do as an artist is all over the map, includes experiments and edge cases, a huge diversity of media, and a wobbly line between the artist and the audience, but I\u0027m doing it anyway, and I\u0027m doing it now. If you are reading this early version, you probably know me, or know someone who does. Have you read my stories? Maybe you\u0027ve attended my rituals, received strange mail from me, been urged to confess your sins to a cheesecake in a science lab, passed a torch on the beach at night with me. Maybe you\u0027ve watched me make up a game on the spot, been \"arrested\" by me at the observatory at midnight, participated in one of my mail order guided meditation time travel larps? Or maybe you have purchased one of my paintings or something else I made. Whoever you are and however you got here, thank you, kind folks. I honestly believe that without those of you who have believed in and been entertained or changed by the stories I tell and the art that I made over the years are in a way my collaborators. I have been held and encouraged by dreamers, doers and believers, philosophers, tricksters and romantics who see me for who I am. Listening fetishists, old punks, rebels, working moms, etc., have helped me tame and groom my wild imagination to a point where it is bearable, to make the voices into images, action, experiences and content. Thank you. And so now there is more. Now there is this place, where a community can gather, where we can talk, and where we can try things together. Thank you for your time, thank you for your money, and thank you for your faith in me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page, I will be offering you longer form essays on the human condition, culture, art, mental health and other odds and ends, for free. If you choose to support me financially for my creation of new work, your contribution will give me some of my time back, and I will use that time to make richer, higher quality content for you at a greater frequency than I could without your help. Those of you who have chosen to give financially will gain deeper access to my process, additional essays and sometimes a say in what I write about, access to audio conversations between myself and other local artists who I admire, WEIRD MAIL FROM THE ACTUAL POST OFFICE, exclusive invitations to participate in the live events and experiences that I produce in the Bay Area, as well as occasional instructions on how to participate remotely in group art projects from anywhere you live, via the internet, and the world wide cyberwebs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for coming to this page.\u00a0 Thank you for reading this to the end. Thank you for liking me. Thank you for joining me in this unfolding process. Stay foolish, I already love you. We are going to have fun!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an experiment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(banner photo credit: Richie Rhombus, from Appetite Obscure Ice Mountain, directed and produced by the same)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ll be able to put myself in more interesting situations to write about, because I won\u0027t have to constantly worry about money anymore, and I\u0027ll pass those experiences on straight to you.\u00a0",
