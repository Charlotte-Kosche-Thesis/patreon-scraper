    "summary": "Alright guys, welcome to this fancy little Patreon page meant to support me, rikai!\u003cbr\u003eI make gaming videos, do livestreams and in the future with help from this Patreon plan to expand into other areas of entertainment/content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWell, in addition to the improvement in content, there\u0027ll be various reward tiers that will give you access to different things. I haven\u0027t fully fleshed things out yet, so the list will probably grow as time goes on, but some of the things I have in mind are access to a private discord server set up specifically to be able to talk with my patrons whenever I\u0027ve got the time to be able to get feedback and just spend some time with the people that spend their hard-earned money to support me as well as some sort of personal thank you, and badly drawn art by me, someone who definitely isn\u0027t an artist! There are other ideas that I haven\u0027t quite decided on, like patreon-exclusive livestreams and other such things. Look at the sidebar to see the current tiers, and let me know if you\u0027ve got suggestions for things you guys would like, because if you\u0027re going to take the time to support me, I definitely want to be able to give something extra back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would you want to support me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI\u0027d like to take the money you give and reinvest it into making the channel better in a ton of ways, from higher quality production to a complete overhaul of the art and styling of the videos, channel art and anything else related. I\u0027d also like to upgrade my hardware so I\u0027m no longer constantly fighting with things to be able to bring you guys higher quality content and instead just bring you more content and a whole host of other things!\u003cbr\u003eWhat will I do with the money? Well, the same thing that most other people on patreon will. A combination of improving content quality, improving my personal quality of life (I\u0027m looking to move to a house that will let me have a dedicated recording space for the gaming videos, and also potentially for some other non-gaming secret projects I have sitting on the back burner). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that you guys, if you\u0027re coming here, are probably here because you want to support me and not for the pledge tiers, but if there\u0027s anything reasonable I can add to give back more to you guys, I\u0027m going to do everything I can to do so.\u003cbr\u003eI thank you guys from the bottom of my heart for any support you choose to provide, and even if you choose not to, for taking the time to even stop by and consider it! :)\u003cbr\u003e"
