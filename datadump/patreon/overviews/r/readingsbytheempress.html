I have been an intuitive since I was a child, always with these \"knowings\", unable to explain how I knew, but surprising others with statements that turned out to be true.\u00a0 I believe much of this is from loved ones on the other side, as I have had the ability to \"hear\" from others\u0027 loved ones and know what they look like and how they come across before the other person describes their dearly departed to me. \u00a0 My videos are tarot readings on topics ranging from politics and influential persons to monthly readings for your astrological sign.  I ask viewers to bring their own intuition to the readings. I find that  people who are drawn to tarot readings have greater intuitive abilities than most.\u00a0 I also ask the viewer to understand that while I try to keep an open mind, willing to see what I do not expect to see, Tarot readings are not objective.\u00a0 They are inherently subjective.  I draw upon my intuitive abilities which I believe provide valuable information. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, readers should keep in mind that predictions that come out of tarot readings are based upon the dominant energies at the time, how it looks like it will play out.\u00a0 Sometimes, uncertainty in outcome is suggested by the cards when factors affecting outcomes are still evolving.\u00a0 Also, please understand there are some questions Spirit will not answer, as we are not meant to know for our own or others\u0027 protection. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eYouTube Channel\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e features a lot of videos:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGNVucwCmmYLqZCZpPBpwAA\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGNVucwCmmYLqZCZp...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDecks used are:\nAmanda Hall\u2019s Simply Tarot Deck (these are the cards that look like paintings with the tan border and description window on the bottom)\nSmith-Waite Tarot Deck, Centennial Edition (these are the small cards)\nLo Scarabeo\u0027s Universal Tarot (these are the cards with the white borders, with names of cards provided in different languages)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer: Tarot readings are for entertainment."
