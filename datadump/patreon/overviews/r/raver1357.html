    "summary": "Hello, people of the internet. I go by Raver, since that\u0027s the name I thought was cool back in 2008 and it apparently stuck. Since it\u0027s far too late to turn back now, I\u0027m here to present my case for why you may want to support my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As you can presumably tell by the images around the page, I draw things that are, to varying degrees, porn. No way to spruce up that fact, but if that\u0027s the sort of thing you\u0027re into, then we may be able to help each other out. I draw bondage, specifically, featuring ladies from various realms of fiction (mainly games) in any number of distressing and/or kinky scenarios that you may be interested in seeing. The bulk of my stuff is posted to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://raver1357.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e page, with a few posted to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/pictures/user/RaversDungeon\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHentai Foundry\u003c/a\u003e on occasion. I also stream on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/raver1357\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePicarto\u003c/a\u003e almost every Wednesday, sometimes on other days depending on schedule conflicts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e And now, I\u0027m going to be even more blunt than usual. I don\u0027t have a huge amount of stuff to offer here, just free time that can be spent producing more. I want to make the kind of things that you (hopefully) want to see, and to be brutally honest, the money I get from this goes mainly toward food, rent, and savings. With any luck, that will eventually leave room to invest into better software and maybe a half-decent computer to work with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all that being said, I will always be looking for ways to improve this, so don\u0027t hesitate to leave feedback about how you feel this operation is being run. This is still very new and experimental for me, so if you have concerns or questions, contact me at any time. I don\u0027t recommend using e-mail since I always forget to check it and Windows 10 doesn\u0027t know what desktop notifications are, so I would recommend contacting me on DA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a Discord channel that you can join. It can be helpful for asking questions, providing information, or getting regular updates on the status of your requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://discord.gg/sfbvtE6\"\u003ediscord.gg/sfbvtE6\u003c/a\u003e"

As far as the particular kind of content goes, that is something I\u0027ve been doing since sometime around 2007, scribbling on printer paper when my parents weren\u0027t around. After posting the first of these images to DeviantArt and getting some decent feedback, the years-long process of teaching myself how to draw started. Over time, as these images became more elaborate and ideas could actually be realized the way I wanted, it helped me gain confidence and eventually start learning to actually socialize. Through a small community built up around what started as a few random drawings done out of boredom, I found something that gave me a reason to try new things, with one new thing in particular leading to the best decision of my life; finding the one I would be spending it with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat didn\u0027t sound pretentious, did it?",
