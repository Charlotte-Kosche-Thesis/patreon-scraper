    "summary": "We, the small team at The Retro Perspective are here because we want to continue putting out quality content, be that written content on \u003ca href=\"http://www.theretroperspective.com\"\u003etheretroperspective.com\u003c/a\u003e, video content on our YouTube channel or even other stuff like podcasts or streams. Whilst we started as a video game channel, we felt we had to branch out to film/TV \u0026amp; music due to our passion \u0026amp; expertise in those areas but to find the right balance \u0026amp; direction for The Retro Perspective we\u0027d love to build a community \u0026amp; allow you as a viewer to have a more active role, so we know we are serving you as best we can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur DIY approach to filming \u0026amp; editing (and my strong aversion to jump cuts) means that our equipment is pretty basic \u0026amp; editing takes up a good chunk of my time. We have struggled through many technical issues, bad lighting, broken audio, faulty hardware, but after a couple of years we\u0027ve managed to scrape together a website \u0026amp; YouTube channel we\u0027re pretty damn proud of. However, we would still like to improve our content by upgrading our video \u0026amp; audio equipment, so if you decide to become a patron then we\u0027d like to thank you \u0026amp; assure you that your money will go towards keeping our content thriving!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhat We Do\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe have a few different ways in which we deliver content to our subscribers. Firstly, we have straight up reviews \u0026amp; opinion pieces which can either be consumed in written or video form. We do have a scoring system out of 10 but we like to think that the content of a review is a lot more important, so we do not include the score in our videos and use it mainly for people to see at a glance how well games have been reviewed on our website. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gF4oJjzns3E\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e We also have much longer videos such as our \u0027Retro Perspective\u0027 or \u0027Reel Talk\u0027 series which will feature 2 or more of us \u0026amp; go into much finer detail with things like game mechanics or cinematography. This is the kind of content that gave us the idea to start the channel as on many occasions we have talked long in to the night about the flaws of \u003cem\u003eMetal Gear Solid 4\u003c/em\u003e or the perfection of \u003cem\u003eHalf Life 2\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jsRv66jT9s\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s also our music oriented content such as \u0027Shuffle or Boogie?\u0027 which are essays on the history \u0026amp; methods behind a particular series\u0027 music or focusing on a particular composer. We also like to conduct interviews with said composers to talk about past \u0026amp; future projects which have ranged from small indie titles like \u003cem\u003eEitr\u003c/em\u003e, to the not so small \u003cem\u003eSouth Park. \u003c/em\u003eWe have plenty of other content to peruse as well, so feel free to check\n it all out. We welcome feedback, critique \u0026amp; discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1j4yp5uPxg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo Game Collection\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur content is also inspired in part by seasoned video game collectors like The Angry Video Game Nerd \u0026amp; Lazy Game Reviews, so we have a growing \u003ca href=\"https://www.theretroperspective.com/video-game-collection/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo game collection\u003c/a\u003e of our own focusing mainly on older Playstation titles but spanning many other great consoles too. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclosure\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe aim to be as transparent as possible with our viewers, if we receive a review copy from a company we will at the very least disclose that in the video description \u0026amp; article. Honestly, we aren\u0027t fans of advertisements of any kind \u0026amp; since YouTube is trying to suppress small channels we\u0027ve decided that we won\u0027t be allowing them to run ads on our videos where possible. There\u0027s also not likely to be any sponsored videos on our channel...unless of course, we\u0027re secretly taking the piss out of the product or it\u0027s something we genuinely believe in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously, we appreciate every single interaction we have with our viewers, that\u0027s what keeps us motivated to keep making videos, writing articles \u0026amp; conducting interviews.
