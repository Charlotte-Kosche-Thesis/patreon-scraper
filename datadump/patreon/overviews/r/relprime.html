    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://relprime.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRelatively Prime\u003c/a\u003e is the only podcast which features the best stories from the Mathematical Domain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a break that went on far too long Relatively Prime is ready to bring mathematics back to everyone with headphones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 3rd season of Relatively Prime is going to be a bit different though. For the first two seasons host and producer Samuel funded Relatively Prime through Kickstarter. This meant \nSamuel retreated to his cave for months and months to make the show. \nWhich is all well and good but, what were you supposed to do in the long\n mathless months waiting for episodes to start? Especially as we all \nknew that once they did show up all the mathematical stories were going \nto be gone less than two months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why Samuel now plans to take Relatively \nPrime monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is going to mean a change in format too. In order to maintain a monthly release schedule the shows are going to focus on telling a single story, instead of a bunch all on a single theme. While this does mean shorter episodes, it also means much more focus on the one story being told. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Samuel\n here breaking the fourth wall to share a secret with you inside these \nparentheses. When the Kickstarter for season 3 failed to reach its goal I\n essentially wrote off doing any more Relatively Prime, but it is \nbecause of all of you who have reached out and said you want to hear \nmore episodes and would support this wonderful work I love to do so much\n that I am going to bring back the show. Really all the kind words meant\n so much and I can\u0027t wait to give y\u0027all more awesome mathematics stories\n to listen to.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you enjoy mathematics or stories or mathematical stories please pledge to support the 3rd season of Relatively Prime. Any amount helps! Any amount at all, and the more patrons Relatively Prime gets the more time Samuel will be able to spend spreading the wonderful word of mathematics. (Samuel breaking the 4th wall again here. This last sentence is super true as I do have a primary job which involves making people coffee in order to pay the bills, but the more bills I can pay from making the show the more days I can devote to producing and telling mathematical stories.) Plus, you will get a \ncool reward when you do pledge and everyone likes getting a little \nsomething(the reward levels are cumulative too, so you will get \neverything from the levels before the one you choose too!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support, and have a matheriffic day!\u003cbr\u003e"
