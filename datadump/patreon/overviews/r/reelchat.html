    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eWho is this Adam Stolfo of which you speak?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat would be me! Welcome to the \u003cem\u003e\"Reel Chat Patreon Community\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0guys and gals. I guess I was always destined to be a creative person in some form or another. I\u00a0discovered filmmaking in high school after experimenting with a variety of creative outlets throughout my early years, and became enthralled by the visual storytelling power of the movies. I like to refer to myself as\u00a0the quintessential movies guy, willing to discuss all things film \u2013 practically all the time if permitted! Podcasting is my latest creative venture, and I believe \u201c\u003cem\u003eReel Chat\u003c/em\u003e\u201d is a perfect way for the team and I to share our love of film with like minded cinephiles - in what I believe is the most accessible and entertaining way possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is The Reel Chat Podcast?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the course of our fortnightly show, the \u003cem\u003eReel Chat\u003c/em\u003e team share their thoughts on all things film. It\u2019s more than just opinions and reviews mind you. It\u2019s a round-the-board discussion show with one goal in mind \u2013 the entertainment, enjoyment and appreciation of the art form. In the course of an episode discussion we break down a film, looking at it\u0027s cast, it\u0027s filmmakers, it\u0027s soundtrack, it\u0027s home video and streaming options, as well as it\u0027s most interesting little-known anecdotes and production trivia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy do I need your help?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis show has been essentially a one-man operation for over two years. I am my own audio engineer, producer, intern, publicist, talent handler, personal assistant and fan club manager.\u00a0Financial security from my listeners would go a huge way to helping me to produce \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e content for the movie loving community out there. With enough support, I can make your favourite (or at least top 10 favourite) podcast even better! Oh, and I might even be able to buy a new pair of jeans. I hope that\u0027s okay??\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of Patreon as like a monthly fan club subscription-meets-Kickstarter. You pledge X dollars towards supporting the content and creation of the show each month. You get offerred different rewards depending on how much you pledge - look at it as giving something back. You get charged at the beginning of each month and you can raise of lower your pledge at any time you wish. Various Reward Tiers are listed so you can see the exciting ways I plan to use your generosity for your entertainment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\u0027s the difference between Rewards and Goals?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards are things I\u0027m doing \u003cem\u003efor you\u003c/em\u003e as a huge thank you for supporting me in my creative endeavours. Milestones are what I\u0027m specifically going to do with the money \u003cem\u003efor you\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eat various amounts. Basically, they\u0027re all the things I\u0027m doing \u003cem\u003efor you\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCan I listen to the Reel Chat Podcast without supporting?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course! You can still download \"\u003cem\u003eReel Chat\"\u00a0\u003c/em\u003efor free. The podcast will remain free for download on iTunes, Apple Podcasts, PlayerFM, Stitcher, TuneIn, or any good podcast app for that matter. Or you can stream it at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://reelchat.com.au\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://reelchat.com.au\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease remember: No contribution is too small! Anything you can part with will help us go the distance. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach fortnight I work tirelessly to bring you top-notch, blood-soaked content. Myself and my team live for this stuff. And now we\u0027d like to actually fully invest ourselves into the podcast. That\u0027s where you come in: if you chip in just 1 dollar per month (or more if you feel that way inclined), we can finally expand our operation and improve the quality of our product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRest assured: the show will always remain free. But if we receive enough financial support per month, we\u0027ll have the means to create more merch, produce extra episodes, and give you other bonus content that casual listeners won\u0027t otherwise have access to. In a perfect world, we\u0027d be able to meet each \u0027n\u0027 every one of you! And with your generosity and assistance, we might be able to make that dream a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks an absolute bundle in advance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour host\u003cbr\u003eAdam Stolfo"
