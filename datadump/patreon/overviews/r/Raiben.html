    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wnigGQ8.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, my name is Raiben and I do stuff on the Internet that some people enjoy (a bit). I\u0027ve been making YouTube videos and livestreaming on Twitch.tv for 3 years now, and due to medical costs and YouTube\u0027s new monitization, it seems it is necessary to fund myself through Patreon rather than YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe medical thing is a bit, unsettling, but suffice it to say, medical bills aren\u0027t cheap in the USA, and it\u0027s the primary reason I\u0027ve not been able to create content, and initially, getting my health back in order would be prioriy one, but anything you decide to give toward the channel and myself will go directly back into the channel to help make the whole show better for all of you. If you\u0027re curious about what exactly is going on, feel free to ask via Twitch, and I have explained everything in a video here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/M1lku6OBGcs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/M1lku6OBGcs\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo break this down a little further, the uses for any donations would be for:\u003cbr\u003e-Help for Medical Bills\u003cbr\u003e-Internet bills\u003cbr\u003e-Xsplit fees\u003cbr\u003e-Equipment Upgrades\u003cbr\u003e-Music Licensing (for cinematic videos)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you fund me or not, thank you. Honestly, thank you. The fact I even feel like I could attempt this is thanks to you all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe basic medical costs come down to needing a minimum of 2 blood tests that have to be sent to a lab overseas, one test to confirm the exact type of parasite, and the 2nd to confirm that it\u0027s gone. This assumes no complications, but the way I look at it, one step at a time. The other major costs can be split into medication costs and helping pay off previous hospitalization costs. Regardless, just to handle the parasite, without any other extraneous stuff will cost roughly 600 dollars over the next 2 months.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt looks like this:\u003cbr\u003e-Blood test $176\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-medication $85\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Fees $58\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said above I\u0027ll need two blood tests and a few doctor\u0027s visits (where the fees come in)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to run this patreon as transparently as possible, and will keep any patrons updated as best I possibly can about how I use any donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your time, and if you enjoy what I do, and would like to see me do more of it, consider joining the Patreon Crew!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time!\u003cbr\u003e-Raiben\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS. Everyone has a cool name for their supporters.. what do you guys think I should call you? I was thinking Parasites.. but that might be a bit on the nose :P\u003cbr\u003e"
