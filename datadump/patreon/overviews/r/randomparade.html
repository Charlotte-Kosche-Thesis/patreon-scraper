    "summary": "Greetings! We\nare an independent band known as \"Random Parade\".  I\nwrite the songs, grab willing musicians to collaborate with me to record\nand release them. We occasionally play live shows as well.  With\nseveral EP releases and a full length CD, we have been fortunate to\nget great feedback.  We are thrilled when we find new listeners\nwho enjoy our style of post-punk, alternative music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife\nrarely turns out the way that you plan it, yet, somehow we manage to\nreach point B from point A. I reflect on where I am now and what is\nimportant to me, and I couldn\u2019t have imagined this life that I am\nliving 20 or so years ago. I am a musician and have always known it,\nbut took the path of least resistance that so many musicians take.\nThat path took me through the dark forests of corporate America in\nsearch of the elusive American dream.  Along the way, I continued to write and record music. The thing about musicians, artists, writers\nand most creative sorts; we will do what we do, regardless of whether\nor not we are considered \u201cprofessional\u201d or not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen\nI was young, I stumbled across my town\u2019s college radio station.\nThey were playing amazing music that you couldn\u2019t hear anywhere\nelse (there wasn\u0027t much of an internet back then). \u00a0Punk rock with\nlots of four letter words and angst, imported English and European\ngoth, new wave, and industrial music. They weren\u0027t all happy. They\nwere songs with lots of emotion, energy and attitude. \u00a0I went on to\ndiscover other styles that really expressed deep emotions and that weren\u2019t\nafraid to break rules of how the songs were structured, and played.\nThey were truly \u201calternative\u201d and groundbreaking in their day; fearless of not sounding like the hit songs on the radio. I take that\nwith me as I continue on my musical journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\nmusic evolved through each decade, through the wonder of life to the\nhardship of uncertainty and betrayal, of heartache and loss to the\nunsettling of the world and love and existence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\nhave set up the Random Parade Patreon page for those who really\nlike what we\u2019re doing, who would like to support us as we continue\ndoing it and are willing to contribute a small amount of money to\nhelp keep the ship afloat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DOES IT WORK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s really simple. You decide how much you\u0027d like to contribute per audio release. It can be as little as $1. \u00a0We\u2019ll release songs to our Patreon page and your card gets billed at the end of the month based on how much music is released. You can put a cap on your contribution level to make sure we don\u0027t take your rent money. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are currently writing and recording songs as we go, for 3-5 song EP releases and eventually full LP releases and are on pace of about 1-2 songs a month. Random Parade Patreon patrons will have access to songs as we finish them, before the EPs/LPs are released, as well as any exclusive content we throw out there for fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for supporting us and independent music! I can\u0027t wait to get to know you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

What began as a lo-fi bedroom project grew to three self released EPs and the latest full length release, \u003cem\u003eThe Sad Charade \u003c/em\u003eon Bitemark Records. Christopher has since assembled a backing band, consisting of drummer James Ross and bassist Doug Cummings to tour and collaborate on a second full length release.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Sad Charade\u003c/em\u003e continues to find successes online and garnered some college radio airplay.
