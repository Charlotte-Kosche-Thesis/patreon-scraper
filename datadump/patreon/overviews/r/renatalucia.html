Influenced by a family of outsider artists, writers, quilters, embroiderers, miniaturists, and a research\nscientist, \u00a0my work includes paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, fiber, and mixed media works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy subjects range from traditional quilt patterns in\nencaustic paint interlaced with photographic images of unknown people, to gerrymandered congressional districts rendered in traditional embroidery techniques, to newspapers that have been manipulated to resemble our natural,\norganic surroundings. Behind the scenes, you\u0027ll also see my lesser-known interests in landscapes, figurative work, and other explorations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RI7SGbnQnTk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work has been featured twice in the periodical\nNew American Paintings, and is now part of the public collection of the\nInternational Women\u2019s Museum in Marfa, TX. Additionally, I was a resident\nartist at Houston\u2019s Project Row Houses, and a recent award winner at the 2017\nLawndale Big Show and the 2018 Assistance League of Houston Celebrates Texas Art\nshow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Patreon and My Rewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to join me in this journey, with insights into my work, success, failures, shows, research, thought process, and studio. From career updates, in-process photos, private sketchbook views, digital works, and special acknowledgements,\u00a0to larger works on paper, discounts, and commissions, my rewards are tiered to offer something for every price range. I hope you will find something of interest and of value to you that represents a token of my appreciation! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that, while my reward levels are named with various art movements and types of work, this is just for fun and to distinguish the levels! The names of the reward levels do not represent the type of work you will see or receive! For instance, if you join at the \"Happening Level\", you will receive all the rewards of the previous level, plus a\u00a0small work on paper (e.g., 11\" x 15\") mailed to\nyou following every three months of support, and a 10% discount on any artwork\npurchased from me. I will not be able to actually perform a Happening for you. Unless this page REALLY takes off...we\u0027ll see!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
