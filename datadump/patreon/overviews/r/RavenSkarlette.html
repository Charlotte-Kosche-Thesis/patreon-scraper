    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\"Every adventure requires a first step.\"\n-The Cheshire Cat\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my adventure!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhere do I start? Do I list my dislikes/likes in alphabetical order? Or give\nyou all of my pet peeves and hobbies? Better yet, I\u0027ll bore you with a short\nstory of my life. If you can\u0027t tell, I\u0027m not the best at talking about myself.\nSo, I\u0027m approaching this with raw, brutal honesty; and sarcasm. It\u0027s what I do\nbest. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude09\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBefore I go on an informational rampage, I want to take a moment to say thank\nyou. Thank you to every single person that I have crossed paths with in my\nlife. You have taken part of molding the woman I have become. Thank you to\neveryone who has believed in me, and supported my dreams. You\u0027re the real MVP!\nWithout all of you, none of this would be possible. \ud83d\udda4\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut enough of the chit\nchat, time to get down to the nitty-gritty facts about me. I once told\nsomeone I was a boring person\u2026I\u2019ll let you be the judge. I consider myself an eccentric\nhome body. However, I do enjoy a friendly escapade. I have many interests, to\nmatch my many Gemini moods: \u003cbr\u003e*I\u2019ve been considered to be a dweeb. Based on my\nenjoyment of Star Wars, Harry Potter, comics, cosplay, being a bookworm, and\nthe world of fantasy. Oh, and did I mention I met Stan Lee at a local\ncomic-con?\u003cbr\u003e*I\u2019m an amateur gamer. Some of my current favorite PS4\ngames are Fallout 4, Injustice, Mortal Kombat, Until Dawn, The Witcher 3, COD, and\nLife is Strange. But you can never go wrong with some classic Super Nintendo\ngames.\u003cbr\u003e*Movie fanatic, my collection and taste range from The\nLittle Mermaid to Drop Dead Fred and animated to based on a book. Horror, gore,\nparanormal and suspenseful flicks will always have my heart. One, Two, Freddy\nis coming for you! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e*There\u2019s that famous quote, \u201cWhere words fail, music\nspeaks.\u201d by Hans Christian Andersen. I can\u2019t begin to tell you how true that\nis, to my life.  I don\u2019t know how I would\nsurvive without music. From the lyrics, to the beat, to the feeling, moment of\nunderstanding, and clarity. One of my favorite bands at the moment is Sylar and\na couple songs that I\u2019ve been listening to on repeat lately is Don\u2019t You by\nLandon Tewers and I Fall Apart by Post Malone. One of my truest happy moments,\nis in front of a live band. Going to shows is amazing on so many levels. A\nweekend festival is on my bucket list. Well it would be on a bucket list, if I\nactually had one. \u003cbr\u003e*I\u2019m not an athletic person. The most activity you\u2019ll\nget from me is pulling my own arm towards my mouth to take a bite of some pizza\nor tacos, \ud83d\ude1d but on a more semi-serious note I enjoy some yoga or a cross fit\ntype of gym workout.  But I do enjoy\nwatching certain sports: Baseball, although my favorite team isn\u2019t the\ngreatest, go Pirates! Football, more so on the college side. I don\u2019t mind\nwatching basketball and hockey. Lately, I\u2019ve been getting back into watching\nextreme sports: love supercross. I\u2019ve been thinking about taking up\nskateboarding, as a hobby. \u003cbr\u003e*Animal friendly. I\u2019ve grown up with pets and still\nhave a few today. I used to work at an animal hospital and used to debate on\nbecoming a vet tech. My current animal companions consist of Daisy, my old\nlady. She\u2019s a Chihuahua. Dexter, my handsome kitty. And Puff the Bearded\nDragon. Here\u2019s a good spot to tell you that I am afraid of spiders\u2026yuk!\u003cbr\u003e*I enjoy a wide spectrum of art. From paintings to\nanything abstract to my own sketches. \u003cbr\u003e*Advocate for the good ole Mary Jane, serves wonders\nfor medicinal purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSelf-expression!\nThis is huge to me. It\u2019s such an important part of anyone\u2019s life and part of\nwho you are. It can be from something as simple as a hair color to a tattoo or\npiercing\u2026if it makes you happy and isn\u2019t harmful, then express away. You shouldn\u2019t\nlet the opinions of society or a certain person(s), hinder who you are. I\u2019ve\nchanged my hair color more times than I can count. I\u2019ve lost track of how many\ntattoos I have and I do have multiple piercings. I don\u2019t think there is\nanything wrong with any of these, just like I don\u2019t think there is anything\nwrong with not liking these things. Find what you like and run with it.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\ntry not to be political and I don\u2019t usually care for talking about sensitive\nsubject matter. But I will say, I\u2019m a strong supporter for Mental Health\nAwareness. This is something that plagues many people and is still so\nmisunderstood. I have my own demons, but I can affirm healing is possible and\nthere is help out there.  And try to\navoid the stigma. It will only bring you down. One of my favorite organizations\nis To Write Love On Her Arms. If you haven\u2019t heard of them, please give them a\nmoment of your time. And while you\u2019re at it, watch the movie. I can\u2019t put in to\nwords how strong and informational it is. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eI want to create\u003c/strong\u003e body positive and art through photography, for anyone\nwho needs to know they aren\u2019t alone. There is someone somewhere, who can relate\nto you and understand you. There are connections that lead to support systems.\nDon\u2019t shut yourself off. And \u003cstrong\u003eI want to\nprove\u003c/strong\u003e to myself that I am beautiful, regardless of the opinions of the\npeanut gallery. \u003cstrong\u003eBeauty really has no\nboundaries\u003c/strong\u003e. There is no set guideline. Embrace yourself, inside and out.\nThere\u2019s always going to be a flaw and someone is always going to criticize you.\nAnd I promise you, those things will not defeat your continued growth and never\nlet it get to your confidence. Love yourself. My life hasn\u2019t always been this positive\njourney for me. I\u2019ve struggled with an eating disorder, I\u2019ve been on both sides\nof bullying, I\u2019ve had a constant battle with my own body both physically and\nmentally, I\u2019ve given in to addiction. We all make mistakes. \u003cstrong\u003eThose imperfections don\u2019t define who we are\u003c/strong\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDown\nto my core, the inner essence of who I am, I stand by this:\u003cbr\u003eI am venturing\nout of my own shell, to be a \u003cu\u003epublic slayer of negativity\u003c/u\u003e to boost\nself-worth. \u003cbr\u003eI am the \u003cu\u003eexecutioner\nof self-hate\u003c/u\u003e and the \u003cu\u003eembracer of self-love.\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a \u003cu\u003emercy\nkiller of self-destruction\u003c/u\u003e and \u003cu\u003eadmirer of hope.\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\naren\u2019t defined by one thing. \u270c\ufe0f We are beautiful. \ud83d\udc9c\u00a0 We may be strange. \ud83d\udc7d\u00a0 But if you ask me, all of the best people are\nthose things. \ud83d\udc8b\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I aspire to become a SuicideGirl, to be part of what has inspired myself.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
