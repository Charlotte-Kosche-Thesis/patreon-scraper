    "summary": "Hey! thank you so much for checking out my Patreon! I\u0027m Adam and I make fun, informative, humorous and inspiring content on youtube, instagram, snapchat and twitter. I travel all over the world, eating weird food and making videos and taking pictures while also being a full-time actor (Santa Clarita Diet, iZombie, Up in the Air etc). I\u0027m working harder than ever to create daily content for you guys on my instagram and weekly videos on my youtube. That is what this Patreon is about. I love making content for you guys. It\u0027s what I live for. Though sometimes I can\u0027t make as much as I\u0027d like because I have to juggle my time with other work that I\u0027m sometimes less passionate about. That\u0027s why I started this patreon. I want to post more photos, videos, more vlogs, more behind the scenes, all of it. I also want to eventually hire someone part time to help me with exporting footage, uploading, assisting in different ways. Ultimately, I want to make more stuff for you, my viewers, my amazing army of an audience, to enjoy. But I need your help. Even if you can\u0027t join my patreon, sharing the link would be so appreciative. And please know that no matter how you support me, whether it\u0027s monetarily, morally, signal boosting, giving me a friendly nod if you see me on the street, or just subscribing to my stuff... I so appreciate you. And I can\u0027t thank you enough."
