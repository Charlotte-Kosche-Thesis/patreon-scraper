Your assistance allows me to give a little bit of you to the people that provide the program more diversity and helps me to explore new voices and compositional techniques. This means fascinating people like Doug Lynner, Mustafa, Michael Logue, Laura Steenberge, David Van Brink, David Tristram, LapDogs, Wayne Jackson, Jack Hertz, rizorkestra, Bill Walker and Paul Nicholson can come contribute more often and also helps ensure stage excursions, like the show at the MAH in Santa Cruz with an opportunity to compose and direct 5 musicians playing instruments ranging from Hurdy Gurdy and Viol to vocal delights, percussion and synthesized sounds can happen even more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/dK0QYb/wayne_later_days_400.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Guests are important to the show. They bring new perspective and timbre. They have to travel from their homes and studios to either the station or my studio to participate in the program. I would like to make my guests feel welcome and comfortable when they come. I think paying them for their time and travel contributes towards that. In the past they have all come for free. They have, like myself, a burning desire to create a unique brand of music. They will be able to come more often and even more people will be available if I can reimburse them as a thank you for their participation in this unique musical journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/dZaQYb/sebring_train_show_400.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your contribution is a monthly and regular donation, a small amount goes a long way when I know I can count on it.

Things like the sampling of a studio creation, special request R Duck show song treatment, contribute your story to the program, another Quack card, more blinking LED\u0027s \u00a0and so forth.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
