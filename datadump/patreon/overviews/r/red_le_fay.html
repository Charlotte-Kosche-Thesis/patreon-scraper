Huulllooooooo *waves frantically in your general direction* I\u0027m quirky and spergy and gay and my boobs are made of silicone. :D I\u0027ve popped up on Amazon\u0027s Transparent, I\u0027ve stood nude and painted in downtown Los Angeles, I\u0027ve written a butt-ton about film, television, video games, and transgender rights, and I\u0027m set to join the cast of a cool LGBT web series (Gates and Strays) for its upcoming second season. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make stuff about once every week or two. Either a photoshoot, a video essay, a weird skit video, a bunch of writing, or all four. Since I do donations per creation, it\u0027s def a trust thing! I don\u0027t spam the donation button, but I\u0027m a new account so it\u0027s up to you to trust me there. You can also set donation limits as to how much you want to give per month. I don\u0027t like monthly because A) I might not make any art in a month, who knows! and B) I don\u0027t want this to feel like Any Job cuz I know I just won\u0027t make anything. Even though this money is for production, it\u0027s also for food, but I don\u0027t want this to become A Chore that I grow to dread. I want this to *enable* my regular workflow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best way to follow what I\u0027m up to is check my facebook feed. I give away most things I make for free and have for years, but if you find my megadose of words and memes and photoshoots and things worthwhile, then feel free to join my other soft friends who are also donating. :3 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, though it is a shameless topical nod it also has the benefit of being true: I think in this current political climate, it\u0027s more important than ever to support the work of POC, LGBT folk, disabled folks, and other such groups.

Ten years, to be exact. My trans issues blog, translabyrinth.com. My YouTube page with 2k subs and 200k views. 95% of my five-and-a-half years in art and film journalism. My countless articles and write-ups (with one exception). My hundred podcast episodes, my many speaking event appearances, several dozen photoshoots (with two exceptions), acting gigs, published poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow hey, that\u0027s life. That\u0027s my fault. I didn\u0027t advocate on my own behalf. Like ever. I never thought my art was worth anything, so why would I *extort* people on its behalf? It would be robbery to take money for my dreadful crap. Robbery, I say! (Says I.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of giving my \"terrible\" art any breathing room, I tried to do what people told me to do. Get a \"real job.\" I was, let\u0027s see, a theatre house manager, floor staff at an independent theater, a waiter at an Indian restaurant, an organizer and rape crisis counselor, a domestic violence counselor, an accountant, a barista, a janitor, a warehouse worker, and other things besides!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14202594_10103583632483689_7573393852537237105_n.jpg?oh=e6c203ee8e9319f543edcaf59170e32f\u0026amp;oe=58D1BAB6\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuffice to say, none of this ever worked out for me. I have autism and I do very poorly in workplace relations. Or working with people at all. When one boss I had in DC walked into our shared office, when she closed and locked the door behind her, sat between me and the door, and said \"I don\u0027t like the way your brain works, and I think it will hold you back for the rest of your life,\" she was neither the first nor the last to tell me so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tried to fit in as a straight man (I was super bad at it! My beard was nice, tho.) And hell I just couldn\u0027t hack it, so I finally accepted that I was (and always had been) a gay woman. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tried to fit in as a normal employee, and I\u0027m finally accepting that that will never, ever happen. I\u0027ve been in therapy for years, I\u0027ve read so many books and articles and talked with so many people whose brains work like mine. Tried to learn how to CHANGE. But none of it helped! Eventually you gotta decide whether something is a matter of self-improvement and personality tweaking, or whether you just are who you are and there\u0027s nothing you can or should do to change it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLol I guess you could say I\u0027m coming out as an artist. ;D That lowest form of life, who creates things that bring thought and joy to others! The horror. *shakes fist at...err...myself, I guess?*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReal talk now. I\u0027ve been without a stable home since 2012. My name has only ever been on a rent agreement once in that time, for a few months, and otherwise I\u0027ve hauled my bags from couch to spare room to floor to spare room and so on for years. Or just been homeless for stretches. All the while smashing and burning out of job after job, this latest though because I\u0027ve developed difficulties walking which the doctor is still trying to figure out why.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFun fun fun!
