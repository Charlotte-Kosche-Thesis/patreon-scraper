    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHai Hai to all my Regular fans! This is Kiid also known as RegularAnimationsXD on youtube and I am a very passionate animator!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are you?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell now that you asked so kindly I am Kiid and I have been animating for about 4 years now. Many of my inspirations come from DBZ, SMBZ, Final Fantasy, just a lot of video game and anime mixture. Unfortunately my home isn\u0027t the type of work environment for me to work faster or even create bigger things for the being time right now. This is where Patreon comes in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT PROJECTS WILL YOU BE CREATING?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThanks again for asking so kindly! There\u0027s a few series I want to create! One which I\u0027ve already announced called \"Sonic: A World Of Chaos\". There\u0027s a 2 more projects I want to get to but both I think I should keep a secret until I can actually find time to create them. For the meantime I often stream video games and you guys can talk with me there and pretty much ask me anything! My goal is to be able to create amazing animations for all of you to enjoy in various styles for all. Here is just a fraction of the animation quality I can produce for the time being.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUWFMaeyqYE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere can even be guest animators that will feature in my projects and I\u0027ll even produce collabs for you all to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE IS MY MUNNIES GONNA BE GOING TOWARDS?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYOU ASK SO MANY QUESTION I LIKE THAT! So as I said before all the funding will go towards getting a new place for me to animate. I feel like thats honestly what is holding me back so every cent I currently make on my own and what will be made here will go towards find a place for me to work on my projects in piece.Maybe eventually down the line I will need \u003cstrong\u003ebetter equipment or software \u003c/strong\u003ebut for now just a place to call home please! Anything more than the goal I will try to give back in whichever way I can either through giveaways, prizes, streaming and talking to fans whatever I can do to show my gratitude!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do want to throw in that I want this to work out because if it does I will be able to partner up with a couple of animators you guys all know! THEN WE CAN REALLY CREATE SOMETHING GREAT!"
