My name is Rita and I write stories.  Welcome to my Creator page here on Patreon!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a story teller all my life. \u00a0I wrote my first story on paper, at 7 years old, and spent my childhood writing stories and drawing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an adult, I continued to write short stories off and on as time allowed.  But something I began noticing was that the more I wrote, the more stories began to come into my awareness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI call myself a Story noticer.  I notice the stories that happen in my daily life.  And what is interesting about that is when I write them down, they read like fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the many jobs I do to earn my living has me spending a lot of time outdoors interacting with nature. \u00a0I have learned to tune my awareness to certain things happening that most of us don\u0027t notice in ordinary human consciousness. \u00a0So that\u0027s one way I notice stories. \u00a0It\u0027s a bit like tuning a radio receiver to a station. \u00a0And it happens automatically the more I write. \u00a0Seen this way, it seems very magical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome people call that style of story telling, Magical Realism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do various things to make my living. \u00a0I live on a homestead with my husband and partner Mike, and I grow food. \u00a0I also bind books for Pegana Press, which is our family run press making hand made letterpress books, which we sell. \u00a0I also practice a form of energy medicine called BodyTalk, so people come to me for that. \u00a0And I occasionally take on odd jobs in exchange for food or something else we might need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I write. \u00a0Sometimes, I write like mad, with stories flowing all around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I have started doing is putting these short stories into zines or as in the case of Winter Tales, in the form of a letterpress collectible chapbook typeset by hand by Mike at Pegana Press and hand sewn by me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a page on Patreon has helped me to reprioritize my time for story telling. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt has also helped me set deadlines so I continue to write constantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd just by creating this page, I\u0027m already feeling inspired. \u00a0So thank you for being here. \u00a0(excuse me, there goes a story now...I\u0027d better gather it in, before it gets away).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Update--Timeline:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is what I have been creating since joining Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoined: \u00a0August 15, 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReleased: \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3 editions of\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.peganapress.com/hearth---heart.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHearth \u0026amp; Heart\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, a collection of short stories released quarterly in 1/2 page zine format. \u00a0Short stories, collage, original artwork and photos.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3 short stories in 1/4 page zine format with collage for Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3 micro stories in mini zine format with collage for Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1/2 page zine \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.peganapress.com/other-features.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhere Do The Spoons Go?\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI also write and post a micro story every Monday for patrons under the heading \"Micro Monday\".
