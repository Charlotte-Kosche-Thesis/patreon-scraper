    "summary": "Hi everyone! I\u0027m here because I am trying my hardest to put my journalism degree to work and get back to what I love most: writing and discussion. I currently cover the National Women\u0027s Hockey League for an SB Nation site, The Ice Garden, but I don\u0027t get paid for it. I have a day job that I like, but is starting to run me into the ground, and as such, I really want to be able to put more effort into my craft so I can potentially land a paying gig. But there\u0027s just one problem: money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get paid fairly decently for my field of work and live in an area with a lower standard of living, but I still tend to struggle to pay my bills \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003ebe able to do things I feel will really help me with my writing career (such as travel to places for tournaments, go to away games, interview sources from out of town, etc.). I also don\u0027t have a reliably working laptop in order to make things like freelancing gigs happen at this point in time, though I am trying. As such, I am turning to Patreon to help get on my feet and be able to give YOU, my potential patrons, high-quality, thought-provoking content, both text and video (\u003cstrong\u003eyes, I want to start a women\u0027s hockey-centered YouTube channel as well!\u003c/strong\u003e). With your help, I\u0027ll be able to explore deeper topics not just in women\u0027s hockey, but in broader society as well -- having to do with gender, race, class, pop culture, current events and social justice. Interested? Well, join my party! There\u0027s room for everyone. :)"
