Will you support us? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2001, rabble has steadily grown to become Canada\u0027s most visited alternative, non-profit media outlet. In 2011, frustrated with the news coverage of Parliament and the Prime Minister\u0027s Office in Canada, we crowd-funded our own independent journalist to cover news on the Hill for the rest of us. Readers and like-minded progressive organizations came together and sent award-winning reporter Karl Nerenberg to the Hill. Since then, Karl has filed hundreds of stories and covered the issues that big media ignored. Karl is a veteran journalist, documentary filmmaker, and watchdog over the powerful. He digs deep into the affairs of parliament to bring you the overlooked stories that don\u0027t make the big media cut. He brings you real news.

We refuse to allow corporate media to give this government a free pass or ignore the people working towards positive social change. Let\u0027s build on Karl\u0027s work and create a space for a new force of young and talented independent journalists to hold this government\u0027s feet to the fire.\u003cbr\u003e"
