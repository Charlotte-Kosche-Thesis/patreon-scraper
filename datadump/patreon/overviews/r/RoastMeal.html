I\u0027m poor and want to bring an idea to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0just thought I would put up this patreon for anyone who was willing to join me in a little bit of modded minecraft fun within the VRC communities I seem to have found myself so deeply embedded in over the last few months, and of course anyone from the outside world looking for a good sesh.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course anyone willing to actually become a patron to the cause and help support a server and its monthly running costs will get some sweet rewards, that we have yet to figure out. Depending on the amount of people we have interested in this we can set up a discord with dedicated voice rooms and bring some in game goodies to the higher tiered sponsors \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne step at a time though, I am just asking for help on the first months payments and getting everything up and running, then we shall see where we can take this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso last but not least, as we dont have a dedicated server quite yet, DM me on discord @insane#9902 and we will see about getting you onto the placeholder server we are currently hosting off my spare computer!"
