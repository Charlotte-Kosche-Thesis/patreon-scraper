     "about": "Hi! \u00a0My name is Ricky Molina. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI write original music and produce music videos in different genres. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I also produce educational videos on composition, arrangement and production and do product reviews from time to time as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003etailor videos according the interests of my audience\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon members get to request songs according to their tastes as well as participate in the earnings of my original compositions from commercial sync placements!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a classically trained guitarist who grew up playing and appreciating the music of Sor, Tarrega, Carcassi, and all the romantic classical composers particularly. \u00a0But I\u0027m also heavily influenced by \u00a0the great rock groups and guitarists of the 70\u0027s and and 80\u0027s (you know who they are) and anything with a beat - like the jazz funk of Earth Wind and Fire, Brick as well as dIsco artists like Donna Summer, Chaka Khan KC and the Sunshine Band etc. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently (over the past 15\u00a0years), I\u0027ve been immersed in \u003cstrong\u003ejazz\u003c/strong\u003e, and have expanded my repertoire to incluse \u003cstrong\u003ebossa nova, latin rhythms, bebop and\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also keen on writing \u003cstrong\u003eorchestral pieces that incorporate beautiful natural vistas and scenery\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0You can see a few of them on the Ricky Molina YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also see that \u003cstrong\u003eI write music for children\u0027s stories, and do the voice-overs and narration as well\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a whole bunch of songs that I wrote in my demo archives that are ready to go. Many of these songs are orchestral, jazz, country ballads, guitar solos or rock oriented. \u00a0I finally decided to produce these original song ideas that were building up dust on the shelf - and invested in a home recording studio, as well as music production, orchestral arranging and sound engineering courses that help me produce professionally sounding recordings for everyone. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBottom line, I love all kinds of music, and if you listen closely to my work you\u0027ll soon find that I really can\u0027t be pigeon-holed into any one musical genre or style. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy heritage and upbringing has exposed me to so much great music in different genres and cultures - and I would love to share my passion for creating music with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to post videos weekly - these include orchestral pieces (with nature, meditative or new age themes), classical and jazz guitar arrangements, childrens book narrations with original music, music for sync, pop, rock, country and ballads. I will also produce educational orchestral and arrangement studies of classical, pop, rock and jazz pieces, and provide my supporters with product reviews and tips on producing music and/or videos. \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease have a look at my rewards page, where I give my fans a host of gifts for their support. \u00a0I also have 5 tiers of rewards for co-ownership of original material. \u00a0Have an idea for a commercial, film or video game and need music to make it fly? \u00a0Send me one or two reference tracks (sometimes known as \"demo tracks\") to give me an idea of the kind of music you\u0027d like. \u00a0We can discuss finer points as well - I\u0027d be happy to write music for your business or media project! \u00a0And the neat thing is that I am pretty confident that I can write a musical variation that suits your needs and that you\u0027ll be happy with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a supporter of my Patreon page, I really value your input. \u00a0I will direct my energies to areas of your interest as best as I can - and continue to make great music videos in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your support!",
