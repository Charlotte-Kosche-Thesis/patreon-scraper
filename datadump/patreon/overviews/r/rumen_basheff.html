You take a part in making art. In exchange for support, artists listen to their Patrons for suggestions or simply give access to rare or behind the scenes shots. Patreon also protects models by allowing only interested audience to access the content.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo setup with Patreon, you provide a name which can be a pseudonym, a credit card and an email address. The\u00a0credit card is billed for the monthly pledge amount.\u00a0When I post new content, you get notified. You can also talk to me via private messages or inline comments.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/b93i08g4hpqfpnk/_D4A8214.JPG?raw=1\" style=\"background-color: initial; width: 317px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eAbout me:\u003c/h4\u003e\nI am inspired by the ways in which people \n\u003cstrong\u003ecraft, build, and sculpt\u003c/strong\u003e their bodies. I find the human body fascinating \u2013 not just when presented for a competition. We all have control of our bodies during daily living; we devote time to developing strength, flexibility, endurance, power, body-centered spirituality, and energy.\u003cbr\u003e\nI celebrate the human body in rope. It\u0027s about the beauty and power and shape of the human body. Rope enhances what a body can do and allows a pose to last longer. It often replaces musculature that quickly becomes fatigued in non-rope holds or hangs. A second person, the \n\u003cstrong\u003erope artist\u003c/strong\u003e, guides the spirit and drives the effort, the determination, courage, commitment and endurance to achieve something. I utilize the body as an artistic canvas, molding and shaping the \u003cstrong\u003eaesthetic form using ropes\u003c/strong\u003e as the brush. The emotional energy is the paint providing shading.\u003cbr\u003e\nI often sprinkle eroticism and sexuality in my work. It is only natural - the achieved pose is attractive, stimulating to both the person in the rope and the artist who contemplates his result. This said, many people regard the connections created within rope as exclusively sexual or erotic, or a dominant/submissive practice. This is not correct. There are many forms of emotional connection associated with the practice of Shibari\n\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe person in rope develops feelings of absolute trust, safety, and personal surrender which lead to physical and emotional release. The person applying rope has a deep empathy for their partner in the form of nurture and protection. This form of connection penetrates one\u0027s spiritual realm, becomes extremely rewarding for both sides.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach of my ties is a unique, special memory.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4dk13cczkw1ish/_D4A7892.JPG?raw=1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe time and energy needed to grow in rope and photography is\n\u003cstrong\u003e incompatible with a full-time career\u003c/strong\u003e. Leaving a reliable 9-5 job (and the associated paychecks) behind requires \u003cstrong\u003eYOU \u003c/strong\u003ethe art fan, the rope student to step in and help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eMy .COM home is \u003ca href=\"https://rumenbasheff.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://rumenbasheff.wordpress.com/\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI also accept direct\u00a0PayPal and Venmo donations.

     "about": "Rope! It marries the logical and artistic sides of my brain. The logical side is technique, safety and correctness. The other side is a connection just like in dance which slows and speeds, which allows for artistic expression of both partners without a single defined lead. The process of tying is soothing to me on the low ramp; excitement, challenge and gratification build on the way up. I thank my partners in kink that collaborated with me on artistic expression and play.\u003cbr\u003eI tie and photograph to push the edges of what has been done before. I am fascinated by the human body in general. Rope stimulates my thoughts about how the body moves in rope. You might see me sketching poses from aerial silks, yoga, ballet or dance and thinking how to lift and freeze them in the air. I thus partially have an idea where I am going during a shoot, but our connection and your ideas might take us anywhere.\u003cbr\u003e",
