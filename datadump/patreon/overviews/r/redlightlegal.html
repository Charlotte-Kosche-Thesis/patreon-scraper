    "summary": "I\u2019m starting this crowdfunding campaign as a personal call for support because my work as Red Light Legal is personal. This project is just me. And while I have had support from many brilliant people in the sex work, radical legal, and nonprofit communities, this project has largely been a solo adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver 3 years ago I launched Red Light Legal, a nonprofit providing legal support to people working in the sex industry. I was still in law school, but felt the need to respond organizationally to the very real, very harmful increase in punitive action being taken against sex workers in Oakland and beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work changes shape constantly in response to individual/community needs and available resources, though through all my focus is to support those most impacted by violence, enacted by both the state and individuals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting myself in this work has not been easy; as other sex worker advocates can attest, our grant applications get sent into a black hole as even the most \u201cprogressive\u201d funders refuse to support sex work projects that are harm reductionist and refute the \u201carrest as rescue\u201d narrative. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs it stands, Red Light Legal will be out of money next spring. When this happens I will no longer have funds to maintain the infrastructure of the organization and ability to commit myself to this work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn order to sustain the work I love (and to keep a roof over my head while I do it,) I need to raise $2,000 a month.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCan you help me make that goal?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s a short list of work I love to do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-SSI/SSDI disability cases. Battling the federal government is long, traumatizing, and ultimately impossible for most people who could obtain benefits. The vast majority of SSI lawyers work on contingency, which means they only take on \u201cslam dunk\u201d cases, leaving very little support for impoverished disabled folks, especially those who have \u201cinvisible\u201d disabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Running an online legal clinic. As far as I know I\u2019m the only person available to candidly answer general legal questions about sex work related issues and give sex work-competent referrals nationwide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Teaching sex workers to better protect \u0026amp; advocate for themselves. I absolutely can\u2019t stand professional gatekeeping, which means whenever possible I work with folks to help them feel competent in their own legal advocacy. I do this in workshops and trainings, how-to tutorials, and stockpiled templates, sharing them freely so that we can become less reliant on non-sex workers who might not fully understand unique needs and better equipped to support one another. #letsdocommunism\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Disaster preparedness. For some folks, especially for trans and queer people, our legal systems make transphobic \u0026amp; queerphobic harm inevitable: like at arrest, incapacitation, or at death. Harm reduction work isn\u2019t just about reducing the number of instances of harm, but also mitigating harm as its happening and preventing further trauma and chaos. I try to help folks think about the hard things so that maybe they won\u2019t be so hard if they happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Court support. Support for someone who has to deal with the legal system can look really different. Sometimes it means helping someone collect evidence, prepare for judge\u2019s questions, or being a legal translator between a public defender and their client. Sometimes it means making sure their partner has transportation to a hearing so they won\u2019t be alone.\u003cbr\u003e"
