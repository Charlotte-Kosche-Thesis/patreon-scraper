    "summary": "Hi everyone! Thank you so much for making your way to my Patreon page. I have so many ideas and projects I want bring to life and I\u0027m hoping all of you will be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to experience the world and for you to experience it with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I love photographing, what I\u0027m most\u00a0passionate about is making friends out of strangers. I\u0027ve never had a time more memorable than going on a road trip with people I\u0027ve just met. You learn about their past, their passions, and their dreams; It\u0027d be hard for me to name something more beautiful. I want to be able to live in the moment, learn from people from all walks of life and cherish the memories that I\u0027ve been given.\u00a0In my efforts to live this, I\u0027ve run into many things that hold me back. Working unrelated jobs to fund my photography and trips take time away from shooting and, jobs where I can make money with my passion force me to create images and advertisements I simply am not proud of and don\u0027t want my name on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is going to help me balance the time I spend at traditional jobs and focus on the content I put out there. As well as help fund the things that I\u0027ve wanted to create for a long time including prints, stories, and artbooks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see more of my work visit rvlis.com or find me on Instagram @rvlis\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions please see below, or email me ralis@rvlis.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to support my photography in exchange for rewards. Different amounts correspond to different rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you click the \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d button, you can select how much you want to pledge per set (sets are a package of my photos that are released 1-2 times per month). You\u0027ll be charged automatically, and can adjust or cancel your pledge at anytime. Seriously though, there\u0027s no pressure \u2013 the work I share on Instagram will always be free \u2013 but I appreciate any support.\u003cbr\u003e"
