It is like Kickstarter in that fans pledge money to artists so they can make stuff. But, rather than a bunch of money all at once for a really big thing, fans pledge a smaller amount of money for a more consistent stream of smaller-scale things.\u003cbr\u003eAnd where Kickstarter asks for money first and then uses it to make a big thing, on Patreon the artist asks for money AFTER the thing is already made, i.e. a tip for a job well done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(184,204,228);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often are you going to be putting out songs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eA maximum of once per 1/2 months, these projects take a huge amount of time to complete.

I know it existed and i LOVED it but it didn\u0027t really cross my mind as something i would ever be able to try myself. I had no musical people in my family at the time and never took music in school, you have to have a \"Gift\" right? you know, that thing that you either got \"it\" or you aint!. \u00a0At 18 and with little to look forward to in my academic pursuits i decided to give the guitar a go. It was at this moment that my life and outlook on it completely changed and allowed me to feel like i could contribute something, it is \u003cstrong\u003ethis\u003c/strong\u003e feeling that i have wanted to try and pass on to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realised very quickly that there is some musical connection in everyone, most feel they can\u0027t contribute to the music out there and so i began to teach on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/rexpearson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e so that others could self study from home like me and see that anyone can do it regardless of background or that \"Natural ability\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://j.mp/SubToRex\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echannel\u003c/a\u003e has grown beyond anything i could have imagined and i thought it was high time I give those learning some cool stuff to listen too. I began making music videos and shows that showcase the best that i can do and working with the best musicians i can find hopefully it will help to inspire those learning or those who just enjoy music with something of me in there. I always like to put a twist (guitar influenced of course!) on all my cover tunes and try to bring out the best in the musicians I\u0027m working with and the result I film for you to check out.\u00a0You can check out one of my latest vids below featuring some of my good friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/czoi0hrOcT0?rel=0\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will happen if you support me? The Future?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy vision for this channel is to try and create a hub for anyone interested in my music, anyone interested in their music or anyone thinking that they would like to start being a musician and of course a place to create something different and, well, COOL! I love Making these videos, its just a ton of fun - not only do I get to collaborate with so many talented people, but I also get to meet really awesome supporters that inspire me to create new things and keep pushing. My videos have got so much better as a result of other peoples support and i owe them so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to make this project even bigger, and to release new pop song transformations more often.  \u003cstrong\u003eRight now, I typically release one music video a month.  If I can get enough of a production budget, though, I\u0027ll aim to release one every week. I\u0027ll even quit my current job! (see the goals)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn addition, I\u0027m planning to offer more educational material on my website ( \u003ca href=\"http://www.rexpearson.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.rexpearson.com\u003c/a\u003e) and \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/rexpearson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e, and of course my Patreon page so that others can learn music the way that I did. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron, you can help with all that!  I\u0027ve created some rewards as a thank you, including invite-only private live chats and some other cool things as a way of saying thanks. Take a look!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOf course, becoming a patron is totally optional! \u003c/strong\u003e If you don\u0027t have the money to do this, it\u0027s totally cool - I\u0027ll always continue making videos for you, and I\u0027d love to hear from you no matter what!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThanks for watching, and best wishes,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/rexpearsonguitarist\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/rexpearson\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://j.mp/SubToRex\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRex Pearson\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I want to create a piece of music to where all the proceeds goto charity and produce a video that captures the emotions that are felt when you go through something like this. The crew are in place, the music recorded and the idea ready to shoot. We just need a hospital to shoot the video, i found one but they won\u0027t give it for free (damn it!) so if i hit this goal i\u0027ll be able to make this video and hopefully make a big difference to the charity (donations) and awareness (music video) You can help make this happen!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://donatelifecalifornia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Brittany_Johnson.jpg\" style=\"width:224px;\" alt=\"Brittany_Johnson.jpg\" /\u003e",

Now that I\u0027m creating music as well as education videos the website badly needs a facelift! I have a lot of ideas on how to make a kick ass website with loads of fun features and community aspects. Some things include.... Proper forums, Interactive video pages, Create you very own profile,, Live chats, not to mention a better layout and tons of other features that will need a pro design company to take the helm. \u00a0It will provide a new place to learn guitar, get inspired to be a musician and watch cool music videos!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://foxtailmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/web-design.jpg\" style=\"width:221px;\" alt=\"web-design.jpg\" /\u003e",
