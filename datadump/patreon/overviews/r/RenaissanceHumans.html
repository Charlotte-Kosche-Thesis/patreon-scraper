    "summary": "Okay here\u0027s the deal with who I am and why I\u0027m starting a Patreon account:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Situation: \u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Andrew Perlot, and I started reaching out through the internet in 2008 to help save people the agony I went through when I was suffering from colitis. I ditched that intestinal disease, even though my doctor told me I\u0027d be saddled with it for life. I did it by switching to a diet of fruits and veggies (Doctor told me colitis has nothing to do with diet). I also lost 62 pounds, got myself from sick to healthy, and became an enthusiastic athlete. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u0027ve been focusing on sharing the science behind health, fitness, weight loss, and emotional/mental well being with the world, and I\u0027ve been pretty successful at it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Work:\u003c/strong\u003e Several million people have read my articles, listened to my podcasts, and watched my videos over the years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy efforts have been centered around the idea that a segment of the population actually wants to understand what underlies their health troubles, as well as their failures to achieve fitness, weight loss, and happiness goals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think many people are tired of unsupported internet claims, clickbait-y articles, and attempts to convince them they can be saved from their troubles by the newest supplement or fad diet. I think people still have the attention spans for in-depth articles and other content that goes into the science instead of making stuff up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaying The Bills And Bettering The World:\u003c/strong\u003e Ideally, I want to give most of my content away for free, and I\u0027ve done a lot of that. Most of what I\u0027ve created over the years has been given away without asking anything in return. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I\u0027m always having to balance the desire to give life-changing info to people, regardless of their ability to pay, with the fact that I need to pay my own bills. To do this I\u0027ve run ads on my old website and sold books. This has downsides, however. Sometimes the ads are trashy or directly in opposition to the facts I\u0027m providing in my articles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my popular-and-free endeavors - like my podcast - failed to attract a sponsor that I viewed as compatible with my values. Despite having a very successful show, I had to cancel it because it wasn\u0027t coming close to covering its costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo making sure I can pay my bills has reduced my offerings and made my old website cheesy with ads. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You Should Contribute To My Efforts:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to be doing more to improve your life and the world at large, and to do that I need to be able to not care about whether or not an endeavor will make money if I think it\u0027s a worthwhile cause. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started a new website, RenaissanceHumans.com, and I want to make it self sustaining so I can improve and expand what I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start, I want to never put ads on it. Ads are frankly annoying and hurt the user experience, but they do make money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe alternative is for all of my many readers, watchers , and listeners to step up and contribute a tiny amount toward making my efforts sustainable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow This Works: \u003c/strong\u003ePatreon allows readers to donate whatever they want per month. Donations recur each month. Anything from $1/month on up is hugely helpful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy initial goal is to raise $500/month, with the eventual goal of hitting $3,000 per month. This money\u00a0 will go to cover:\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA New Renaissance Humans Podcast: \u003c/strong\u003eSo many of you have asked me to bring back the podcasts because you loved my interviews and science-focused discussion topics. I\u0027m going to do it when we have enough cash flow to cover my time investment in the podcasts, which is in the $500/month level. However, to wet your appetite and pay back early contributors, I will produce three podcasts when I get my first $100/month, another two when we hit $200, two more when we hit $300, and a final two when we hit $400.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting: \u003c/strong\u003eIt costs money to host my websites, and the greater the traffic, the more expensive it gets.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAweber: \u003c/strong\u003eThe service we use to email new articles and videos to the subscription list.
