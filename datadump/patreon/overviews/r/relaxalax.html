My content on RelaxAlax began with coverage of Super Smash Brothers for Wii U/3DS before it\u0027s release.

I wish to grow my brand to a level where I could basically do anything after my time on the website is over. For now however, Patreon gives me a chance to make ends meet - I\u0027m a young adult (almost) finished my studies at University and want to move out to my own place. The freedom given to me by having my own office space and a pad I can truly work in is all I\u0027ve dream of.\u00a0 I\u0027m sure you know this, but YouTube is unreliable - I can\u0027t gauge how much I\u0027ll make in a year and \u003cstrong\u003ethat\u0027s scary.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003ePatreon gives me the chance to feel safe while pursuing my goals.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eYou should know also that I don\u0027t pigeonhole myself.

Basically, it\u0027ll let me throw out research ideas that I may not feel comfortable talking about in videos yet. These blogs could make the jump to video if they have enough going for them. They\u0027re meant to be easy-going reads on topics of game design and story telling. Secondly, there will be short editing tutorials breaking down an effect in a recent video. I\u0027ve had requests to show how I edit so this\u0027ll be a prime tier for those interested in learning all they can about my style.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$3 tier \u003c/strong\u003e- This takes you close to the videos. First, you\u0027re in a private discord with other patrons and myself. I don\u0027t joke when I say it\u0027s probably the only Discord server I frequent so it\u0027ll be good if you want to casually chat or toss ideas at me like other Patrons have. This tier also allows you to view videos early! Since I have videos done 24hrs before they go live, this\u0027ll let you see it right when the upload bar fills!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5 tier \u003c/strong\u003e-\u00a0 Immortalise your support! This year let\u0027s you appear on the Endcard - forever! Even if you pledge 1 month, you\u0027ll find your way onto every video from here on out! Also, you;ll get the chance to play sub games with Alax on streams if the game presents itself. This is a pretty loose reward however, in that we could do other things such as do collective art streams or hang out in Discord talking.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10 tier\u003c/strong\u003e -\u00a0 So you think you\u0027re hot shit? Well, this tier will treat you like it. Past rewards of this tier have been merch such as stickers, t-shirts, and key-chains. Since these items became a pain to mail out, I cut down on this tier and allowed the lower tiers a chance at some of the perks. This tier will still have exclusive merch, just annually. I\u0027ll still send out the odd letter or two if I feel like I want to send you guys something juicy, but this tier is really for the lovely people who want to go above and beyond. And to those who have, you know I love you \u0026lt;3.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eMy goal with Patreon is to ultimately use it to build myself up without needing to rely on underhanded money making practices. I want to be 100% true to you and the content. So for those who have given me this privilege, thank you.
