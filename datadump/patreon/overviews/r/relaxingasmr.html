Welcome to the Patreon page of RelaxingASMR. The fact\nthat you\u0027re here reading this means you are probably a subscriber to my YouTube\nchannel. If so, thank you. I\u0027ve worked hard to make my channel a place for you\nto relax and unwind while hopefully getting some ASMR tingles. My hope is that you will read further, and become a patron of my work.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003ePatreon is a remarkable method to help support the artists\nwhose work you enjoy. It\u0027s a funding platform that\nprovides a convenient way for someone like you, to give regular support to the\nartists you love, who are creating content on an ongoing basis! It is sort of like leaving a tip for a restaurant server that\nworked hard to make your dining experience the best, or a tip-jar for the piano\nplayer that made your evening memorable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy video making days began the day after Christmas 2011 after\nreceiving an iPhone as a gift, and I have not looked back since. During this video journey, I\u0027ve learned that even though it\u0027s fun for me to actually shoot the videos, creating videos\nof good quality requires a great deal of time and effort, and this is one of the reasons I created this Patreon page, to help offset the time-cost of creating content on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other reason I set up this Patreon page is to help me acquire and incorporate better equipment and software into my video-making efforts. I feel that I\u0027ve made technical progress with my videos considering that\nI\u0027ve not invested much money into equipment, but I\u0027m always looking to take things to a\nhigher level, and that requires better video and sound equipment, as well as better editing software and computer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s frustrating to throw out half a\ndays work because of technical dissatisfaction, but I\u0027ve had to do just that on\nmore than one occasion and start the process all over again hoping for better\nresults. It is easy to tie up an entire day shooting a video and then there are the post-production hours\nduring the week, putting it all together into something pleasing to watch, but, I do it, not only because it\u0027s fun, but because so many of you enjoy my videos. It\u0027s rewarding to know that my videos play a part in relaxing you, or helping you sleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,242,202);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eYou might wonder how would you benefit from becoming my Patron?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,242,202);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like my work and want to see more of it\nmore often, then you\u0027ll benefit from becoming a Patron. \u003cstrong\u003eYour encouraging contributions will\nmean good things for the future of my channel\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking relaxing ASMR videos has become a passion\nand I hope to continue this pursuit for a very long time. I have an endless supply of content and so much more to show you, and because of this, I have\nset up this Patreon account to help with my efforts in making my unique\nstyle of videos available on YouTube.
