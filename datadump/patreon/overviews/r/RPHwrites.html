Some of them are true hauntings, some are paranormal\nmysteries, some are cozy mysteries with witches, and some don\u2019t have anything\nto do with any of those things at all. \ud83d\ude0a\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was a ghostwriter for many years but, luckily,\nback in 2014 my own books started taking off and I was eventually able to quit\nmy full-time job to become a full-time author of my own material.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have two popular series out: the Taryn\u2019s\nCamera series-about a woman who sees the past through her camera-and the\nKentucky Witches\u2019 series. All 12 books have topped their Amazon categories and\nbecome certified \u201cbest sellers.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nalso create ghost hunting and paranormal videos with my kids, Sam and Iris\n(known on You Tube as \u201cGhost Kids\u201d), and I\u2019m working on a podcast called That\nWeird Family. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSo\nwhy do I need YOU? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e1) Help with marketing funds \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ve taught myself book marketing from the ground up.\nI even offer coaching services that provide marketing assistance to other\nauthors. The knowledge is there, the funds aren\u2019t. It\u2019s become a Catch-22: you need\nto market for readers to find your books but if your readers can\u2019t find your\nbooks then you aren\u2019t earning royalties and, therefore, can\u2019t market. And marketing\nis expensive. (More about that later)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e2) Help with finding more \u201ctime.\u201d \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI certain physical limitations that make it difficult for\nme not only to write, but also to engage in \u201cnormal\u201d daily activities that I\nused to take for granted before I became ill\u2013things like getting dressed,\neating, walking to the bathroom, etc.  To sustain my family\u2019s way of life\nwhich, believe me, is nowhere near extravagant, I sometimes must take on\nadditional writing jobs for other people. I may only be physically able to sit\nup and write for 2 hours a day; I would rather that time go toward my own\nbooks, rather than someone else\u2019s. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I think about a long-term self-sustaining\nplan, I have decided to branch out into two different areas:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n1) More coaching services and courses: I\u2019ve\nspent a lot of time helping out other indie authors over the past few years. I\nbegan to notice, however, that I was sometimes spending up to 3 or 4 hours a\nday answering questions, for free, in forums and in private messages. I\u2019ve now\ndecided to put together some basic and affordable coaching services and courses\nto help those authors out. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n2) Donations. Other authors have suggested that\nPatreon as a way for readers to support my books, and as a way for me to offer\nexclusive material to them in return. So I am giving it a try! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe way this works is a reader can donate\nwhatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after\nthat. Can\u2019t afford to pledge vey much? That is totally fine! Even $1 per month helps,\nhonestly!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat\u2019s Wrong With Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nhave a chronic and progressive rare medical condition called Ehlers-Danlos\nSyndrome. It\u2019s a connective tissue disorder that has wreaked havoc all over my\nentire body. It causes chronic pain, organ rupture, and frequent dislocations.\nWe thought that I had the hypermobility kind, which is still bad but\nsurvivable, but a year ago we learned that I have Vascular, which is much\nworse. I\u2019ve lost several organs from the condition and now have a thoracic aneurysm\nwhich is growing at an alarming rate. There is no cure for EDS and we aren\u2019t\nable to operate on my aneurysm, so all we do is manage the pain and various\nother symptoms that come with it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy\nEDS has caused a Chiari Malformation, too. (Basically, my brain tonsils hang\ndown into my neck which is NOT meant to happen.) Although I had brain surgery a\ncouple of years ago, I still have neurological issues from the condition. Brain\nfog, nerve pain, forgetfulness, chronic Chiari headaches, the occasional CSF\nleaks in my skull, etc. are regular parts of my life. The EDS has also caused\nrheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, sciatica, gastroparesis, peptic stomach\nulcers, chronic fatigue, bowel obstructions, hernias, and an array of other minor\nmedical conditions. To be honest, it\u2019s been difficult to enjoy the success I\u2019ve\nearned because not only do I spend a lot of time trying to manage my symptoms,\nbut I\u2019m also facing medical bills of more than $90,000. (We pay more in monthly\nmedical bills than we do for our mortgage and my student loans combined.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwill NOT let the EDS or anything else stand in the way of my books, however.\nAlthough there are \u201cbad days\u201d, in which I have trouble performing basic\nfunctions, I just try to ride those out and write even harder and smarter on the\n\u201cgood\u201d days. This is why, however, that I would prefer to put that energy\ntowards my own books, rather than continue to take up extra writing jobs to pay\nfor the marketing and other expenses that come along. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat I\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy initial goal is $2.500/month.

You know how, when you pull up a book\nthat you want to read and there\u2019s a big row of other books below it? We have to\npay to get our books to show up there. \u003cstrong\u003eCost\nper month: $500\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003epost \"boosts\". \u003c/strong\u003eIt used to be that whenever I made a post to\nmy FB page, just about everyone saw it. Now they don\u2019t. I have nearly 4,000 \u201clikes\u201d\non my page but fewer than 100 people even see a post, unless I pay to \u201cboost\u201d\nit. When I announce a new book or promo on Facebook, this ensures that\nthe post gets onto 1/3 or 1/2 of our Facebook followers\u0027 News Feeds. \u003cstrong\u003eCost: $300 per month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPromo services.\nSometimes, as an author, I like putting my books on sale. It\u2019s a \u201cthank you\u201d to\nmy current readers who, perhaps, didn\u2019t get the chance to read the book\nearlier. It also helps me bring in new readers. Those promo services like Robin\nReads, ENT, Fussy Librarian, etc. all cost money. In fact, Book Bub charges me\n$400 just to run one promo for a single day. \u003cstrong\u003eCost: $400 per month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eMe.\u003c/strong\u003e My book sales are good, but I am no\nStephen King. Like any other small business, it fluctuates from one month to\nthe next. I may have a GREAT month, but then it\u2019s followed by two slow ones. Keeping\nthe internet on, so that I can actually update this page and upload my books to\nAmazon, and keeping the electric working is pretty essential to the whole\nwriting process. \u003cstrong\u003eCost: $200 per month\n(internet and electric)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eOne\neditor. \u003c/strong\u003eIf you belong to a big publishing house, they hire an editor for you.\nThat\u2019s not an expense that you have to cover yourself. If you\u2019re an indie\nauthor, however, you have to find a way to cover that cost. I have been through\nMANY editors. I once paid $800 to an editor who got awesome reviews, only to\nhave to get the book re-edited because they missed so many mistakes. I finally\nfound a GOOD editor who works well with me. Since I release a book almost every\nmonth, I have worked out a deal with her to keep her on retainer. \u003cstrong\u003eCost: $300\nper month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s the basics.
