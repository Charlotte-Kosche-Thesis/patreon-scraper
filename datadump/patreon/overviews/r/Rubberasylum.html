We find ourselves with the original playroom back after 5 years, and we will now be focusing on the best of gay fetish content both from us and the best the internet has to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I only invite my followers to buy us a round of drinks, in the grand scheme of things I would like to invest in new HD video cameras for the playroom, as well as bring back the website with daily writing from many writers across many communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you once again, here is to 10 years of perversion, and here\u0027s to 10 years more :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith That, Visiting Time is over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t scream too loud as others are trying to sleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Asylum"

You know when you hear the click of that lock that you are there to stay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost are designed with proprietary keys so only the holder can let you out, and the truly special of these tout a breaking strength of over one-thousand pounds rendering escape to be all but a pipe dream for the person caught within their grasp.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe feelings and sensations brought on by this level of helplessness hark back to the days of old style institutions where the restraints were the center of your treatment. A time before terms like patients rights and chemical restraints were even entered in to the lexicon.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eA world where just by upsetting the wrong person a patient was liable to be placed in immobilizing restraints and dark seclusion for no reason other than sport. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour life was their say; your fate was decided for you; you were a member of the Asylum.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIn this world liberties were often taken, sadists ruled the guard-stations, and patients were at their mercy. When faced with this kind of torment and seclusion the seconds would pass like hours, the hours like days, and the days like an eternity.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis was not a medical world by any stretch; this was a holding pattern for lost souls. Odd and strange experimentation into the mind, in to sensation and human limits would take place within the depths of the institutions. \u003cbr\u003eNo regulation, no mercy, no way out The time has come once again to embrace this world. My World.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to The Rubber Asylum.\u003cbr\u003e",
