    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, friends! Welcome to our Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are Rainheart Symphony and our main goal is creating\nsymphonic metal covers. We release the covers in sets of four songs that outline\nthe same theme. Each month we are planning to release two new songs from a\ncurrent set. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, how do we make our\nvideos?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst of all, we choose a theme and pick 4 songs that\nfit it. The themes may vary from years of release\n(80s, 90s) and musical styles to countries or\neven a single band! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAfter the songs are selected, I start creating symphonic arrangements. That means that\nI analyze original melody, chords, and\narrangement and adapt everything for different\norchestral instruments as if a real orchestra played it. So, there are usually from 10 to 20 instruments and each\none has its own part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/jZHmm7/h_F23f_DDSD_o1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the orchestration is done,\nwe start a long rehearsing process of new material. It usually takes several weeks to get\nto the point when every piece sounds perfect and\neveryone is cool with the arrangements. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThen we begin to film\nour videos and record instrumental and vocal\nparts. Sometimes we film and record for up to 16 hours straight, but that\nbrings a lot of emotions. Usually we shoot on weekends and we LITERALLY live at\nthe studio: we sleep there, eat there, and chill\nthere (if we have time :) ). The\nstudio has already become our second home. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/dNSaeS/IMG_7637.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen filming is over and records are done here comes\nthe most difficult part - mixing and mastering of all tracks and editing of the\nvideos. I do it all myself (at least for the time being) and on average I spend\nfive or six 12-hour work days on making one song and video for it (and that\u2019s\nif my computer won\u2019t act up on me which is a whole different story). I\u2019m a\nperfectionist and I probably could spend less time on everything, but I just\ncan\u2019t settle on something that I\u2019m not totally satisfied with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we are those crazy people who do it all for free!\nAnd, of course, we\nalso spend a lot of our own money to buy or rent equipment and a lot of energy\nto actually do it. Our dream is to make a living from our music, but it would\nbe very nice to at least cover our expenses for now. And, even if we don\u2019t, we still will keep on creating because it is\nour very life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/geXKwERrkOE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope, by now you are\nalready thinking: \u201c\u003cdel\u003eShut up and take my money!\u003c/del\u003e Take all my money right now! Guys, you are awesome!\u201c\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut wait, friend, \u003cstrong\u003edo you know how this thing works?\u003c/strong\u003e I\nmean do you know what Patreon is? We are glad to tell you! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform where we will upload our\nexclusive content for our subscribers. You can directly pledge any amount of\nmoney to back our project starting from one dollar per video. There are\ndifferent levels of patronage with different rewards, so you can choose the one\nto your liking. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u2019ve mentioned\nbefore, we\u2019re going to post two videos a month. So if you pledge $1 per video,\nit will add up to $2 a month, etc. All pledges are customizable. If you\u0027re\nconcerned about going over your budget, you can set a monthly maximum for\n1 video/month during the signup process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funds will be transferred at the 1st day of each month. You can change the pledge\nor cancel your subscription anytime you wish, no hard feelings! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd now you might say: \u201cGOT IT! Can I give you my\nmoney now?\u201d Wait, waaait, waaaaaait\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u2019t you wanna know what you\u2019ll get?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re eager to offer something REALLY special to you!\n;) Here are the rewards you can get for becoming our patron (each next item\nincludes the previous positions): \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cstrong\u003eearly access to all our videos\nand patron-only feed\u003c/strong\u003e (behind the scenes videos, sneak peek photos,\nQ\u0026amp;A\u0027s).  And whatever crazy things we\ncome up with!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$3\u003c/strong\u003e - an opportunity to \u003cstrong\u003evote for our next themes\nand songs\u003c/strong\u003e. Your opinion is really important to us! Note: we\u2019ll need at least 15\npeople to participate to get a \u201cclear reading\u201d of the results.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cstrong\u003eMP3 download of every new cover right after\nits release\u003c/strong\u003e. Here\u2019s the thing, we create the covers in sets, and it would only\nbe logical to release them the same way, right? So we\u2019ll get them to iTunes,\nGoogle play, and other services as EPs, but only\nafter the fourth song is out. But here you can get the download on the day of each song release (or the next day at the latest)!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cstrong\u003eorchestral version of every new cover right\nafter its release and your name in the credits\u003c/strong\u003e at the end of our videos.\nIf you\u2019re really into that symphonic sound, it\u2019s your chance to get a version\nwith only vocals and orchestra. And it\u2019s not available anywhere else!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$15\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cstrong\u003eyou offer a song \u003c/strong\u003e(that fits the next\nannounced theme) and we\u0027ll include it in the poll. The same deal as with\nopportunity to vote, but here we\u2019ll need 15 more people besides you and other\npatrons who chose this option. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAlso I would like to say\nthanks to you all for taking your time to read it, and to every patron who has already joined us, and to everyone who is\nconsidering becoming our patron! You all inspire us to make more music and do\nit as best as we can! And it doesn\u2019t really matter how much you\u2019re ready to spend on supporting our project, it is\nyour appreciation and feedback that we really care about! Even if you can\u0027t\nsupport us financially now, you still can share our videos on social media\nand it helps us a lot. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eGreetings and thanks from the band!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlexandra\u003cbr\u003e"
