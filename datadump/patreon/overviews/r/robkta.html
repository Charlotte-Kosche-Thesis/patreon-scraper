    "summary": "Greetings and Buonasera everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Roberto but everybody calls me RoBKTA and I\u0027m a VGM remixer and music producer/composer based in Italy. I\u0027ve been able to switch my passion for music from a simple hobby to something more as it gained me some exposure in the video game music remixing community, through the release of many albums and singles (\"Club Needlemouse, \"OutRax\" and \"Cerulean DanceFloor\" among the most notable ones) along with a number of original compositions that made it to the Internet through various net-labels (Tiny Waves, Business Casual, Future Society Collective, etc.).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as I saw, it seems that many supporters of mine would love to give something back for the music I\u0027ve been doing until now, and that\u0027s why I decided to create myself a Patreon: I see it as a chance for me to give more to my audience, improve more and at the same time, give a better opportunity to support me and help me in making this music making dream even bigger.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, this happened roughly a year or so ago... And I have to say, that maybe I didn\u0027t put in this website the attention to detail that I wanted; as 2017 came, many things have changed. I recognize I got better and improved, and my Patreon didn\u0027t reflect this evolution, therefore I decided to overhaul it completely, offering you better rewards, and making my musical creations really worth of your money and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what has changed specificaly?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, of course you can still support my music for as little as the price of a cup of Italian Espresso coffee (just 1$ in Italy as far as I know) and you will get a song per month, in high quality stereo MP3; with a little more, you can also enter a raffle to decide the theme for every track every month. But please consider that if you decide to support me even further, you\u0027ll be also able to access remix packs of these Patreon-exclusive tunes (if you feel brave enough to fiddle around with them) and also music lessons on how to be just like me. Yeah! You wanna do the funk? Now you can learn how to do so as we goof around together in Google Hangouts once a month, as we alternate memes and serious music making altogether, like a real family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd, if we get to meet a specific goal, every two months, I\u0027ll be able to offer to all the patreons a special physical reward which can be a limited release on vinyl, CD or tape of a single or album which lucky winners will be able to get through a raffle during one of my Twitch streams.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can see all this as a real motivation to give more to my fans and be really worth the support you show to me. And this time, \u003cem\u003eI REALLY MEAN IT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for your support! Let\u0027s make some funky music together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- RoBKTA\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShoutouts to the amazing Tron Bonne for the anime version of yours truly that you see here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCheck out her\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TronBonneArt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
