We believe in\ngetting out of the comfort zone and pushing the boundaries of what is possible\nwhen pursuing a goal with nothing more than sheer will and determination.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur mission is demonstrating to the\nworld just how much fun and adventure can be achieved when dedicated people\ncommit to taking action on an idea. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSustainability is at the heart of the\nRatbag Nomads. We use recycled equipment scavenged from second hand store, army\nstores and many other sources in today\u2019s throw away culture. While our\nadventures are based on low to no cost activities, our message requires your\nhelp to spread. With your generous contributions, we can help change the lives\nof those stuck in un-resourceful, un-sustainable ways of living and thinking. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Ratbag Nomads are making a\nstatement to the world that fun and adventure is merely a mindset that can be\nachieved anywhere and in any situation; That there is good in everyone that can\nbe brought out when life is stripped back to basics. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe invite you to join the ride as we\ncycle through a continent near you.\u003cbr\u003e"
