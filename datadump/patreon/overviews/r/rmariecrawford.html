I started Contaminatio Press in 2017 to publish my novels, not because I couldn\u0027t publish them the traditional way (to be honest, I never tried) but so that I could maintain as much creative freedom over my work as possible. All of my books are made by hand, from the covers to the stitches that hold them together. I even make the glue in my own kitchen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that by doing things a little differently, I might start something great--but I can\u0027t do it alone. Without fans, my stories will just sit around on my shelf collecting dust. That is not what I created them to do. More than anything, I want to write stories that people enjoy reading and characters that people can say they were happy to have met. I would be honoured if you would join me on this journey. \u003cbr\u003e"
