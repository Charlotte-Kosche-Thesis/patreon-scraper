    "summary": "Hello! My name is Roxie Prince, and I am an indie author. I have published three full-length novels, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Way We Go\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eGrowth Spurt\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eEalanta\u003c/strong\u003e, as well as a shorter work entitled \u003cstrong\u003eCOMPENDIUM: A Horror Novelette\u003c/strong\u003e. Stories are in my blood, and they literally saved my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born HIV+ and orphaned by AIDS at the age of ten. When my world was falling apart and everything felt terrible and frightening, I found solace in stories. I learned to read before kindergarten, and when I wasn\u0027t allowed to go to public school for the fear of an HIV+ child being around other kids, my father made sure my I had enough to satiate my voracious appetite. Often, when I thought I couldn\u0027t go on anymore, when things got too difficult, I turned to stories. I survived through books and knew that one day I\u0027d write my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings us to decades later. I\u0027ve achieved that dream, but because of my illness, I cannot supplement my income otherwise. I am legally disabled, and unfortunately, being an independent author doesn\u0027t make much money at all. In truth, I put more money into my writing than I make out of it. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m not complaining. I would write anyway. I always have and I always will, but I would like to be able to one day make this self-sustainable. Maybe even be able to support myself by doing what I love and with my talent because isn\u0027t that what we all want?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus far in my indie author journey, I have done everything myself. I have done all of my own editing. I have done all of my own formatting for paperback and ebooks. I have designed all of my own covers. I do all of my own marketing. (This is the hardest part. The part that holds me and my work back the most.) All because I have absolutely zero dollars for a budget. With your help, I could put money toward these things, hopefully helping me create better work by giving me more time for actual writing, allowing me to better market my work, and to reach a wider audience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy novels are about vulnerable young girls in difficult situations and their growth into strong, independent women. It\u0027s my goal to tell stories that empower girls (and boys) by telling survival stories. Because these types of stories are what helped shape me into the woman I am today, and I want to, hopefully, pay homage to the stories that gave me the strength to make it through my tumultuous childhood and young adulthood. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoung girls face great adversity every day, even in their simple day-to-day lives. They are bombarded by images on Instagram and elsewhere that tell them they aren\u0027t pretty or thin enough. They feel pressured constantly to fit into cookie cutter boxes to be just like everyone else to be acceptable. Not to mention if they struggle with their sexuality or their gender expression; that throws a whole other level of pressure on them to become someone they aren\u0027t. And their family lives might not be happy or nurturing or loving either, so if they can find a reflection of themselves in a story, even for a few hundred pages, it can make a huge difference. Fiction has immeasurable power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am working on two more novels. One is another companion novel to \u003cstrong\u003eThe Way We Go\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eGrowth Spurt\u003c/strong\u003e called \u003cstrong\u003eTell Her I Love Her\u003c/strong\u003e. If you\u0027ve read either of those, it is the story of Gloria\u0027s childhood and how she came to be the woman we know. The second book I\u0027m working on is the sequel to \u003cstrong\u003eEalanta\u003c/strong\u003e entitled \u003cstrong\u003eEalanta: The Golden City\u003c/strong\u003e. I also write short stories on the weekends in a project I affectionately call my \u003cem\u003e#shortstoryweekends\u003c/em\u003e. These short stories vary in genre. They are a way to flex my muscles and take a break from the long-form process of novel writing. And on my blog at roxiewrites.tumblr.com, in my downtime, I read and review books written by other independent authors. It\u0027s a passion project of mine. Taking care of other independent authors is extremely important to me as it is a community that has brought a lot of goodness and joy into my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere, to patrons, I will share original short stories as regularly as monthly but hopefully as often as a weekly basis. These short stories will be first drafts that patrons will get first glimpses of. Who knows if they will ever see the light of day beyond here, but they just might be Patreon exclusive editions. I will also give peeks into my writing process, share the occasional poem, along with chapters and notes from my novels, and ask for feedback and input from patrons. This will become a collaborative process, I hope, and together, we can create something really cool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I know how valuable your dollars are. They are hard-earned and precious. If you deem me and my work worthy to give over one or more of those dollars, they will not be taken for granted. I will do my best to do right by them. I can promise you I work as hard as I can every single day to make the best work I can because this is what I do. This is not just something I do because it\u0027s a job -- it\u0027s truly my passion. I wake up with a fire in my belly every day to do it, and what is better than that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Roxie Prince is a creative soul who turns her life into stories, poetry, and art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe was born HIV+ and was orphaned by AIDS at the age of ten. Growing up with HIV in the late-eighties/early-nineties, when the AIDS epidemic was at its peak, gave her a unique perspective on life and a gratitude for the things that most people take for granted. She tells stories of survival through her works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoxie learned to read at a very young age and was \"born talking\". Her father, Steve, instilled a love of literature in her from the moment she could pick up a book, and she\u0027s never put them down since. She\u0027s always been a storyteller, and from a very young age, when things were hard for anyone to cope with, especially a child, she retreated to the world of stories. Books saved her. She read anything and everything she could put her hands on, from Dr. Seuss to Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, before she started public school in second grade. Before then, her father was her teacher because they couldn\u0027t send her to school for fear of bringing home more illnesses to her already dying mother, and also because schools weren\u0027t too keen on an HIV+ child attending their classes. Protagonists became her best friends. The worlds in novels became safe havens from the chaos she faced in real life. And to this day, stories are her sanctuary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe always knew she would be an author. There was never a question in her mind. It was a calling, really. She wrote her first bound book dually called The Pretty Princess and Suzi and the Cute Cat at around age six. She still has it. It\u0027s badly illustrated and tells the story of a princess who was liked by everyone because she was so pretty, but she didn\u0027t want them to like her because of her beauty. Pretty deep for a kid, eh? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day is a gift. She wasn\u0027t supposed to live beyond ten years old. Some days are difficult, but Roxie wakes each day with a fire in her belly to tell stories. And she hopes you\u0027ll read them. She lives her life to its breaking point. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find her works on Amazon and all major booksellers. COMPENDIUM: A Horror Novelette is a collection of five horror shorts about different people in the same apocalyptic situation. The Way We Go is a novel about growing up with a mother who isn\u0027t dependable, raising a younger sister, and finding love and yourself in an unexpected place. And Growth Spurt is a companion novel to The Way We Go that brings back some beloved characters but stands all on its own and tells a tale of growing up, coming out, acceptance, friendship, and family. And Ealanta is an epic YA fantasy novel in the first of a series about how one girl\u0027s discovery of who she once was leads her to become the woman she is meant to be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for following Roxie\u0027s journey both online and in real life. Without your support, her dreams couldn\u0027t have become a reality. It never goes unnoticed. Blessed be.\u003cbr\u003e",
