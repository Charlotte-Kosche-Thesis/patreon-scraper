Thanks for considering supporting me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eVideo editing is a time consuming process, and being financially stable is something I need as a working adult. So, I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll consider aiding my dream of becoming a full time YouTuber. This is a sort of donation box thing, so that I can use the money for things like food, paying artists for projects, and working on being able to continuing to bring you content. I have a few rewards planned out, but they are subject to change (and I\u0027ll let the backers know when they do through an update). Rewards will be issued once payments have come through.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got a few lets play series in the works, while I work on finishing college. Once I\u0027m done with college and my job hunt, I\u0027ll be working on a few fun videos which you can learn more about by becoming a Patron! I look forward to working together with you all to make enjoyable content!\u003cbr\u003e"
