Then I have answers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: PERO RICH! Why you here though? What you up to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBueno.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here because there is a community of like-minded patrons and poets and teachers who believe in the things I do. I\u0027m here to keep doing what I\u0027ve been doing for fourteen years--writing and advocating for writers of color, telling my stories, and teaching the art forms I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat exactly are \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e sponsoring, though? Well, to paraphrase a friend of mine, I\u0027m never not working. But at this precise moment,\u00a0I am working on the projects listed below. Number 3 is the biggest, hairiest idea of them all, one which I\u0027ll be working on for the foreseeable future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) THE BOOK\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA second collection of poems, tentatively titled ENDOMORPH, which is dedicated to the poetics of the body and an exploration of the various kinds of heaviness the body carries.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) THE SHOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA one-man show involving music and movement, based around the second collection.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) THE SITE \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA multimedia web project revolving around Latinx literature and culture; featuring original content by Latinx poets, prose writers, and filmmakers; interviews and discussions with emerging and established Latinx artists, as well as live and online incubator spaces in which artists, collaborators, readers, and viewers can interact and create more new work. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(#3, in something like plain English: If I\u0027m able to execute it as planned, this means I\u0027ll be back in the independent curation business. Live performances featuring emerging and established Latinx writers and performers, talkbacks, and Q\u0026amp;A. This will all supported by the online platform, where you\u0027ll be able to see the event archive, read new work, and enrich your understanding of Latinx art with amazing content. And if you\u0027ve ever wanted to be a part of a space that sincerely pursues equity among Latinx artists, this is your chance.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: HOLD IT, PAPI! Who are you, anyway?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rich Villar, and I am a poet, essayist, performer, organizer, and educator. I have been an advocate, a teacher, and a curator on behalf of artists of color, especially Latinx poets, for the past fourteen years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was the co-founder and curator of Acentos, a grassroots project promoting the visibility of Latinx poets and writers, which was founded in 2003. At various points in its history, Acentos was a reading series, a workshop, a series of symposia, and a homebase for Latinx writers and their allies in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. \u003cem\u003eIn fact, the cover photo on this page is of the audience we gathered in 2008 when 33 Latinx poets read their work in a marathon reading at the Association of Writers and Writing Programs conference in New York.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Today, Acentos exists as \u003cem\u003eThe Acentos Review\u003c/em\u003e, a literary journal publishing emerging and established Latinx poets, prose writers, critics, and book reviewers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI published my first book of poems,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eComprehending Forever,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0with Willow Books in 2014. My poetry and prose appears in journals such as \u003cem\u003eRadius Lit Mag, Black Renaissance Noire, Beltway Poetry Quarterly\u003c/em\u003e, and\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThrush Poetry Journal. \u003c/em\u003eMy work also appears in a landmark anthology called \u003cem\u003ePoetry of Resistance: Voices For Social Justice, \u003c/em\u003eedited by Francisco Alarc\u00f3n and Odilia Galv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the performance world, I have contributed voice, body, and text to a number of theater companies and productions, including Actors Stock NYC\u0027s \u003cem\u003eEve Descending\u003c/em\u003e, Luna Stage in Montclair, and \u003cem\u003eGhetto Hors D\u0027ouerves: Climate, \u003c/em\u003ewith the Oye Group and the Bushwick Starr Theater. I also co-curate Lincoln Center\u0027s annual LA CASITA show for Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I serve as Artistic Director and poetry facilitator for La Sopa NYC, a community-based writing and performance workshop in New York City with roots in the movement poetics and spoken word traditions of the 1960\u0027s and onward. I am also a freelance educator with recent residencies in the school systems of Montclair and Hoboken, New Jersey, where I taught poetry as an alternative pathway to learning, with particular emphasis on middle school STEM curriculum. For three years, I have served as faculty for the Bronx Loaf Teen Workshops at the Foundation For Letters, and I also served as faculty for the Frost Place Conference on Poetry and Teaching in 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in the power of image and metaphor to imagine new ways to learn, interact with the world, formulate our politics and citizenship, and theorize about the nature of the universe itself. I believe in storytelling and live performance as a way to develop empathy and foster connection among human beings. I believe in memoir because I believe in the healing power of memory and truth telling. Poetry is a liberational urge, and my mission in life is to continue practicing it and teaching it to others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Dude. You\u0027re a busy dude. How can I be a part of all this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to be a part of these next chapters, become a patron and you\u0027ll gain a backstage pass to the process, along with some opportunities to talk back to me about these projects. There will also be opportunity to engage me as a professional arts curator, editor, and teacher of poetry. You might even be able to contribute your ideas and energy toward a new online venture for Latinx arts and culture!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t choose to be a patron right now, that\u0027s okay too. Thank you for the opportunity to talk to you about this art we love, and maybe we\u0027ll see each other down the road. I\u0027m also really easy to talk to in person and on Twitter. Follow me at @elprofe316, or come find me on Facebook.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePa\u0027lante como el elefante, and thank you all for being part of the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMad love,\u003cbr\u003eRich.\u003cbr\u003e"
