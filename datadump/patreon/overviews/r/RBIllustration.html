    "summary": "Hi! My name is Rebecca\u00a0and I\u0027m an artist and writer living in the south of England. I\u0027m currently working on a cyberpunk novel and webcomic, \u003cem\u003eWired\u003c/em\u003e, with many more projects in the pipeline in addition to running a YouTube channel where I post timelapse videos of my art progress. I enjoy drawing androids, monsterboys, aliens and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e- My Projects\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWired\u003c/strong\u003e is a story set in the sprawling metropolis of Aethercove, where humans and androids walk side-by-side. Androids are possessions - created to be sentient, but not permitted free will. Amid this chaotic society, close friends Rikani Sheridan and Casey Knight share a cramped apartment in the rundown Sector C. Money is tight, but they\u0027re happy enough. There\u0027s only one problem. Employment, money, a home - they\u0027re all reserved only for humans. And Rikani is not a human.\u003cbr\u003eHe just pretends he is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBreakwater\u003c/strong\u003e is a novel aimed at a slightly younger audience, set in a fantasy world of emerging steampunk technology and hidden magic. Eighteen-year-old Saralynne Redfern encounters a fifty-foot merman held captive in the depths of her home city and while dealing with the chaos of her own life as a young member of the nobility, she has to hatch a plan to rescue her newfound finned friend before it\u0027s too late. Meanwhile in the imperial palace, a young footman discovers he possesses abilities long ago banned by the reigning monarchy which put his life in direct danger - and he\u0027s not the only one keeping secrets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConstellations \u003c/strong\u003eis a space opera that takes place in a future time of interstellar travel. On the backwater planet of Ethrin, the part-human part-alien Fitzpatrick family share a cosy (read: cramped) apartment with their ten-feet-tall four-armed friend Cinnamon. Kieran and Fiora have spent years trying to save for a cure for their dying son, when the perfect solution seems to drop into their laps. The only problem is, they\u0027re going to have to do a little law-breaking to access it. OK, maybe more than a little.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a good job Cinnamon is a fast driver.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e- Why Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Wired webcomic will be released online for free - but contributions from patrons would help towards print costs for physical copies of the comic and spending related to the novel\u0027s publication. It also supplements the wage from my part-time job so I can spend less time there and more time on my art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e- How does it work?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, there is only one tier - $1+. This is because I would like to maintain this page as a \u0027tip-jar sketchblog\u0027. I post WIPs and sketches here and will be emailing larger rewards to processed patrons as well as occasional physical rewards such as books or prints. There is no set posting schedule, hence I give patrons the freedom to pay as much or as little as they would like -\u00a0there is no pressure at all and I really appreciate anything you\u0027d like to give. The support of my online followers keeps me motivated and I\u0027ll work hard to ensure I keep producing high-quality illustrations, comic work and novels!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you so much!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
