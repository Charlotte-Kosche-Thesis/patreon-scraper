This is your #1 source for Music catering to the darker side of our souls. My style of composing has earned me the nickname\u003cbr\u003e\"The Next Danny Elfman\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY would you want to become a Patron of mine?\u003cbr\u003eAnswer: It will unlock the door to a world of Fantasy, Horror and Majestic Music that will leave you yearning for more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love reaching new people and introducing them to my signature sound and style of writing. Meeting and interacting with other musicians, fans and instrumentalists and exploring ideas and melodies is what I consider the best part of the Music Industry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to compose the most captivating scores and orchestrations I can while reaching as many people as I can. I have found that my music has had such a larger impact than anything I could\u0027ve imagined. It has helped some deal with depression, suicide and other mental illnesses but even more it has brought others on a journey into the darkness. A place where many are afraid to journey but long to secretly in their souls. I allow you to take the journey into the dark abyss of the world within the safety of your headphones. You will find mystery, mayhem and lush melodies along your way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming one of my patrons, you are gaining access to exclusive content not available anywhere else on the web. More importantly you are helping make music. Every dollar that is received is put toward further productions and orchestrations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life goal is to become a renowned Hollywood composer. I have not lived an easy life and my road has had many bumps in it that were beyond my control. However rather than turning to the darkness and giving in I channeled the demons I was given into a positive force, MUSIC. Music is such an amazing tool that can give us the power and motivation to move mountains and stars. Every dollar that is acquired from Patreon goes towards purchasing new equipment, purchasing music notation software and funding the production of new albums. Your support is the drive that has kept me alive and passionate for so many years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to you exploring my world. Listening to the symphonies that I have composed. Soaring through the clouds together through the power of an audiotorial journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
