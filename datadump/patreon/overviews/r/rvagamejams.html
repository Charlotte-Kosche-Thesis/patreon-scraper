We are \u003cstrong\u003eRVA Game Jams\u003c/strong\u003e, a group of creators in Richmond, Virginia making video games together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur group is focused on hosting \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eopen to the public\u003c/strong\u003e game jams, workshops, and other meetups. Since 2012, we have hosted nearly two dozen game jams, and our group has collectively made over \u003cstrong\u003e100 games\u003c/strong\u003e! Partnering with the community, we\u0027ve been able to bring illustrious guest speakers\u00a0Kellee Santiago, Zoe Quinn, Catt Small, Chris Suellentrop, and Tom Fulp to Richmond. In 2015 we won the Creative Catalyst award at the RVA Creativity Awards, and we have been featured in several local publications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past four years we have relied on participants, friends, family, and our own pockets to fund our activities, but moving forward, we\u0027d like to do much more for our participants and our community. This includes more guest speakers, comprehensive game development workshops, and equipment to enable us to do things like record workshops, stream events, and record podcasts. We also have tons of ideas for hardware projects, arcade machines, alternative controllers, and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the core missions of RVA Game Jams is keeping our events free and open to the public. We believe that anyone who wants to make games should have the opportunity to explore the medium in a low-pressure, community-guided, safe place - and we look forward to the next 5 years of RVA Game Jams! \u003cstrong\u003eWe can\u0027t thank you enough for your support.\u003c/strong\u003e"
