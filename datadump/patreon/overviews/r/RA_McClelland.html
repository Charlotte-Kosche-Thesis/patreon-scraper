    "summary": "Hi, everybody. My name is RA McClelland, and this is my Patreon. Thanks for dropping by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s talk, huh? You want to know what I\u0027m doing here. Well, it\u0027s kind of a long story, but I\u0027ll try to give you the bullet points.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not going to tell you about my whole life right this second, but that\u0027s important for you to know. I was kid in Desert Storm, in the First Persian Gulf War. I saw some things up close and personal that most American kids never see, and honestly, it kind of messed me up. It has messed me up for a long time, and I\u0027ve spent most of my life trying to make sense of the world because of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m a writer now, still trying to make sense of the world. I\u0027ve written things anonymously on the internet for years as a way of dealing with depression and anxiety. Here\u0027s the thing about writing anonymously on the internet though: you\u0027re anonymous. It\u0027s screaming into the wind, and even when someone hears it, it\u0027s still just alienated and depressed. And I don\u0027t think I can go on like that. I won\u0027t survive it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo...wow, that\u0027s a lot, huh? Yeah, sorry about that. But listen, this isn\u0027t about pity or charity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s just a lot of sadness in the world.\u00a0There\u0027s a lot of pain. I want to be able to talk about that honestly.\u00a0So that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing here. I first learned to talk about the painful parts of my life just chatting with friends about books, and movies, and music. And you know what? It really helped. I want to do more of that.\u00a0For myself. For other people suffering. And hey, maybe for you too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a website where I write articles and stories. If you haven\u0027t already seen it, take a look around at \u003ca href=\"http://www.expositionist.net/\"\u003ewww.Expositionist.net\u003c/a\u003e. Hopefully, you like what you find. You might also notice a few things cordoned off for Patrons only. Well, that\u0027s all my most personal writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first Patron-Only content you\u0027ll probably find is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"A STRANGER LIFE\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my novel in progress. It\u0027s a fictionalized retelling of my life up to this moment. If you want to know the whole story (or maybe just what the hell is wrong with me) \"A Stranger Life\" is it. This is the novel I have to write, and I know it is, because any time I sit down to write anything else, this is the story that demands to be told. I can\u0027t get away from it and I can\u0027t forget it. So I\u0027m doing the next best thing, I guess. I\u0027m telling the story in excruciating detail one page at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"A Stranger Life\" is the story of Cora Scott, a screwed up teenager dealing with death, depression, and Global Terrorism through movies and Rock music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming one of my Patreon Patrons means you can read this story before it\u0027s published. You can help shape the story with your thoughts and feedback, and you can get a digital copy of the finished book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second kind of Patron-Only content at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.expositionist.net\"\u003eExpositionist.net\u003c/a\u003e is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHAZARDOUS MATERIAL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be honest with you, this is not for the faint of heart. Hazardous Material is the white hot, bleeding edge of my depression. This is where I talk about everything that hurts me most, and this is how I find my way out of those spirals before they kill me. I\u0027m not a self-help guru, and I\u0027m not a therapist. But if there\u0027s one thing I know to be true, it\u0027s that talking about depression helps a lot more than pretending it doesn\u0027t exist. That\u0027s what Hazardous Material is about. These are the things I struggle with. I can\u0027t speak for everyone in the world who suffers, and I can\u0027t solve the problems that hurt people. All I can do is find a way out of my own depression every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it can be valuable to listen to people go through that process. So, if you\u0027re in a place where you feel like you can\u0027t talk about something, a job that eats you alive, a relationship falling apart, a family member dying, you can read Hazardous Material and know you\u0027re not alone. You haven\u0027t failed just because the world hurts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s still hope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming one of my Patreon Patrons means you can listen in while I convince myself that life is still worth living. It\u0027s an argument I have with myself pretty often, but I\u0027ve always won too because I\u0027m still here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll join me."
