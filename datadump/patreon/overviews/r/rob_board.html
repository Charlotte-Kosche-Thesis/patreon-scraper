    "summary": "Hi, thank you for checking out my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on a mission to obey the Great Co-mission of Jesus Christ to proclaim the gospel, heal the sick and diseased, cast out demons, make disciples for Him, and train pastors to do the same.\u00a0 I have been one of His disciples for over 40 years and have pastored, wrote books (7 on Amazon at this time), developed internet training programs, and trained pastors and Christian leaders. \u00a0To do this requires a community effort willing to work together with God.\u00a0 I no longer pastor or have a congregation to send me forth in this mission, or have a TV audience, or sell thousands of audible programs, or have any way of doing this ministry without creating a community to work with me and help fulfill what I believe God is calling us to do.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eI help people get to know God in a very real way and help them to grow in their spiritual life as a disciple maker for King Jesus.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I absolutely believe God has already supplied everything needed to accomplish His mission, but I also believe He supplies these resources supernaturally by flowing through people to help send forth His ambassadors to go into the harvest and fulfill His plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have been invited to go to 14 countries to hold crusades, train pastors and leaders, help in feeding programs for children, build orphanages, help fund drilling wells for clean water\nsupplies, and work with local pastors in their communities in very hands-on ways.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0My heart hurts to know there is so much need in this world and knowing that the Lord wants me to be His Ambassador to help meet this great need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark 10:29-30\u003c/strong\u003e --\u00a0 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\"Jesus said, \u0027Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel\u2019s sake, but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.\u0027\"\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI want you to know without a doubt that whatever level of partnership you chose, you will be rewarded both during this lifetime and in the next.\u00a0 I see a big world that is suffering without the true knowledge of a loving God that wants to help them.\u00a0 By building this community of world changers for as little as $1 per month or as much as you believe this ministry is worth to the world and the kingdom of God we together can have a most positive effect.\u00a0 As a team member with me by becoming a patron I will send you a training that will help you develop your faith to receive the supernatural return on your investment in expanding the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am building a community of people who have a heart for God and His great co-mission\u003c/strong\u003e, but don\u0027t believe they personally can go and do this kind of journey. \u00a0 What you can do is become part of this community of world changers and from the comfort of your own home can send me to accomplish this mission and \u003cstrong\u003eTOGETHER\u003c/strong\u003e we will stand before the King and hear Him say \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Well done thou good and faithful servants.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 For as little as the price of a hamburger or a latte a month you can join with me to help fulfill this great co-mission, write books and training programs, and other training materials to use in accomplishing this goal. \u00a0As a team partner you will be updated regularly on how you are helping to go into all the world on this epic journey and you will receive a copy of every book I write or training e-course I create.\u00a0 Wouldn\u0027t you really like to be a part of something much bigger than yourself?\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eBecome a patron and be a part of a great community of world changers.\u00a0 God has promised, in Mark\u0027s gospel, up to 100% return on whatever you give towards the advancement of His kingdom.\u003c/strong\u003e"
