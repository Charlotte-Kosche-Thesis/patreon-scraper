The Roundtable has existed since May of 2016 and after just one year we\u0027ve built a community of over \u003cstrong\u003e200,000\u003c/strong\u003e people! Each and every day we\u0027re thrilled that so many people care about our content and what we make and are looking to expand both the content and audience each and every day. While we adore Steven Universe and have an undying love and motivation to always produce content around the series, it\u0027s not the only interest we have at The Roundtable. We live by the motto \"Plus Ultra\" -\u003cem\u003e to go further beyond\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0Recently we just got registered as a legitimate business and aim to expand that legitimacy.

In order to properly expand and create more content at a consistent pace and \u003cstrong\u003emaintain a level of quality\u003c/strong\u003e, we\u0027re going to need to hire more people to help us create more content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter YouTube and our network take their share of our monthly ad revenue and TeeSpring has their cut of our merchandise, we\u0027re left with funds that\u0027s not nearly enough to accommodate our future endeavors and sustain ourselves in our personal lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t want and will not employ anyone without the funds necessary to compensate them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat new content do you have to offer?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many concepts for new shows that are constantly being discussed and evaluated by us as a collective team which we\u0027ll reveal more of as we level up, but a main goal is to increase the quality of our existing shows such as Let\u0027s Talk with Tom!?, by upgrading the equipment and sets used to create said shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dj1FpxTWoYU?ecver=1\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother main goal is to assemble a team of artists, writers and voice talents to produce a 5-part animatic fan-fueled and made, passion project - \u003cem\u003eSteven Universe: Man vs Gem (Working Title)\u003c/em\u003e an original story that sees Steven and the Crystal Gems face off against a human adversary.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u0027t stop there!
