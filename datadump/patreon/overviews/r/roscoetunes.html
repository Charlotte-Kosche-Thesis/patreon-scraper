    "summary": "Hey Folks! My name is \u003cstrong\u003eAdam\u003c/strong\u003e and I write \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal acoustic music\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m a member of the bands\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eFront Country\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSmall Town Therapy\u003c/strong\u003e, and the \u003cstrong\u003eModern Mandolin Quartet\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been writing music since before I could even play an instrument. As a young child I would spend hours \u201ccomposing\u201d at my Grandparent\u2019s piano. \u003cstrong\u003eCreating new music\u003c/strong\u003e has been a constant in my musical life since then and has grown to be a big part of my identity as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\nFor me writing music is more than giving myself something new to play, it\u2019s about \u003cstrong\u003econnecting\u003c/strong\u003e with people and sharing the results of the \u003cstrong\u003ecreative process\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow you can be part of that creative process! Not only will you have the opportunity to support the creation of new music, you also have the opportunity to \u003cstrong\u003einteract\u003c/strong\u003e with me and other patrons during that process. I\u2019d like to engage with listeners and supporters and have an open discussion about how I\u2019m developing new material and why I\u2019m making the musical choices I\u2019m making.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you know I write primarily instrumental music. Since there are no words to provide context, I feel some sort of description is helpful in giving the listener a way into the music. At concerts this is easy as you can have a dialogue with the audience, but with recordings alone there is more of a separation. I\u2019d like to take it a step further and have that dialogue during the creative process. Instead of just supporting the creation of a finished song or songs, you will get an intimate look at the development of new tunes and arrangements through videos, demos, sheet music, and conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis will result in finished tracks and full length albums which you, as a patron, will have early access to.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to helping with the creation of new music, your support will enable me to provide better quality demos, videos, and web concerts.\u003cbr\u003e"
