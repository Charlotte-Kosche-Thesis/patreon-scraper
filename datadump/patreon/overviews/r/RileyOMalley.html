I\u0027ve had a passion for art ever since I was little and don\u0027t plan on stopping anytime soon! My style is versatile, from use of color, design, and various themes. I create bright and bold, often contrasting work, with varied macabre or even cutesy pastel works in between. Always experimenting, try anything new to add to my repertoire, and most of all - to have fun creating what I do! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt has become a main part of my day to day life, and I\u0027ve been working hard to make it a full time basis for my work. With Patreon, I want to make this dream a reality. I\u0027ve had a steady flow of commission work, but I\u0027d very much like the time to work not only on those but personal projects as well (from comics, t-shirt designs, handcrafted arts, jewelry, and so on!) while rewarding followers, patrons and clients in the process. If you\u0027d like to help me reach this goal, then continue to read and find out how you can support this lil artist make her dreams come true!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(A big thank you for those who are wonderfully patient with me in posting content here even if I may not have alot or post most of my content elsewhere. You\u0027re support is highly appreciated ;v;)\u003cbr\u003e",
