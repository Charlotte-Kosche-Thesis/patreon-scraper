We hope to have a brick and mortar location soon, but we also want to engage with like-minded folks wherever they may be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRed Books, Black Ink.\u00a0 engages with the world of books and literature from a radical left perspective.  We publish original content and share articles of interest from elsewhere on the web.  We may also occasionally sell a book, piece of art, or other product or service.  We don\u0027t like online book shopping - we are romantically entangled with the tactile experience of the bookstore.  But we also have a lot of books and no physical space as of yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tRed Books, Black Ink. started as a passion project of James Birmingham\u0027s.  After leaving a PhD program - disillusioned with the Academy and recovering from Seasonal Affective Disorder - James came to the conclusion that operating a bookstore/cafe was the direction he wanted to go in.  The project evolved into something more multifaceted than just a bookcafe - perhaps we are trying to do too much, but there is so much we want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
