My main focus is comics, I want to be an interior sequential comic artist for a major publisher. I\u0027ve had a cover published through Valiant, a pin up in Dynamite, and currently working on several creator owned books.\u003cbr\u003eI wanted my Patreon to be a new avenue for fans to discover my work, collect my pieces and connect with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to share my work with as many people as I can. My comic library is growing and doing 5 shows a year isn\u0027t enough. I would love to exhibit in Toronto, Chicago, Seattle, hell even San Diego or New York! So, my goal on here is to build some savings to help get me where I want to go.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re probably thinking \"that\u0027s all well and good, but what\u0027s in it for me?\" Ah, an excellent question. I\u0027ve been doing a \"Sketch A Day\" through my Instagram for a couple of years now. I\u0027m thinking of taking that concept and applying it here. Every day a supporter of mine can get a high res digital copy of a sketch I\u0027ve made. I\u0027ll be doing themed months to keep things fresh. I\u0027ll even have Patrons choice and choose someone\u0027s suggestions at random.\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that I\u0027ll have phone wallpapers, digital prints from my archives, maybe progress videos (once I\u0027m familiar with vlogging.)\u003cbr\u003eAnother reward will be a new monthly digital art print. These are just like the prints I have at shows. They will also coincide with the themed month. These will be fully coloured. Some will be for you guys before I print them to bring to shows so you\u0027ll get first dibs.\u003cbr\u003eWHEW! I think that covers it. Thanks again for taking the time to learn what I\u0027m offering and hope you\u0027ll take this ride with me."
