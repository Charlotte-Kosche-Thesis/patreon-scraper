    "summary": "Hello, my name is Cindy Morris. I am the Recovery Girl. I have been in recovery from meth for 5 years now. I have been working on this project for over 3 years now. I recently graduated college with my AS in business management. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a completed business plan\u00a0for the Recovery Girls Sober Living Home with proper projections set into place. I have created a marketing plan for an App that will be created to connect recovering addicts all across the nation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am a single mother and full time waitress.\u00a0My\u00a0amazing friend and colleague\u00a0Liz manages the Recovery Girls Facebook page. As we all know social media is a full time job. We are the Recovery Girls. We are proud of our recovery and are not afraid to tell the world. We take any and every opportunity to speak on and advocate for recovery. We are trying to produce a stigma free environment in our rural community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResources for women here when it comes to addiction support services are scarce. We believe women are a very important part of the family circle. We will make more resources available to women and women with children in our rural community. Keeping women close\u00a0to the place they call home is essential when guiding one to a long-term recovery. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Recovery Girls Sober Living will help women apply the tools gained in treatment to their everyday lives. At the home the women will be guided through daily routines\u00a0by an on-site house mother. Women will gain experiences and skills through additional classes and\u00a0engaging activities right\u00a0in their own community. We are proud Recovery Girls and we will strive to\u00a0clear the stigma when it comes to\u00a0women and addiction, one woman at a time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecovery Girls of Sterling is a sober living program for women seeking recovery from substance abuse. This organization is a new age take on the steps necessary to reach and maintain long-term recovery. This house program\u00a0takes recovery beyond 12 steps. Recovery from addiction is a lifestyle change\u00a0and long term commitment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis program will guide women by implementing new coping mechanisms, changing daily\u00a0lifestyle habits, and peer guided recovery support with group integration. In this program, the women involved will not only feel new but they will become apart of a family with the same purpose; To live life according to one\u0027s newly developed terms through house program completion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The biggest obstacle this organization will overcome is funding the start-up costs in order to open the doors of a home."

     "about": "I am an advocate for recovery because I am a recovering meth addict. I have been in recovery for 5 years now. I just graduated college with my AS in business management. I have been working on this project for 3 years now. In the rural community that I live in, resources for women to help maintain recovery from substance abuse are scarce. To me, women play a very important role in the home. Without a place for women to recover close to home, it defeats the purpose of treating a women with a substance abuse problem. It does not help them apply the tools gained in treatment. Look at it like this; if a plant is sick you remove it from the infected soil, treat it, then replant it where it can from, only for the plant to get sick again. If women in rural communities like mine could be treated and placed in a Recovery Girls sober living home and guided by a house mother the \u0027soil\u0027 will become clean. With proper guidance from an on site house mother who will help these women over come daily obstacles using the tools gained during treatment long-term recovery can be maintained.",
