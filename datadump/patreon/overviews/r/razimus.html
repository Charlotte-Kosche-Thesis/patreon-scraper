     "about": "Hi, I\u0027m John \"Razimus\" Hughston, online I go by \"John Razimus\". I\u0027ve been researching, writing, directing, editing videos/research projects since 2009. I\u0027ve never made any money from it from the context of I went to my tax guy in 2017 and he told me, \"If this was a business you\u0027d be losing money every year\". That doesn\u0027t stop me, money has never been a motivating factor in what I do, but some months I can\u0027t make content due to concern over paying the bills. I\u0027m turning to you guys to help the cause. Here is some of the type of content I\u0027ve created in the past, and please let me know which is the type of content you\u0027d like to see more of in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few YouTube shows...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Hoax Hunter\" Exposing hoaxes and seeking truth from a more scientific fact based point of view. I\u0027ve been doing this show since 2009.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Occult Unmasked\" Researching occult subjects and seeking truth concerning them. Even if the explanation is controversial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Pyramidikal\" Started as a paranormal comedy show but evolved into a show very similar to Occult Unmasked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Occult, Esoteric, Antiquarian; Book Review\" This is a new show, a continuation of Occult Unmasked but solely focused on book reviews primarily on Occult and rare books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on making a few new shows or simply improving the shows I already have. I review Vinyl Records sometimes and generally speaking my shows are greatly inspired by the following; \"SIGHTINGS\" hosted by Tim White. \"In Search Of\" hosted by Leonard Nimoy. With a bit of \"The Prisoner\" starring Patrick McGoohan and \"The Twilight Zone\" starring Rod Serling. \"Unsolved Mysteries\" starring Robert Stack. With a mix of independent investigating and research driven conclusions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also could do more \"Pyramidical Podcast\" episodes if suggested. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know which of my shows are more popular, so please send in suggestions and I am greatly interested to know which of my shows are the type of content you\u0027d like me to focus on. Thank you to everyone who even considers donating to the cause!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--- John \"Razimus\" Hughston\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m passionate about investigating a wide range of subjects from the Occult, Esoteric \u0026amp; Spiritual to Scientific subjects that involve theoretical science such as Time Travel, String Theory, Advanced Technologies. I started a YouTube in 2009 with the goal of exposing a hoax involving Time Travel, I believe I successfully proved as many facts on the subjects as humanly possible. In 2010 I was exposed to a spiritual aspect of the universe, I\u0027m a very logical person, I like to focus on facts, and looking at all sides and all angles. Since 2010 I have been interested in collecting rare Occult books, Antiquarian, Esoteric type books that hopefully will help me solve a mystery concerning what happened beginning in 2010. Many don\u0027t believe it, but in 2011, 6 months after my initial introduction to a dark spiritual aspect of the universe, I was poltergeist haunted for 6 months, the repeating of 6 months is strange and I\u0027m trying to figure out as much about the subject as I possibly can. My goal is to write books on what happened to me, self-publish these books, and I\u0027m motivated to document as I research these subjects in video form. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
