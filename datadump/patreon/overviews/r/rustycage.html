So I\u0027m not saying noooot to become a patron. \u00a0But you don\u0027t HAVE to. I will continue this craft as long as life permits one way or the other. \u00a0Patreon just seems to have a bad wrap recently because of how many scamsters come on here and beg for peoples money and never actually do anything with it. \u00a0Thats not what I\u0027m about. \u00a0I\u0027m just a product of this modern internet age. \u00a0A musician who records out of a dirty shed to make songs that hopefully can inspire others. \u00a0I am just a youtuber, who does my best to make twisted videos to entertain bored viewers online. \u00a0The internet is like the wild west right now, and fellers like me gotta do whatever it takes to make a living with our craft. \u00a0So yea buddy, that\u0027s my patreon pledge. \u00a0Spare a buck for an old boy to keep this fella on his feet, and I will deliver back with my song and dance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport the Insanity, and god bless your twisted souls."

I currently have 2 albums out which can be heard on my bandcamp http://RustyCage.bandcamp.com .  I also am responsible for creating what the web has dubbed \"The Internet\u0027s Most Dangerous Game\" , that would be The Knife Game Song.   My goal is to use my music to bring despair and sorrow to the listeners until they give up on the happiness of life the way I have.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
