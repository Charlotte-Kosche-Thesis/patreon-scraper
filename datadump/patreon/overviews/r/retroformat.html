These can hardly be sold, but they can certainly be shown.  They look awesome on a 3d TV!  I have been showing these at meetings or\u00a0conventions and also via YouTube, which has a pretty good stereoscopic player (though lately there has been complexity there).  I will continue to make the 3d videos, even though there is no \"market\" for them, really - I just love the work and the creative potential seems to be limitless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour support will help keep me focussed, maintain momentum, stay positive, and that will help me to become more productive! \u00a0I feel passionately\u00a0about making fine art stereoscopic images and advancing the state of the art in this genre - I consider it my life\u0027s calling - and you can help me to continue this pursuit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you very much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBoris Starosta\u003cbr\u003e"
