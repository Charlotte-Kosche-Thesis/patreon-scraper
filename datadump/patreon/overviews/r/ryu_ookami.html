I usually work as a freelancer, but I also have a few projects I work on my own! I worked on Daedalic Entertainment on Black Guards as a 3D-Asset Designer and I also made a complete self-made card game called \"The Finest Guild Of Real Gentleorcs!\" - a card game in which you have to insult your friends in a high-class manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/jyfUWc/giphy.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbnormal \u003c/strong\u003eis a \u003cstrong\u003esurvival Pen\u0026amp;Paper\u003c/strong\u003e in which the players are playing as a group of survivors in an extinction\u00a0event. Depending on the scenario, this kind of event can be very different: It can be a classical zombie-apocalypse, an alien invasion, but also some kind of natural\u00a0disaster or a war - or even some sick inhuman game like we know from the purge or battle royale. Whatever it is, the player\u00a0goal is to keep his survivor under any circumstances alife. There is no actual\u00a0quest or mission in this Pen \u0026amp; Paper Game, but the survivor gets a little bit more hungry, thirsty and tired every round, so that the player has to take care of the needs of their role-survivor. But they all have to watch out, every mistake they make can be the last and every decision has his ultimate consequences!\u00a0 If you support me I can provide you with new content for this game over time! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means not only new rules, new campaigns, new videos and stuff, but also new features and translations as well. I also try to make some smaller projects on the way as well, so support can help me to archive my long-term goal of finishing this project one day. ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to thank my family and friends for their support and I also want to thank every patron who dedicated himself to be a patron of mine : )"
