    "summary": "Oh. Hi. You\u0027re here. And this is me talking about myself. Despite the fact that I do that kinda all the time, this feels weird, but I suppose that\u0027s the point.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong ago and far away, I wrote lots of personal essays -- about growing up in New York City in the \u002770s and 80s, about being an outsider in New York Society, about my ridiculous and brief career as a teen pageant queen. \u00a0For various reasons -- including feeling like I wasn\u0027t allowed to take up space and because I didn\u0027t know how to talk effectively about the juxtaposition of beauty and horror in the stories I wanted to tell -- I stopped doing that. But now, tentatively, I have a memoir project underway, and it\u0027s time to start writing those essays again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is finding time. Because the time not dedicated to my demanding day job is dedicated to writing romance novels that provide me with revenue. In order to return to the land of personal essay and move towards being a full-time writer, I need to make my words -- all my words count.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I am asking you to pledge to support my work on an essay-by-essay basis. I only get paid if I write something; and you get exclusive access to my content for the first three months after I write it, for the smallest of pledges. Seriously, despite those higher patron levels, in my head this is all about finding support at the $1 per essay level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s my memoir project about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in not one New York that was dying, but two: The single-sex debutante-focused private school my parents sent me to because the little girls wore white gloves like in the movies and the art scene, where my parents worked and socialized, as it was ravaged by AIDS. Bisexual, genderqueer, and closeted for survival in one world, I used the other to find myself and my voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I cut my hair, chose my queerness, and ran away to college, I also exiled myself from the New York Society to which I had never quite belonged. I wasn\u0027t pretty in the right way, wasn\u0027t remotely a WASP, and definitely too weird and queer to marry well. So I lost touch with the girls I grew up with, got a job at Washington DC\u2019s Lambda Rising, and did my best to jettison the vestiges of the Transatlantic accent that had been trained into me by both an exceptional and archaic education and endless years of speech therapy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that was that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil I started writing romance novels twenty years later. Because romance novels are often about everything I grew up with \u2013 loss, survival, female society, and status, suddenly the teenage years I had only talked about in the clumsiest of ways were easy to explain. \u201cIt was like Pride \u0026amp; Prejudice. Also AIDS instead of consumption.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, because of the type of fiction I love to write, my present and future are no longer divided from my past.\u00a0The romance genre has forced me, as a queer writer, to examine the way I once saved myself through exile. As I\u2019ve rediscovered my past and begun to make peace with how our culture teaches us to frame love stories and female identity, I\u0027ve discovered that the stories I\u0027ve never known how to share effectively are suddenly the ones I must tell.\u003cbr\u003e"
