So lets start at the beginning. I started building guitars in Stewarton,Scotland around 8 years ago. It was very much a hobby, and an absolute pleasure to build things that made a noise . It all started in a tiny, tiny garden shed. At the time i had no idea what would happen. Gradually more and more people asked me to build for them. So i built myself a workshop, from the ground up. It was in here that things really started to develop. Originally i did versions of classics like Les Pauls and Stratocasters, but i always had the urge to spread my wings design wise and so started building fully custom instruments, from customer designs and from my own ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople seemed to enjoy the handmade aspects of my work and i have a penchant for antique tools and traditional techniques. Part of the joy of the process for me is reviving 100 plus year old handplanes,gouges, chisels and so on, and actually putting them to use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince day one, i\u0027ve had a fascination with timber, as you\u0027ll see from my work. Wherever possible i use locally sourced timber including sycamore,elm,pine, beech and yew. Part of the Ragh identity is to highlight these beautiful timbers that you don\u0027t see on \"traditional Guitars, and yet they grow all around us. I do still use \"exotics\", provided they are sustainable sourced and certified (that is a must). As a major bonus, it leads onto my next point....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am determined to support as many local businesses and suppliers as i possibly can. In times where worldwide economies are suffering, we need to pull together and help each other out. I use the local Sawmill extensively, and 2 other Glasgow based timber suppliers. All of my electronics come from a UK based \u00a0start up, and my pickups are handmade in the UK too. It will always remain a core ethos of the business to support small local companies, wherever possible. And any money YOU spend via Patreon, on a guitar or on some handmade accessories actually supports a small business, and his family. I kinda like that, which is why i spend my own money with like minded businesses\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, and basically why i\u0027m here, things got so busy during the summer of 2016 I had to make a massive decision- a new workshop. So on the first of November, 2016, Ragh Guitar moved into it\u0027s new home, in the heart of Stewarton, Scotland. 800 square feet of guitar building glory. The flip side being, operating costs quadrupled, not that i\u0027m complaining. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn September of 2017 we also became a Limited Company, and are working on distribution deals for the guitars as the business grows\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut i thought it was time to ask for a little help and here is why-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Youtube channel is going from strength to strength, but making guitars and finding time to film and edit is not easy. Since the channel started, i\u0027ve received literally hundreds of messages asking for advice. Going forward, it\u0027s a side of the business that needs more focus, which unfortunately includes financial support. The channel has been incredibly well received, with tens of thousands of views already. Any Patreon support goes directly towards the associated costs of professionalizing the content\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, it goes without saying i am truly grateful for you to have taken the time to read my story, and if you would like to be a part of the future of Ragh Guitar it would be beyond awesome if you would spare whatever you can to support it\u0027s development.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"

There are no CNC\u0027s involved in the process of any of our guitars. 100% built by a human being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe focus at Ragh Guitar is very much on the timber. As you\u0027ll see on our various social media pages, we try hard to use local Scottish timber wherever possible and reinvent it in the most imaginative way possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story of Ragh Guitar and it\u0027s development is a good one. It has developed from building from a small shed as a hobby, moving onto a larger (but still very small!) Handbuilt workshop, to the new 700sq feet workshop in the heart of Stewarton.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is why we have arrived on Patreon. As a family owned and operated business, the pressures of simply covering are immense, and eat into design,building and marketing time. However, \u00a0it\u0027s passion that drives us to work the long hours to produce one of a kind guitars. We\u0027d love to be able to invest more of that passion into the things that really matter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ein a nutshell, a lot of small monthly donations would really help us move forward , quicker.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewe\u0027ll get there one way or another, but your help would be immensely appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethank you, and I hope you\u0027ll join the team\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
