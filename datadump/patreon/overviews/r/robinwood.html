    "summary": "Ever since I was tiny, I\u2019ve been dividing my time between reading stories, and making up my own. I always assumed I\u2019d be a writer, someday. But I was easily distracted, and there was so much to do!\u003cbr\u003e\nFor more than a decade, I made covers for books and magazines. I designed a Tarot Deck, painted covers for Dragon Magazine, and worked with Anne McCaffrey on a book called \u201cPeople of Pern.\u201d After that, I wrote two non-fiction books, tech-edited several others, made a slew of Photoshop tutorials, and created content for a virtual reality platform called Second Life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve been a nurses aide in an old folks home, a factory worker, a teacher, a cleaning lady, a well-known artist, and many other things. I\u2019ve been recognized by strangers in the street, and I\u0027ve been totally unknown. I\u2019ve lived in apartment complexes, on a farm, and in the suburbs. I\u2019ve been a pacifist, and an Army wife. I\u2019ve been Stepmother to two wonderful boys, and now I\u2019m a grandmother.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have so many stories to tell, more than I can probably write in what remains of my lifespan. It\u2019s time to start telling them, but I have other obligations I need to meet, too; and some parts of telling stories, like hiring a professional editor, cost money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. If you become one of my Patrons, you\u2019ll help cover some of those expenses, so I can spend that time writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn return, you\u2019ll have the satisfaction of knowing you helped make the stories possible, and a chance to read them before they\u2019re released. If you contribute more, I\u0027ll tell you some of the backstory, or let you read everything I\u0027ve written that day. At some levels, you can even make an appearance in a story or book!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to be a Patron, once a month Patreon will take the money, and give most of it to me. In return, I\u0027ll give you whatever reward you\u0027ve chosen. You can quit at any time, but I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll be enjoying it so much you won\u0027t want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t contribute, that\u0027s fine too. You can still read the short stories for free, on my blog. I put up a new one every other Saturday, and leave them there for a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you can, I\u0027ll really appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
