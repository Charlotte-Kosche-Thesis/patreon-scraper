Whether selling out listening rooms as a solo artist or performing around St. Louis with formal and informal blues and old-time groups, he uses his considerable knowledge of folk material and unassailable skill on guitar, mandolin, banjo, harmonica and fiddle to disarm any attempt to fix tradition in history books or on wax cylinders. Spearman\u0027s 2010 album, \u003ca href=\"http://ryanspearman.net/store.cfm\"\u003eLive at the Chapel\u003c/a\u003e is no less than a clinic on how to update tradition without losing what makes mastering the old language worthwhile. His music speaks to the old spirits and teaches them a thing or two about contemporary life and song as well.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    Spearman is an instructor at \u003ca href=\"http://www.folk-school.org/\"\u003eThe Folk School of St. Louis\u003c/a\u003e where--for the last five years-- he has taught classes covering several traditional musical subjects including, clawhammer banjo, old time \u0026amp; bluegrass fiddle, guitar, jug band, improvisation, music theory, \u0026amp; old time ensemble performance. \u003cbr\u003e   He has toured all over the United States and in France, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. He has performed on the main stage of The Telluride Bluegrass Festival (Telluride, CO), The Northwest String Summit (North Plains, OR), High Sierra Music Festival (Quincy, CA), Kinfolk Festival (Lyons, CO), and The Thomas Hollow Songwriters Gathering (Exeter, MO), The Fayetteville Roots Festival (Fayetteville, AR), The Boulder Theater (Boulder, CO) , The Aggie Theater (Fort Collins, CO), and The Fox Theater (Boulder, CO), \u0026amp; The Sheldon Concert Hall (St. Louis, MO) just to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Currently Spearman is performing solo, with the newly formed duo, \u003ca href=\"http://theachinghearts.com/\"\u003eThe Aching Hearts\u003c/a\u003e, and with The Ryan Spearman Band.\u003cbr\u003e",
