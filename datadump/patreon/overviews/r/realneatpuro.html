    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo many ideas for projects, nowhere near enough time to work on them all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHello there! My name is Justin, and I run the YouTube channel Real Neat Puro. What started out as a one-off side channel for my Wrestle Kingdom video quickly spiraled into the most fulfilling creative outlet I\u0027ve ever had- thanks to all you wonderful people who take the time to listen to me ramble. Since January, pretty much all my free time goes into making videos for this channel- but between my tendency to work on something until I\u0027m completely satisfied and there only being 24 hours in a day, my output has been sporadic, to say the least.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the work I\u0027ve done so far and would like to give me the opportunity to devote even more time towards obsessively watching and occasionally writing about pro-wrestling, then this is realistically the best avenue for it (not getting into how YouTube labels pro-wrestling content when it comes to ads).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money I make from here will be largely spent on day-to-day expenses (bills, wrestling streaming services, beer, etc.), as these are the only things between me and a life completely consumed by fake play fighting. Help make this life a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m doing a \"per video\" Patreon because at the moment I can\u0027t really guarantee a minimum number of videos per month. Each project varies drastically in production hours and, again, I\u0027m a quality over quantity guy- within reason, but my current goal is 1-2 videos a month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe channel is still very young and I\u0027m continuing to experiment with my topics and production style, but you can expect each video to be between 5-20 minutes- however long it takes me to cover all my significant thoughts on a certain topic. The subject matter ranges from wrestler and faction profiles (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U\u0026amp;video_id=HE0V2h4kQZU\"\u003eMinoru Suzuki: The Importance of a Lonely Warrior\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U\u0026amp;video_id=fXECM4ZTIls\"\u003eThe Troubled State of Bullet Club in 2017\u003c/a\u003e), match analysis (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U\u0026amp;video_id=KGTLa_n9w3s\"\u003eThe Importance of Kenny Omega vs Kazuchika Okada\u003c/a\u003e), show previews (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U\u0026amp;video_id=2UWvGWvSgw8\"\u003eThe Stories Behind Wrestle Kingdom 11\u003c/a\u003e), and more general discussions (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U\u0026amp;video_id=8RkBieI49KA\"\u003eThe Changing International Face of New Japan Pro-Wrestling\u003c/a\u003e). My main concern will be making sure you are getting your money\u0027s worth with each video.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo far all my videos have been focused on New Japan Pro-Wrestling, but soon I\u0027d like to fulfill the \"puro\" part of my title and branch out to write about other Japanese promotions- both past and present. As well as the occasional outside topic (I feel like there has to be something profound said about Wrestling Society X). But since I\u0027m currently known for making NJPW content and that is probably what you are paying for, \u003cstrong\u003eI will only be marking New Japan related videos for Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e for the time being- at least until I have a few non-NJPW examples for you to sample.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
