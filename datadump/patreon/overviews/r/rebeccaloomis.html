Through books, movies, poetry, plays, music, dance, art, and so much more, we\u0027ve celebrated and lamented fragments of what it means to be human. A story can ignite passion, inspire heroism, instill hope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor love of my fellow earthlings and this life we all share, I\u0027ve embarked on writing stories in the genre of dystopian fiction. My debut novel, \u003cem\u003eA Whitewashed Tomb\u003c/em\u003e, is about a young woman named Tabitha, whose only chance at finding her estranged father is to hunt him down for the corrupt authorities. (Read more\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.rebeccaloomis.com/the-book/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTabitha\u0027s story isn\u0027t over, and with your help, it can continue.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s simple: With your support of just a few bucks per month, I can prioritize writing the sequel to A Whitewashed Tomb. Without you, I have to set Tabitha aside for less exciting projects that pay for my groceries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you join my team of patrons, you\u0027ll get to be part of the writing process with me. Depending on your pledge level, you\u0027ll have access to early drafts, live video chat sessions, exclusive material not included in the book, glimpses into my process, a book club study guide, the real and raw side of lil ol\u0027 me, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is a lonely business. I\u0027m so happy to have you along for the journey. From Tabitha, Ambrose, and all your fictional friends in \u003cem\u003eA Whitewashed Tomb\u003c/em\u003e, THANK YOU for your support!"
