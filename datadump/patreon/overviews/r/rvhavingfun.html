John and Tracy talk every week about their adventure in Full Time RVing, questions a lot of new RVers ask, tips and tricks, and more. Join us each week for RV Having Fun and live the dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTracy and John have been full time RVers for about 10 years. We have made multiple mistakes over the years that we will share in our podcasts. We\u0027ve learned a lot. And we have an unique point of view because we not only have been guests in parks but currently we are managing a park. That brings a very different perspective that we share as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on the Patreon page we will be giving early access to the shows, behind the scenes clips that have been edited from the show, after the show content on occasion, exclusive videos and pictures, and personal interaction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe look forward to meeting all of you and we appreciate your support.",
