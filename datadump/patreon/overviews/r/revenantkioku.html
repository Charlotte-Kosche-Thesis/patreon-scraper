    "summary": "The \u003ca href=\"http://fourjobfiesta.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFinal Fantasy 5 Four Job Fiesta\u003c/a\u003e is one of my most enjoyable times of year, and it has been getting bigger and bigger each year. So why am I asking you to pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA better site. More events. New games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ask you donate to the charity event first. Then, if you have the means, I am asking you to help me spend more time making this event bigger, better  and towards my goal of developing a game designed exactly for the Fiesta itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh no, crowd funding!\" you say. Let me reassure you that the Fiesta is here to stay no matter how much comes through this funding. I will still work to make the Fiesta run better and smoother. But through this funding I will be able to say \"I am going to spend time tonight rewriting the Fiesta page.\" instead of \"I am going to spend tonight translating.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s take these ideas one by one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Better Site\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the Fiesta site launched in 2011, 125 players had played the previous year. 488 played in 2011. In 2016, 1988 players registered \u003cem\u003ebefore the event even began\u003c/em\u003e. In order to keep the event growing, a better website is going to be needed. Easier logins, easier account management. Faster victory approvals. Better ways to ask for and get support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore Events\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years now people have been asking for this game and that to have their own Fiesta. With the resources, I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more time to running these events. It would also be easier to dedicate time to managing the site year round so you could do logged runs outside of the official Fiesta season.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Games\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides running the Fiesta in my free time, I\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://letsplaying.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edevelop games\u003c/a\u003e. It has been a dream of mine to develop a spiritual successor to \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy 5\u003c/em\u003e designed \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003especifically\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0with an event like the Fiesta in mind. This will take resources well beyond myself. Art, music and the like. I have been working on a game for a while now, tentatively called \u003cem\u003eFated Final Voyage\u003c/em\u003e. You can follow its progress\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://whatisacrepe.com/dev-blog/?category=Fated+Final+Voyage\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon, like all of life, is a work in progress. I\u0027m sure there will changes and more to come. I hope that with your help the Fiesta can become one of the biggest gaming events around!"
