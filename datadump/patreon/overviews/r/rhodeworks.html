    "summary": "Hello, and thanks for visiting my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Rhodeworks, a history teacher by trade, and I write. It has been a hobby for me for much of my life. This Patreon marks my attempt to transform it into something other than a hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have one big project I devote my time to currently (and it\u0027s probably how you found this page). This project is a web serial called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://notallserial.wordpress.com/\"\u003eNot All Heroes\u003c/a\u003e, a gritty take on superpowers and heroes and villains set on\u00a0a near-future Earth that\u0027s not so much post-apocalyptic as it is on the permanent eve of one. A central question of \u003cem\u003eNot All Heroes\u003c/em\u003e is whether a hero is truly saving the world if they are merely preserving it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNot All Heroes\u003c/em\u003e follows three individuals from very different backgrounds -- Sabra, Fisher and Leopard -- who operate somewhat outside of the usual hero/villain dichotomy. Each of them will be forced to confront what it means to be a hero while they try to find a place in the world. It\u0027s a story about personal apocalypses as opposed to global ones, and what happens when those apocalypses are one and the same. \u003cem\u003eNot All Heroes\u003c/em\u003e is currently updated Tuesdays weekly. Ideally, however, I would like to update three times a week -- but that requires support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this time, my plan is to allow Patreon supporters a greater degree of feedback opportunities. But, generally, my wish is for people to donate because they wish to support me, not in return for any potential perks. Perks can take away time from writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to establish enough support that I can spend more time writing and, therefore, move to a more frequent update schedule. Presently, monthly totals will result in chapters being released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this page, and thank you for your support. Your support is what allows me to devote more time and energy to this passion of mine and, for that, I can\u0027t thank my followers enough."
