    "summary": "Rachel Jendrzejewski is a writer and performance maker who works throughout the U.S. and internationally, most often investigating awareness, embodied experience, and the complexities of \u201ccommunity.\u201d She frequently collaborates with dancers, visual artists, musicians, fellow writers, and alleged non-artists to explore new performative vocabularies. Her works have been developed and/or presented by the Walker Art Center, Red Eye Theater, Public Functionary, In the Heart of the Beast, Padua Playwrights, The Wild Project, Playwrights\u2019 Horizons, Trinity Rep, A.R.T., and ICA/Boston, among others. She is currently a McKnight Fellow in Playwriting at The Playwrights\u0027 Center. Other honors include a Playwrights\u2019 Center Jerome Fellowship and Core Writer Residency, a month-long residency at MASS MoCA, plus project support from the Network of Ensemble Theaters, Minnesota State Arts Board, and Foundation for Contemporary Arts. MFA Playwriting, Brown University.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* * * * *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein recent years, I have been \u003cstrong\u003eexploring many different models for financial sustainability \u003c/strong\u003eas an experimental writer, collaborative performance-maker, and interdisciplinary artist. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein November 2015, I joined this new platform, Patreon, which departs from many other crowd-sourcing platforms in that aims to generate \u003cstrong\u003eless project-specific, more ongoing income for artists,\u003c/strong\u003e while directly connecting these artists and their work to their audiences, fans, and supporters -\u00a0taking the best of patron models from centuries past (the 1:1 mutually rewarding relationship between an artist and a supporter) and translating it into a new horizontal platform for today (where a \"patron\" can be someone who regularly gives $1, not $1 million). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eat first, I was nervous that nobody would sign up. but today, I am humbled to have dozens of incredible patrons who are providing me with substantial support - empowering me to prioritize work that might otherwise live on the back burner indefinitely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003egiving through Patreon is different from nonprofit/charitable giving\u003c/strong\u003e. Patreon support is not tax-deductible. it\u0027s more like subscribing to a theater season... only instead of paying an institution for tickets to whatever they might create that year, you\u0027re paying an artist directly for access to whatever she makes that year (or over any amount of time that you want to commit). it\u0027s an active relationship and mutual exchange.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has become popular thanks in part to some high-profile folks (like the amazing \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\"\u003eAmanda Palmer\u003c/a\u003e) who use it to connect to fans around the world. clearly, I\u0027m not operating at such a vast scale, so I hope it goes without saying that I do not have expectations about securing a comparable level of support! \u003cstrong\u003erather, I see this platform as a useful way to connect with my existing small-yet-so-mighty circle of supporters in a way that is personal, ongoing, and logistically smooth/streamlined\u003c/strong\u003e - perhaps eventually serving as an alternative to (at least some of) the big time-sensitive project campaign blitzes, as I become able to budget for projects in a new way, thanks to knowing what has been pledged per piece.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"per piece?\" you might wonder, what does that mean?\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein a nutshell, here\u0027s how it works: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e+ you \u003cstrong\u003epledge \u003c/strong\u003eto give a certain amount (could be $1, could be $5, could be more) every time I release a new piece of work. it is super fast and easy to sign up, and you immediately have access to the full archive of previously shared work, which has been accumulating since 2015!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ a \"piece\" could be something small, like a blog post, or big, like the premiere of a new performance. \u003cstrong\u003eI make a lot of different kinds of things\u003c/strong\u003e - not only performances and blog posts, but also social practice experiments, collages, poems, songs, films, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ I currently share 1-3 \"pieces\" per month. sometimes it is less and occasionally it might be more.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e+ \u003cstrong\u003eyou can set a dollar cap on your giving\u003c/strong\u003e, so that you never exceed what is affordable for you during months when I\u0027m on fire! you\u0027ll still get access to everything I make. you also can bow out before you get charged in any given month, if you find yourself in a financial pinch or simply aren\u0027t feeling it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ in addition to being the first to access any released \"pieces,\" my Patronauts will receive \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive updates and thank you gifts \u003c/strong\u003eon a regular basis, most of them organic to my art-making processes of the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ein 2018, your support is more vital than ever, as I undergo treatment for breast cancer. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll be working more slowly than usual, but mind you, I will be working. developing a new interdisciplinary collaboration with Brooklyn-based choreographer Terry Hempfling through The Playwrights\u0027 Center, with a work-in-progress showing in the spring. examining modes of resistance and habits of thinking with Billy Mullaney. building a new play with The Syndicate. revisiting writing initially sparked through a collaboration with Karen \nCellini and Vicki Grise, investigating the female body as political \nlandscape. scheming some very big exciting plans in Maine with Theo Goodell (patrons are getting the inside scoop along the way). AND MORE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyour patronage plays an unspeakably huge role in allowing me to prioritize and commit time to these projects, in many cases even before (or in lieu of) securing institutional partnerships and other forms of funding. I can\u0027t wait \nto share more about all of it with you over \nthe coming months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethank you so much for your belief and support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebanner image from video still of work-in-progress with Terry Hempfling, 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eprofile headshot by Rafal Nowack\u003cbr\u003e"

These invites may include free tickets to my next production, private real-time broadcasts of productions, panel conversations, long table discussions, happy hours, story circles, brainstorming sessions, think tanks, and more. I\u0027ll shape these opportunities in part through close conversation with you, based on your location, availability, curiosities, and interests. \u003cbr\u003e",
