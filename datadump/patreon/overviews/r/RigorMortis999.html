You can find my work at \u003ca href=\"http://gamesheetmusic.com\"\u003ehttp://gamesheetmusic.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce I could write several transcriptions a week as a hobby, but now I have a family to support. This means little time for pro bono work. If you can help me financially, I can provide more of the music we both love.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to produce a large number of sheets. I would like to make the most informative videos possible. I would like to provide my transcriptions in multiple difficulty levels. I would like to regularly take requests. I would like to produce audiophile level recordings. Your pledge is a step towards making these things happen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd now for examples.
