    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI love to be entertained, but over the years the bar of censorship on programming keeps falling lower. I got tired of it, but there seemed to be no where to turn to for quality, family friendly entertainment. I discovered that kind of quality story telling in the form of classic radio shows. \u003cbr\u003eSure, sometimes the audio preservation of these old shows can be poor, the setting a little quaint, and certain social norms have actually become better over time. Smoking is no longer portrayed as glamorous, and stereotypes of race and gender have made advancements to break out of the old molds. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a world where \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe comedy is clean\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGood guys always win \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHeros are eworthy role models\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s still plenty of timeless entertainment value in these old shows, but as long as they stay tucked away in archives, how will any new generations enjoy them? Why should they fade from memory, and be a matter for historians and librrians to research? \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat Your Support Will Do\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially, it\u0027ll give me a vbig head, and I\u0027ll be flattered. On a more regular basis, it\u0027ll help me to maintain the monthly expense of the recording equipment I use, the server space and expense, finding new sources of radio shows, and keep me disciplined to sit down and write show notes and record new podcasts. \u003cbr\u003eAs more long term goals are reached, you\u0027ll be helping to keep the shows circulating in the ears of newer and newer fans. Breaking out of the archives, and maybe even inspiring the xcreative writers of the future in how to write quality stories, or possibly exploring a return to an audio medium for telling stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEveryvbody Wins\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTelling stories through audio can be enjoyable and liberating. It may be imnpracticle to watch a video while driving, doing household chores, or other physical work. With audio, you can still take care of that job, enjoy a story, and paint the picture of the scenes in the imagination. Pictures and special effeccts that are better than anything a movie can deliver. \u003cbr\u003eBe a part of it, and help get the word out about the wealth of classic audio entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e"
