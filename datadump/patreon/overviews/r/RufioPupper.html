This is RufioPupper, (you can call me Rufio, pup, puppy, or little one, I respond to those and variations of those!), I use they/them pronouns, and welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always had a deep investment in sex education, particularly queer and trans inclusive sex education. Even growing up in a very open environment, being queer and genderqueer, I still didn\u0027t feel like I learned about sex in a way that made sense for my body and my relationships. This was even further complicated by my multiple disabilities which also impact my body, mind, and therefore, the ways I have sex and also engage in kink.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first started dabbling in kink when I was around 20 years old, so that was around 2013, but it was only a year later that I started to become really invested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI discovered puppy play, actually, through a show called Taboo, which I caught on the channel National Geographic. They were doing a special on Puppy Play, and that was where I first saw Tyke Puppy and Liliane Hunt, who lived in San Francisco at the time of filming. Funnily enough, I was actually planning on moving to the bay that next year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I saw Tyke Puppy and Liliane Hunt, I was immediately enamored. I was like \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s what I want to do. Whatever that is, I need to do it.\u201d I remember watching that episode multiple times since it was recorded, just in awe. Ever since then, I have been hooked!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I moved to the bay, I dove headfirst into the scene. I was so eager, I went to every event I could, joined munches, when to kink cafes and dungeon parties and classes, I went to the Folsom Street Fair during the years I lived there, and I met so many incredible people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was so fun experiencing new people and trying new things and to this day puppy play is still my favorite thing. Now, years later, I am in a different location and am trying to integrate into the community here. I want to continue learning new things and sharing what I learn because I think that peer education is so valuable. Peer education was very much what helped me navigate the world as a young adult where much of what information that was put out to me didn\u0027t pertain to who I was or how I lived my life. My peers and I made it so that we could support one another, whether it was regarding navigating chronic pain or sensory issues during sex, alternative barrier methods for queer couples, or figuring out how to deal with dysphoria during intimacy. I hope my content here is able to encompass topics that create an inclusive environment for all kinds of kinksters, and is also just enjoyable for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading, and I hope you will support my journey in self-discovery and peer education so we can all continue to grow and learn together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
