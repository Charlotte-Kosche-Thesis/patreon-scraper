    "summary": "Producing high quality, professional-level content is a very time-consuming process. The best of editors are only as good as their best efforts, so giving it your all is rather important. Unfortunately, doing so can be rather difficult and expensive, and I\u0027m not exception to this rule. Between audio tracks, software, plug-ins and more, the cost of producing videos can grow significantly depending on how you approach it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my case, I have to pay for my audio tracks, my software and my plug-ins, as well as any additional materials which are not able to be created by myself. My refusal to resort to pirating is largely due to the fact that I wish to remain professional, honest and transparent in my works. Because of this, my hands are tied and I am forced to turn to Patreon for your support. While for now this avenue of creation remains a hobby, I wish to eventually turn it into a career. I can only do so if I can afford to practice and refine my craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to pay for my software, purchase my audio tracks, and pay for any additional necessary plug-ins. All of the money I receive through Patreon will go back into the channel, and your support will be reflected in the improved quality of every subsequent video released. Beyond this, I have a handful of rewards for those who are interested.\u003cbr\u003e"

Upon joining the booming Pony Fandom in the end of 2011, I began immediately creating PMVs. (Pony Music Videos.) These videos have covered a large range of genres, and have been in all sorts of styles. I strive to provide my fans will good, quality content, at a relatively fast pace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a very tech-savvy person, and have been working with computers my entire life. The entire technology as a whole intrigues me, and so I feel I must learn as much as I can about, and from it. My taste in music covers a large variety, and I can\u0027t say there is a genre I don\u0027t like. \u003cbr\u003e",
