I always believed that creating and making comes from the heart and that the payoff would be seeing how appreciative others are for your work and effort. However, living in this capitalistic society I know that\u0027s not how things work. As I continue growing , I understand that the work we do as (queer, undocumented, trans, people of color/non white) artists in the movement is important and should be valued. So, if you value the work that I do and would like to support me as I visually decolonize my way through the world, I would be infinitely grateful and I\u0027ll happily take you along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I\u0027m looking to make some changes in my life by the end of this year which include a big move. At this point, any little bit of financial support will help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd lastly, I\u0027m starting to save up for my top surgery. I\u0027m not a place where I can make this a priority just yet- too many factors still need to be considered, but this is something that\u0027s very important to me and my growth. I\u0027ll be setting aside a fund for this and saving up until I\u0027m ready.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I humbly ask for your support at any capacity. I\u0027ll do my best to tangibly show my gratitude through little gifts you\u0027ll receive in the mail. That\u0027s my way of saying \"thank you for caring and thank you for helping me survive.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSiempre en la lucha hasta la victoria y la liberaci\u00f3n-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU CAN STOP YOUR PLEDGES AT ANY POINT.
