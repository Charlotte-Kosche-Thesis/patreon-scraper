    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m roBurky. I make stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\nI tell stories about games, like the tale of my homeless sims \u003ca href=\"https://aliceandkev.wordpress.com/\"\u003eAlice and Kev\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nI make videogames, like the arcade experience \u003ca href=\"https://roburky.itch.io/three-body-problem\"\u003eThree Body Problem\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd since the beginning of 2017, I\u2019ve been making\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itch.io/c/227877/mods-for-the-sims-4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emods for The Sims 4\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat I\u0027m doing now\u003c/h4\u003eI do part-time work caring for children and young people with disabilities, but my weekdays are spent split between freelance work and the creation of mods for The Sims 4. It\u0027s my hope I can keep this balance between these different types of work that I enjoy, and that as this patreon grows I can increase the time I spend on making things for patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes The Sims exciting for me is the collaborative way you work with the game to create a story. You come with an idea for who your sim is, and what kind of life they\u0027re going to have, and then the game pushes back with some ideas of its own, and what comes out can be surprising and affecting.\u003cbr\u003eThe mods you see me make will generally be intended to help along this kind of play. Although there might also be some other kinds of things from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should see a new mod or a feature update from me at least once a month. When a new game patch is released, you should also expect a patreon post from me soon after to let you know what mods, if any, require an update.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOther stuff I do\u003c/h4\u003e\nI am perhaps still best known for telling stories about games I play, and this patreon will be my home for these kinds of writings going forward. Finding the kind of game that will inspire this type of thing isn\u0027t easy, so it\u0027s not something I can commit to on a schedule, but when it happens, my patrons will be the first to read it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eBecoming a patron\u003c/h4\u003eWhen you pledge to this patreon, you\u0027re giving me a little bit of money every month to help keep me alive, sheltered, fed, and making things. You\u0027re thanking me for the things I\u0027ve made that you have enjoyed, and supporting me for the things I will make in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you become a patron, no matter the amount you pledge, you will get email alerts whenever I release an update or something new, and in your patron welcome message you will find a link to a download key for my little arcade game Three Body Problem as thanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you pledge at the $3 tier or above, you can also join my community of testers. You will get access to patron-only posts that will contain links to preview builds of mods and games that I make, some of them practically finished and just waiting for me to write up the formal descriptions, some of them works-in-progress that I would love it if you could give me feedback on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you pledge to one of the higher tiers, you... will be so generous I don\u0027t yet know what I can do in return. I\u0027ll think of something, but in the meantime, you will just be awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nWhether you\u0027re able to pledge or not, thank you so much for just reading this page and considering it.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
