    "summary": "Hey everyone, and welcome to the relaunch of the Replay Retro Patreon account, if you\u0027re here it\u0027s probably because you\u0027re a fan of the show and because you want to support it going forward to help me make it as great as we both want it to be, so first up massive thanks to you for that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut i think it\u0027s time for some home truths, in all honesty the channel has been let go quite a lot recently and that\u0027s not good enough, the fans (both patreon and not) deserved better, i could put it down to huge changes in my life, i could put it down to general lethargy towards the channel but those are all excuses. It\u0027s time to get back to doing what i love and bringing you a show you\u0027ll hopefully enjoy and maybe even feel like supporting again, so how is this gonna happen?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell Season 4 is drawing to a close after the longest production schedule ever and i really want to avoid that happening with Season 5, so to make that a reality i\u0027m planning a block of planning sessions, filming sessions and productions sessions so that i\u0027ll always be a few episodes ahead, this means there should always be regular content set to a regular schedule, i\u0027m also going to focus on new shows to refresh my interest and keep things fresh, so watch this space guys, the channel is coming back!"
