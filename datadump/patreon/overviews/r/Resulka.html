    "summary": "Hello there! You seem to have stumbled along here to my page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past 8 years online, I have been known for two things - \u003cbr\u003e1: Silly Let\u0027s plays of Adventure games, Edutainment and *wink wink* adult games of the DOS era\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eand 2: Even sillier short adventure games I\u0027ve designed and created for ReVenture Games. (Lorna Bains, Able Mabel Gets a Job and Glass Splinters.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy time to work on both of these was severely hampered for the last 6 years was a full time job and over the last year I have changed to a part time job while I make a good crack at Game Development at a full length game with real sentiment behind it, not just a short silly adventure after silly short adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I don\u0027t wish for you to fund my lifestyle as I that is what my part time job is for, what I\u0027m looking for help with is my monthly subscriptions to such tools as MODO, Substance Designer+Painter, Marvelous Designer, The Adobe Creative Cloud Suite. All tools I use for making the games I work on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what will you get in return for pledging? First off, Information on my game desk and being in the Testing group for any games I\u0027m working on. I also made a return to posting daily on my Youtube channel. I mostly cover Adventure games and Edutainment but occasional other things show up too - Like Nail Art and how to\u0027s on 3D stuff or retro gaming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I\u0027m doing daily 15-20 minute videos. During the weekdays, I alternate between a Modern and Classic Adventure game. I\u0027m using 1997 as my separation year for this, Though 1997 is now 20 years ago, this is when the modern adventure era sorta began. I wonder when people will consider the \"post modern\" adventure era to start, but that\u0027ll be seen eventually. On the weekends, I post Edutainment titles. I occasionally have some extra videos ontop of that, such as when I\u0027m interested in a VR game or something that\u0027s popped into my mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreons generally will receive an update on Sunday that has all the videos for the coming week, before they hit youtube!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also stream, through that\u0027s not a set part of my routine and is generally based on when I have the effort and time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s about it - I thank you for your time and I really appreciate any help you can give. \u0026lt;3"
