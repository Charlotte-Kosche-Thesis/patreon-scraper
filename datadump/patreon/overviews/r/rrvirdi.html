Virdi, and I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m a science fiction/fantasy author primarily writing and publishing in the\nurban fantasy genre. My series, The Grave Report, has been nominated for a\nDragon Award in the best fantasy (paranormal category 2016) and at the time of\nwriting this, I\u2019ve published three novels. Dangerous Ways, book one of The Books of Winter, has landed in the 2017 Dragon Award finalists as an urban fantasy novel. Many of my short stories have been\npublished in anthologies to benefit charities such as the Alzheimer\u2019s\nAssociation, and St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m at\nthe part of my career where the demand for my writing is taking off and the\nincome isn\u2019t quite what it needs to be to meet that demand. I\u2019m writing full\ntime, landing appearances at conventions and even attending them as an industry\nprofessional now. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBetween\nwriting, attending conferences, researching material, and juggling three\nseries, (yeah, I have three in the works) it\u2019s getting to be time consuming. My\ncareer is at the point where it\u2019s make it or break it. I\u2019m consistently working\non honing my skills, and producing whatever I can to the best of my ability. In\nall of that, it\u2019s hard to keep up freelance writing and a stable source of\nincome outside of my writing. And writing income is unpredictable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI need\nyour help to buy me time to get more projects out there so I can invest in my\ncareer and turn this into something long term. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eI want to\nwrite for you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create art and share it with you. I want to be able to\ndedicate the time to write short stories in between it all and give those out\nfor free so people can read without having to commit to my novels. Not everyone\ncan afford giant books, but that doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be able to read.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat your patronage will allow me to do is all of that hopefully. I\u2019ll be able\nto keep producing high quality novels and share them with the world. I\u2019ll be\nable to follow my dreams and make bigger strides and capitalize on the good\nthings already happening.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the three years since being published, I\u2019ve been nominated for a variety of\nawards, one being a massive one. I\u2019ve met my heroes in the writing world, many\nof them have copies of my works. I\u2019m attending cons as a guest, and I\u2019m just\ngetting started. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m humbly asking for your aid in helping me accomplish all of that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nThank you. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
