They can literally be about anything but my most popular ones tend to have something to do with being trans.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe landscape of YouTube has changed dramatically over my time on the platform and earlier in 2018 they changed the monetisation requirements which completely wiped out so many smaller creator\u0027s earnings - my Adsense balance hasn\u0027t changed since they implemented them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, I am lucky to have some people who support me on Patreon and for as little as $1 per video, they get access to my content as soon as it is available and a little more backstory behind the videos I make. Not only that but I often run ideas past them and the idea is to eventually build something of a community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, here are the rules:\u003cbr\u003e1. Do not pledge more than you can afford. I\u0027d hate to have you being in financial trouble because you support my methods of procrastination\u003cbr\u003e2. Feel free to put a limit on how much you want to pledge per month because Patreon will ask for your pledge PER VIDEO if you do not specify otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLove Ruby! xx"
