I finished an \u003cstrong\u003eundergraduate program in international relations and modern languages\u003c/strong\u003e after a rocky start in university. I then went on having several health issues that unfortunately killed my ability to concentrate for a long time, making it near impossible for me to continue my undergraduate program in linguistics and translation. I am the owner of two Australian Shepherds, \u003cstrong\u003eRuten and Bug\u003c/strong\u003e, who are both as different as they are similar: he is a hard-working, particularly intelligent boy and she is a volatile, powerful and sweet little girl. I hope to continue doing herding with them and providing them a good home.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon page would most likely finance the \u003cstrong\u003enext three projects, \u003c/strong\u003ewhile helping me move forward with my \u003cstrong\u003ewild, wild dream.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eTHE PROJECTS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eShepherds \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eis my little baby. It\u0027s an idea that I got last summer and I\u0027ve been tweaking the plot/information about it. I would like to write about my adventures with my dogs, in the canine world, and in herding, presenting them in mixed media (writing and photos). I think it is important to write a book where the owner struggles with her goals, her objectives, with the hand that\u0027s been dealt to her. This book would reach out to most dog owners trying a new sport with their dogs, struggling with goals, objectives, competitions, their own nerves, or even the people who are only trying to make it to the next day with their pets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePretty Ribbons\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is on its third draft and is inching closer to publishing date, in January 2019. It is in need of a beta-reader who will assess any language and sensitivity issues. Set in a modern Montreal, it explores underground organizations, sexuality and gender identities.
