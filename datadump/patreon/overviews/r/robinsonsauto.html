Times were different back then, wasn\u2019t uncommon to bring your kids to work, well at least it didn\u2019t seem to be.\u003cbr\u003e you can say that is where my visions began.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003efast forward a few years, my Dad opened his own repair shop J\u0026amp;H Automotive along with a partner Jim. with the support of my mom and us kids. that\u2019s when i started gaining knowledge, on the job training put me years above others my age, them other tech kids ha who\u2019s that guy! i was walking tall had the basics feeling the pride when others would ask me questions and visit the shop. The future seemed bright what more could i ask for.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Through the years unfortunately like many relationships My father and Jimmy grew apart and split ties.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOut of that transition came Robinson \u0026amp; Sons Auto, say that loud and proud \u003cimg src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/svg/1f642.svg\" style=\"height: 1em !important; width: 1em !important; margin: 0px 0.07em !important;\"\u003e i do. i was committed! still young at this point the only contributions i could offer was my wiliness to learn and show up everyday, very long days most times. it was tight some months i wont lie but we somehow kept the doors open.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Few years later when the lease was up, The land owner put the building up for sale prime location, I recall my Dad coming in the shop saying; There\u2019s an offer on the building and we cant match it.\u003cbr\u003eNeed i say more. that was the end of the road as i knew it, we left that shop leaving a big part of me behind. They tore the shop down and built a new convenience store. people these days most likely have no clue when they walk in, There walking on a kids dream. i cant dwell on this to long. still gets me.\u003cbr\u003esince that day i had a goal. i will do whatever i had to and get what we once had back, i worked many lines of work since then while rebuilding that kids dream on the side, its been a long road and im closer and wiser than ever, it would take a army this time around to take what i built.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imaging this effort consumes countless hours. Creating content has never been about the money to me, However the closer I get to achieving this goal the more time and money is being invested. Its getting harder and im not giving up! so here i am asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003eA Small contrabution could potentially take this Chanel to the next level. I truly have so much more to offer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for the support, Will \u0026amp; Family\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eRobinson\u2019s Automotive Specialist\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
