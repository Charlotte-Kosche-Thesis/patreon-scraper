A Patreon page is a modern twist on the old patronage system of the arts. This allows people to directly support a creator and to free the creator to produce more, um, creations. By supporting me on \u003cstrong\u003ea monthly basis\u003c/strong\u003e, you help me to secure time and equipment to create faith-focused photo projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for that support, I will offer rewards based on your contribution level. You can see a list of them to the right. They range from a heartfelt thanks and access to my feed to signed photo books!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to that, and most importantly to me, we will be creating a community. In this private community, we will be able to discuss the values of art and faith and how we can apply them to our lives. You will also be able to suggest subjects, be the first to see my projects as they develop, see behind the scenes videos and interviews, and be a part of the thought processes behind each project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that contributing to something like this is not for everybody and that\u2019s okay. I really appreciate your interest in and support of my photography in the other contexts that brought you to this page--thank you so much!
