    "summary": "Hey pals! My name is Rosa Francesca and I\u0027m a musician and aspiring Music Therapist. I\u0027ve been learning various instruments and singing from a young age, and studied Music at Lancaster University. I also worked as a singer-songwriter for many years, creating folk, jazz and alternative pop music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m creating this Patreon because I\u0027m moving in a new direction with my work. I have lots of cool artistic collaborations with a visual artist in the pipelines (of which I\u0027ll hopefully have more news to share soon), so I\u0027m looking at moving into the realms of electronic music and sound design which is very exciting! I have some experience of this from my degree, but it\u0027s still a far cry from the music I put out as an acoustic singer-songwriter. Therefore I\u0027m asking for your support so that I can be motivated to create some cool new sounds, and so that I can keep learning new software and have access to the equipment necessary for these projects. For an idea of the kind of thing I\u0027ve been working on lately, check this out:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://therapeuticdiversity.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/rosafrancesca/shes-my-type\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also hoping to study Music Therapy soon, and have started a blog looking at the lack of diversity in the field, cross-cultural aspects of Music Therapy, and general musings on equality and inclusion in mental healthcare and the arts.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://therapeuticdiversity.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://therapeuticdiversity.wordpress.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting my patreon will give you access to previews of new work, old demos from my singing work, exclusive info about the digital and visual art pieces I\u0027m working on, behind the scenes notes from upcoming blog posts, and general updates on my creative process (plus probably a few harp covers thrown in!). I\u0027m hoping we can have a fun little community and discuss music, diversity, music technology, and all that goodness together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay cool, friends x\u00a0"
