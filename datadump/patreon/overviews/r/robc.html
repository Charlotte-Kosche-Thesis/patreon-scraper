You can check out one of these below - my look at the vastly underrated\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMorpheus\u003c/strong\u003e, or you can visit my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAgJhaPWsQLlrBtOdZ6K53I_2RPhfzI6\u0026amp;action_edit=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efavourites playlist\u003c/a\u003e which includes some of my favourites from those I\u0027ve done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fQgi3p_SW8M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who aren\u0027t familiar with it, Patreon\u0027s a service which allows you to support the creators of various things you enjoy in a more direct way. Working as a freelance programmer means that there\u0027s times when my time, or my income is somewhat unstable - meaning I may have additional time to work on a larger video, or that I may have less time in order to catch up on a project. So by choosing to pledge, it helps me block out time to work on these videos, as well as plan for some of the other ideas I have in my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI must \u003cstrong\u003estress\u003c/strong\u003e that my videos will \u003cstrong\u003ealways be free to watch\u003c/strong\u003e, regardless of whether or not anyone supports me here. I\u0027m primarily setting this up as a tip jar, for those who do appreciate the work I\u0027m doing, and are in the position where they can spare a few dollars each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my Plans?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the short term, I plan to use any pledged money to help cover my various living \u0026amp; tech expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver time, if the channel grows in support, I\u0027d like to be able to put some of the money towards improving my videos - from getting better capture hardware, to training \u0026amp; materals for the packages I use (Final Cut Pro \u0026amp; Motion), as well as other supporting pieces for when I do live action framing parts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get for supporting me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start with, I\u0027m offering early access to videos as I upload them - when working on them, I try to get a few done at a time, so as they go up, they\u0027ll be ready for Patrons to view ahead of their public release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with that, I\u0027ll also include some behind the scenes action - talking about some of the games I\u0027ve been playing for coverage, along with some other little surprises along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, this is something which I\u0027ll expand over time (as things grow) - but when it does, I\u0027ll be sure to let all my patrons know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for taking the time to check this out!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
