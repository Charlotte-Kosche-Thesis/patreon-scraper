Thank you for stopping by my Patreon page and checking out my comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking on teams and solo I have published a range of comics on all sorts of topics in the last 7 years, including in anthologies like \u003cem\u003eSliced\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eSunday Comix\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e I also write a weekly webcomic - \u003cem\u003eGreannan An Lae\u003c/em\u003e - which is a longform fantasy comic in the Irish language (English translations are made available here). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost all of my work is available for free online for anyone to enjoy, but supporters here will get to see a lot more process and development work (if that\u0027s your thing) and also extra comics that aren\u0027t published anywhere else. Oh my!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT WAIT THERE\u0027S MORE. With the help of a trusty writer (thank god for writers) I am now embarking on a mega project of genuinely epic (terrifying) proportions. We will be publishing in print but I will be sharing development artwork and so on through Patreon, so this network of enthusiastic supporters will get behind-the-scenes goodies as things unfold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf money is tight, interacting with my work on the various social platforms is also hugely rewarding for me and deeply appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
