    "summary": "\"Frankly, I was sick of being told by male-run labels and managers, that they would sign me if I had other men write my music and shift my image. I created Alt Mode in reaction to that.\" RYAT\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA L T M O D E \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlt Mode, as in: alternate modalities is a body of musical works written by the composer/producer, RYAT (Christina McGeehan), reconstructed into a performance that integrates dance, live electronic music, video mapping, interactive media and set design. Directed and choreographed by Watson-Wallace, and composed and designed by RYAT, the work asks questions about what it means to be a woman on stage, radical female presence in a popular context and equity within the form. In this work, RYAT and Watson-Wallace continue to explore how we wear our identity, working with themes of doubleness, drag, the other, pleasure and melancholy, as sources of power. We explore ecstatic states, state-shifting, and pleasure as revolution, as ways to propose new futures."

Help support our team of 19 artists to finish creating this performance.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"Frankly, I was sick of being told by male run labels and managers, that they would sign me if I had other males write my music and had them shift my image. I created Alt Mode in reaction to all that bullshit.\" RYAT\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA L T  M O D E  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlt Mode, as in: alternate modalities is a body of musical works written by the composer/producer, RYAT (Christina McGeehan), reconstructed into a performance that integrates dance, live electronic music, video mapping, interactive media and set design. Directed and choreographed by Watson-Wallace, and composed and designed by RYAT, the work asks questions about what it means to be a woman on stage, radical female presence in a popular context and equity within the form. In this work, RYAT and Watson-Wallace continue to explore how we wear our identity, working with themes of doubleness, drag, the other, pleasure and melancholy, as sources of power. We explore ecstatic states, state-shifting, and pleasure as revolution, as ways to propose new futures.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis campaign pays for the\u00a0giant team of animators, dancers, directors, videographers, lighting designers, production designers, musicians, fashion artist and many artist assistants will be working for two weeks in April and two weeks in August to finish the development. There will also be mini residencies, where teams of these artist will get together to work for a week at a time February-August 2015. This development takes tons of time for creation and rehearsing, renting of spaces, and payment of materials. 90% of this donation goes to the artist time.",
