Wow, this is when my life will change and the serious work will start.  I\u0027ll keep you posted with how it goes and share some inside information and exclusive content too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would expect that it would take me a year to 18 months to complete.\u00a0 Following on from this I have several other ideas for original research into the value of Reiki and would love to take those forward too.\u00a0 Lets see where this can lead!\u00a0 Please join me on the journey.\u00a0 As a community lets join together to make this work and share the journey as a group.\u00a0 Thank you so much for your interest and support.\u00a0 I hope you will continue to read The Reiki Incentive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love and best wishes,\u00a0 Angela x"

She enjoys sharing her passion for  authentic practice as well as research into the benefits of this wonderful therapy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAngela has been involved with Reiki since 2003, having studied the complete Usui system with a number of Reiki Masters.  She also worked for many years alongside professionals within the NHS, including those who offered Mindfulness based therapy for patients in chronic pain. During this time she developed a keen interest in clinical research into the benefits of Reiki and completed a Masters degree in Health Research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis led to a post in clinical research and further training with the NHS Health Research Authority. A short stint in a clinical governance role on the management team at a local hospital trust followed.
