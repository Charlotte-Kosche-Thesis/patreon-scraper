Years ago, on a whim, I grabbed my iPhone one afternoon and started recording gameplay runthroughs of my favorite board and card games, and uploading them to YouTube. I started out for fun, but it quickly evolved into a full time job where I produce over two hundred hours of content every year!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can check out my series at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/rahdo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYOUTUBE.COM/RAHDO\u003c/a\u003e, and as a sampler, here\u0027s a playlist of some recent runthroughs I\u0027ve done (click the playlist icon in the top left to see a long list of video choices):\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLmQverenaaqJuH7cIV7jHStAkopgGY5fA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal with my videos is always to demonstrate what the game feels like to play, primarily to help like-minded board game geeks choose which of the myriad games on the market are right for them. I tend to focus on \"euro\"-style games (thinkey, puzzley games that require a lot of strategy and planning) with a special emphasis on the 2 player experience, as I only play games with my wife, Jen. My filming style is intended to put you, the viewer, at the table so you can get a first hand, first person view of the flow and style of gameplay.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope my love of boardgames comes across in everything I produce, and I hope to keep producing, which is where you come in. If you should choose to support the show, there\u0027s a few different rewards available, most prominently the opportunity to vote on what games I cover (details\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEvblZtQXOo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e), early access to some videos, and exclusive content only my backers get to see!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have any questions, please don\u0027t hesitate to ask (or check out \n\u003ca href=\"http://faq.rahdo.com/\"\u003ehttp://faq.rahdo.com\u003c/a\u003e)and otherwise I just want to say thanks for watching, have a very nice day, talk to you later, so long, buh bye! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
