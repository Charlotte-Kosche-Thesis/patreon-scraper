    "summary": "Hello and thank you for visiting me here on Patreon. A few years back I launched a successful\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/randygranger/pre-order-strong-medicine-the-cathartically-joyous\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKickstarter campaign\u003c/a\u003e. It showed me just how much people want to support my work as a musician, healer and one who brings people together through music and stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong my travels people have mentioned they would contribute to me if there was a way to support me on an ongoing way beyond crowd funding. Here it is. If you follow my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://randygranger.net/news/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblogs\u003c/a\u003e or social media presence you\u0027ll know I am one who always inspires, teaches, unites, heals with my work and words. I take what I do very seriously and frankly, could use your help in bringing my brand or healing and music to a larger audience. I know you agree we need more of that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support here allows me to write, record and release more music and videos. It also allows me to tour on an even larger scale. I go to places other artists might not like Hooker, OK, Joplin, MO after the horrible tornadoes, Big Spring, TX for an art exhibition, Moosehaven Moose retirement community in FL, Leesburg Center for the Arts in FL, many assisted living and long term care facilities, many schools, Rock Art festivals, Fringe festivals in San Diego and Salt Lake with my cohort in Theatre Dojo telling ancient tales with acting and music that move, captivate and get audiences talking about compassion, war and forgiveness. I\u0027ve volunteered music in Hospice and Alzheimer\u0027s Dementia facilities for eleven years. I also teach workshop to encourage other players to do the same. I\u0027ve lead spiritual journies to Acoma Sky City and Canyon de Chelley and have played tens of hundreds of concerts, house concerts, festivals, National and State parks, theatres, houses of worship--you name it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a fully-self funded independent musician with eight commercial releases in my current Native American/World/New Age genres. I give and serve as is my calling. I\u0027m a widow having lost my partner to pancreatic cancer in 2011. I was caregiver and all doer and had to quit touring to do so, without regret. My album\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cdbaby.com/all/lonegranger\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStrong Medicine\u00a0\u003c/a\u003edocumented that journey musically and is a very moving and popular album with my fan base.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have busked many times for coins and dollars. This is like virtual busking to some respect. Please support my ongoing work and mission to bring more peace and reflection to this world. Thank you y Muchas Gracias,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eRandy"
