First I take the final written script and create an audiovisual script that contains images I\u2019d like to use to tell the story. Then I spend days searching the internet and social media platforms for the perfect clip to match the sentence. Finally I edit these all together, add titles, voiceover, and music for in a silky smooth concoction. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDistribution \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLastly is preparing the content for distribution.
