    "summary": "Vexed by the ages-old question: \"Where I can I get exclusive swag while also being part of a community of fans of an elder of the New England Poetry Scene\" are you? I can help. Let me tell you a story...That\u0027s what I do- I tell the make-believe stories that are true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtists neither create, nor exist, in a vacuum, and this, I truly believe, is what Patreon offers that is truly a thing of beauty, its soul, if you will... and that is: community. Writers collect, compose, and record Life. Their own life, that of others, their community, their people, the world writ large and small. They do word magic with emotions and dreams and apocrypha. They do it to understand, and to be understood. But I can \u00a0only do this if I have such a community where I can belong. As a writer and as a performing artist, what I do only has meaning if it can reach another\u0027s heart. And it can only do that if it reaches their eyes and/or ears first. Without an audience, I\u0027m just someone shouting into the void, or scribbling words down in a room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am inviting you into my community. I do this as a creator, as a person who lives with disabilities, as a father, and as a person in recovery. In all these roles, I can only hold on to the gifts of these identities if I give some of those gifts away. This is why I create: to give back to a world that has given me so much. There is a lot I have brewing, and you can be part of an inclusive group, with access to writings and blog posts unavailable elsewhere, plus odds and various swag, again, available here and nowhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me (if you did not already come here, knowing that):\u00a0I am a working artist, with over 30 years I experience. I was a part of early Slam History, have toured extensively nation-wide, and been published in many different journals, anthologies and websites. I have also been involved in editing and work-shopping with others, from established professionals, all the way to middle school children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
