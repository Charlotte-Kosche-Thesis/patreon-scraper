    "summary": "It is human nature to be creative. \u00a0Yet many of us get lost somewhere along the way and lose touch with that impulse - even artists and other makers. \u00a0My work is about reconnecting to that relationship with our hands, body, mind and spirit. \u00a0I create installations and performances that offer opportunities for non-artists to share, learn and grow. \u00a0I also make discreet objects that contain the seeds of those larger works. \u00a0If I ruled the world, everyone would make something with their own hands everyday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Robyn Love and, as it happens, I do not rule the world. \u00a0I make art instead. \u00a0Most of my work includes some kind of needlework - knitting, embroidery, crochet, spinning wool - but that isn\u0027t where it ends. \u00a0Those techniques are the launching pad for my ideas and inspiration. \u00a0I also make drawings, prints, sculpture and mixed media pieces. \u00a0In addition to making art, I offer yoga therapy to people at the end of life and I have been a formal student of Zen Buddhism for almost 15 years. \u00a0All of this experience enters my work and I use it to inspire others to engage their own inherent creativity. \u00a0You do not need to be an artist to touch this aspect of your nature! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Patreon, I am creating a series of videos shared bi-weekly that are designed to inspire and encourage you to reconnect to your creative self. \u00a0Again, you don\u0027t need to be an artist (but you could be!). \u00a0If that isn\u0027t for you, you also can participate as a collector of art. \u00a0I am offering a limited number of spaces for people who want to receive an original work of art (no larger than 12\" x 12\") once every three months. \u00a0Every quarter, you will receive a package with a unique piece of art made especially for you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspiration can come in many forms. \u00a0Please join me as we discover them all!"
