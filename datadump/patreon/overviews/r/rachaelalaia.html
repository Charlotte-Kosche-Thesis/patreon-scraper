We are working for thoughtful and honest self-inquiry within a guided container on Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work is committed to inspiring a divergent way of being\u2014which involves challenging the things we take for granted as truth, fact, or reality, it involves coming into relationship with our body\u0027s felt experience and our self-concept, our stories about ourselves and the world, our own creative/destructive powers, our ways of mothering and caretaking, our theories on birth and death, our definitions of success and failure, our relationship to grief, rage, pain and pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work is intent on learning to exist in right relationship, with the planet, with each other, with ourselves, with what\u2019s always left unseen. And by \u201cright\u201d I don\u2019t mean an exchange that\u2019s policed as proper, nice, or civilized. But a way of relating that is grounded in respect and integrity. A way of interacting that is honorable, reciprocal, and real. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work is rooted in a somatic, systems-based, experiential inquiry of the anthropocene\u2014particularly exploring how we humans might reclaim our wild sovereignty and extracate our wholeness from internalized and systematic structures of oppression by way of our bodies, how we might increase our capacity to show up more fully, more connected, and more powerful in our lives through our actions, how we might act out and embody the profound complexities of what it means to be human right now on planet Earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work is informed by my short but full time on this Earth in this body as a passionate writer and poet, a scientist and skeptic, a dancer and artist, a teacher in ecology and earth studies, an activist, a survivor of trauma, a spiritual mentor for shadow walkers, a seer in divination practices, a podcast host and speaker, a facilitator of transformational group work, a neurodivergent human living with mental \u201cillness,\u201d a mother, a witch, a gardener, a yogi, a seeker, and a devoted lifelong student of this wild human experience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT THIS WORK IS NOT\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis work will not be universally applicable or beneficial to every single person, painting a broad brush stroke across the lives of all who engage\u2014to assume so would be to overlook the distinct needs we have as a diverse group of individuals. I don\u2019t want to invalidate and erase our differences; I want to honor them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work is not a pathway to bolster a cultural preoccupation with perpetual positivity, constantly being happy, or feeling good all the time. It is not about fixing our fucked up-ness, softening the blows of reality, reconciling the mayhem we face, or about making the hurt disappear. Rather, it\u2019s intent on being in the mess, reconnecting to our humanness, restoring a certain grounded resilience, and learning to value the beautifully varied full spectrum of our human expression and interwoven existence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work is not for achieving perfection, imposing absolute expertise, coming up with impenetrable explanations, diminishing anyone\u2019s direct lived experience, or giving unsolicited advice. It is neither conventional wisdom nor an easily marketable set of rules, conditions, or recipes to success, but is a container built to discover and engage with what\u2019s real for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work is not here to tell you how to live, respond, react, relinquish, revel in. It\u0027s not the magic bullet or the cure-all.
