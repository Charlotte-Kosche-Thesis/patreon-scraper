    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of you\nprobably know, but for those who are new, my name is Doug Gray. I\u2019ve been\nrunning RedsMinorLeagues.com since January of 2006 where I have covered what\u2019s\nbeen going on in the Cincinnati Reds minor league farm system. It has been\nmostly a full time job for me for several years now. Since 2009 I have been a\ncredentialed media member for all of the full season teams that have been\naffiliates of the organization. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been keeping an eye on Patreon for over a year now as a possible replacement option for the sites previous subscription model and I have liked what I\u0027ve seen. After months of deliberation I decided to make the jump to this platform, hoping that it\u0027s the best thing for both myself and for you, the readers of the site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks of donating\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll content\non RedsMinorLeagues.com is going to be free for everyone moving forward. Those\nwho donate and support the site will however get a few perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\nDuring the\nseason \u2013 morning emails with notable performances and notes from the previous night\u2019s\ngames will be waiting in your inbox.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\nEarly access\nto interviews and scouting reports that will go up on the site days later.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\nThe ability\nto submit questions for player/coach/minor league development guys for\ninterviews, and mailbag questions in the format that we have done in the past\nin the All Questions Answered topics.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the move to Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs many of\nyou know the site has been supported by both advertising and a subscription\nbased model for the past few years. The subscription model that I\u2019ve been using\nhasn\u2019t kept up with the rate at which the sites traffic has grown over the\nyears. One thing that I\u2019ve heard from more than a handful of people over the\nyears was because it was difficult to sign up for with the system that was in\nplace. Patreon represents a much better way for those who want to support the\ncontent to \u201cdonate\u201d or \u201csubscribe\u201d than the current system does. It also seems\nlike it will make things easier for me when it comes to the workflow of\nproviding the content to the readers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere is\ncertainly some risk involved in making this move. Without requiring people to\npay to access the content on the site some people will choose to not support it\nvia money that otherwise may have. With the previous model, I had built up a\nsmall amount of subscribers that provided me with income that along with the\nadvertising money was enough to scrape by. Changing the entire format and\nasking all of those people to re-sign up for a new format, as well as asking\nthose who haven\u2019t supported things via that model in the past could leave me on\nthe wrong side of things. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy hope is\nthat being open about everything (both monetarily and the reasoning behind\neverything), and providing quality content for everyone will move this venture\nforward and let it grow beyond what the previous model was doing. Making\neverything available to anyone who shows up, and making the content easier to\nfind for those looking in search engines for it, will continue to grow the user\nbase, which in turn will also make the site better and easier to provide more\nquality content. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of the new model\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe main\ngoal is to keep the website going. As noted above, the growth in traffic has\nbeen strong over the last few years. While that has helped out, between the\nsubscriptions and ad rates (which vary wildly from month-to-month), it\u2019s gotten\ntougher as I\u2019ve gotten older to continue to operating the site on the amount of\nmoney it\u2019s brought in. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will be\nfully committed to keeping the site going for the rest of the year regardless\nof how this new model turns out. I am hoping for the best and with your\nsupport, to keep the site going forever. Either way, it\u2019s going to continue\nthrough at least the end of the year no matter how things go. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe other\ngoal is be able to just provide more content. That will require enough people\nto be interested enough to support everything that goes on at the site.\nExpanding the in-person coverage, adding other contributors to the site and\nprovide overall better and more in-depth coverage of the players, organization\nand individual teams. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuestions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you have\nany questions, please feel free to email me: dougdirt24@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e"
