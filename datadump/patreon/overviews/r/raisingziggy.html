Hopefully, you\u0027ll decide to stick around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably already follow me over at Raising Ziggy, and you\u0027ve come here to see what Patreon is all about - right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell honestly, up until a few days ago I had no bloody idea what direction my Patreon would take. And now I do. So thank you to those that stuck with me as I worked shit out - and if you\u0027ve just turned up, you\u0027ve bloody timed it perfectly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was talking with a mate recently about the \u0027us\u0027 that we were before we had kids. And that when you become a parent, often all the new friends you make, and the new people you meet ever know of you is parent you. Responsible, tired, old, adult.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut who you are is SO much more than that, and you have stories. Stories that will raise eyebrows, and make people laugh.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomeone once said to me that I needed to write a book. You know, OE baby, never knew my dad, found my real name at 15, found my real dad at 18, one way ticket to Aussie, one way ticket back to Whangarei, crash on the Northern motorway,  police escort out of Kerikeri, ban from Matauri Bay, that time I lived on a yacht in New Caledonia, that other time I slept in my car. The car that my uncle then stole. A guy called Eddie.  A girl called Ra. That time I rolled in a puddle on Queen Street cause I was hot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah. Those stories. Some of them are funny and some are sad and some are almost unbelievable, and I once wrote in my dairy at the time \"I need to write this shit down before I smoke too much weed and can\u0027t remember any of it happening\u0027 but I never wrote it down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m going to it down. Bit by bit. And if you\u0027d like to be part of this, (wherever this may lead), then sign up, and come along on this journey with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it\u0027s not for you that\u0027s cool too, thank you for coming and checking it out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEm"
