    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Rachel Meghan. I write things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written for a number of websites, including Funny or Die, Rue Morgue, Monologue Blogger, and Love TV. I mostly enjoy writing personal essays, many of which can be found on the up-and-coming FLASH Zine. I write poetry too, and have released two zines, \u003cem\u003edesperate living \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003emedium talk\u003c/em\u003e, both of which you can find on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write plays! My first play,\u00a0\u003cem\u003ein a room called heaven,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ewas workshopped in March 2016 and will be getting a full production in mid-2017. My second play, \u003cem\u003ei\u0027ve decided\u003c/em\u003e, had its first reading in September 2016, and is currently being workshopped. My pilot, also titled \u003cem\u003edesperate living\u003c/em\u003e, is going to have its first reading at The PIT in the next month. In addition, I\u0027ve written a number of one acts and sketches, as a result of my training at Hunter College, Fail Better Reading Series, and UCB.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a recent graduate of CUNY Hunter College with a BA in Theatre. I\u0027ve been performing since I was a kid, and I consider it my first love. Since I started college I have been in a number of productions ranging from new works to classic texts. I also write and star in my own short films, which you can find on my channel. I started doing comedy in 2015, and have been featured in several stand-up shows around New York. I\u0027ve even performed on public access television! Currently I perform weekly with the New York City Rocky Horror Picture Show shadowcast (NYCRHPS) as Janet, which is super cool because it\u0027s been a dream of mine to be a part of that community since I was a kid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI art direct sometimes. I started doing it on said public access show (\u003cem\u003eThe Special Without Brett Davis\u003c/em\u003e), and began doing it on a few web series. Recently I even got to design a Jack Daniels commercial, which was super fun. I really love being on set, and art direction is my trade of choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, I am an advocate for mental health. I live with Borderline Personality Disorder, and while it can make my life absolute hell sometimes, it also keeps me strong and challenges me to create and be the best I can be. You\u0027ll probably see me write about it a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, that\u0027s pretty much my life. I\u0027d love it if you subscribed. I\u0027ll bring you all of my best stuff, including poetry, personal essays, zines, and maybe even some artsy stuff too! I\u0027d love to make things for you. Hit me up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003erachelmeghan.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
