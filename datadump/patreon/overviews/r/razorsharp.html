    "summary": "Razor Sharp Studios, founded in West Virginia, has consistently produced at least one feature film every year since 2008\u0027s PORKCHOP, which launched it\u0027s own trilogy and spin-off film, PIG GIRL. We\u0027ve slaughtered teens in every possible way, including lawn darts, croquet mallets, and even re-animated fetuses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one thing we\u0027ve always been stuck with is how to produce content consistently, on a weekly basis. That\u0027s where this Patreon comes in. Instead of ONE Razor Sharp feature every year and a six month delay while we drive ourselves crazy editing it, imagine weekly YouTube and Vimeo content, delivered directly to you on a weekly basis. Web-series, shorts, skits, music videos.....we want to bombard you with content until you hate us...and then grow to love us again....and then hate us......and then hopefully love us some more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe monthly bills for Razor Sharp are a bit more than you\u0027d think. Between web-hosting, our editing suite, our podcast hosting, Vimeo, Stamps.com, and several things we\u0027ve actually had to CANCEL due to lack of funds, we basically get drained dry every month trying to just stay afloat and keep our content out there, floating around for you guys to enjoy. Becoming our patron means we can keep providing you guys with all the stuff you enjoy....and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would also be able to afford things like koozies, buttons, figures, and all sorts of other treats that we always give out for free to anyone who wants \u0027em, especially at conventions. And we\u0027d be able to attend more of THOSE at well! Want us in your town? Become our patron and we can get out to do more shows and spread Razor Sharp to the masses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if it\u0027s a small monthly pledge, it all adds up. A few people at $10 will take care of our webhosting. A few at $25 could take care of several other bills. Then we can start releasing web-series and features and attending cons. Before you know it, we\u0027ve taken over the world. Together. In an evil way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not looking for a handout and we\u0027re not looking to have our lives paid for so we can sit around sipping champagne and eating steaks. We\u0027re simply asking.....if you like it, support it!"
