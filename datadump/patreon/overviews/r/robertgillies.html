    "summary": "Hi! I\u2019m Robert, and ever since I can remember I\u2019ve been attached to a musical instrument, from pianos and trumpets, to guitars and the human voice. I started writing songs for fun (in fact, my first one was for my girlfriend at the time - my second? For when it didn\u0027t quite work out) and after hearing how much people related to what I was doing decided to take it seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u2019ve performed around the globe, written with some pretty big names, and got several of those songs out there with artists like \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IumYMCllMsM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBebe Rexha, X Ambassadors\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-YQqaqPVDE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIllenium\u003c/a\u003e. That being said, the life of a professional writer and performer isn\u2019t one that\u2019s marked by stability, even when you\u2019re hitting high marks - so that\u2019s why I turned to Patreon, a place where I can create freely and have the support of incredible people like you, turning my passion into something that can sustain me on a more regular basis and where I\u2019m not restricted by a label or publisher\u2019s whims or needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year I\u2019ve decided to experiment like crazy - dig deeper, find new sounds, try things that might scare me at first, but will lead to deeper truths being revealed. Should you decide to become a patron of mine, you\u0027ll be privy to behind-the-scenes content, first listens, and online hangouts designed to bring you on board in an even more meaningful way. You won\u0027t just be a listener - you\u0027ll be a participant. I\u0027d be honoured to have you behind me on this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u2014\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does Patreon work? Instead of funding a big, one-time project on Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, Patreon allows you to become a more permanent patron of me as an artist, giving as little as $1 per project I release. The more people involved, the better - I can produce songs with my friends and guests, record in studios, and have the songs professionally engineered and mixed!"
