I\u0027m a 30 year old young Canadian man with a lovely girlfriend for 7 years and a beautiful 4 year old daughter.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI love doing what I do for a few reasons. At first it was just for the \nfun of it but it\u0027s evolved into something greater than just me having \nfun. It\u0027s about putting a smile on other peoples faces. It\u0027s about \nchanging someones life in someway because they were able to listen or \nwatch something silly I do that added a spark to their darkness. I\u0027ve \nreceived many letters and e-mails talking about how I\u0027ve changed peoples\n lives just because of this. It still blows my mind that I can do what I\n do and have that effect on others..and that\u0027s what makes it so darn \ngreat. A second reason is the fact that it\u0027s downright fun. I can be \nmyself, do what I love and work from home. It\u0027s a lot of work but if you\n love what you do it\u0027s not really working is it? Thirdly, it\u0027s a great \ncareer opportunity. There\u0027s a lot of potential in YT as a career and \nit\u0027s very exciting for anyone trying to get somewhere on YouTube. Though\n the competition is fierce and tough.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://bentcorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pat_banner1-350x99.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPatreon is a crowd funding website where you can directly support the \ncreators you love!

I will carry on making youtube videos whether you\n pledge or not. Please don\u0027t donate anything if you\u0027re strapped for cash\n and certainly don\u0027t feel obligated to support my work in this way.
