    "summary": "Hello, and Welcome to Roll to Breathe:  the actual play podcast delivering thematically-driven narratives through copious character melodrama!  ...Except, not really.  I mean, we do deliver those things, but this isn\u2019t Roll to Breathe.  This is our Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, about us.  I\u2019m Yako, also known as Meg!  Behinds the scenes, I take on a role as host and producer of the podcast, but in the first season of our podcast, I played the robotic hero Epoch.  In our next campaign\u2014Steel City Rhapsody\u2014I\u2019ll be playing Lena Wen, who you can see in our banner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in late January of 2017, I had been wanting to do an actual play podcast for a while, but I had trouble organizing a group of friends to actually execute the plan.  When we managed to synchronize our schedules and run a Masks campaign, I saw my chance and asked our group if they\u2019d be okay with recording our session.  They agreed, and today we\u2019re sitting at the end of a campaign.  What was a project we expected to get a little attention from family and close friends before fizzling out has completed one fulfilling narrative arc and enjoys an average of about 140 downloads per episode.  We can\u2019t thank you enough for your enthusiasm, and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to share our stories and characters with you through different games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo continue this journey to the best of our abilities, we\u2019d really appreciate a little financial support.  It will go to paying the people who take time out of their weeks to create assets for the show, better audio equipment, and more original music.  As a distant-future goal, we\u2019d also really like to be able to play and record some special games all in one room together-- not an easy feat, seeing as we\u2019re spread over three countries!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve set up some rewards for backing us at certain levels.  Our biggest reward is also the cheapest:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEpyllion: A Bonus Campaign\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://rolltobreathe.podbean.com/mf/web/pdij8y/cover_full.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEpyllion: A Dragon Epic is an Powered by the Apocalypse title from Magpie Games.  It\u2019s an all-ages adventure in which dragons navigate a highly magical world, protect it from all-consuming evil and learn about friendship in the process.  When I mentioned wanting to run it, I got six people interested, each of whom had their eye on a different playbook-- quite a feat, considering there are exactly six!  So we\u2019ve created two groups who have parallel, unique adventures in the same world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eOnyx\u003c/strong\u003e clutch is made up of Darn (Kyle), the well-mannered, clumsy apprentice craftsman; Jagi (Holly), the fearless and loyal daredevil; and Luka (show newcomer Trin), the withdrawn but empathetic Seer who is intimately familiar with the Darkness that plagues the land.  The \u003cstrong\u003eOpal\u003c/strong\u003e clutch contains Tokarz (Jovian), the serious and righteous warrior; Fegios (Bee), the shy but stealthy nature adept; and Yorne (show newcomer Setsu), the eager and optimistic academic.  Epyllion episodes will release every other week, alternating clutches, so you\u2019ll usually get one adventure of each clutch a month.  To learn a little more about them, you can listen to our sample episode:  character generation with both clutches present, \u003ca href=\"http://www.rolltobreathe.com/e/epyllion-teaser-character-creation\"\u003eright here\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for visiting this page!  Even if you can\u2019t give us anything, your continued listening and feedback means a lot to us, and we hope you enjoy our next season.\u003cbr\u003e"
