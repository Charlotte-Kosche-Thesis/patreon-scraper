Many artists use it and it works like this: Decide how much you wanna support per video ($1 or more). Then register by clicking \"Become a Patron\". There are different levels of rewards you get each month. \u003cstrong\u003eFor example the\u00a0$5 level gives you skype vocal lessons from me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0You can also decide how many times per month you wanna support no matter how many videos I make. I usually make about 5 per month so set a MAX nr if you need to. To edit/cancel your pledges can be done at anytime for whatever reason you have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s13.postimg.org/tz26iaesn/helping_hand.jpg\" style=\"width: 659px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, I am asking you to support what I so passionately do and want to keep doing. To improve and make better music videos is one of the things that puts a smile on my face when I wake up in the morning. But it takes lots of hard work, 10 hours each day also goes to a regular day-job. But singing is so much fun and I love helping people with singing advice and guidance in life. So become my Patron to push me even further to make this a musical full-time job. I can then focus more each day and greatly enhance our experience. Really makes a difference.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAlso as thank you, your name will appear in the end of each video. Many thanks!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
