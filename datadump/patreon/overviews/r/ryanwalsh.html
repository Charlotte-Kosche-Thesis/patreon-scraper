    "summary": "Hello! And thank you for visiting my Patreon page! I have created this page in order to follow a new dream. Since returning to Portland from my studies in Spain, I have been performing full-time. While this is an absolutely amazing job, I have discovered that what most excites me as an artist is the challenge of learning new pieces of music, as well as composing them. This is primarily what I want to dedicate my professional life to. Patreon, through its ongoing subscription service, combines the modern power of the internet with the historical model of artist patronage to help make such dreams possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Contributor you will be supporting my continued creation of original new music, primarily on classical guitar and piano, as well as the curation of my favorite pieces from the classical guitar repertoire. You can contribute as much or as little as you like, and in return you will receive everything from periodic recordings, to blurbs with my thoughts on the music, videos of all of my songs, physical CDs of each new album, comped tickets to live shows, handwritten personal letters detailing my musical journey and how your contributions are helping make it possible, my undying gratitude, and more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo go check out the cool stuff I\u0027m offering on my page, and get signed up if you support the cause!\u00a0Classical music is my life, and I want for nothing more than to share it directly with YOU, my fans! Thank you for joining me in this dream, and I hope you enjoy my music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRyan"

After several years studying full-time alongside some of the world\u2019s finest and honing my skills, I began to hear a different call\u2014that of my own roots in the Pacific Northwest\u2014and I knew it was time to continue my travels. Although I have now returned home, my journey with the classical guitar is only beginning. I am excited to share the beautiful, mysterious, and intensely intimate music I discovered during my years abroad with those here at home.\u003cbr\u003e",
