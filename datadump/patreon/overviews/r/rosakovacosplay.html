I\u0027m Rosakova Cosplay, I\u0027m a cosplayer and nerdy lover from Colorado in the United States and I am 24 years old. I\u0027ve been cosplaying on and off for over ten years now and it has become a huge passion of mine that I am incredibly dedicated too. I attended my first convention when I was 14 and absolutely fell in love with Cosplay and the community and knew it was going to be a huge part of my life. It was so amazing going to my first con and realizing that hey I wasn\u0027t alone in this big world of being a fan of something nerdy and that I could talk to anyone and have a similar interest with them, it was very eye opening and has led me down an amazingly beautiful path of creativity and fun. I\u0027ve always been a huge fan of gaming, anime, movies and comics since I was very young, my mom introduced me to it at a very young age. I have memories growing up of playing Sonic on my Sega and how excited I was when Pokemon first made an appearance, or when Lord of the Rings came to the theaters, or when I beat my very first video game; Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I\u0027ve always had a huge passion for all things nerdy, it is very apparent in my every day life. Ask anyone who knows me and they\u0027ll tell you that I live in nerdy clothes and have a plastic harem of girls (anime figure collection) that I am very proud of and not afraid to let people know my love for the things that make me happy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4669/25136658277_239cef4003.jpg\" width=\"333\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I cosplay?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eI cosplay for many different reasons, some of them are that I really love taking a character and bringing them to life, and the confidence boost I always get when I see myself become a favorite character and watching others get just as excited as I do. I love being creative and taking characters or ideas and giving them my own flair, from genderbend cosplays to bringing animal/monster characters and turning them into humans, the sky is the limit when it comes to cosplay and I enjoy challenging myself and seeing how creative I can be. I also cosplay because of the community, it is so amazing to attend a con and see so many other cosplayers and fans. It\u0027s amazing to be able to go and be around people with the same passions and interests as you. If it weren\u0027t for cosplay I would not have the friends and support groups I do, and it means the world to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4749/39109467375_dd68dbdb78.jpg\" width=\"333\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I have been hesitant to try Patreon for a long time honestly, I was scared that it would limit what my audience could see and segregate them, I wanted my audience to always feel included and not like I was hiding my content for money. I never ever want to take away from my fans. After a lot of research and talking to other artists though, I learned that Patreon is just the opposite! It allows for so many opportunities for the artist and for the Patrons, it pushes the creator to be more and to do more for their fans, and to go above and beyond on the quality of content. This doesn\u0027t mean separating anything at all, or excluding anyone.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThe content on my Patreon will not be exclusive to Patreon! instead it will be debuted on Patreon first and soon after shown on all my other forms of social media, of course there will be certain aspects of Patreon content that will stay exclusive though, such as exclusive rewards. Also it\u0027s not an unknown fact that cosplay is hella expensive, from \nmaking/purchasing cosplays, to purchasing equiptment for shoots, and to \nattending conventions, among many other aspects to make this all happen. Patreon helps with this part of cosplay and can \nhelp keep me afloat and to keep producing new and amazing content, instead of disappearing for months at a time while I wait for the right funds to keep doing what I love. Why even subscribe to my Patreon you might ask? well there are many things that make Patreon exclusive such as the BTS content, the exclusive prints, the one of a kind Polaroids, Discord channel, private Snapchat, and many other special things I offer for being a Patron. The only content I will share with all platforms are pictures and final edits of videos from shoots or tutorials.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"406\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4656/28228379909_0dbddd41da.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWell honestly this part is 100% up to you. If you want to help support me in my endeavors? You\u0027re awesome! and thanks so very much! You get a lot of cool stuff if you do, and if you don\u0027t want to pledge?
