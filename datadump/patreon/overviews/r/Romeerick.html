    "summary": "Hi there! Sawubona (this is how the Zulu tribe of South Africa are greeting). I just came from a short trip to Cape Town so I feel full of energy.\ud83d\udcaa\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of, I\u0027m glad to have you there! My name is Romee Rick. Chances are you landed on this page after having read a short paragraph of my new novel depicting the life of Edna, a young metis mother about to experience a lot of tribulations in our modern world. And you most probably enjoyed reading it! \ud83d\ude09\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, thank you! \ud83d\ude4f\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I writing this story?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea came into my mind while I was staring at an amazing mountain in Cape Town.\u003cbr\u003eI started thinking about the world we live in. Everybody\u0027s in a hurry, busy working 9 to 5 jobs just to make enough money to cover the bills. People are sacrificing their holidays and their health sometimes for what? For money. Those who cannot work two jobs anymore are desperately looking for quick ways to make money, so that they can survive. Some ways are legit, others are not. Some seem to care about legit jobs, some don\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut how far are we willing to go to get money? Do we set any limits?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be interesting to see how people in need of money would behave in certain situations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s how I came up with the story of Edna. I want it to cover those questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are craving to know the rest of the story, then help me launch the book. I can\u0027t do it alone, to be honest. I will need your support to successfully complete this project. I will need you to back up the creation of our novel and be part of that interesting journey \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udd92.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust hit the big orange button that reads \"Become a patron\"!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I raising money for? And why am I asking you to fund the project?\u003cbr\u003eWell, there are 2 simple reasons to that:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePutting out a novel is not really affordable. It requires money. I have set an initial goal of $2,000 to cover the editing and rewriting costs, the cover design costs, and the publishing costs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI believe that, instead of writing the novel alone, it would be more fun to have a community that is passionate about the project and shares ideas to build up the story.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created some awesome perks for those who want to contribute! See you in the perks section!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
