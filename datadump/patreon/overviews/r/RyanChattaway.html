    "summary": "To say that I have a passion for cinema would be an understatement.  When I was born, I blew the minds of the medical community when they found that I was born with millions of microscopic film reels in my blood. Since birth, the world of cinema has dominated my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Growing up, whenever I went to the doctor\u0027s office, they would prescribe me a high dosage of Blockbuster Video Free Rental coupons. The doctor told me to watch two films the first day and one film each additional day until I was completely healthy. Well, let\u0027s just say that even though Blockbuster Video is no more, my love of film has endured. When I was a teenager, I started to try and create films of my own.  I borrowed different family member\u2019s video cameras and made dozens of videos. I created short films, stunt videos, and I even remade \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" when I was 15 years old. It was a success by my standards! We had a viewing of the film at my sister\u0027s house and had 10-20 family members and friends there. When the end credits began to roll everyone started cheering. I knew this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. By the time I was 23, I had filmed weddings, profile videos for corporate professionals, and created videos that were viewed by countless church congregations all over northeast Florida. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In January of 2011, after taking a hiatus from making videos, I decided to start a YouTube channel so I could spread my love of film over the internet. When I started, I decided to set a few goals for my channel. The first goal was to reach over 1,000 subscribers. I never thought  I would reach 50 subscribers and believed this was completely out of my reach. Another goal I set was to be accepted into the YouTube partnership program, which gives content creators the tools to reach a bigger audience. I almost gave up my first year because I didn\u0027t have enough views to reach that goal. My last goal was to build a portfolio of reviews that would allow me to join a film distribution studios press list which would give me the opportunity to review blu-rays and dvds before street release dates. These were goals that I set in order to keep my vision and motivation flowing. I never thought I would actually meet them.  I thought wrong. As of January 2015, I have met all of those goals! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The primary goal of my Patreon Campaign is to enable me to upgrade to a new computer and as well as the best editing software on the market. I would also be able to begin the process of starting a production company. Everything from short films, documentaries, private weddings, and other events would fall under the umbrella of this company. Down the road, I would love to be able to make it my full-time job to produce high quality videos with my own company.  It would truly be a dream come true!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I would like to take a second and thank everyone who has supported my dream over the years. I have met people all over the world who share the same passions for film that I do. I am very excited to be taking this next step towards my dream with the support from my loving wife, great family, and amazing friends.  Thank you so much for your continued support!"
