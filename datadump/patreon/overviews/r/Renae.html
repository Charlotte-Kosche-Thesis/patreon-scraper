When I was a child, I would draw pictures and tell my mom a story for each one, and she would write the stories on the backs with the date and my age. When I was old enough to put my thoughts down on paper myself, she bought me a journal, and my love of writing bloomed from there. It started with juvenile journaling-- \"Dear Diary, today I realized I have a huge crush on Carson, but I\u0027m not allowed to have a boyfriend. Not fair!\"-- which made its way into angsty, brooding teen poetry-- \"His love was fake right\nfrom the start/I should\u2019ve known he had no heart\"-- and finally came to a head with the completion of my first young adult novel,\n\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Real-Renae-McBrian/dp/0692461574\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHow Real\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, my execution didn\u0027t do my idea justice and I self-published it before I really knew what I was doing, and it has hit a dead end. So I\u0027ve decided to share my writing in the form of short stories, snippets of dialogue, and the occasional journal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting is my passion. It\u0027s all I\u0027ve ever known. Cut me open and I\u0027ll bleed words.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI just hope that someday, those words can make a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou subscribe, I give. You can pledge any amount you want, whether it\u0027s $1 per month/story or $15 or $20. \u003cem\u003eEvery dollar is a dollar that I earn doing something that I love.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Some of my writing will be posted publicly, for anyone to read. But subscribers will have access to pieces I hold dear-- journal entries I don\u0027t necessarily want to share with the entire world but still want to share with people who care, or short stories that mean more to me than other pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll try to stay as consistent as possible with how often I post, but with two kids to chase and a house to run, my posts may be sporadic from time to time. But I will always make sure to post \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribers who pledge $10 or more per month will receive special snail mail love from me.
