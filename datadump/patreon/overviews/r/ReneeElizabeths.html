The dreaded introduction section!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve met quite a few writers over the years and I\u2019ve discovered we have lots in common. We love stories--writing them, reading them, telling them, listening to them, sometimes even singing them. We\u2019re addicted to books. Many of us are confirmed word nerds and dedicated grammar geeks. And we\u2019re probably the only people you\u2019ll meet who have to set a spending limit before walking into a stationary store.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re also, pretty much universally dumbfounded when asked to describe ourselves or our writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(If you want to empty a room full of writers, just ask us for a brief bio and a short synopsis of our latest work. We\u2019ll all suddenly remember we might have left the oven on or we\u2019re late for an appointment and the next thing you know we\u2019ll all have rushed away.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, who am I and what do I do? I\u2019m Renee and I write. And I draw. And sometimes I draw about writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly I write fantasy, romance, and horror stories of varying lengths, from tiny little flash fiction pieces all the way up to epic trilogies. If you want a sample of what I do, Fireside Magazine published a creepy little ghost story of mine, \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.firesidefiction.com/issue23/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTime Out\u003c/a\u003e\u201d, in their\u00a0May 2015 issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been a storyteller my whole life, but I\u2019ve been working on my craft seriously for about ten years now. I write and rewrite and write some more. I read and analyze. I critique and offer up my work for critique in return. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m getting pretty good. But I\u2019m not quite as good as I want to be. I\u0027ll continue doing those things, but there\u2019s only so much improving I can do on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. I\u2019d like to start doing more to improve my craft. Take some classes. Attend workshops. Go to professional conferences. Capture successful writers and lock them in my basement so I can siphon the genius from their brains and add it to my breakfast smoothie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWait. Forget I said anything about that last one. I mean, I don\u2019t even have a basement. Or drink smoothies with breakfast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack to the classes and conferences and stuff. As I said, I\u2019d like to tap into some of these professional resources and improve my craft. (For specifics about what I\u2019d like to do, check out the goal section of the sidebar to see what I\u0027m currently working toward.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem with all these things is that they take time and money. I\u2019m willing to put in the time. I\u2019m hoping you will help out with the money.\u003cbr\u003e"
