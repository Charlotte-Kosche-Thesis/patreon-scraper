    "summary": "The Ramshackle Chronicles is an extended live-action battle game, set in the fantastical world of Ramshacklia, and played by the two Knights, David and John Klopcic. This Patreon page is part of a much larger social media campaign, which includes a Facebook page, a blog, and a YouTube channel. This social media campaign follows the exploits of the two knights and their daily, real-life battles over the territories of Ramshacklia, as well as the shenanigans of the townspeople in the village of Ramshackle, including those of the magnificent, all knowing, all seeing, tower dwelling, minion possessing, glorious, powerful, scheming and creator of this page: Benjamaster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how did this project come about, I hear you cry...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, ever since I was a young lad I have always been completely obsessed with all things medieval and fantastical. I used to sketch mythical creatures and mystical weapons in my little drawing book, and then I would go out into backyard, girding myself with a hooded cloak and arming myself with beloved stick, and I would lose myself in my medieval fantasy world, where I was the renowned hero.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany things have changed since those days. My family has grown and relocated for one; I am now one of thirteen children, and my family has since vacated suburbia in favor of woods and streams. I myself have grown as well. I have had many amazing experiences and unique opportunities, including the chance to create props and costumes for a group of talented young filmmakers, as well as the privilege of attending college, where I am studying emerging media with a focus on design and production. As a young kid, I always dreamed that I would someday be able to bring the world inside my head into the real world, so that I could show everyone that I wasn\u0027t just a weirdo waving a stick around in the backyard. Unfortunately for me, I didn\u0027t have an awesome older brother with the resources, ability, and passion to make my daydreams tangible. So I was just a weirdo waving a stick around in the backyard. For my younger siblings however, that is not the case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came home from my first year away at college expecting to have a miserable summer, working fast food again and hiding from my crazy family. But then, after witnessing my younger brothers entertain themselves by running around the upsized yard with foam \"swords\" (they were more like bats), and by having stand off duels using bows and padded arrows, I had a brilliant idea. I decided that I was going to create a world for them, placing the exotic locales of our new property onto a fantasy map, and casting them as arch rivals, each motivated to control as many territories as possible. But why stop there? Why not let the whole world participate? I decided that I was going to make this campaign the grandest adventure of my life thus far. I contacted my young professional friends, asked them for advice, and received help in creating some quality media content to kickstart this project. I spent countless hours crafting high-quality foam weapons and realistic costumes to be used in this venture, and I came up with as many ideas as possible to let anyone and everyone participate in this legendary summer saga!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging to help fund this campaign, you will help me make this project into the epic extravaganza that I know it has the potential to be. Your donations will have a direct effect on how much content I can deliver, as well as the quality of that content, and the overall spectacle. Even a small pledge helps tremendously. It may not even seem worth pledging just a few dollars, but those few dollars translate directly to materials I can use to make better and more weapons and costumes for this project, or dollars that can be spent to help spread the word via ads.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA longterm goal for this project is to upgrade the hardware and software that I use to record and edit the video content for this project, so your donations can quite literally make this project look better! It\u0027s also my hope to make this project my full time job for the summer. I am a college student after all, and that comes with a lot of expenses. But I want to commit as much of my time to delivering content to you as I can, rather than having yet another mindless job to replenish my textbook and deodorant fund. I\u0027ve also gotten a lot of help from friends, who have generously donated their time and skills to making my idea a reality. If possible, I would like to compensate them for their hard work. After all, they have deodorant funds too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge you are pledging per episode. An episode will consist of a cinematic recap of especially epic moments in the battle for Ramshacklia. There will most likely be 4 or 5 episodes over the course of the campaign, but in addition to this there will also be other video content, mainly vlogs which I will post as often as I am able.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat it all comes down to is this; the more I get for the project, the more I can give you. The bigger and better the numbers are on this page, the bigger and better the battles become, the quality of the videos becomes, the amount of content becomes, and in short, the bigger and better Ramshacklia becomes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of amazing plans that I can\u0027t wait to show you. All I need is a little bit of help. Your support means so much to me. That is probably the last time you will hear those words coming from an evil overlord, so savor them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(If you wish to pledge an amount higher than there is a perk for, contact me and we will discuss an appropriate reward!)\u003cbr\u003e"
