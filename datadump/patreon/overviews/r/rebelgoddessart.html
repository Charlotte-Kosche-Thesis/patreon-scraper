Completeing her Certificate II in Makeup Artistry and Dress Style Hair, she went on to win Hair and Makeup Artist of the Year 2003.  An opportunity to Assist Rae Morris followed and Leesa never looked back - assisting Rae at LMFF for 4 years and various other projects she honed her skills and went on to secure an agent - Camerons Models (now London Management)\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\nHaving worked on many famous faces including Jennifer Hawkins, Margot Robbie, Michael and Lindy Klim, she has also worked at Chanel 7 and other prestigious shows such as The Logies, Alan Border Medal and MKR. Leesa also does cosmetic tattoos and has started on small black artistic tattoos - just to extend her reportoire - anything creative!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow returning to her first love painting, Leesa is drawing from many sources of inspiration from the colours in nature to man made sculptures, but faces - whether in the flesh, on canvas or paper - will always be a constant source of pleasure and her true passion!\n\u003cbr\u003e",
