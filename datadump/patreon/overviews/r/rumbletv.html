    "summary": "Welcome to Rumble TV\u2019s Patreon! If you are clued up, you\nprobably already know what Patreon is all about, and if you are here, I think\nyou will definitely know what Rumble TV is and does! But for those that don\u0027t, let\u2019s\nbreak it down.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo many of you have expressed interest in supporting the\nchannel, and this is a great way of giving you that opportunity. I have had one\noff optional donations available for some time now, and I will continue to\noffer that for those of you that don\u0027t want to commit to anything.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever for those of you that do want to commit, well\nboy\u0027o\u0027boy do I have the incentives for you here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst things first though, why Patreon. The purpose of this\nPatreon campaign is simple - to reduce my dependence on ad \u0026amp; one off\ndonation revenue. It is to create a more direct relationship between us at\nRumble TV, and you loyal fans at home.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow I know, some of you like wrestling content, some of you\nlike Rugby content, and some of you like Gaming content. I have tried to adapt\nmy channel to everyone\u0027s tastes, but unfortunately due to a lack of financial\nstability, I\u0027m struggling to make the rounds as quickly as I want to.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith Patreon, it will guarantee me a monthly income that\nwill allow me to provide a more comprehensive service to you all. It will pay\nfor new server space (Ridding us of YouTube\u0027s over the top copyright nonsense),\nbetter equipment, which means more content faster, and a host of other stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFurthermore you all know that I support various charities\nthrough my channel too, funds from Patreon will also be shared amongst those at\na ratio of 1/3.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, the incentives, what are you getting and how are you\ngetting it! For Rugby fans, 6 of the 8 NRL weekly matches will be made\navailable to Patrons only. You all know how much a switch YouTube is being over\nthe NRL lately, so there isn\u0027t another option other than go outside of YouTube\nto complete the journey. Who knows the limitations of Super League and YouTube\nnext season, so we are playing that as it arrives.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWrestling fans, you will get a monthly wrestling review!\nNew, current or old, I will review the pants off of Wrestling Pay Per Views,\nand you get them all here, exclusively here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGaming fans, just like wrestling fans, you guys get a\nmonthly review too. Perfection personified. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m asking as little as $3/\u00a33 a month for all this\ncontent... you won\u0027t get an entertainment package like that anywhere else, and\nit all goes to a good cause, and not to some greedy fat cats pocket who\ncouldn\u0027t care less about any of you. It goes to mwah, the Resident Rumbler, who\nloves you all!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCheck the rewards for more info guys.\u003cbr\u003e"
