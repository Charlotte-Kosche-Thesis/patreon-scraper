    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, my name is Alex Haddad.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eBut everyone calls me \u003cstrong\u003erainChu!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m making a game called Rabbit Ranchers. It\u0027s a light, fluffy game that\u0027s a mashup of two of my all-time favorite games, ever: \u003cem\u003eThe Sims\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eHarvest Moon!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s based around the lives of a family of four rabbits. There\u0027s a lot more about my game than I can explain here, but I\u0027ll try the best I can. There\u0027s not yet video or screenshots of gameplay, because I don\u0027t feel like the art is ready to show off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is in \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0early development, and there\u0027s not much to show off other than under-the-hood engineering work and concept art. The foundation the game is built on is nearly done, but the gameplay and art still needs to be built upon it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, please do message me! It\u0027s not a bother- in fact, I love talking about it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Gameplay\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThese cute guys move into an old barn when their old home is flooded with instant tapioca. They are slow to learn farm life, but they learn to love it. The story is told through their interactions with each other, in speech boxes. There\u0027s plenty of fun writing to read. There\u0027s no Simlish here! Every interaction you\u0027ll see is both meaningful and hand prepared by me... or the fans! Have your li\u0027l buns till, sow, harvest, and upgrade their house, their land, even the vegetables themselves! The story advances as the farm grows. Order new stuff in the mail order catalog or on infomercials on TV (Did I mention I\u0027m a huge fan of infomercials?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Community\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will create a community site for the game, with a browser based story editor. You will be able to create stories, download them, and play them offline. Registering for an optional free account will let you share with others using the central server. If you play the game with an internet connection, the game will automatically include some player made stories, hand picked by a team of approved moderators. Everything in this curated list will be \"officially unofficial\". It is the game\u0027s fanon. If your story is picked, you might even see the consequences of your story addressed in one of the game\u0027s official story packs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut why Patreon? Why not just charge for the game?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will charge for the game, as well. I need money to eat, money to pay rent, and money to keep the internet and lights on. I decided against Kickstarter. I don\u0027t want to have you guys pay me money for a product you haven\u0027t even seen yet. I want to take small donations in exchange for behind the scenes extras, early access to the game, and access to Patron-only polls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently looking at ways I can monetize the game. I may add Patreon rewards to the game itself, or I may charge for DLC. After some thinking, I\u0027m leaning towards a free to play model, since that would help get more people into the game, and quickly grow the base of player content. And more player content means more fun for everyone! If I go this route, I would most likely create \"Supporter\u0027s Packs\" that add additional, non-essential furniture, items, vegetables, and stories, in exchange for a pay-what-you-want or small fee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the game is released, if it has an initial cost, I will see to it that every Patron who has paid at least the price of the game via Patreon will get a key to unlock the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you spend this money on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to bills and groceries, I will spend my Patreon money on license fees, subscriptions and game making tools. Here\u0027s what I use, and what it costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eAdobe Creative Cloud\u003c/em\u003e: I use Adobe CC for art assets. I use both Photoshop and Illustrator extensively. I occasionally use Animate, as for the animated splash screen in the beginning of the game. I use Dreamweaver to update my website. I have about 8 months of subscription left before I must renew at \u003cstrong\u003e$599.88.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eUnity\u003c/em\u003e: When the game gets ready for public release, I will want to remove the \"Made in Unity\" splash screen to dissociate myself from crummy Unity games. I don\u0027t want someone\u0027s first impression of my work being \"Oh, this is a Unity game. I know how these usually are.\" The splash screen can only be removed by paying for Unity. This isn\u0027t going to be something I do for until I\u0027m ready to release the public Beta version. When I do, my yearly operating costs will grow by \u003cstrong\u003e$395.00\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eMiscellaneous expenses\u003c/em\u003e: There\u0027s a lot more stuff, one time costs, that I can\u0027t list. They come up occasionally and I can\u0027t usually predict them. There\u0027s music that I want to commission, and friends I sometimes have to compensate for their help. Things that fall under this category are: Spine Pro to give floppy ears to rabbits, the occasional time saving asset from the asset store (time is money- and I can sometimes save both by spending a few dollars), Sony Vegas from Humble Bundle to do video promos on YouTube for publicity, and others like this. I try not to go crazy on buying software for this project because I realize that my own effort is what is going to make or break this game, not how much money I spend on my kit, but on the other hand, if I have money coming in to cover those costs, there\u0027s no reason to stick with Gimp, CC-BY music and sounds, and other lesser-quality free solutions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill I get rewards? Will they be good?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027ll be awesome,\u00a0if you want to be involved in the game\u0027s creation.\u00a0The early access builds won\u0027t be fun. They will be functional, barebones game demos that you can help me shape! I will have polls accessible only to my Patrons, which gently guide me to prioritize, add, or remove features. I like to create for me, but I also like to create for my friends. These urges conflict, and in the case of Rabbit Ranchers, the desire to create for others has won out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow complete is the game? How do I know you\u0027re actively working on this project?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatch my progress bar fill up on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://rainchu.com/bugs/roadmap_page.php\"\u003eroadmap\u003c/a\u003e to get an instant idea as to how far away I am from the next version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can this be your only job?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt isn\u0027t. I also work together with a team/game company making other great games (\u003ca href=\"http://www.productsforrobots.com/welcome.html\"\u003eProducts for Robots\u003c/a\u003e), so I can\u0027t devote every single day to Rabbit Ranchers. I would love to devote more time to this project, and the more money it makes, the more time I can devote.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy does the company logo still say \"Your company slogan here?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI think it\u0027s funny, and I enjoy a healthy dose of Comic Sans.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m an indie game developer and designer born and raised in the heart of intown Atlanta. I have no formal training or college, but I have extensive experience in many languages! (Coding ones, of course. I speak only English.) I\u0027ve written my own flexible 2D engine in C++. It\u0027s scripted in Lua and is designed for tile-based levels. It excells at platforming and top-down adventure games such as Zelda. It was originally made for a sprawling metroidvania. I haven\u0027t made a full game with it yet, but it was an incredible learning experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I like to work in GameMaker: Studio and Unity. I\u0027ve been improving my art as well, and I\u0027ve begun to find an art style that works for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest dream is to live comfortably and carefree in my small condo, living off of meager meals cooked with cheap ingredients. I want to live comfortably forever, free to create. As long as I can create, I can be happy. For me, game making is an outlet to the drawing, writing, and coding that I love so much. Even if I earn just enough for what it costs to live here in my home, that\u0027s enough for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy making my games so, so much. I hope that you can enjoy them, too! If not, that\u0027s cool too- I create what I love, and I don\u0027t expect everybody on earth to love what I create. Whether you like what I do or not, thank you from the bottom of my heart for looking at this page! You gave me more than just a click- you gave me some of your time, which I truly value.",
