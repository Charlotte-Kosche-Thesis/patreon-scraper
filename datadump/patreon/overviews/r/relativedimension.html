    "summary": "I was inspired by some of the other podcasts out there; from Actual Plays like Penny Arcade and Acquisitions Inc., and Hiddengrid, and Arcology Podcast, to informational podcasts like Critical Glitch, Gamerstable, Fear the Boot, and Arcology Podcast again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to create my own podcast, and since I was running an online Shadowrun game, I decided to start recording it for the eventual release in case someone out there wanted to hear yet another game. I set my original game in the 2050\u0027s, going through a mix of older modules, and home-created jobs and missions. I plan to continue in this manner until we reach the current timeline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of the backlog, and the length of time between playing/recording the sessions, and when they were released (2 years in some cases), we decided to pause the 2050\u0027s campaign, and start up another.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e Artificium Occulte Venatores\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e follows a group of Vatican-employed artifact hunters as they travel the globe seeking artifacts and relics that the Church wants to acquire, recover, or just deny to someone else.\u00a0 The release schedule is more current, often only a few weeks after we play/record.\u00a0 We are also streaming the game in twitch, live as we play, so people can listen in live.\u00a0 Live viewers also have the ability to help the players by buying them extra dice with nuyen that you earn just by being in the twitch chat.\u00a0 You can find us every other monday at twitch.tv/relativedpod\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I\u0027ll be able to purchase some of the modules and books that I don\u0027t yet own, or own bad quality copies of. I\u0027ll also be able to better afford hosting and domain fees, make sure I have alternate storage means so that a bad hard drive doesn\u0027t wipe out the show\u0027s archives, and maybe even acquire some needed upgrades to equipment. If things go well enough, there might even be more time for additional content as well. We look forward to continuing to provide content for your enjoyment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
