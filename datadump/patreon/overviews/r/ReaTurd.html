     "about": "I\u0027m a 23 year old female, I grew up in Mentone, Al. Like the majority of small town kids, I had dreams bigger than the world. I\u0027ve always loved art, my grandmother was always a wonderfully, creative person, she\u0027s also ambidextrous. Which always amazed me. I work as a cook, for a local country club and also as a cake decorator. I used to manage a convenience store, but it\u0027s not what I want to do. It\u0027s always been cartoons, comics and books, anything that takes me from reality, or to better understand the lives of others and what they have and how they have experienced life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy mother passed when I was only 13, she let drugs change her and eventually take her. My father had previously left my life, leaving behind scars and some rather useful knowledge, mostly survival, and self preservation, always thirst for knowledge. He is a Lance Corporal Marine and decided his children should also go through boot camp, so my first experience with a television was in the 1st grade and rather embarrassing. Upon my joining with my god father (one of the best people I will ever have the chance of knowing and loving) I was bombarded with technology and gifts, he owned a restaurant and taught me so very much about cooking and baking. This man completely supported my odd humor, and love for books, video games and just about anything I wanted to submerge myself in. The only problem was... I have six other siblings and he constantly worked, most of our conversations were through pen and paper (though I was spoiled, he didn\u0027t support cell phones). Anyways... I\u0027ve lived an intense life, I\u0027ll give more details, If wanted, but it\u0027s helped me become the \"artist\" I am today. (Never referred to myself as \"artist\" before?) some of my themes are a bit dark,and the ideas come from images I create, in my head, with certain emotions,but my writings usually take on more of a fantasy vibe, though I definitely keep everything on the \"dark\" side, as I\u0027ve been told.\u00a0",
