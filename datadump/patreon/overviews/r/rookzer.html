It will be used for equipment, upgrades, upkeep, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon page for the YouTube channel. As most of you know, creating content is not free. I am a MotoVlogger and regular vlogger and with that comes costs of upkeep to equipment. (i.e. motorcycle maintenance, gas, camera mounts, software, hardware, etc.) Even though I have a bike, it\u0027s not paid for so I still have the monthly cost as well as insurance. I will also be trying to go to various MotoVlogger meetups to bring you even more content as well as opportunities to meet you, the supporting subscriber. I do NOT want you to think you have to contribute. This is just here as a way to enable those of you that want to help out a way to do so. If you can\u0027t, don\u0027t worry about it. We are all one big happy and growing family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
