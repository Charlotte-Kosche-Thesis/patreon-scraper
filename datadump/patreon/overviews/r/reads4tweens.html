It\u0027s a labor of love, but, well, it\u0027s also kind of expensive. The website costs some money, and keeping up with books, especially new releases, isn\u0027t cheap. I\u0027m a freelance editor, so any time I spend on the site (which is at least a few hours a week, sometimes more) is time I\u0027m not spending on paid work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWonderful people have volunteered their services to get the site up and running, but they\u0027re professionals and for future upgrades I want to be able to pay them for their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want access to the site to remain free so it\u0027s easy for the people who need it most to find what they want. I want to ensure it stays kid friendly and focused on the books, so I don\u0027t want to accept advertising.

If you\u0027re a fan of Reads 4 Tweens, chances are that there are a lot of issues around kids, literacy, education, media, games, and so on that matter to you. I hope that this Patreon community will be a place where we can have some of those discussions."
