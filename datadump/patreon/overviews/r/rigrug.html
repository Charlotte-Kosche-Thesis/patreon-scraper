     "about": "Greetings! It\u0027s Rigrug here! We\u0027re a group consisting of Willo (me) and Shirohtakashiya. Mainly I(Willo) will be doing the talking. About our roles in the project, Shiroh contributes to the story, concept arts as well as coming up with interesting combat scenarios for the comic itself. And I take everything that Shiroh has input and what I have and fuse them together and produce the final comic itself and I also write the scripts and work on storyboards and every other little things that you see every now and then. I love manga and especially enjoy drawing cool characters and creatures. But just having a cool character or creature is never enough, because I always end up making stories and aspirations for my characters and so, we ended up with the comic \u0027Therianthrope\u0027. And we\u0027ve made a patreon for it, so that we can continue telling the story, cause artists need to eat too X\u0027D",
