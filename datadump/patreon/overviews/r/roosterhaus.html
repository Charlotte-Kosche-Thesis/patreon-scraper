Although we care for many different rescued and special needs animals, including dogs, cats, ducks, peacocks and even fish, our primary focus is to rescue, rehabilitate and give permanent sanctuary to chickens, specifically roosters, who\u0027ve fallen victim to the animal industry and the cruel, illegal underground world of cockfighting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoosters are one of the most misunderstood animals in the world, making them the ultimate underdogs, even in the rescue world.  We strive to fill this need by creating a better, safer world for them and by smashing the negative stereotypes and myths through our sanctuary, rescue work and public education.\u00a0 We are here to show the world their individually unique and amazing personalities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRooster Haus Rescue is one of the only sanctuaries who\u0027s focus is specifically on roosters and rooster education.\u00a0 Because they have very little support in this world, donations are imperative to allow us to continue rescuing and caring for these amazing animals.\u00a0 Becoming a patron of Rooster Haus Rescue not only helps us continue saving lives through our ongoing rescue efforts, while caring for our permanent residents at the sanctuary, it also gives you really fun rewards!\u00a0 We acknowledge the current role roosters portray in the world and we feel it\u0027s especially important to show our gratitude for your understanding that they need your help too! \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!... from our Haus to yours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
