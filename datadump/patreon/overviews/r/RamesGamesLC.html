I\u0027m Rames.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I make quirky, sometimes quiet no shouting allowed youtube videos, and sometimes stream on twitch! I make as good of quality videos as I can. I record with OBS Studio and edit very lightly with Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2017 and Adobe Media Encoder. Which means sometimes I even animate my text (almost never).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Why do I have a patreon?\u003cbr\u003eA: Because I want your money! Why else does anyone have one?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What do I get for pledging to you?\u003cbr\u003eA: Right now? Basically nothing! As I get more and more expendable funds from Patreon and you lovely people, I can funnel that all back into you as perks of some kind or another. \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon does\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003enot allow raffles, or giveaways of any kind. Anyone who expects you to pay for a randomized chance at winning something or nothing on-site is gambling.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs the pool of income/ support increases, the prize pool available to everyone on discord/ Twitch also increases. \u003c/strong\u003eEither a higher quantity of low value giveaways, or a small number of large ticket giveaways. Prizes may vary.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is for support, plain and simple. I will find ways to reward those of you who support me directly to the best of my ability. And you feel the rewards are inadaquate I will work with the community to find things you\u0027d like as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a guy, so I can\u0027t offer my body or BTS photos or lingerie or sexy implied \"nudies\" for your money. It\u0027s beyond my physical ability.\u003cbr\u003eUnless you can pay for a sex change I will never get, because I don\u0027t want one.\u003cbr\u003eBut you can pay for a gym membership and maybe someday I\u0027ll make a sexy calendar for 20 lucky people.\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027ll probably just be of me playing with kittens or something. I love all animals. But mainly cats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make videos when I\u0027m not suffering from mental health issues that make getting out of bed to go to my dead-end 40 hour (sometimes more) job at a grocery store almost impossible. No please, don\u0027t feel sorry for me I don\u0027t need sympathy. I\u0027m not sorry to be me and you shouldn\u0027t be sorry either. But I do really enjoy making videos and while I\u0027m not looking to make it a full-time career, I would very much like to make it a full-time hobby. Any even $1 helps. And honestly, between you and I I\u0027ll probably never charge over $15 for a tier anyways. Maybe someday I\u0027ll make t shirts, that would be cool to wear my own face...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever.
