    "summary": "I create the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://after-on.com/podcast/\"\u003eAfter On Podcast\u003c/a\u003e, a collection of unhurried conversations with thinkers, founders, and scientists. It\u0027s an offshoot of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/Fiction/After-On-Audiobook/B06ZZXC8VJ/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1502782444\u0026amp;sr=1-1\"\u003emy novel After On\u003c/a\u003e, which Random House/Del Rey published in August of 2017. The first eight episodes went deep into the science, tech, and sociological issues explored in the book. As I was finishing them, I realized I was having too much fun (and learning too much!) to stop podcasting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do a huge amount of preparation \u0026amp; research for my interviews - typically 20-30 hours, often more. This gets me deep into the work and personal histories of my guests, allowing me to structure an interview that explores things in a truly informed manner, while remaining 100% accessible to non-experts. I do my best to achieve an information density that\u0027s a bit closer to that of a TED talk than that of a meandering interview. My other goal is to take listeners from passing familiarity with a complex \u0026amp; important topic to a top-percentile understanding of it in the course of hearing an episode.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy topics have included cryptocurrency, consciousness, augmented reality, extreme longevity, terrorism, quantum computing, drones, and Fermi\u0027s Paradox. Some of my guests are household names with millions of followers. Some are as unknown as I am. But all are world-class experts in their fields \u2013 ones who have been wildly generous with their time so as to impart some wisdom to the rest of us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting with the launch of this page in late February of 2018, I plan to post two episodes (or thereabouts) per month at least through June. Depending on support levels and other factors, I may then maintain the frequency, increase it, or diminish it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporters at or above $5/month will get access to a recorded roundup of thoughts \u0026amp; recommendations (articles, books, etc) connected to each new episode. Sometimes I may also throw in news about other projects I\u0027m working on. Think of it as Part 2 of the debriefs that I already put at the end of each episode for all listeners. For now, I\u0027ll post them here on my Patreon page - later we may get fancy with a private podcast feed."
