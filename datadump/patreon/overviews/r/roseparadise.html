    "summary": "Hi,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Rose Paradise, a California Chanteuse from Stinson Beach. My style is indie pop. I\u0027ve been writing, playing and recording music for several years now and am really passionate about being a musician. Some of my influences are Amy Winehouse, Lana Del Rey, and Florence Welch. My music is a wonderful creative outlet for me and I hope that it inspires other people. Most of the songs I write come from a personal emotional experience. My new album, \u003cem\u003eBLOOM\u003c/em\u003e, chronicles an important year in my life, it is 13 songs from my 13th year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first album, \u003cem\u003ePacific Blue\u003c/em\u003e was released in 2014. I used Kickstarter to help support the making of that album. I received a lot of great support from friends, family and fans. The album got great reviews from Paul Liberatore at our local paper the Marin IJ and he even chose it as one of his favorite local releases of the year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my latest album, I took an even bigger leap into the recording world. An amazing recording studio opened in the town where I live in 2014. I first started hearing about it when some bands I like (My Morning Jacket, and Band of Horses) came to record here and I saw their pictures posted on instagram and then ran into some of them at coffee! I reached out to the owner of the studio and offered to help out at the studio in exchange for time there recording. Then what started as getting a few songs recorded, quickly turned into a full album\u0027s worth of material. Even with the studio costs covered, we had to pay for musicians, engineers and post production costs out of pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople say it is hard to survive financially as a musician, but that\u0027s where you can help.\u00a0\u00a0I\u0027m turning to new fans and supporters to help with the financing of my music. I\u0027m looking for patrons who believe in me, like music and want to help a young musician make a bold start. I am both a student and a \"start-up.\" Building a healthy future in music requires diligence and talent. It also requites investors like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can become a Patron of Paradise and help support me on my musical career!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e You chose the $ amount that you would like to contribute on a monthly basis. You can cancel your subscription at any time, so you aren\u0027t locked in. You will be charged each month and I will use the money towards making new music, recording covers, making videos, buying equipment and performing out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose of you who subscribe now will \nbe the fans and patrons that help me grow the most!
