    "summary": "Hey! Thanks for supporting the continued operation and development of Radiocapture. I\u0027ve been working on this for almost 7 years now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to build a version that can be mostly open sourced (unfortunately the demodulators will always have to be closed source due to NDA requirements) so you can run your own copy of Radiocapture.com locally and capture your own systems. Every person that contributes to this patreon is another voice telling me to make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the uninitiated Radiocapture.com is a software defined radio system I built that captures entire trunked radio systems. It will decode the control channel and then capture every transmission as it happens, as well as all the metadata that comes across the control channel. A single Radiocapture machine can capture hundreds of simultaneous voice transmissions and a bunch of sites, additionally it\u0027s designed in such a way that it can run across multiple computers. My biggest RF site uses 3 machines to capture 19 P25 systems, and easily hits more than 100 active voice channels recordings simultaneously every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe warned though, it generates a LOT of data."
