    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHello, thanks for visiting! I\u0027m a singer with an idea, and I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll be able to help make it reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few years, I\u0027ve debated what to record for my first album, and what conceptual directions to take. I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that my project should embrace the things that brought me to where I am: performing covers (I was the lead singer of two cover bands and a karaoke host) and the Sea Monkey community that I get to travel with on each JoCo Cruise (whose immense amount of enthusiastic support gives me confidence to follow my dreams). That\u0027s why I decided to create a \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e campaign to \u003cstrong\u003erecord a collection of Sea Monkey covers with Sea Monkey musicians, where at least one major element of each song is changed\u003c/strong\u003e. A group of Sea Monkeys is willing to contribute their talents and a list of song ideas is growing, but projects like these aren\u0027t cheap and YouTube revenue won\u0027t cut it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, \u003cstrong\u003ehere\u0027s the deal\u003c/strong\u003e: If you think this project has merit and you want to help it succeed, you can \u003cstrong\u003esupport it here on Patreon \u003c/strong\u003e(a crowdfunding site co-created by \u003cstrong\u003eJack Conte\u003c/strong\u003e of \u003cstrong\u003ePomplamoose\u003c/strong\u003e, also a Sea Monkey). You pledge a certain amount per project, and pay when each finished song is released. The created song will be available for all patrons to download, and additional content will be made available as funding goals are reached. My personal goal for this project is to connect with you while exposing you to the amazing people who have enriched my life over the past 5 years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may not be able to afford to contribute, and that\u0027s fine - I\u0027d prefer you keep your money if you need it that much. Being involved in Patreon does not mean a paywall will be involved with my content, and songs will be posted to my YouTube channel without any expectation of payment on your part, so you can listen to them and share with your friends like you normally would. Simply spreading the word is help enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and considering your patronage!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Randy Parcel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfile Pic courtesy \u003cstrong\u003ePerry Zombolas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoCo Cruise Crazy 2 Highlight video courtesy \u003cstrong\u003eJonathan Coulton\u003c/strong\u003e, filmed by \u003cstrong\u003eChristopher Dillon\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eAngela Brett\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/ltegwVIWSu4?t=4m58s\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/ltegwVIWSu4?t=4m58s\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
