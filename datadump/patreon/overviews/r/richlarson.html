Since 2012 I\u2019ve published 100+ stories, the majority of them in SF magazines like \u003cem\u003eAsimov\u2019s, Analog, Clarkesworld, F\u0026amp;SF, Lightspeed\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eTor\u003c/em\u003e. Twenty of those stories have been reprinted in Year\u2019s Best anthologies, and over a dozen have been translated into Chinese, Vietnamese, Polish, Czech, French or Italian.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, I have a lot of stories to tell you. That\u2019s why I originally made this Patreon page: so I could spend less time stocking shelves at a liquor store, and more time writing fiction that moves and surprises and just plain entertains. And because I appreciate the people who support my work, I wanted to come up with a tangible way to thank them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether it\u2019s behind-the-scenes author commentaries, sneak peeks at my latest WIP, or access to unreleased or hard-to-find stories, you\u2019ll have every opportunity to get deeper into what I do\u2014how deep is up to you. If you just want to commit a couple dollars as a \u201cthanks for all the fiction\u201d \u00a0tip and move on, I\u2019m grateful for that as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I hope you\u2019ll stick around, so you can say you knew me when. Writers don\u2019t exist without readers, after all, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to set this trajectory on my own. Let\u2019s keep the stories coming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHell, let\u2019s crank it up a notch.\u003cbr\u003e"
