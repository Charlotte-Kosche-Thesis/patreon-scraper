    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eVideo Game News Radio\u003c/strong\u003e is the oldest weekly gaming radio show. \u00a0It began in 2004 and continues to run today. \u00a0The theme of the show is different than ordinary gaming shows, because it presents a \"working class\" view of the gaming industry. \u00a0The hosts include a Steel Worker and Brick Layer, a Truck Driver, and a currently out-of-work struggling student. \u00a0The show is lead by a computer programmer who is passionate about gaming, he tries to keep the crew on topic while it often steers blindly into other topics, such as which pizza place is better, why Australians should ride kangaroos (If you got \u0027em, use \u0027em!), and many more stupid conversations. \u00a0We have a lively audience that participates via email and Facebook, and they help support and add to the weekly conversation. \u00a0It\u0027s like a big party and you\u0027re part of the conversation. \u00a0Nothing too serious, nothing heavily edited (or edited at all for that matter). \u00a0It\u0027s raw and truthful and often a touch offensive, but not on purpose, just because somebody always says something stupid.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be using the Patreon money to help provide incentive for the hosts to contribute weekly (Real life often gets in the way of doing shows, so by providing some monetary value for the hosts, they are more likely to show up.) as well as a percentage will go towards beefing up the show and services related to it. \u00a0We aren\u0027t asking for much. \u00a0If you want to give the minimum, that\u0027s great. \u00a0I\u0027m not going to lie to you and tell you we plan to build a new revolution in gaming media. \u00a0We\u0027re just going to keep producing the same content we always have, and this will help us to continue doing so. \u00a0Thank you for your time, and if you never listened, you can find the shows in the following ways...\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. \u00a0youtube.com/vgnnetwork \u00a0(Audio and Video are recorded and updated here, as well as live shows are presented every Sunday at 8pm EST)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://vgn.libsyn.com/rss\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://vgn.libsyn.com/rss\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0(The RSS feed of the show for podcast applications and iTunes)\u003cbr\u003eYou can also search for Video Game News Radio or VGN Radio on the iTunes App Store, the Amazon Android Store, or the Windows Phone 8 store to find out companion Podcast app.\u003cbr\u003eYou can talk to us on VideoGameNews.com (Keyword to get in is Garlic Bread)\u003cbr\u003eOr like our Facebook page -\u0026gt;\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Video-Game-News-Radio/193670002480\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Video-Game-News-Radio/193670002480\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note, each pledge is per show. \u00a0To earn a reward you must pledge four times at the tier you pledged at. \u00a0You can change your pledge tier at any time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
