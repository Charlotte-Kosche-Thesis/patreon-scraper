    "summary": "Hi this is Elliott Miller from the Voice of E Website and You Tube Channel. I create some of the most thematic board game reviews ever made, as well as interviews and videos from some of the biggest conventions in the country, including Origins Game Fair, San Diego Comic Con, and Gen Con.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing board games for a lot of years, and have a flair for the dramatic, and the silly. So I began creating board game review videos unlike any others out there in the wide world of reviewers. I use costumes, skits, and cheap special effects to try to entertain people while I provide them with the best information I can about the games that I enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, I have paid for everything out of my own\npocket. I do not make any money creating these videos. Sure, I get review\ncopies of the games, but each review typically costs a lot more than the actual\ngame does. I pay for costumes, equipment, software, and any training that I can\nafford, but affording everything is tough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to be able to take my work to the next level. I\nwant to be able to provide everyone with the best and most entertaining videos\nthat I possibly can, and for that I need your help. I need better equipment, software, more costumes so that I can include other characters in my videos. There is much more that I can do, but I simply cant afford to do it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot everyone likes my videos, and think that they are too silly for the board game review world, but there are a lot of you who appreciate the effort and fun I put into my videos, and I\u0027m hoping that some of you would be willing to support me in making even better content in the future.\u00a0 If you like what I do, please consider becoming a Patron. With your help, we can do this together.\u003cbr\u003e"
