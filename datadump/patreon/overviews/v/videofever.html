Unfortunately, their captors aren\u2019t necessarily the smartest aliens in the galaxy and proving their case may be harder than expected.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe show is just as much about puppets and sci-fi as it is about video games. All the aliens we meet are portrayed by puppets and we hope to meet as many of them as we can. All our puppets are made in-house and we strive to build them to professional quality standards.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs a sci-fi show and a gaming show, Video Fever is intended to be fun and positive.
