    "summary": "Hey folks, I\u0027m VHS GIRL, a nerd in her early 30s who was apparently born inside a Blockbuster. Since I was old enough to put a tape in a VCR, I\u0027ve been obsessed with TV and movies. Sure, there\u0027s other analog formats, but Beta Girl just doesn\u0027t command that kind of power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, subscribing to me (even for a $1) helps me from grinding the wheel so hard doing social media to make those sales, and more time to do what I really want to do, paint a VHS tape on wood and add the taglines that should have been on the box in the first place. I like to speak to myself from the 90s, perusing the local video store, trying to figure out what to rent. So far, I think other people are into it too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goals are 1. healthcare (I haven\u0027t been to a dentist in years!) 2. merch --- the more merch I have, the more likely I will be able to turn a profit at festivals, booths, art shows, you name it 3. Gettin\u0027 that sweet sweet Macbook Pro, so I can finally find/catalog/mix footage I find from rare VHS and show you that I\u0027m more than just a dorky painting cinephile... this last goal is asking a lot, but there are 45 million people in the US who make over $100 k a year, so hey, you can\u0027t blame me for tryin!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/vhsgirl\"\u003ehttp://www.instagram.com/vhsgirl\u003c/a\u003e for completed works and become my patron to see behind the scenes stuff I don\u0027t post anywhere else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2016 Miami Basel\u003cbr\u003e2017 LA art fair\u003cbr\u003erepping 24/7 at Red Truck Gallery in New Orleans\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
