I\u2019ve worked on assignment for several publications, mainly Abort Magazine out of Vancouver.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt excites me to know that I may get the next iconic shot of your favourite artist for the world to see, and I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at doing it. However, I\u2019ve had to face the increasing difficulty in finding compensation as a photojournalist in this day and age. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I\u2019ve decided to carve my own path by turning to the crowdfunding model; something that works the way I do. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours every year photographing and editing live music in addition to working a full time job (with overtime), just to support my passion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to have more time to shoot as many shows as possible in the coming years. With your support, Patreon is how I can make this happen. Let\u2019s make something magical. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e- Derek"
