In love with love. Quirky and extremely animated, shy yet confident. Some may even call me saucy.\u00a0To sum me up is a task deemed impossible. A disproportionate ball full of sass, romantic tendencies, sarcasm, intelligence, and a hint of stubbornness.\u00a0I\u0027m a Leo with a Virgo moon... If that means anything to you, I love you. I thrive when Mercury is in retrograde and spend WAY too much time in my own head. I take a ton of selfies and on occasion get to stand around naked while people draw or photograph me (if you\u0027re interested, email me). I\u0027m hoping that your support will allow me to do more of that. For the past 10 years,I\u0027ve had the pleasure of working closely with the homeless in California and i absolutely love it. People fascinate me. Lost people, places and things make my heart happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is a place for photos and videos of me... and possibly other things, not seen on my tumblr or Instagram. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you don\u0027t pledge, thank you for reading this far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
