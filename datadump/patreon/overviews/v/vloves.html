    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0Hello \u0026amp; Welcome to CLUB V here on Patreon! My name is V and\u00a0I upload genuine commentaries (reaction videos) on my channel. I have eclectic taste and I love seeing what new videos you want to show me and the rest of our community. Requested videos from Patrons are my first priority. Please check out the perks/rewards located on the right side of this page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0WE\u00a0sing, dance, giggle and I share with you what I feel about each video.\u00a0WE have a great time\u00a0together, and it feels like we\u0027re all friends here. Our channel is now a year old as of 4/7/18!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Being a reactor is a hobby I am passionate about. Here\u0027s something I wrote in my \"community tab\". We celebrated our 1 year Club V youtube-versary and I wrote this:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0As a child, I\u0027d walk around with a tape recorder in hand. I\u0027d interview my loved ones. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0In my teen years, I\u0027d record pretend music/talking shows on my tape player (of course I had to attempt to do different voices for each of the guests on my \"show\". Come on, you know i\u0027m creative like that)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0In my 20\u0027s I tried a hand in podcasting for an internet radio station and I created 81 music shows for fun (3 hours long each: music \u0026amp; talking) which went live weekly. That experience taught me A LOT!! My husband supported me with editing, finding my voice, encouragement, graphic designs. My mother pushed me and gave me that confidence. She had a huge influence on me (music-wise). She knew I was made for this. Not to mention, that recording device has been glued to my hand for years! (Dejavu Much?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0A decade later..here I am doing what makes me happy (again).  I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be where I am today in life. I absolutely love what I am doing. I hope you can tell. I\u0027m not just sitting in front of a screen recording myself \"watching\" a video. If you\u0027ve seen my videos, you\u0027ll know there\u0027s more to me than that. I am so lucky and grateful for this platform.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I believe in this inspirational quote whole-heartedly. \"Do what you love, Love what you do\". I take my hobby \u0026amp; passion seriously and I consider\u00a0it\u00a0my \"why\". It comes naturally to me as I\u0027ve been doing this type of thing for years (i\u0027m in my 30\u0027s, I know I look 12!) I have made so many wonderful friends, and i\u0027m learning so much about all the beauty this world has to offer. I am also evolving and learning as I go. Who am I doing that with? With YOU! The bottom line is this: My mission\u00a0is to put a smile on your face, keep the fun train going, and share with you half the things we never knew existed. Thanks to loyal subscribers \u0026amp; patrons who request the coolest random videos. :) YOU find these gems, and I get to share them with the rest of Club V. You\u0027re in good company and when it doesn\u0027t become fun for you, PLEASE let me know so we can fix that! I thank you for being here and for welcoming me into your life. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE NOTE: If you like what you see on my channel, and you\u0027re unable to pledge, please don\u0027t feel obligated. Either way, I will continue to record reactions. Your view and share goes a long way and I appreciate that more than you know!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love \u0026amp; a BIG\u00a0smile,\u003cbr\u003eV\u003cbr\u003e"
