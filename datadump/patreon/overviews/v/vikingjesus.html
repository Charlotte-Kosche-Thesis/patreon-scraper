Welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince my music career took off like a rocket thanks to Tommy Tallarico and Video Games Live, the biggest problem I\u0027ve faced with regularly putting out content is finding the time to keep up with myself. For years, my music has had to be put to the side in order for regular life duties to take focus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest goal with Patreon is to be able to focus on music full-time, and being able to produce music more frequently as it becomes my focus. Everything after that is gravy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePassing that initial goal opens up the doors for a lot of other cool stuff to take place. Things like music videos, professional mixing services, full albums, merch, tours, anything we can dream of will be possible. I\u0027ve made some valuable connections over the last few years, and I\u0027ve put together a team that will bring the very best in what they do to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support from my patrons will go directly towards sustaining my music career and allowing me to create the same badass heavy metal you\u0027ve come to expect of me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be clear: Not everything I create and post here will be music from video games. The occasional original song or cover from another medium will be thrown in as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve said since the day I was christened my stage name that I couldn\u0027t do any of this without the incredible support from the community, and I know we\u0027ll be able to continue that here and create amazing things together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALL HAIL!\u003c/strong\u003e"
