    "summary": "Hey what\u0027s up guys? Together let\u0027s learn about radar detectors, laser jammers, dashcams, and all sorts of tools to help us have a better driving experience. I\u0027m creating videos that are focused on teaching you all about the very best radar detectors and laser jammers on the market, how to use them and set them up properly, and sharing comprehensive test results to see how they compare in an objective, fair, and unbiased way. It\u0027s all stuff that I both personally want to learn myself and want to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to do this for a living now full time, creating some of the best and most interesting new countermeasure videos possible. I\u0027ve got a massive list of video ideas. Many of the videos are reviews, recommendations, and tutorials, and even more are things beyond \"here\u0027s stuff you should buy so I can make money when you do.\" It also includes fun stuff like showing you how police radar and laser guns work from the police officer\u0027s perspective, comparing different radar and laser guns, testing out the latest radar detector detectors, doing more in depth head-to-head radar detector comparisons, and so on. All sort of fun things. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to be a salesperson whose main goal is to sell you stuff so that I can make a living. As an engineer and tester, I\u0027m more interested in learning cool new things and gaining a better understanding of how stuff works for myself and for the entire community. It takes a massive amount of time to do all the research, test, create and edit videos, dissect patents, discuss ideas with others in the community, talk with different manufacturers, beta test new products, and so on. I\u0027m doing this full time now and I\u0027ve found that since I\u0027m not willing to do paid reviews for manufacturers since I want to remain unbiased and objective, my other alternatives are things like YouTube ads, private sessions, and Amazon affiliate links. Basically things that keep me open to all products so that I don\u0027t have a financial incentive to recommend one product or brand over another. I\u0027ve found that this takes more than that and I genuinely feel you deserve the very best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo since I want to focus on creating educational videos to bring more knowledge and understanding to the community, I\u0027m asking for your help to assist me in growing forward. I want to help us all understand more about the big picture and staying protected. If you\u0027d like to grow and learn more too, you can now help me by becoming a Patreon supporter. The more we work together collectively and the more of us do so, the better this works for all of us, both financially and otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs some bonuses and perks for you, there will be more giveaways throughout the year that only my Patreon supporters will be eligible for, exclusive behind the scenes sneak peeks of videos and upcoming testing, discounted and even free private sessions to help you stay protected, and all sorts of different goodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big big thank you to everyone who help support me in doing what I do. It\u0027s literally because of you that I\u0027m able to continue doing what I do. This is a combined group effort and I thank you so much for your support. :)"
