My novel \u003cem\u003ePseudotooth\u003c/em\u003e was published by Unsung Stories in March 2017. I\u0027ve since appeared on panels at MCM ComicCon (I\u0027m just as surprised as you are), Nine Worlds, and have events planned for the next\nsix months. Things are beginning to take off, and I want to hit the ground\nrunning with more stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to finish my next novel. There\u0027s two of them, actually.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0One is sitting there, waiting to be finished. It\u0027s about a Victorian cross-dressing horror-themed nightclub. The other, set in an Edwardian water-cure resort, is begging to be started. I\u2019m putting together a book of short\nstories. There\u2019s also another poetry chapbook that\u2019s been wanting attention for\na long time.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I wrote \u003cem\u003eBeauty Secrets of The Martyrs\u003c/em\u003e, I treated it like a day job, and it\nwas just wonderful. I had my little room at the back of the house to go to, and\nI\u2019d be there from nine until five every day. Getting that much work done was a\nluxury, but circumstances change, and lately I\u2019ve not had the material means to work as hard on stories as I\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nI have Marfan Syndrome\u003c/strong\u003e, the connective tissue disorder that killed Rent\u2019s Jonathan\nLarson. It\u2019s an incurable illness that means I get a lot more tired than\nregular people, injure easily, heal slowly, and need medication and medical\nsupervision to keep me safe and functioning. There are sudden events to worry\nabout, like lungs collapsing and retinas detaching. It\u2019s painful and expensive. When I\u0027m trying to meet my material and health needs, something often has to give, and, miserably, it\u0027s usually the writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nYour support\u003c/strong\u003e equals more time and energy for me to finish stories and to play\nwith new ideas. Maybe even to work a bit less and focus on what I love a bit\nmore. Even $1 a month helps me to pay my Internet bill, buy that rare book I need for research, pay the fare to get to a convention or scout out a location. And it means I know people are listening, which is the most important thing of all for any author.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you don\u0027t already know me and my work, here\u0027s a window into my world...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://verityholloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bsotmpage.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://verityholloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-17.22.51.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://verityholloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-28-at-17.09.52.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://verityholloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-28-at-17.10.07.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, friends.
