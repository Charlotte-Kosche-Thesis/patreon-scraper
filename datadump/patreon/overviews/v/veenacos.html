I started cosplaying a few years ago and decided I wanted to invest all of my time and effort into it, and see where it takes me! I also aspire to be a makeup artist one day after I can no longer cosplay or model. I attend conventions throughout the USA and wear costumes I\u0027ve made. I also enjoy competing! I\u0027m also a huge Kpop fan and enjoy doing Kpop inspired photoshoots, dance covers, and makeup tutorials. I also attend Kcon NY!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does pledging work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge, you can choose exactly how much! Even if a Tier is, for example, $10, you can throw in an extra $1 and receive the same rewards.\u003cbr\u003eYou are charged as soon as you pledge, and you receive access to every post ever made that can be viewed by your tier. Charging upfront keeps people from viewing everything and then leaving before they get charged. After that, you are charged around the 1st of every month for as long as you pledge! You can cancel anytime. If you don\u0027t wish to be charged for that month, please cancel before the previous month is over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will I receive rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post SFW photosets as they happen, and NSFW photosets between the 20th and the 25th of each month. I do one NSFW photoset per month, at least one cosplay photoset per month, and sometimes I do out of cosplay/fashion photosets!\u003cbr\u003eI mail out physical rewards and post fansigns and wallpapers also between the 20th and 25th.\u003cbr\u003eAll photos are given via drop box links!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you put out tutorials and WIP photos?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t always have time to make a large build each month, so that content is released on no schedule. I try to put out little crafting collages, write ups, and videos here and there even if it\u0027s nothing huge!

I currently am living with my grandparents (don\u0027t worry they want me to stay lol), but I aim to have my own apartment and live independently. With this goal, it is assured that I can continue doing what I love and what you all enjoy, and live with the guarantee that I can support myself and my crazy cat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor this to be applicaple, I will need to make sure I can sustain this income for at least 3 months to make sure nothing changes!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a HUGE thanks, I will do a video apartment tour, host a giveaway with all sorts of goodies, and host a poll to attend a convention of YOUR choice!
