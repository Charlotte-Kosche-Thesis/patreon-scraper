    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m \u003cb\u003ePaul\u003c/b\u003e \u003cb\u003eVorvick\u003c/b\u003e, and I make \u003cb\u003esatire games\u003c/b\u003e.\u003cp\u003eGames aren\u0027t just usable for entertainment. They can provoke thought, start discussions, and make changes in the world. But this can only happen if the games come with their own messages and meaningful design. My goal is to make games that include precisely those elements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSo what\u0027s a satire game?\u003c/b\u003e It\u0027s a game that points out some issue in our world and asks us to examine it. But it\u0027s more than that as well. It\u0027s a game that implies its message rather than stating it. It\u0027s a game that leads its players along a \u003cb\u003epath of discovery\u003c/b\u003e, where they can learn about what is wrong in the world and think of how to fix it. It\u0027s a game which has\u003cb\u003e a hidden, deeper meaning\u003c/b\u003e, behind whatever it is you play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSatire games assume that their audience wants to \u003cb\u003ecritically examine the issues\u003c/b\u003e in the world, and provides a stepping stone on that path. Playing a satire game allows a group to get together and discuss exactly what it is that we want. It gives a lens through which to view a problem, and\u003cb\u003e leaves the question open\u003c/b\u003e about how to solve it. Satire games have similarities with social good games, but from the opposite angle. Most social good games tell you the problem and answer at the same time. Satire games raise the issue and then \u003cb\u003eask the audience to discuss\u003c/b\u003e with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCreating games is difficult.\u003c/b\u003e A lot of resources go into making something accessible and meaningful. Your support will help with costs in art, music, coding, and other expenses that are necessary to create the games. In addition, your support will give me personally the freedom to pursue more game design, and some\u003cb\u003e strong feedback \u003c/b\u003eabout the topics of games I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m planning to distribute my games through \u003cb\u003eCreative Commons licensing\u003c/b\u003e so that I don\u0027t have to restrict access to them. I want everyone to play, so that everyone can start sharing in the experience. Getting support from my patrons allows me to distribute games freely, while being able to support myself at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027d like to check out my existing games, you can do so here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.vorvick.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.vorvick.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for reading, and thank you for your support!\u003c/p\u003e\n"
