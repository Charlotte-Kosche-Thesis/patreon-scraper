    "summary": "There\u0027s an itch to scratch that has left players, developers, and designers with a bit more wanting now that one of their favorite games ages without updates. Armed with a slew of tech at our fingertips and a full decade of custom content, NWN2\u0027s limitations are showing but it doesn\u0027t have to stop there. In the past six years I\u0027ve developed specific plugins for toolset enthusiasts, external tools for PWs, and players, now I\u0027m on a mission to author a newer toolset and nwn2server process that extends well beyond what we traditionally have while presenting user friendly scopes for existing and new module developers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWork has already begun under one of the largest Persistent Worlds still operating today, which will serve as an in production example of what is being achieved, presenting continuous integration and deployment, built in integrations into revision control systems (SVN and Git), and a forthcoming multi user IDE for same-time collaboration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExtension of the 32bit nwn2server process into 64bit has compiled and tested successfully to operate, though NWNX4 core adjustments will need to be released in order to resume former core NWNX4 functionality. The GUI has been removed to satiate headless IL needs under Mono, enabling hosting support on all x86 targets Mono supports (Unix, Windows, Linux) with forthcoming support for armv7+ targets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew client upgrades include \"cooldown\" timer notification on spells and feats, an update to the ADL, and an in-progress minimap click-to-navigate action, and built in Discord integration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuggestions for features are always welcome, though the work is more demanding than a hobbyist fitting in a few hours during the week. I\u0027m not asking for much, but if the community can support $16/mo pledges per individual, I would only need 160 pledges in order for faster progress and development as not just a hobby but also as my full time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- V\u003cbr\u003e"
