    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://visualvox.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/human-silhouette-on-beach-with-sunsest.jpg\"\u003eI\u0027m a 50+-year old Autistic woman who lives \u003cstrong\u003eextremely well\u003c/strong\u003e on the Autism Spectrum. I own a beautiful house in a beautiful town, I\u0027ve got two reliable cars in the garage, and I\u0027m a valued subject matter expert in my day job. I\u0027ve been healthily married for over 25 years, and my marriage just keeps getting stronger. I\u0027ve overcome homelessness, crushing debt, debilitating chronic pain, agoraphobia, as well as a host of other setbacks. I\u0027m loved by many, and I love them back. And I have my own home office / study lined with hundreds of books that I\u0027ve chosen (and paid for) myself. I have the life of my former self\u0027s dreams, and it didn\u0027t happen by accident.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wasn\u0027t magically blessed by some benevolent force on high. I wasn\u0027t born into money. I\u0027m not politically or socially or financially \u003cem\u003econnected.\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027m Autistic. And that\u0027s made my life what it is. If I weren\u0027t Autistic, I don\u0027t see how I could have \u003cem\u003eanything \u003c/em\u003ethat I have today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAutism is generally considered a disabling condition, and it certainly can be. But that\u0027s not the end of the story, for Autism can be a \u003cem\u003ehuge \u003c/em\u003eadvantage in life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur senses are sharpened. We\u0027re extremely empathic. We tend to be more level-headed and logical than non-autistic people (and hence make much better choices about important things). We\u0027re funny. We\u0027re focused. We\u0027re able to sustain our attention on a single subject far longer than most non-autistic people can even imagine doing. Why let all that go to waste, because the world is a rough place for us to live?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy indeed?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing in the past has focused on raising awareness about women on the Autism Spectrum, but I\u0027m now widening my reach to help Autistic folks who \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003ewant to live life to the fullest, and are willing to put in the work to make the most of their talents and abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Autism comes with its distinct challenges, it also imbues us with incredible abilities, which we can most definitely use to build the life we long to live. Our talents often go buried beneath the detritus that builds up from living in the non-autistic / neurotypical world. I\u0027ve learned, from 50+ years of experience, how to work with my system. I\u0027ve studied how the human system works, and I\u0027ve found specific knowledge that has literally changed my life for the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to pass that along and teach others how to work with their Autism, not have it constantly work against them. Yes, the world often \"does a number on us\". That\u0027s not in dispute. What I\u0027m offering here is a way to get on with life, regardless of that, and strengthen and hone the innate capabilities we have that let us not only survive, but \u003cstrong\u003ethrive\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
