Vanguard! The goal of VCAcademy is to serve as a platform to help newer players get into the game by providing high quality tutorials, product reviews and more! But If you are an experienced player don\u0027t fret! There will also be a lot of improvement style videos since there is always something we can get better at. (I\u0027m no exception, haha) Thank you for taking some of your precious time to check out my patreon and supporting my new channel and adventure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor you to become a Vanguarderbilt patron it would mean the world to me. As a Vanguarderbilt patron you would not only be helping me create content and put all my ideas into action but you are also supporting incoming players and those looking to level up their game. All of the videos on this channel take up a lot of time, whether it is researching, recording or editing. By becoming a patron you will be helping me create this content as well as providing me with the resources to try out new videos and video series. By being a patron you will gain access to a few extra tools to provide an extra dimension of interaction between us. (See reward tiers) I hope that you will decide to support the channel by becoming a patron, and if not thank you for taking time to check this out!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
