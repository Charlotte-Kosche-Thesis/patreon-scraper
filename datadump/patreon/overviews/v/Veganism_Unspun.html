This time is primarily devoted to research, though it also involves scripting, filming and editing. So if you wish to show your appreciation for the time I invest in activism, I\u0027d be forever grateful. My ultimate goal is to do this full-time, and if there ever comes a time when I have enough support on Patreon to quit my job and do so, I\u0027d jump at the chance - so if you want to get me one step closer to that goal, donate today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I can\u2019t\nafford to donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDon\u2019t sweat it, there are other ways you can help too. Sharing\nvideos really helps spread the message, or you can devote your \u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e to helping the channel: I was\nrecently contacted by one activist who has offered to translate some of my\nvideos into Dutch so they can reach a wider audience. This will of course take\na significant amount of time and effort and is greatly appreciated, so if you\nare fluent in English and another language and would prefer to help out this\nway, that\u2019s awesome too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you to all my viewers and Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s deeply moving to realise how many people care as much as I do about these issues. I will continue to strive to hold\npowerful interest groups to account, expose their lies and contribute to their\ndemise. In this way, I\naim to show non-Vegans important, appalling truths, but I also want weaponise\nsuch knowledge, so that it can be wielded by passionate Vegans such as yourselves, and thanks to your support, these goals are already becoming a reality.\u003cbr\u003e"
