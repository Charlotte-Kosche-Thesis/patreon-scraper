    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0That\u0027s usually the first thing people want to know. The answer\u0027s easy: I\u0027m a Science-Fiction and Fantasy author! The name\u0027s Max Florschutz, and I\u0027ve been writing and publishing Sci-Fi and Fantasy works for several years now. You might be here because you\u0027ve heard of\u2014or better yet, read\u2014one of my books. Like \u003cem\u003eUnusual Events.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Or \u003cem\u003eColony\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then again, you might also be here because you\u0027ve stumbled upon, or been a follower of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://maxviking.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e, and its weekly series \u003cem\u003eBeing a Better Writer\u003c/em\u003e, which has been running for over five years now dishing out weekly articles on all sorts of elements of writing, from character development to genres to pacing. These articles come out (usually) every Monday, and they\u0027ve long been a draw on my site, shared and used by many, and one of the core reasons to fund me on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr maybe you\u0027ve just stumbled across this page in some other way, either through Google, an outsider, or even Facebook. Who knows? But you\u0027re here one way or another, and now you\u0027re reading up on things. So that\u0027s the answer: I\u0027m a Sci-Fi/Fantasy author working every day to bring more awesome stories into our world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Have I Written? \u003c/strong\u003eScience-Fiction and Fantasy. My \"short\" story collection (it\u0027s in quotes because many of those stories were not short at all) had a few stories set in the real world, but for the most part, I stick to the more fantastical genres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn any case, if you\u0027re looking for titles, I\u0027ve got a number you can go take a look at.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eOne Drink \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eDead Silver\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0are both Urban Fantasy Mysteries set in the Unusual Universe, a world that\u0027s much like our own ... but just slightly different in the way that a lot of what goes bump in the night it very real, and known to the world at large. \u003cem\u003eOne Drink\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0stars an NSAU \"spook\" whose job is dealing with Unusual crimes taking a case to figure out why a ghostly wolf would attack a man in his home, while \u003cem\u003eDead Silver,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0the sequel, stars a shaman trying to track down a chupacabra plaguing a small New Mexican town.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re more in the mood for a little bit of everything, then \u003cem\u003eUnusual Events: A \"Short\" Story Collection\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0might be more your speed. Containing ten \"shorts\" (again, only one really is short enough to be a short story, the rest are novelettes and novellas) from various universes and genres, \u003cem\u003eUnusual Events\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is a bit like a sampler platter from a restaurant. You\u0027ve got mystery, fantasy, Sci-fi, superheroes ... even a little bit of thriller and suspense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy most successful work thus far, however, is \u003cem\u003eColony\u003c/em\u003e, a Sci-Fi epic of\u2014I kid you not\u2014\u003cem\u003e1,764 pages.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Yeah ... I do Epics. So, Epic Sci-Fi following three strangers who find themselves working with one another on an alien planet to track down a retired computer programmer who may have pulled off a massive case of industrial espionage. Things get complicated fast, as they usually do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://maxviking.wordpress.com/my-books/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBy the way, here\u0027s a link to my site, where you can get a more in-depth look at each of these, and even purchase them.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, that\u0027s not all. I\u0027ve written some smaller stuff on my site, and have even written fanfiction (Wanna know a secret? A lot of authors have!). But the big one that pulls people in, and what this Patreon is mainly to support, is \u003cem\u003eBeing a Better Writer.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, What\u0027s \u003cem\u003eBeing a Better Writer\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Simply put, \u003cem\u003eBaBW \u003c/em\u003eis a weekly writing help. Initially it was a \"time-to-time\" thing I did in response to fans of mine asking questions about writing topics, putting my education to good use by passing on what I\u0027d learned to newer, younger authors. One of my fans would ask something like \"How did you make these characters seem so real?\" or \"How do you write good fights?\" and I\u0027d think about it for a time and then do a little write-up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese got very popular. Which meant I was getting more questions, and in turn, doing more write-ups. Which in turn got more attention ... and so eventually I had to find a balance. Thus \u003cem\u003eBeing a Better Writer\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0was born, a weekly (barring a few holidays) article feature on my site talking about\u2014what else?\u2014how to be a better writer. I cover it all, everything from writing romance to escalating the tension in your story and even avoiding melodrama. All of these posts are put up for free on my website for all to read, free of charge ... And in turn, they\u0027ve been mentioned and used everywhere from book reviews to college course syllabi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Patreon \u003c/strong\u003elargely exists to help fund the creation of those articles, as a sort of \"Thank you\" or \"Please make more of these.\" Each one takes me a good amount of time and effort as well as a lot of personal experience, but I put them up for free anyway, because there are a lot of young writers out there who won\u0027t learn this stuff in school, yet still want to become better at their craft, and want guidance. I\u0027ll pass on what I can. To those who want to offer monetary thanks, I used to just say \"Buy my books, and we\u0027ll call it good.\" Now, though, there\u0027s another option: this Patreon! Whether you\u0027re a first time supporter or a long time fan, this Patreon is open to you as a way to say \"Hey, thanks! I appreciate what you do, and want to help you stay on your feet so you can keep producing content.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all it is. There\u0027s no locking. I\u0027m not going to \"hold off\" book or article releases until I hit a donation limit (that practice is, quite frankly, sleazy). I\u0027ll keep working hard at things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat donating \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0do is reduce my reliance on my part-time job. Authors don\u0027t make a lot. Most of us have at least one other job we take to make ends meet. The more we earn, however, the less time we need to spend at said job, and the more time we can spend doing what\u0027s important to us: writing more stuff for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on Patreon helps reduce that reliance, and give me more time to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Good question, but I have an answer. Aside from a feeling of goodwill, you will also get a once-a-month bonus feature\u2014usually an early look, or behind-the-scenes peek at work on my latest project. Sometimes it includes special articles or pieces, such as retrospectives, long before they go up on my site. It\u0027s only once a month, because, you know, time, and I\u0027m not trying to create some sort of subscription service for my content, but rather support content that everyone gets to see, but it is a bonus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my page, and if you haven\u0027t yet,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://maxviking.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echeck out my site!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
