    "summary": "For over five years, I\u0027ve been entertaining and enlightening people like you with my series Vaulting. The show that looks at the underrated side of nostalgia, examines it and gives you the facts on what you didn\u0027t know about like unknown behind the scenes facts and more. This series has gone through a lot and at this time, I would like to continue what I love to do. This started as a small hobby and I didn\u0027t think it would take off this well.This show has a loyal fan base that I respect\u00a0but now its time to ask for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver time, there have been moments when I needed props, books/film magazines for research, title card art\u00a0and other items. This show has no budget and in order to get these needed materials, I had to pay this out of my own pocket. Now, I\u0027m not going to guilt trip or shake out a tin can pleading for cash. But all I ask is this. A simple request to pledge for the show. I love what I do and I love the folks who appreciate what I\u0027ve done. Telling about that one rare animated movie from the 1980s with Lorenzo Music to even the moments on television that will make one wonder how they got pass the censor. I enjoy talking about it. I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut with your help, the show can go on. I believe I have a good enough size of viewers and fans to take this to the next level. With your support and help, the show can continue and maybe just a little more. On the side, there have been some personal projects I\u0027ve been meaning to get off the ground. If you like the style and tone of the series, chances are you will love what I have in store for the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here is the big question, what will I get in return? Well, depending on each level of rewards, an assortment of things. Instant requests, video game reviews, preview episodes a day before the release date, special vlogs for Patreon account members including behind the scenes stuff and recent movie reviews, access to bloopers/deleted scenes and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the choice is up to you. Because with your help, Vaulting could get bigger and better than you can ever imagine. Until then, see you on the next upload and thank you for your help.\u003cbr\u003e"
