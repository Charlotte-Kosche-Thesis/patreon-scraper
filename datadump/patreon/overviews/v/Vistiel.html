    "summary": "Hey guys, my name is Jordan! I\u0027m a Wildland Helicopter Firefighter from California and finally exploring writing in my off time. Currently, I\u0027m writing the story \"A Gentlemen\u0027s Curse\". The only \u0027donation rewards\u0027 I\u0027ll have will be access to chapters before they go up on RR. My story is just getting off the ground but I\u0027ll do my best to not slow down releases! Keep in mind though that my summer job will impact my writing time. Any single time donations or committed monthly donations will go towards helping me write without having to worry about money. Thank you for reading(this extremely long \u0027about\u0027) and I hope you enjoy the voices in my head!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals for this feel unrealistic right now, but I would love to become a full-time writer and be able to quit my job. I\u0027ve found this is an extremely enjoyable way to spend my time and any of you that help me toward actually becoming a professional writer are greatly appreciated! I\u0027m still working on deciding on specific rewards for the tiers but that can come later. All I know is that in some way shape or form they will be name based, whether its a character I kill off or one that stays for a few chapters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eName choices for rewards may be refused based on viability in the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent number of banked chapters for Patrons only: 5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
