    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"After traversing the savannah in search of lions, elephants and the elusive Popobawa, we return to our camp and gather around the fire. With tea and hot chocolate in hand, we discuss the day\u0027s adventures and make plans for the morning\u0027s safari. As night settles in, a silence takes hold, broken only by insect chirps and the distant cackle of a hyena. From my backpack, I pull out a tattered book, its cover scuffed, its pages stained. It\u0027s the memoirs of paranormal investigator Beatrice Knight. Opening it, I begin to read...\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJambo! I\u0027m Vered. I write \u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(5, 45, 73);\"\u003efun, paranormal fantasies\u003c/strong\u003e set in my hometown of Nairobi, Kenya. My two series -- \"\u003cem style=\"color: rgb(5, 45, 73);\"\u003eSociety for Paranormals\u003c/em\u003e\" and \"\u003cem style=\"color: rgb(5, 45, 73);\"\u003eThe Cozy Tea Shoppe Mysteries\u003c/em\u003e\" -- incorporate history, African mythology and quirky humor. I\u0027m also working on a \u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(5, 45, 73);\"\u003eromantic urban fantasy series\u003c/strong\u003e set in modern Nairobi involving lion shifters, African demons and zany adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I want to bring those books into audio format. But creating audio books is dreadfully expensive. So instead, I\u0027m going to read these books for you right here, chapter by chapter, around the digital campfire. You\u0027ll hear pages turning, branches rustling, birds chirping\u00a0and, if you\u0027re really paying attention, flames flickering in the night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly members of my Safari community will have \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive access\u003c/strong\u003e to these recordings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to clarify: I\u0027m not planning on using these recordings to create professional audio books for publishing (aka Audible / Amazon). Some people like to hear an author\u0027s rendition of her own stories, so here\u0027s mine! I\u0027ll also be including other fun stuff like videos of me doing things, extra facts, answers to your questions etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo pack your bags, gather around the campfire and get ready for an African adventure like no other!"
