I developed the ability to \nrelate to people from all walks of life, be they prime ministers or \nhomeless folk.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy father and mentor encouraged in me;  compassion for humankind,\u003cbr\u003e\na solid sense of social justice and, above all, to never underestimate the intellectual ability of the public!\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter a long hiatus, Bill and Mavis still talking in my head,\u003cbr\u003e\nI can no longer be silent. My vocation includes waking all of us\u003cbr\u003e\nto the political reality of the moment;\u003cbr\u003e\nwith a bit of humour, to make it memorable.\u003cbr\u003e\nWelcome to my world:\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Outcasts",
