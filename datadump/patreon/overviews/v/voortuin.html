    "summary": "Voortuin [for-tuen, meaning frontyard] is a group of people making stuff. We started out as an independent magazine in 2012, releasing a stapled zine once a month. The design of the magazine changed with every issue as we tried to surprise our readers. After a couple of years we started incorporating different media and found out the best way to surprise our audience was to not actually make a magazine every time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where our ideas outgrew paper and ink. We started making audio stories, very short films, websites, powerpoint presentations, gifs and printed curiosities. Our goal is to catch people off guard by showing them something that seems random and shallow, but which actually is.. well.. mostly random and shallow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would like to thank everyone who had paid subscriptions to our magazine and bought it in the bookstores. It\u0027s cool to see how there are people all over the worlds who like some of the stuff we make. Today we will still make zines or books, but not in a periodical manner. We think online media has grown up and is a good space to catch people off guard. Arguably even better than hidden somewhere in a magazine on a shelf in a shop you will never enter."
