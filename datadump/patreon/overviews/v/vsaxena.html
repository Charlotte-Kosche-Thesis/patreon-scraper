    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI initially set this page up after I got laid off from a high-paying conservative commentary gig back in February, in the hopes that my readers and fans would help me out. To those who signed up and contributed, I thank you with all my heart!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe good news is that I\u0027ve since bounced back and now work as a weekday news blogger for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://downtrend.com/author/vsaxena/\"\u003eDowntrend\u003c/a\u003e and weekend news writer for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.bizpacreview.com/author/vivek-saxena\"\u003eBizPacReview\u003c/a\u003e. I also run two Facebook pages: my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/VSaxenaFanPage/\"\u003epersonal fan page\u003c/a\u003e and \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsFeed/\"\u003e Conservative News Feed\u003c/a\u003e,\" which has no relation to ConservativeNewsFeed.com. Someone else runs it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThough I\u0027m now financially stable, I decided to go ahead and leave this page up anyway to allow my readers and fans to continue showing love. But in case\u00a0you\u0027re new here, let me tell you a little bit about myself and what all I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m V, short for Vivek Saxena, and I\u0027m a passionate conservative news writer and commentator. I don\u0027t just write stuff, though. I literally spend at least 65 percent of my day browsing news feeds, reading columns, listening to podcasts and tracking every iota of political/cultural/social news I can. Why? Not only to be aware of everything that\u0027s happening, but also to find stories that either anger or inspire me. And I gotta be honest. A lot of stories do those things to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so passionate about conservative news because I truly believe that unless American returns to the values and traditions that brought us this far as a nation AND as a species, we\u0027re ultimately doomed. I\u0027m talking about\u00a0personal responsibility, hard work, discipline, faith,respect, sincerity, rule of law, sovereignty and a thousand other values, traditions and concepts that I see gradually dying before my very eyes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs someone whose family immigrated to the United States about 30 years ago \u003cem\u003eon merit\u003c/em\u003e, and as someone who has had to overcome a plethora of obstacles (including\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://aspennj.org/what-is-asperger-\n\nsyndrome\"\u003ehigh-functioning autism\u003c/a\u003e) to achieve even a modicum of success, I have very little patience for the endless grievances and victimhood of the contemporary left.\u00a0 I didn\u0027t make it this far in life by crying my eyes out and demanding others pat my ass, folks. So it really ticks me off when I see or hear entitled people trying to use their race, their disability or their whatever to demand this, that and the other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these various beliefs and values are reflected daily in my work. Because the news business is ultimately a business, however, I frequently use what are called \"clickbait\" headlines to lure readers into clicking over and reading my stories. I hate doing that, but unless I keep traffic at a certain level, I don\u0027t get paid. But I try to make sure the actual content of my stories are always intelligent and well-sourced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway. If you\u0027d like to show some love, all you have to do is sign up for an account with Patreon and then choose an amount to contribute every month. Iit\u0027s entirely UP TO YOU how much you\u0027d like to contribute, whether it be $1, $5, $20, $100, etc. It\u0027s also up to you when to end your subscription, if ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my commentary and want to \"subscribe,\" please do. If not, I understand. Either way, I sincerly appreciate YOU reading and following my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eV Saxena\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Note: I haven\u0027t touched any of the more, nor do I plan to. I intend to leave it at Patreon as a secondary savings account. I already save and invest the vast majority of my money, but it never hurts to have additional savings account handy in case you get laid off.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
