Ok, ok I know it is old fashion, but then again so am I! I tend to take it out on an average about ten or more times a day. I write down everything from grocery lists to doctor\u0027s appointments. Remember the old part, anyway... About two or three times a day I also flip to the back and jot down scenes for my big novel debut. I have found that I am GREAT at scenes and character building. It sounds like it might be a great novel so far right? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, wrong, that is where my writing ability seems to end. That is where YOU come in!

     "about": "My pen name for this fun and exciting endeavor is Ally Cahoots. Which together stands for - Conspiring together secretly to combine and unite resource with (another) for mutual benefit.\u00a0As I stated I can come up with some downright awesome characters, scenes and ideas and that is where my ability seems to stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy real name is L. Bogedin grew up and still live in rural Northeastern Pennsylvania, tucked into a scenic bend of the Susquehanna River. In 1998, we bought a vacant lot in town, built it out, and opened Twigs Caf\u00e9 Restaurant to generate some income and bring new life to the area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwigs is one of Tunkhannock\u0027s centerpieces and certainly is the center of our lives. We gainfully employ around 38 to 40 people, many who have worked at Twigs for years. It has also provided us a way to give back to our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen our son went off to college, we had a chance to adopt three girls from Russia. The girls are now 21, 23, and 24, and our son is married and has a son, who is my pride and joy grandson! We also have a baby girl on the way, and I simply can not wait!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I have seen needs in my own life and our town, my answer has been to start businesses to fill them. The main floor of WellSpring House is an upscale used clothing shop called Omm Encore Fashion. Upstairs there is a massage treatment room, and another filled with beautiful home decor items for any home. We have just started an online radio station\u00a0called TwigsCafeRadio.com and this where I post all of my notifications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few years, I have begun writing. My first story was chosen for Brian Weiss\u0027s 2012 book \"Miracles Happen\". When my grandson was born, I wanted him to know how much he was loved from the moment I found out that he was on his way. I wrote a book call \"Warm Fuzzies\" so he would always know and remember my love for him. My hope would be to share this book with at-risk children who need love and connection in their lives. I also wrote a story about my girls published by Story Shelter. I love to write for children, so my next project is to have published a three-book series Terrance A. Dragon. I have just recently put out a book called \"Spiral Blueprint ~ A Moving Meditation.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re in my area of Pennsylvania, are interested in alternative health care, or love giving and serving to make the world a better place, or just want a great meal, let\u2019s connect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
