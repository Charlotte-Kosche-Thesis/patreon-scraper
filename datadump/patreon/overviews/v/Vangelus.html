I\u0027ll also\nbe doing a few more peeks-behind-the-scenes with what I do via the patron feed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing will be \u003cstrong\u003elost\u003c/strong\u003e to the Patreon machine.\u00a0 No video series will be gated off, no big secrets will be kept, and no cocaine will be snorted off anyone\u0027s chest (hired or otherwise).\u00a0 I don\u0027t expect or demand any viewer of my stuff to take part in this Patreon thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the opening\nperiod of this campaign my primary goal involves purchasing new  \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eequipment\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 After doing a major audio upgrade in 2012 (adding a Zoom H4n to my kit) and moving into working with a DSLR camera in 2014 (a Canon 70D), I\u0027ve been less and less satisfied with my desk lamps and convention coverage set-up.\u00a0 I\u0027d like to slowly swap out some of this well-used stuff for newer and better things: better lights, a lavalier mic, more lenses, a proper grip mount...perhaps even a little box to stick onto my handheld mics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd we\u0027ll all see the impacts of this campaign...WHEN?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI dunno, man.\u00a0 Implementing and planning as I go is one of my best and worst habits, so I\u0027ll do my best to keep you informed one way or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027ll be patron perk options, too, which will happen sooner than later!\u00a0 What with the platform already existing, and all that.\u00a0 They\u2019re nothing huge,\nbut hopefully a little bit of fun, and I might add more if feasible ideas come\nup.\u00a0 For the time being, this campaign is more or less a form of \u0027tip jar\u0027 on the counter of my...uh...internet countertop.\u00a0 The empty guitar case in front of my obnoxious street performance.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow flexible is this campaign?\u00a0 Could things change?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor sure!\u00a0 It\u0027s just another internet media adventure.\u00a0 Let\u0027s dive in and see what happens next!\u003cbr\u003e"
