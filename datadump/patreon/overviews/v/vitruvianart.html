Glad you made it to my page! \u003cbr\u003eI have finally gotten on Patreon\u00a0so I can hopefully continue to have the means to do the gorgeous gems, the drawings, and painting, and \u00a0wonderful art that drives my heart!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have been obsessed with all things GEM for just about two years now and it is becoming more and more of the heartbeat of my life. The amazing things I have learned as an artist and a person continue to drive me to know more and from there share what I know with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is huge to me that You have access to everything I have to offer but I don\u0027t want to make this the normal rewards based system. Of course the more I am able to earn, the more I will be able to devote to this passion and the more I will be able to share. Helping other people and teaching are such a big part of who I am that if I ever stopped... I think I might desolve... or something...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e No matter what happens I will always do art. It is a serious driving passion in my life, and something that has guided me through most of the darkest times as well as the beautiful times I have experienced on this earth."
