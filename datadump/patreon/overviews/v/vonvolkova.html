I create images which are sometimes straightforward photographs and sometimes layered artwork or digital collages made using my own photos as the source material.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have used Patreon in the past, and have only just recently turned my account back on, so I\u0027ll be slowly adding goals and other details while I do a soft relaunch, but in the meantime I have new things to share and didn\u0027t want to wait any longer to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my images, and would like to support me for $1 or more per month, that is really wonderfully kind of you.\u00a0I will continue to share my work online for free, so you don\u0027t need to donate in order to see new images I create, but you will often get to see them sooner than everyone else. (Sometimes my images are for projects still in progress, and I cannot always share them online right away.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become my patron, your money will help me keep working on images. At this early stage, that means a budget towards experimental prints and the occasional cup of coffee.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons get access to my patrons-only stream where I\u0027ll talk about my ideas, my inspirations, and my process, as well as upcoming projects I am slowly working away on. If you choose to sponsor at the $5 or $10 level, I will send you a small or medium print once per year. I am very open to suggestions of other things you\u0027d like to see included there. I do sell large prints, and I do accept commissions for custom work, but these are things for which I charge quite a lot more than what seems appropriate for this setting. However, if you prefer to do such a transaction through Patreon, perhaps as multiple installments, I am more than happy to create a custom reward tier just for you. Just contact me with the details and we will work it out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks again for wandering by here.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nXO\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVeronika\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2895/14037644238_e0f8ddd711_b.jpg\" width=\"650\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

Being alone is not inherently lonely, but can instead be peaceful and rejuvenating. The darker spectrum I tend towards comes from an appreciation of the way the light falls when it is scarce.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re curious about my portraiture, you might enjoy \u003ca href=\"http://eightcuts.com/2011/11/09/veronika-von-volkova/\"\u003ethis interview over at eight cuts conducted by the wonderfully thoughtful Dan Holloway\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cRing the bells that still can ring\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eForget your perfect offering\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere is a crack, a crack in everything\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s how the light gets in.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e- Anthem, Leonard Cohen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
