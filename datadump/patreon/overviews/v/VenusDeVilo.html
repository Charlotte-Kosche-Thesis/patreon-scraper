     "about": "The Voice Of Horror and Queen Of The Pumpkin Patch, Venus de Vilo, at your dark and deranged service.\u003cbr\u003eDescribed by \"The Bite\" Gothic-Alternative magazine as \"The love child of Marilyn Manson and Amanda Palmer.\"\u003cbr\u003eReferred to amongst Her fans, \"The Gravediggers\" as \"The Queen Of Weird\" , \"The Irish Emilie Autumn\" and \"Yer Wan From The Grudge!\")\u003cbr\u003eGraduating from the BCFE Rock School in 2011, Venus de Vilo has been nationwide inflicting Her gruesome and exceptionally WEIRD live shows on the unsuspecting and unwilling public at large. \u003cbr\u003ePerforming EVERYWHERE from Rock bars, Metal bars, alternative horror/metal Burlesque and Cabaret nights, open mic nights, miscellaneous venues of note (The Village, The Button Factory etc.) and general gigs of ill-repute.\u003cbr\u003eAs of 2012, Venus has also been known to hold dominion over and host Her very own, every-couple-of-monthly, ghoulishly themed gigs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot just content with frightening the locals, Venus released Her debut 6-track EP \"EDGAR ALLAN HO\" at Halloween 2012. This release attracted international attention from underground radio stations, alternative magazines and assorted like-minded ne\u0027er-do-wells. \u003cbr\u003ePrompted by such sordid infamy, Venus then decided to garner more attention for Herself and released Her second EP \"TILL DEATH DO US PARTY\". (2013)\u003cbr\u003eAural displeasure wasn\u0027t enough for Venus though. 2013 saw Her dazzlingly disturbed venture into the world of the moving picture, via the music video. More like mini-horror movies than music videos \"Crazy For You\" (2013) and \"Fangtasy\" (2014) since their subsequent un-leashings have been proving most unpopular on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFriday the 13th of June 2014 saw Venus launch Her very first, but NOT Her last, 16 page, hand drawn, full colour comic book \"Crazy For You.\" (Yes, an adaptation of Her song and music video of the same name!) Sold at the Dublin Zine Fair, August 2014. Now working on Her second comic book, to be launched this year at Her third annual Halloween shindig, an illustrated re-telling of Edgar Allan Poe\u0027s classic poem \"The Raven.\" These are just few of MANY demented publications the public can expect this year.. More artwork can be found on Her brand new DeviantArt profile:\u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fvenusdevilo.deviantart.com%2F\u0026amp;h=AAQGNjjoX\u0026amp;s=1\"\u003ehttp://venusdevilo.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently working on Her first full length thirteen track magnum opus, \"HANDLE WITH SCARE: More art installation, comic book and highly fictional auto-biography than an actual album!) \u003cbr\u003eMay 2014 saw the first half of Her warped masterpiece infect the internet. \u003cbr\u003eWith song titles like \"I\u0027ve Got 99 Zombies And A Witch Ain\u0027t One.\" ,\"Absinthe Makes The Heart Grow Fonder.\" , \"Paint Me Like One Of Your Dead Girls\" and \"Please Sir, Can I Have Some Gore?\" you just KNOW that \"HANDLE WITH SCARE\" is going to be a musical experience to die for!",
