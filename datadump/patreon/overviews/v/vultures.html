It is about a girl named Lisbeth. She is pulled forward in time by an unknown force, and thrust into the middle of a war between Heaven, and Hell. She, along with a team of misfits are all that stand between humanity and it\u0027s utter demise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic is updated \u003cem\u003eweekly\u003c/em\u003e on Mondays, no more than 4 times a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Chris. I\u0027ve been creating characters, drawing, and writing stories, all my life. I\u0027m a Dad who works a real job by day, and then slays with pen and ink at night. I grew up in a small town south of Buffalo, NY.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally came up with some of the characters, and story idea in High\n School. It sat on the back burner for some time when Unfortunately I \nwent through a period where I didn\u0027t feel I had the necessary skills to \nbe an illustrator, or writer. I would eventually navigate through those \nissues, and find inspiration to finally assemble my ideas and doodles, \nand begin writing it all down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.vulturesblog.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVulturesblog.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n as a way to not only display my comic, but I also hope to use it to \nhelp inspire those who have ideas of their own. I plan to use the \nweb-site to post articles, tutorials, as well as keep an ongoing journal\n of my own personal progress. I was lucky enough to find my inspiration;\n maybe I can pay it forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you asking me for money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an amazing way to support an artist, and although I have a job, and can pay my bills; Every little bit counts. There are costs associated with every endeavor, and I have been lucky enough to be able to work on Vultures, for the last two years or so, without it hindering or destroying my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a comic artist has been my dream since I was a young boy, and it took me a while to realize that. I want to be the best I can be. I want to write and draw amazing stories, and more than anything I want the people reading these stories to be involved. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eVultures\u003c/em\u003e will always be free to read at the web-site.\u003c/strong\u003e However, I hope that this, and the book itself is enough to convince you that it and I are worth investing in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most important thing is that I am not creating this comic for Patreon. This is my project, and has been my project for the last two years. If people like it enough to contribute money to it, I will be very grateful, however if this experiment were to fail, it is not going to stop me from completing it. I started this to prove to myself that I could do it. I started this to show my two kids that they can do anything they set their minds to. I plan to follow through to the bitter end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will want to become part of the adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks very much for checking out my Patreon! I hope you will consider becoming a patron!\u003cbr\u003e- Chris\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
