I dread to think how many hours I\u0027ve sunk into reading books, watching videos and sourcing instructions for a range of skills, and practicing them until they stuck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this journey, I seem to have gained a little bit of a reputation for creating highly detail-oriented costumes that are incredibly accurate to the original source material; and this is the thing I now pride myself most highly on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll happily spend hours upon hours scouring for reference images, testing a range of techniques and materials in order to find the right one, and remaking things in order to attain that last tiny accurate detail. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://valentinecostumes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/closeup.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhilst doing this, I tend to create very detail heavy build logs, guides and patterns for reproducing what I do; and going forwards this is something I will be doing way more actively, which is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGood question. Well, I\u0027m a huge fan of giving back to the community where I can. I like to take the time to create patterns, release 3D printable models, record instructional videos, impart knowledge of processes or mistakes I\u0027ve made along the way, and help anyone that I can to be a better cosplayer. All of this takes up my personal time, and by supporting me as a Patron, it allows me to create more of these things and in turn give more back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will allow me to more quickly invest in the tools and materials that I require in order to create the best content that I can (whether that be improved machines, video equipment or just a leather hide), as well as being able to justify spending a little more of my free time producing this content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy promise is this: \u003cstrong\u003eevery single dollar donated to this Patreon will go straight back into the art.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0No using it to buy a new pair of jeans, or pay for my council tax. I have a decent job and have all of that covered already, so anything that I do get from creating this content will be used to create more of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://valentinecostumes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tyler-and-Marla.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I won\u0027t be tiering my subscribers. Everyone gets the same, whether you donate a dollar or $50. By doing so, you\u0027ll get early access to some of my more polished content (videos, photoshoots, etc) as well as invites to an occasional group hangout where we can discuss anything costume / prop related, and I can offer advice or thoughts on whatever you\u0027re working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support me, that\u0027s awesome, but if not, that\u0027s fine too. You\u0027ll still be able to see all the same content a day or so later on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/andyvalentinecostumes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook Page\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/valentinecostumes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/ValentineCostumes\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e, so feel free to follow any of those accounts if you so wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlternatively, if you\u0027d like to support my work without the commitment of a monthly subscription, you can do so on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/valentinecostumes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKo-fi\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s it from me. If you got this far, thanks for reading, and whether here or elsewhere, I look forward to interacting with you soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://valentinecostumes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Wanderers-X3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay crafty\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndy"
