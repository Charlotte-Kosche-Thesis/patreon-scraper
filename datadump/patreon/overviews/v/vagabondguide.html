This is fortunate for me, since things not going according to plan make the best adventures and the best stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thought I had things set up so that I could write official-type stuff to pay for necessities with some time and money left over, and that extra time and effort could go to building the travel blog I\u0027ve been dreaming of for years. I want to document the wild spaces, mostly here in Arizona, for awhile. Learn about them, then teach about them. There\u0027s so much beauty here, and I really feel that I, and the rest of us, are missing out. Unfortunately, that fell apart at the last possible second and now I\u0027m scrambling for money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027d already gotten everything ready, and I\u0027m tired of waiting. It\u0027s a privilege of our generation that so much of the beauty of the world, and I think it\u0027s a shame we\u0027re missing out on it. So I\u0027m going to make Vagabond.Guide happen no matter what. A friend of mine suggested Patreon, and, well, I\u0027m a bit skeptical of how much help it will be, but I\u0027ll take any help I can get.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan for Vagabond.Guide is to look into living off the land, true backcountry and wildnerness camping, as well adventures more accessible to the average Arizonan or visitor to the state. We\u0027re going to cover hiking, safety, survival, fishing, hunting, gathering, and making use of the natural world around us. I\u0027m by no means an expert, so you\u0027ll get to learn these skills along with me.\u00a0Please note, before sending me money that part of this blog will involve killing, eating, and making things from formerly living things. Not spuriously, but I really do want to look into how we lived in the days before supermarkets and superhighways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I can really promise is that I\u0027ll make the most of it. After all, challenges are what make adventures, and adventure is exactly what I\u0027m looking for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
