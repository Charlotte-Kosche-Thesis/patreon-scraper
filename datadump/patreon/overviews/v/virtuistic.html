    "summary": "Felicitous salutations, and thank you for exploring my this experiment in art and access. My name is Shelby, and I am a queer, disabled, mixed-media artist and crafter living in Minneapolis. I have a proposal for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re familiar with the function of community-supported agriculture shares (CSAs) where folks pay a local farmer for regular deliveries of fresh nosh, I\u0027m offering a similar model as an independent artist, writer, and creator of hand-crafted goods. I like to envision this project as a \"community-supported artisan\" program, with this Patreon\u00a0connecting producers and customers within the creative craft community in a sustainable, directly supportive way. When this idea grows beyond my individual production capacity, I intend to transition this Patreon to support a collective of local artists and makers, thus diversifying the offerings patrons can receive in their share while supporting more independent makers. For more details on how these crafty CSA deliveries work, please check out the FAQ below! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter just a few months, the Cheshire Craft Collective idea has already grown so much thanks to the support of our first patrons: Heather, Sam, and Erin. Their monthly shares keep materials rolling in, and production moving forward. Special thanks also goes to my brother, Loren Vork, for his encouragement, enthusiasm, and the resources he contributed to making the Cheshire Craft Collective\u0027s first appearance at the St. Paul Art Crawl possible. It\u0027s amazing to imagine what will be possible as the list of thank yous grows. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the coming weeks, I\u0027ll be preparing to launch a variety of social media accounts where we can post share-eable updates while I send out exclusive holiday codes to supporters -- so stay tuned for what\u0027s to come! \u003cbr\u003e"

When I reach $1,500 per month, I\u0027ll know that\u0027s possible, and will formalize the Cheshire Craft Collective by bringing in a partner and local artist who will be supported by this Patreon and further diversify the offerings in our craft shares and custom availability.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point, the Cheshire Craft Collective will also expand our options for patrons by adding an unlimited \"Digital Dollar Buck Bite\" that will include .mp3s and videos from performance artists, as well as coupon codes, that will be available to all patrons. We will feature acts with new releases or projects, and offer a flat rate to the artists for the content we share.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",

If we do, we will extend support to two additional part-time artists to continue bringing variety to our shares and supporting sustainable art. We would love to include performing artists who may need to retain hours free for either performances and practice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this milestone, we\u0027ll also launch a Facebook page for The Cheshire Craft Collective, and members of our cooperative group will begin attending artist and craft fairs as we are able. We will also meet as a group and develop future goals for the collective\u0027s expansion if we can cross this threshold.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
