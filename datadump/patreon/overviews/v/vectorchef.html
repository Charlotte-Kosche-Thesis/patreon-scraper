Follow me there @vectorchef\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAloha ! My name is Ronald Munar. I\u0027m a Las Vegas based freelancing graphic designer and illustrator that\u0027s originally from Hawaii. Since 2013, I\u0027ve worked with local and remote clients from the comforts of my own home. My design work in the past include illustrations (vector, digital, and traditional),\u00a0logos, apparel/textile design, flyers, poster prints, and business cards. During my downtime, I\u0027ll tutor graphic design students and first time mac users.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to do a variety of things from humorous work, quick sketches, portraits, watercolor/acrylic paintings, and color pencils. Outside of my creative ventures, I enjoy life like most people (video games, movies, anime, concerts, etc.). For the sake of this Patreon page, I\u0027ll be doing mostly vector work with Adobe Illustrator. Once in a while, I\u0027ll mix it up with Photoshop or other media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe additional samples you see below (believe it or not) were also created in Adobe Illustrator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf3.myportfolio.com/c86446cfd82d5f2938bf01b0186091d4/441a22ff607f52ed262eb6bc_rw_1920.png?h=cd7990c494d66daf40a6485e8fb3f300\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf4.myportfolio.com/c86446cfd82d5f2938bf01b0186091d4/509db8b9f4d5c5cadf0be39b_rw_1200.jpg?h=bdd544498d1674ca6f9c0915a8248540\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \"Vector Art\" ? \u003c/strong\u003eGlad you asked !\u00a0Vector art is a design that can be resized without losing quality. Unlike Photoshop files, they are created with pixels which look \u003cem\u003ehorrible\u003c/em\u003e when scaled above their normal size. Vector art (which is created with Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw) uses bezier curves which forms the shapes. This is what you would use for logos, stickers, apparel design, and large format graphics like car wraps, table banners, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy \"VectorChef\" ? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI take vector illustrations to the next level. I really do ! Right now, food illustration has caught my curiosity. I have also taken the task of busting any myths or crazy stereotypes of vector illustration as \"boring and flat colored\" designs that doesn\u0027t come close to Photoshop. For the record, they both work really well together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you a cook or something ?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI had previous experiences in fast food and spent some time in culinary kitchens. I\u0027ve done everything from dishwashing to prep work. Despite the burns, cuts, bruises, and sanitizer splashing in my eyes, my sanity and all my fingers are still here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon ?\u003c/strong\u003e \"Take the plunge into something new !\" That was my thought. It\u0027s so much better than sitting around wondering how things could be. Life is too short. I have friends that are on here so why not me ? Becoming a Patron will definitely help out a lot ! It will help me create some really cool looking pieces that you will love. In return, every little bit will help with life and materials for my work. If things \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e get going, I can even make some prints, stickers, (and maybe shirts) to send you as well !\u003cbr\u003e"
