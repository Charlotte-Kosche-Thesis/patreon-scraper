In short, we are going to make things, such as videos, music, art, and even t-shirts, hats, underwear, thongs, you name it. It\u0027ll happen. Just you wait, our career will be extraordinary. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Trust me, I\u0027m a diagnosed pathological liar, and my ego may be through the roof, but it\u0027s not nearly as high as my motivation.\"\u003cbr\u003e - Michael.\u003cbr\u003e\"It\u0027s true.\" \u003cbr\u003e- Zayne.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e---------------\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is \"Velvet Eye\"?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Velvet Eye currently consists of me, Michael (Deathlylogic), and my partner in crime, Zayne (prettydukerivers). I have personally been creating things for a good few years now, having started with a few webseries, and eventually branching into ARGs, music, and art. If you happen to be here with knowledge of the Arkn Mythos, I created that, with the help of numerous people! I strongly consider that to be my baby. My little, adorable shared idea baby built from the groundwork by a few friends and I, and from that, I was able to grow as a creator and really show off my talent with webcontent such as -HooH-, and my current big boy,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/soursalt\"\u003eSoursalt\u003c/a\u003e.\" - Michael\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Hi, I\u0027m Zayne, actor, writer, amateur chef, meme machine, water drinker, oxygen breather, and co-creator of Velvet Eye. I have helped Michael with almost every project he\u0027s worked on and I eventually began to help create videos and ideas with him because he loves me and wishes he had the same ideas I had, its really the only reason I\u0027m still around. I\u0027m a music man in my own time with upcoming Bandcamp releases at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://letthemountainsbe.bandcamp.com/\"\u003eLet the Mountains Be\u003c/a\u003e, so check it out or be square.. I make shirts and would love to create merchandise based off any webseries or video or music released from Velvet Eye unless someone wants to do my job for me.\" -Zayne\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e---------------\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is \"Velvet Eye\" ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to create things and get payed for it. That\u0027s essentially it. Sort of.\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking as two people who have greatly inspired others, we believe our creations can helm the awakening of other creators out there and show them what they could be capable of. I create most of my work purely from scratch, (with the exception of -HooH-), and have done so for close to five years now. That was all on my own budget, same for Zayne and his music. We have done all we have right now purely with the shirt on our backs, and a camera, or in his case some musical instruments. We are here now, reaching out for those willing to provide us a greater opportunity when it comes to what we can put out, for just pennies a day! We\u0027re aiming to go to greater lengths to push out the content you all love from us, and then some. Plans include, and are not limited to; a storage unit, an actor budget, filming permits, and of course, vfx and costumes.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not going to BS you, we\u0027re being completely transparent here. If you know us, you know what we are capable of, and if you don\u0027t, well, you will. :)\u003cbr\u003eYou may have seen what we\u0027re capable of, but imagine what we could be capable of with a few extra dollars towards things to better our creations. Like I said, if you know us, you know we are not bullshitting you on this. Your donations will be rewarded greatly, and that brings us to our rewards.\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
