We do this by partnering with local \nclubs and venues throughout the D/FW metroplex, as well as numerous \nsmall businesses, with the simple mission of doing good in the city that\n we love. At the same time, we are a fully-democratic member-driven group\n that gives our membership the voice in the day to day business and \nfuture actions of the organization as a whole. We seek to not only make a\n positive impact locally, but nationally, through our example of \nacceptance, inclusion and diversity.\u003cbr\u003e"
