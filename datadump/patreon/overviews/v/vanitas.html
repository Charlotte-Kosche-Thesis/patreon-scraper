    "summary": "Thank you for visiting the Patreon page for Vanitas Podcast. \u00a0Patreon is a wonderful organization made to support the creations of individuals of one\u0027s choice, much in the way of a custom PBS. \u00a0While the creative side of humanity is what I revere the most, the subject matter of Vanitas is of the obscure, fringe, and even at times destructive components of the human experience. \u00a0If you like to hear uncommon and true stories, then this is the podcast for you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years I have read about, studied, and revolved my travels around the most obscure and unusual stories in our human history, both recent and from long ago. \u00a0The subjects discussed here on Vanitas will be varied from historical figures, medical anomalies, events history wishes to remain hidden, deviant behavior and crime, and all other related ideas on the spectrum of abnormal experience. \u00a0There may be some episodes that will not be for the faint of heart, and I promise to give you fair warning for those. \u00a0All stories will be researched and factually based. I am currently in school pursuing a degree in psychology and neuroscience. This education gives me a scientific and objective perspective to the subject matter, allowing me to put insight into the subjects discussed where applicable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast is released monthly, or more often when time allows. \u00a0Because the subject matter is non-fiction, each podcast requires extensive research, some more than others. \u00a0The support you give here at Patreon enables me to gain access to more hard to find materials. \u00a0It also helps to cover the costs of operations, which include everything needed to make the recordings, the web hosting, and a bunch of other internet stuff that honestly isn\u0027t interesting enough to provide in detail. \u00a0When you choose to support me here on Patreon, you can subscribe at your preferred monthly rate, with each subscription rate begetting its own particular benefits. Becoming a Patron is simple, and you can help support me at levels starting as little as only one dollar a month. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe painting genre of Vanitas was created in the 16th century by the Dutch. \u00a0These somber still-life paintings display an array of images that convey a message that life is fleeting, and our shared end is imminent. \u00a0I do not subscribe to the belief that life is in vain. \u00a0Existence in itself is phenomenal. \u00a0In a poem by Walt Whitman titled \"O Me! O Life!\", he questions the vanity of life, and thus ends with the answer:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\"That you are here - that life exists and identity, \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThat the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me here on Patreon, where you can be an active contributor to the creative steps on which we travel together. \u00a0Thank you so much for your support. \u00a0Every single bit of it is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eOphelia Wolfe"
