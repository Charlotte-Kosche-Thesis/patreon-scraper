Quite frankly, we don\u0027t make enough from AdSense to pay for our trips - let alone rent!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo finance our travels, we often work with brands, travel companies, and tourism boards that are willing to sponsor our trips for some level of integration in our videos. \u00a0This is often a mutually beneficial relationship, but it also restrains us in some ways. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, some of the most fascinating countries in the world are found in the developing world, where government tourism boards lack the funds to underwrite our trips. \u00a0In these cases, if we can\u0027t find another sponsor, we can\u0027t make the trip happen. \u00a0For this reason, much of our content focuses on countries in Western Europe and North America, where tourism organizations have budgets to support our projects. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we\u0027re\u00a0hoping that our Patreon supporters can help us reduce our dependency on sponsors and make content designed first and foremost for our audience. \u00a0We intend to use our Patrons\u0027 support to help finance trips into regions in Africa, Asia and South America, where we want to make the real and raw content that we know you\u0027ll love. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re also planning on using this income to pay designers to help us create a line of merchandise for you guys, as well as cool new features on our website and the latest motion graphics for our videos. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything and everything helps! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarko and Alex\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
