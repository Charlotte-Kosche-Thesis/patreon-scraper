I\u2019m Ella, and when I\u0027m not running around terrorising people while covered in fake blood I like making stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI especially enjoy sharing them with other people, which is one of the main reasons why things like running tabletop RPGs, live action roleplaying games (LARP) and similar appeal to me so much \u2013 I love not knowing quite where something I\u2019ve created is going to go next.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vigormortis.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVigor Mortis\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e started out as a \nLARP run on a university campus in Brighton. However, having to move to \nGermany for work meant I was no longer able to continue the project in \nits original form, and, while I started writing up a tabletop version of\n the game with the intention of running it for my friends some day, I wanted to take the setting I\u2019d poured so many hours into creating and do something with it \n\u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 I had stories I wanted to tell.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019d also always wanted to try my hand at storytelling with more than just words, and, after my first encounter with the incredible work of \n\u003cstrong\u003eJennie Gyllblad\u003c/strong\u003e as part of the Clockwork Watch project, I thought I might have found a potential partner in crime.  A few \nexcessively vowel, tilde and emoticon-strewn emails and a first script draft later and we were away.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/6830f11bde20f70180f86b8955a6d784/tumblr_ncfe0b3eEm1tmkjjoo1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBefore the first chapter of Vigor Mortis was fully illustrated I\u2019d already got five of them planned out in detail, and I\u0027m ploughing through the process of turning these notes into scripts whenever I get the opportunity. As you can likely tell by now, this setting is probably my favourite out of all those I\u2019ve created, and I really want to share it with other people in hopes they\u2019ll enjoy being part of it as much as I do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eVigor Mortis will always be available to read online for free\u003c/strong\u003e, but I\u2019ve come to Patreon for a little help to make sure we can keep releasing pages regularly \u2013 \u003cstrong\u003eat the moment this is every Friday\u003c/strong\u003e. I currently spend a lot of my free time doing extra work in addition to my day job in order to try and drum up the requisite funds for things like hosting, advertising and, perhaps most importantly of all, Jennie\u2019s wonderful art, which has already become as integral a part of the world as my words.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/854255d0f5ac8dbc8a416fc0fe757994/tumblr_np6w09ACfs1tmkjjoo1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHailing from Sweden and currently living in Bath, England, Jennie is a traditional media devotee, taking pencil, ink, gouache and watercolour and using them to illustrate a huge variety of different stories and characters, each a work of art in themselves. With her unique style able to perfectly capture everything from sweeping cityscapes to the sepulchral gloom of a realm not our own, I couldn\u2019t picture the world of Vigor Mortis being portrayed by anyone else.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYour per-page pledges will help ensure a steady stream of Jennie\u2019s gorgeous illustrations to go with my writing\u003c/strong\u003e, plus we\u2019ve also put together a load of milestone goals and pledge rewards that we hope will not only help to further enrich the world of Vigor Mortis but also give you, our patrons, even more to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurious?
