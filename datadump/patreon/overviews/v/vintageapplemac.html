    "summary": "Hello! Thank you for visiting my Patreon page, let me tell you about my project...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a vintage Apple Macintosh enthusiast, although \"obsessive\" might be a better descriptor... I came to the Mac platform very late, first using a MacBook in 2007 when I started my photography degree. I was immediately and wholly converted to the Apple Way Of Doing Computing, being stunned at just how much better Mac OSX was at absolutely everything as compared to Windows XP. I have never looked back, and literally cannot recall the last time I used a Windows box.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing that MacBook in 2007 and falling in love with Mac OS opened the door to me exploring what came before it and I quite quickly thereafter picked up a mint-in-box Apple Performa 630 running OS7.6.1. It was awesome, and really opened my eyes to the richness of the \"classic\" Macintosh operating system, not least of all in how I could see many of the Good Things of OSX actually had their roots planted a decade or more and multiple OS revisions earlier. The fantastic way of computing that I had been converted to clearly had a solid heritage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started buying up old Macs on eBay, at that time people were essentially slinging them out for pennies (this being at least several years before vintage Mac computing became any kind of thing) and I built a collection of dozens of machines, from the humblest consumer models, like the \"pizza box\" LCIII, through to high-end rarities, like the 20th Anniversary Macintosh. After a time, though, I realised that I had dozens of computers that I was never using so I sold almost all of them except for a few key machines that I really liked, and I then set about focussing my hobby on upgrading those as far as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt around the same time, I started to collect Macintosh software and ephemera, building a large collection of big box classic Mac OS games and a huge collection of 90s-era Mac magazines. An offshoot of this particular collecting came about when I won a couple of auctions for hundreds of Mac magazine cover CDs. All of a sudden I had getting on for 500 CDs stuffed full of Mac software, and I needed to figure out what to do with it all. I did the only sensible (read: obsessive) thing that I could think of; spend months loading CDs and hauling the contents off into various directories on an external hard drive to create an uber-library of Stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is when I decided to set up a website to host and share all of these goodies with the world; \u003ca href=\"http://www.vintageapplemac.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.vintageapplemac.com!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, having put my archive of 4,000+ Mac shareware games and 20,000+ Mac shareware utils/apps online (over 30GB of data in the site, and counting!), I decided to use the site to document and explore my hobby, publishing articles on software titles I have, exploring the contents of the hundreds of Mac magazines I have, sharing the whacky bits of ephemera that I hauled off the magazine CDs, creating emulator items for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_mac?sort=-publicdate\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInternet Archive\u0027s Macintosh Library\u003c/a\u003e, hopefully soon producing \"let\u0027s play\"/tutorial videos. And that\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my hobby and I really enjoy geeking out about it. I really hope that it provides some value and entertainment for you, too. Maybe you\u0027ll find that long-lost file you really need in my archive. Or maybe you\u0027ll enjoy the funky content I publish. It\u0027d be hugely appreciated if you would be so generous as to throw a few sheckels in my hat and give me the encouragement to go the extra mile and keep producing great Macintosh content and to keep scouring eBay for interesting stuff to buy and put online for all my fellow enthusiasts to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
