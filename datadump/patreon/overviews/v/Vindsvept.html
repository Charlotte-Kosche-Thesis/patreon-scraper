I\u0027m a musician and producer living in northern Sweden. I write music inspired by fantasy in all its forms. I\u0027ve released 120+ songs since I started in 2013. It\u0027s been a life long dream to be able to make a living out of writing music as an independent artist. Over the last few years I have seen proof that the dream may some day become reality thanks to the kind folks already supporting me on Patreon. A massive thank you to all of you. It\u0027s been an amazing ride so far and I\u0027m working as hard as I can to make this year the most productive year yet.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://vindsvept.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Where.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI work alone. I do everything from the first note to the graphics. The work I do doesn\u0027t primarily depend on money, it depends on time. Of course there are always upgrades and improvements to make and it\u0027s not exactly a cheap hobby to have. Right now the money is spent on improvements until the fateful day where I can switch over to doing it full time. At that point it will be used to keep me alive while I hammer away at the keyboard.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://vindsvept.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Rewards.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe rewards range from having your name included in all of my works to getting to write a song with me, one on one on Skype.While I wish I could make the rewards more extensive I\u0027d rather focus all of my time on writing new music until I have more time to focus on the community.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://vindsvept.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Common.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow many tracks do you release per month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal has always been to release two per month. I haven\u0027t set any particular schedule because I feel it would compromise on the quality if I have to rush to keep up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have a lot of disposable income but still want to contribute.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027d rather have that cup of coffee I don\u0027t blame you. I love coffee. But in all seriousness, if you can\u0027t easily afford it then I don\u0027t want you to. Keep listening and share it on your social media if you want to help out.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating or change how much I pledge? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAbsolutely, you can cancel or change you pledge at any time. Do I have to pay in Dollars? No, you can pay with anything. Patreon is based in the US so everything in automatically converted to that currency.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you very much for visiting and thank you to all of you who have decided to support me in my quest to write music."
