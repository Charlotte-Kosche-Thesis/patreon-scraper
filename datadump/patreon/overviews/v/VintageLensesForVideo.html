I also enjoy doing vintage lens giveaways, monthly\nwhen possible, which has been another great way to help people discover vintage\nlenses!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m\nvery passionate about VLFV and I\u2019m always working on new\ntests/reviews/comparisons/etc, but my abilities to bring such content consistently\nare limited by the time and funds available to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwork on VLFV in spare time and majority of it is also funded by myself, which\nis why I think Patreon can make a big difference. With your support I will be\nable to dedicate more time and money towards creating useful \u0026amp; inspiring content\nfor you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirstly,\nI would like to stress that there is absolutely no obligation to support VLFV\non Patreon. In fact if you\u2019re low\non money, then please spend it things you really need instead. Supporting VLFV is completely optional\nand do it only if you can and really you want to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf\nyou decide to help, then have a look at my Goals on the left, which\nwill some idea of what I want to do with VLFV going forward and also check out my detailed description of Rewards, below, which will give you a good idea on how individual contributions can help. There\nare many things I want to do, but in short, I want to create more and better\ncontent for you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eHOW DOES IT WORK?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\ndecided to set the funding to be \u201cper Review / Website Article\u201d instead of \u201cMonthly\nContributions\u201d, because I didn\u2019t want to make this into yet another \u201cmonthly subscription\nbill\u201d where you don\u2019t exactly know what you\u2019re getting for it. With \u201cper\nReview/Article\u201d contributions you know exactly where your money is going and\nyou only contribute when I actually create new content! Due to my limited free\ntime, sometimes I only create one website post per month, but I would like to\nget to around four (one per week). It doesn\u2019t mean that you will have to fund\nevery new review/article I put out there though. It\u2019s very easy to set your\nPatreon budget when you start supporting VLFV and if you like you can support\njust one review/article per month, or you can support as many as I create and\nanything in between. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur\nvintage lens community is so diverse and everyone has different needs. I try\ncover all sorts of lenses as part of VLFV, so of course not every\nreview/article will be relevant to your needs, but rest assured that if one of\ncontribution helps me create a post that isn\u2019t relevant to you on one\noccasion, someone else\u2019s contribution on another occasion will help create\nsomething that will be exactly what you wanted to see. Even though\ncontributions are \u201cper Review/Article\u201d, they actually help create more\nthan one review or an article, your support will create a long lasting legacy and I can\u0027t thank you enough for that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d prefer to do one off donation instead, you can do it \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/VLFV\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehere\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nalways try to do as much as I can for the vintage lens community, but if you\ndecide to support my mission is such direct way, I want to give my direct\nsupport to you also, so here are some rewards for my Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n$1 on its own can\u2019t buy you much, but such\ncontribution can make a massive difference in a long run. As a thank you, you will\nget an access to my patron-only feed where I\u2019ll do my best to make your\ncontributions worthwhile. I will be posting all sorts of content here before I\ndo anywhere else. I will be listening to your suggestions and requests and will\ntry to help you with your needs as much as I can! Last, but no least, there\nwill be some surprises along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n$5 will help me take care of smaller expenses like the lens\nadapters, lens accessories, etc, so such\ncontribution will be making immediate effect and as a thank you, you will be\ninvited to a secret Facebook group, created for the patrons only. All of us use\nfacebook daily, so sometimes you might find it to an easier way to post\nquestions and well as share videos and advice with fellow Patrons. I\u0027ll be also\nbe there every day to respond to your posts! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e$10 can cover a monthly web hosting or shipping costs, which are boring, but very important expenses and as a thank you, you will get an invitation to a monthly Google\nHangout for Patrons only, where we will do Q\u0026amp;As and chat about vintage lens! It will be a lot of fun I\u0027m sure!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e$20 will contribute towards upcoming review/comparison/lens guide costs, which is what VLFV is all about! As a thank you, you will be given a secret email\naddress where you\u0027ll be able to reach me before anyone else! I get 100s of emails/messages/questions every week and I just can\u0027t keep up with them, so sometimes my response is quite slow, but this secret email address will now become my priority, so I will make sure to respond to your emails within 24 hours!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e$50 is quite a lot of money and it will actually be enough to buy certain lenses for the upcoming giveaways, reviews and comparisons! Such contribution will be making a massive difference to all the upcoming VLFV content and for such generosity I will glad to offer all my knowledge and assistance in a One to One monthly Skype\nconsultation call. You will have up to 1 hour each month (use it how you like) to ask me any questions,\nadvice or talk about anything else vintage lens related! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy alltime favorite vintage lens is the Russian cult classic: Helios 44-2 58mm F2.0. I always say that every photographer and cinematographer should try this lens because it\u0027s the most magical lens I know of. I want to personally make sure than my first 5 Patrons who contribute $50 will get to try this lens, so the first 5 contributors in this tier will get a Helios 44-2 lens from me as a bonus gift! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re unfamiliar with this lens, have a look at a simple test video I shot with it to see how much magic this lens has!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0UgyHDYSZVk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUSEFUL INFO!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you don\u0027t have much money, but still want to support VLFV on Patreon, then just sign up to support 1 post per month at $1 per post.
