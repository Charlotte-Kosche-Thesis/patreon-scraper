    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the KW1S podcast!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForgive me, I seem to have misplaced my molotov cocktail and vendetta mask, but my name is Virah and I am a fucking radical. I\u2019m a working class, highly educated, outspoken, non-religious, polysexual, kinky, queer, cisgender female of color, who works in the adult entertainment industry. My sheer existence has probably already offended (or confused) someone...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made this podcast because I was tired of being silenced. I was tired of people telling me I wasn\u2019t making \u201cpolite conversation.\u201d I was tired of people telling me that it wasn\u2019t the \u201cappropriate place\u201d to talk about \u201csuch things.\u201d It seemed like it was never the \u201cright time\u201d to talk about issues that affect human suffering on a daily basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApparently it\u2019s not \u201cpolite\u201d to talk about the negative social and philosophical consequences of capitalism. Apparently, it\u2019s not \u201cappropriate\u201d to talk about setting healthy boundaries in group sex scenarios. And apparently it\u2019s considered \u201crude\u201d to tell people that their worldview has dangerous and harmful consequences for myself and living creatures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFUCK. THAT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m tired of being told that I can\u2019t talk about things that matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEthics NOT politics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePower is not who talks the most, but who controls the conversation. This includes which issues are important to talk about, how they are framed, which vernacular we use, and what questions are worthy of asking. Most conversations, both on the left and right, are aimed at placing blame on a couple bad apples, but no one is talking about the leaky barrel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEthics are the the core principles we use to determine right from wrong. If the ethics we are operating under are incoherent (at best), then our subsequent politics are going to be shitty and irrelevant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to quantify what makes a philosophy or worldview cohesive and ethical. I want to talk about criteria and accountability. I want to talk about the implications our personal philosophies have, not only on ourselves, but also on our neighbors, our co-workers and our larger human community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhilosophy NOT poetry\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it can be loads of fun to drop a ten strip, and wax and wane about being the \u201conly mind\u201d in the universe or whether or not truth can exist, but that\u2019s not what this podcast is about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s not the knowledge itself, or even the pursuit of new ideas that drives me. Don\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s fine and good to get your rocks off day dreaming about the infinite potential of human life,\u00a0but that\u0027s just not my jam. I\u0027m a little more pragmatic than that. I like my ideas grounded in reality and rooted in our everyday lives. It\u2019s the synthesis between theory and practice that interests me. Ideas that result in more ethical ways of behavior and thought. I\u2019m talking about applied ethics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u2019s the SEX at??\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout ethics and consent, I would be a sexual predator and a criminal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose of you who know me from my adult work know, I have been hyper sexual with ridiculously kinky and taboo fantasies for as long as I can remember. Is it hardwired? Did I learn it from somewhere? Where did these desires come from? \u003cem\u003eI don\u2019t know.\u003c/em\u003e What I do know is that they\u2019re here, they aren\u2019t going anywhere and I\u2019m not the only one with these kinds of desires. I think the more important questions to ask are how adults can get their needs met in ways that are safe and healthy for everyone involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApplied ethics doesn\u2019t get any sexier than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u2019t guarantee that you will agree with or like everything I have to say. A lot of my kinks can be triggering for people who\u2019ve witnessed or experienced abuse. Some of the things I\u2019ll be talking about might make you angry or bring a tear to your eye. Some of my experiences might make you blush or even offend you. I\u2019m not a doctor and I don\u2019t have a panacea for your sex life. I\u2019m not perfect and I will probably stick my foot in my mouth at some point. But what I can promise is to deliver each episode of KW1S with the utmost of thought, care and integrity possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of great conversations going on around consent, poly, sex work, and kink, and it\u2019s got everyone 50 shades of curious about kinksters // sex workers who we are and what we do. I\u2019ve learned that if you don\u2019t tell your story, someone else will, and they\u2019ll do a piss poor job of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShow me that BOOTY!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis platform is for my KW1S podcast.
