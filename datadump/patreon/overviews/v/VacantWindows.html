    "summary": "Hi everyone. \u00a0As much as I hate these sites that encourage asking for money, I\u0027m going to be honest. \u00a0Vacant Windows is two guys, \u00a0Brian and myself. \u00a0We make music because that\u0027s what runs through our veins. It is a labor of love and it has never been about getting rich, but we do dump a ton of cash into this project . \u00a0I\u0027ve endeavored to find creative and affordable ways to do things like release new music videos and manufacture physical copies of recordings but there are only so many corners that can be cut, and everything costs. We would love to take this project to the next level, but there just isn\u0027t much more we can do with the limited means that we\u0027re working with. For example, we\u0027re poised to release our debut LP and I would love to hire a PR Firm to shop it around to radio stations and media outlets, but that will cost us between 1-2K dollars! That\u0027s just one example. We simply cannot afford to make those strides on our own, so if you\u0027re a fan and you would like to be a part of making Vacant Windows in to something more, help us out and make a pledge. \u00a0We\u0027ll be your best friend."
