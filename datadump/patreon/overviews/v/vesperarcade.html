    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI have been creating videos on YouTube for over 6 years as my favorite hobby.\u003c/strong\u003e I began YouTube with a cheap camcorder and recorded unedited high skilled gaming footage. During this time, I also created guides to some of my favorite arcade games. Over the years, the quality of content has improved due to the addition of upgraded equipment. Today, I am most known for creating high quality fighting game tutorials for games such as Street Fighter IV, Killer Instinct, and Mortal Kombat X.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledging will allow me to continue releasing high quality content regularly. \u003c/strong\u003eAs this is a hobby, I only have limited time to dedicate to content creation while not at my regular job. Your pledge will allow me to dedicate less time working and more time building content for YouTube, which is where all my videos will be released. Additionally, the pledges will allow me to upgrade my equipment to keep up with the pace of technology. Ultimately, I would like to be a full time gaming content creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe next project will be to create a tutorial series to teach new and past video game players how to play Capcom\u2019s upcoming fighting game, Street Fighter V. \u003c/strong\u003eFighting games are deep and complex. Unfortunately, they can be intimidating to new players. My tutorial series hopes to present Street Fighter V in a way that will be helpful to players of all skill levels. Street Fighter V is the perfect game for anyone to get started for its design and popularity will appeal to a wide range of video game players. I will begin by teaching basic concepts such as controls, mechanics, and fundamentals on to more advanced concepts such as combos, tactics, and exploits. As new information is released and new techniques discovered, I will update the tutorial to keep everyone up to date with the latest competitive strategies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy fighting game tutorials will be taught via video, with each video structured like a school lesson. \u003c/strong\u003eDirect capture from the game will be the primary focus, with a second camera focused on my hands to help provide a visual example of the mechanical requirements needed to perform the tutorial. All lessons will be fully commentated, focused on providing concise information in an easy to understand format. Also, I plan to provide guides on characters specifically to discuss each character\u2019s unique attacks, combos, and playstyles. No topic will be considered too obvious or simple to explain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBelow, you will find some examples of my past work:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFi4CU1vTjQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFi4CU1vTjQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFi4CU1vTjQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMortal Kombat X - Combo Video Example\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijlbea1msLE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMortal Kombat X - Character Tutorial Example\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rrq_3ZgzDc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKiller Instinct - Tutorial Example\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfP3oj_8oXM\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStreet Fighter 4 - Tutorial Example\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfP3oj_8oXM\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rrq_3ZgzDc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijlbea1msLE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxBQFY5XwxU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe King of Fighters XIII - Trial Video Example\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ecxYvxqe2E\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePersona 4 Arena - Character Challenge Tutorial Example\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
