That mission was to provide useful, entertaining and unique content to the Shadowrun community. We launched with a two segment plan. The first and most important was to create dramatic Shadowrun material in the form of a monthly in character \u0027Shadowblog\u0027 by the shows headline character, Vendetta Violent. It would be different, showing Shadowrun through the eyes of someone who was one foot in the shadows and one foot out. The drama (and trauma) a balancing act like that would create would seem to be somewhat focal while a greater and more hidden plot would slowly develop behind the scenes to spur the series on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second was an informational segment aimed at helping players and GM\u0027s think outside the traditional box or even to get an inside look at the mindframe and tools others use to bring more passion and flavor into their own home games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then we\u0027ve grown to creating fully scripted audio dramas such as our Redmond Born series along with unique actual play content (Tales from the Stuffer Shack) that attempts to immerse the listener into what life in the Sixth World away from the usual mercenary flavor of Shadowrun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1376.photobucket.com/albums/ah15/MyViolentLife/Patreon/violentlifead_zpsknsbphdy.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re excited to be treading some new ground here. After nearly a year of shadowcasts we finally began to break into fully scripted, plot driven audio dramas. To prove that we could do it, we began a new series called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.violentlifepodcast.com/category/podcast-drama/redmond-born/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRedmond Born\u003c/a\u003e which utilizes multiple voice actors, sound effects and dramatic narration. It was also the first time we\u0027d ventured away from the life of Vendetta Violent and into some new territory. It was a hit and remains as the work we\u0027re most proud of. It\u0027s also some of the hardest and most expensive content to make for a podcast from extensive scripting, paid voice actors, subscriptions to music and sound effects services to name just a few of the hurdles we overcome to bring you this entertainment. Patron or not, we will NEVER gate any of the audio content we make behind a patreon paywall and thus, rely on your generosity to keep bringing these stories to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1376.photobucket.com/albums/ah15/MyViolentLife/Patreon/violentlifei_zpsxnvtujam.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Informationals have went through various stages since our start. It originally started as a program that was to be a community resource, then shifted to be largely about interviews and world building before being discontinued. This is programming I want to be able to resurrect as I strongly believe that world building segments were really a strong offering. With this in mind, upon striking our $250 milestone we will be bringing these segments back in a fresh, entertaining way. Taking some inspiration from game shows like \u0027Whose Line is it Anyway?\u0027 we will be pitting two guests \u0027against\u0027 one another over a world building topic judged and mediated by none other then Ozzkore of Join the Anarchy! This is a ton of work, obviously, and thus we\u0027ve put it up as a show milestone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1376.photobucket.com/albums/ah15/MyViolentLife/Patreon/violentlifepatreon_zpsnjw4i6si.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Febuary 2016 we announced our intention for a Patreon campaign. We felt it important to make sure that we were ready and in a position to offer AND fulfill any obligations we made to our fans as well as to the talented artists and voice actors that make this all possible. We also wanted to make sure that we stuck to our guns on our statement of not gating off any podcast content. I am proud to announce that we are staying true to that mission. Patron or not, you will ALWAYS receive the full scope of our audio content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why support the show? Read on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1376.photobucket.com/albums/ah15/MyViolentLife/Patreon/violentliferewards_zpsobez9zwg.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1/5/2018 - We\u0027re working on some new rewards for Patronage. These rewards will be retroactive to the start of this Patreon. Essentially the idea is that every month you\u0027re a patron at the $5+ level you\u0027ll get a ticket. These tickets get put into draws we will be tossing out. I was looking for a way to more actively deal out rewards while making it more \u0027controllable \u0026amp; sustainable\u0027 then the old Nuyen system as I don\u0027t use Patron money to buy rewards (it\u0027s my own thanks to my patrons so should come out of my own wallet). I\u0027m also considering the occasional $10+ draw as well to go along side the $5+ ones (because no matter what your level, you only get 1 ticket per month as a patron). The frequency of these draws won\u0027t be set but I intend on making them semi frequent. Tickets are not expended upon winning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the draws, each level has it\u0027s own special rewards detailed under the reward tiers. As might be expected, each level gets the benefits that come before it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll see that we are using the milestone system for our projected shows. These are essentially going to be mini-series that we REALLY want to produce and bring to you as rewards for your support. With each one of these shows I will be commissioning a piece of art to go along with it to kind of headline the show. This means each time we hit a milestone you will not only empower us to keep making audio dramas but also allow us to both give back to the art community AND add more beautifully done images to the physical Nuyen reward pool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/X3uTEGM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/X3uTEGM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1376.photobucket.com/albums/ah15/MyViolentLife/Patreon/discord_zpsrmlyyqf4.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHow do I link my Patreon account to access Patron only Discord Channels on our server?
