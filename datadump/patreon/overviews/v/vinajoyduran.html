    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m VinaJoy (Duran) Barham. Duran is my mother\u0027s maiden name (yay Matriarchy) and I am part of the Pilipinx diaspora from the Ilocos region.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an unschooling mama, writer and a guide.\u00a0 I share a lot of words on \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/vinajoy\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and some glimpses of my life on \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mamavina/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 I also \u003ca href=\"http://vinabarham.com/intuitive-guidance-sessions/\"\u003ehelp people get clarity\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://vinabarham.com/unpack-your-shit/\"\u003ehelp folks unpack their racist shit,\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://vinabarham.com/adornments-for-your-soul/\"\u003ecreate adornments for energetic protection\u003c/a\u003e. Oh! I also created \u003ca href=\"http://vinabarham.com/product-category/shirts/\"\u003eResist \u0026amp; Thrive shirts\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have other projects I\u0027m wanting to work on, including writing a memoir and a children\u0027s book with Pilipinx-American children as main characters. I dream of creating space for Pilipinx-Americans healing their colonized self. And going back with my family to the Motherland to reconnect. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see more of the current iteration of my work at \u003ca href=\"http://vinabarham.com.\"\u003eVina Barham\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the thread that weaves all my work is about moving towards our most authentic life. What does it mean to live our truest selves? What do we need to heal and let go of? How do we support that healing? How do we prioritize lives who face the most systems barriers in living their most authentic life? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two aspects of my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst as it pertains to dismantling beliefs within and systems we help uphold that keep us from living free.\u003c/strong\u003e That for me expresses itself in holding white people accountable in dismantling their white privilege as well holding space for Colonized People/People of Color to process their internalized racism/whiteness. I do this in my writings, in sharing my perspectives and sharing lessons I am learning from other people of color. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond as it relates to this organic \u0026amp; collective movement towards reclaiming our ancestral wisdom \u0026amp; indigenous sou\u003c/strong\u003el. This translates into my own personal decolonization of my beliefs and everyday practices as a Pilipinx-American living in stolen land. I\u0027m in the very beginning stage of my journey and I constantly seek the voices of those ahead in the path before me. This looks like me sharing my process of excavating treasures from my specific lineage but also the universal + ancient wisdom that we all possess but gets buried in our current patriarchal, white, binary, ableist culture. Whether it pertains to parenting, to art, to spirituality, to work, I speak to all of it when Inspiration \u0026amp; Truth comes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do both because we cannot do one work without the other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy perspectives are informed by the privileges \u0026amp; gifts I hold and the marginalizations I fight to end. My delivery is blunt, honest, vulnerable, irreverent. But I\u0027m here to share all of it, the messy process and all other shit I dig from the depths as well as the dreams and visions I have for a better world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for being here and supporting all of this. I appreciate you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHIS IS HOW WE DO THIS WORK TOGETHER.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Love \u0026amp; Solidarity,\u003cbr\u003eVina\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
