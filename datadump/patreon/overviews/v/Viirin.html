    "summary": "I\u0027m Viirin, a guy with an autobiography I might write, but we\u0027ll just have to see. I traumatized my own therapist with it, so it would be better if my situation improves first so I don\u0027t make myself psychologically worse while doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe patron tiers all do the same thing- fund artists. Just the level depends on how much you can and want to give. The more I get, the more the artist gets, and the more they\u0027ll work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came to Patreon because one of my fans suggested it, and who am I to argue? The creator, that\u0027s who! But it was a good idea and timed well with what\u0027s going on, so I did it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope all of you enjoy my creations- my goal in life is to make one BILLION people smile. Smiling because someone likes what I do, smiling because I\u0027m so stupid and unfunny that it actually IS funny, smiling because you\u0027re confused, smiling because I got something wrong and you see me as less than half as smart as I tell myself I am? That all counts. Will I ever reach this number? No, I won\u0027t, but that\u0027s the point!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy future plans for my work? Let\u0027s look at things in order of popularity as of February 25, 2017, since that\u0027s the day I\u0027m writing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAzure Wyrm\u003cbr\u003eSummary: Roleplaying game. You are a slime that can incorporate any chemical solution, colonize any disease, and replicate any body parts or instincts of plants and animals you eat. Eventually you become a dragon of your own design.\u003cbr\u003ePlans: Since even before I made it into a text-based forum roleplay, I had wanted it to be a fully 3D PC RPG, but that would cost the kinds of money that I don\u0027t have. So, if I\u0027m able, then that\u0027s the end result. In between then and now are a few other things I\u0027d like to do, including:\u003cbr\u003e-Have a website built properly so all the posts from all the threads from all the sites it has been on can be collected and reconstructed chronologically. Each player would have an account created in the name I originally met them as, and their posts under their account name, with the original time and date manually input. Basically, every player can transition effortlessly and all information is kept, no matter what it was.\u003cbr\u003e-A web-based picture novel be drawn that follows each slime, from release to current state. There are a few fight scenes I really wanna see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, Reincarnation Didn\u0027t Work Like I Thought...\u003cbr\u003eSummary: A webnovel that follows a man living without hope, who was dying alone in a hospital, depressed. Then he was murdered. He reincarnated as a monster in a world full of magic.\u003cbr\u003ePlans: I\u0027d like to just get it so the book goes onto my own site, too. Various readers have requested audiobook and hardcopy versions of each chapter. This came up in a conversation with a friend of mine, who is a professional graphic designer (Pancho Lightsout on Twitch) who said he wanted to get into voice acting, so I agreed. While gaming, one of the guys I write collaborative stories with said that he would like to do such a thing too, so I\u0027m looking into letting him. Support people on their own dreams, right?\u003cbr\u003ePancho would require pay for the voice-acted audiobook chapters (Chapter 1 is free, he said), so I\u0027d use some of the Patron income on paying him. He\u0027s also the one that did the cover for this book for free, voluntarily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEugene Comics\u003cbr\u003eSummary: A web comic that is equal parts \u0027intentionally offensive\u0027 and \u0027refreshingly relatable\u0027. The story follows a superhero psychologist who uses super powers from video games and cartoons to kill those who are unrepentantly cruel, or inexcusably oblivious.\u003cbr\u003ePlans: I\u0027m well aware that I\u0027m a terrible artist. Donations and subscriptions would partially go to pay an artist. They are expensive people! But anyway, these are my plans:\u003cbr\u003e-Get the comic onto my own site (which needs to be built)\u003cbr\u003e-The first episode was just homework for art class in college. It was fun to write, but I\u0027m distractable. Anyway, when I was homeless I started writing it more because I didn\u0027t have the internet. As I was given various colors of ink, better paper, colored pencils, crayons, and all sorts of other art supplies to continue working by other homeless people who wanted to read more, I came up with a new art direction. But I\u0027m not talented enough to pull it off and my scanner is finicky with color, so I can\u0027t even try. Two art styles. \u0027Mundane\u0027 style is black and white, realistic. \u0027Enchanted\u0027 style is color, and a crossbreed of Eastern and Western art. I might switch which is real and which is color before it begins, though. Someone asked me \u0027Is all this really happening, or is Eugene just delusional?\u0027 and so I thought the art should support both statements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCopyright Infringement the Trading Card Game\u003cbr\u003eSummary: A trading card game that came about from two nerds (me and a friend) arguing over the phone about which magical items from various franchises could corrupt or cause others to become obsolete.\u003cbr\u003ePlans: Legally speaking, I can\u0027t make money on this, so if you were donating or subscribing for this, don\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t accept.\u003cbr\u003eSo far, I\u0027ve done more than 3,000 cards, and plan on at least 750 more. I stopped using Sumo because it\u0027s just a scam and con. Sure I was able to effectively use it for a few years anyway (once I got my bank to fix it) but I\u0027m just going to go entirely GIMP2. Stuff I\u0027d like to do, when I have more time:\u003cbr\u003e-Make easy card decks you can print off yourself on card stock, so you can download the entire game, or in parts, for free, whenever you want. I\u0027d have it on my site, set up in Decks (which really just means each game, cartoon, TV show, etc, as separate decks so you choose what all gets used per session). Want Pokemon and Doctor Who together, but you don\u0027t want Megaman and My Little Pony to mix with Dora the Explorer or Back to the Future? Don\u0027t download those then. Just get what interests you, ignore what doesn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e-A 3d PC game. I don\u0027t know how to even pull this off legally! But if I could find a way, then each Puzzle Deck piece would effectively be a biome, that might or might not radically change whatever other biome(s) it touched. I\u0027m pretty sure Barter Town (Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome) would have better stuff for trade if it was next door to Yugioh Academy (Yu-gi-oh) and the Death Star (Star Wars).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are other games I want to make, too!\u003cbr\u003e-Legend of the Legend: As far as you\u0027re aware, it\u0027s the medieval times. A priest wakes you up in the forest, and tells you that you\u0027re the hero, and you have to rescue the princess from the dark wizard! But you\u0027ve been cursed with an evil spell that makes your health constantly deplete, so concentrate on those healing items! As you start your quest, a plant monster attacks you, blocking your path. After defeating the monster, you eventually come across a small town. Outside the item shop, and outside the alchemist, are treasure chests with healing potions. If you let your health deplete to a certain point, then... odd things start happening. Shopkeepers start yelling at you to get out, and won\u0027t sell you things. Buildings start looking different. Potions look and are named different things in your inventory. Spoiler! Magic isn\u0027t real, it\u0027s the 21st century, that wasn\u0027t a forest, those aren\u0027t healing potions, that\u0027s not an item shop, that isn\u0027t a princess, that\u0027s not a dark wizard, you aren\u0027t cursed with a health-depleting spell. You are just drunk, and it\u0027s your buzz wearing off. Depending on how sober/cursed your character is, depends on OH SO MUCH.\u003cbr\u003e-Car Pong: Drive around in a mall parking lot during the zombie apocalypse. You\u0027ve got a car with a steam shovel in front that acts like a pinball machine launcher. Scoop up zombies and bank them off light posts, fling them into dumpsters, or play ping pong with them in multiplayer! Just beware of the cute little freckled girl with pigtails and an oversized lolipop- she has a rocket launcher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I wanna build a community. A proper one! I\u0027m able to get most of this stuff for free (to me) by redirecting and interconnecting existing businesses and such, but I still wanna say this:\u003cbr\u003eI want to get some housing, find a way to make it free or stupidly cheap for my tenants/employees. Find out their dreams- they\u0027re probably productive ones. Create those industries within easy travel for my people, make it marketable to tourists. I don\u0027t wanna actually get into the details here, but step 3: profit.\u003cbr\u003e"
