I like all types of games but my preference are\u00a0ones that I can be creative in and/or that challenge me in some way.. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love a good shoot \u0027em up as much as the next person!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to think of myself as quite a humorous and caring person with a tad of OCD and an attention for detail -\u00a0with a slight fondness for Twining\u0027s Morning Breakfast Tea.. Yes I\u0027m becoming a stereotypical Englishman!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoy communicating with people and helping people out and I spend most of my day doing that in my day job. YouTube gives me a chance to apply those skills to my passion, so that\u0027s what brings me to making the gameplay videos that I have been producing for the last couple of months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to grow and expand the channel and create even better content for my loyal followers new\u00a0\u0026amp; old and as much as I wish I could, I don\u0027t always have the funds to do such things. I plan to change my monthly channel update to a Vlog and add face-cam to some of the games I play just so I can reach out to everyone in much more of a personal way. I would also love to do competitions and give aways each month, because its always fun to win things and.\u00a0This is just\u00a0some of the many ideas that float around in my head and if you have watched my Banished series you will know ideas are in that hollow head of mine somewhere!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eThank you!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you have stumbled across this page by mere coincidence or if you sought this page out on purpose, I would just like to thank you \u003cstrong\u003eall\u003c/strong\u003e for the support I get on my YouTube channel and that in no way do I expect anything from you guys and girls. I was asked the question if I had a Patreon page, so I created one to give people the option.
