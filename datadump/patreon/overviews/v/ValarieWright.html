Those who lived this way were recognizable by the staff they carried, which was an earned emblem of their office / role.  They were trained in the use of Runes and herbs, they traveled the worlds beyond this one, so were called upon to guide the dead on their final journey.  These women were considered holy, for they had dedicated their lives in becoming vessels of Forn Sidr, the \u201cancient customs, laws\u201d, the Old Ways. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis essential societal role required many years of both book learning / froedi (\u201clore, old learning\u201d), and hands-on application / blot (\u201cworship, sacrifice\u201d), which is why they were called fjolkyngi (\u201cmuch-knowing / knowledge\u201d).  They were renowned singers of galdr (\u201cmagical incantations\u201d), and knew the right use of mark hlutr (\u201cmark, draw / lots, set of a thing, runes\u201d), which is why they were also called gorningar (\u201cto bestow enchantment, to endow with magic; a magic deed or action\u201d).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this research takes time, practice, and diligence in teasing and collating the mass of information - in dead and obscure languages - into a cohesive and comprehensible format.\u00a0 Please support my Seidr mission, to assure this Old European Folkway is carried-forth into the next generation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eKnow you how to carve, know you how to interpret?\u003cbr\u003eKnow you how to paint (grasp), know you how to test?\u003cbr\u003eKnow you how to bid (ask), know you how to sacrifice?\u003cbr\u003eKnow you how to send, know you how to destroy?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Havamal 144 (Wright translation)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Valarie Wright.
