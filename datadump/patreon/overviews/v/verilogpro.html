When I first graduated with a bachelor degree, I failed to enter the industry---failing 3 interviews at 3 prominent semiconductor companies, which virtually burned all the bridges and ended my job search at that time. But eventually through study, practice, time, and luck, I succeeded and ended up in my position today. You can read all about it at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.verilogpro.com/about\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVerilogpro About page\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was in school, desperately looking for ways to learn Verilog, coding techniques, and gain inroads into this industry,\u00a0nobody taught me common digital design and RTL coding techniques, or pointed me to such resources. Verification\u2014any form of verification\u2014was unheard of (I needed more than several directed test cases to test my design? Who knew!). Even in the first few years of my working career, I continued to have the same questions. My coworkers were very knowledgeable, but like the common cliche\u2014you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know\u2014I never knew what to ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission with \u003ca href=\"http://www.verilogpro.com/\"\u003eVerilogpro\u003c/a\u003e is to be that resource that I wanted and needed when I first tried to enter this industry, and again when I began working in this industry. Through my research and writing I want to educate and explain\u00a0digital design and verification topics\u00a0in an easy to understand manner, to help students and graduates land a job in the industry, to help engineers\u00a0new to this industry rapidly increase their knowledge and skill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform to connect fans to content creators and writers. Rather than an ad-supported model, using Patreon, writers and content creators like me can focus on creating content, and be supported by fans by writing paid posts and other rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can support \u003ca href=\"http://www.verilogpro.com/\"\u003eVerilogpro\u003c/a\u003e by subscribing to become a per-article patron (see right), starting at as low as $1 per article. If you\u0027re able to support at a higher level, the suggested pledge is $5 per article. Every dollar will help me keep the website running, and allow me to devote more time to writing articles! The better job I do, hopefully you will reciprocate and support my work as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy initial goal is to write 1-2 paid posts per month, so you know what your maximum contribution will be. You will always be able to unsubscribe if you change your mind later. By accepting your support, I make the commitment to you that all future paid posts will have the same level of quality as the posts I have written at \u003ca href=\"http://www.verilogpro.com/\"\u003eVerilogpro\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to post my articles for free on \u003ca href=\"http://www.verilogpro.com/\"\u003eVerilogpro\u003c/a\u003e, in order to reach and educate as many people as I can.
