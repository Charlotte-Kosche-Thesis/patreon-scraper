    "summary": "Hey, thanks for checking out my Patreon! First\u2014just to be clear. Donations\u2014no matter their size\u2014are deeply and eternally appreciated. Every dollar I receive from Patreon helps me focus just a little bit more on my passion projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, a bit about me: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a professional writer. I have been a professional writer for a number of years. Unfortunately, the writing I do that pays the bills is dry and boring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI prefer to write about fantasy worlds, heroes, and intrigue--but my ability to do so is limited by the time I spend writing about financial institutions and stock prices.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I started a Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a freelance writer, which means I have complete control over my professional writing schedule. Right now, I spend most of my time working on the professional stuff. Supplementing my income allows me to take on fewer work projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat extra time will then allow me to work on the projects this Patreon page lists that much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to be clear, becoming my patron does not grant you access to \u003cem\u003emore\u00a0\u003c/em\u003elight novel remixes or fanfiction. Those things are free forever. (I don\u0027t think it would even be legal for me to offer them as rewards.)\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what does becoming my Patron do for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll get faster updates.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll have access to early rough drafts, pre-edited versions.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can read my original fiction and any articles on writing I publish.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll have a say in my project schedule (i.e. what I take on next, when I take it on, etc...)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd, finally, those of you who want it, can have direct access to me. We can discuss whatever the hell you want: my work, becoming a better writer, my favorite anime...whatever the hell you want.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn summary, thanks for checking out my Patreon. I hope you\u0027ll stay awhile. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy any of my projects, I hope you\u0027ll consider giving a dollar or two because...well...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make more.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
