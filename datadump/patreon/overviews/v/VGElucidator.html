    "summary": "Hello, I am VGElucidator. I was trying to find some videos on the inspiration behind Castlevania enemies on YouTube one day and found that...well, there wasn\u0027t much to find, really. So I decided that I would be the one to fill that gap through a series I call:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming Deconstructed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing some inspirations of my own, I assembled a video format that combines video games with world culture and history, comparing how accurate the subject from the game is to the thing that inspired it. Some things are really close to the source, others...not so much! Each episode is as entertaining and information-filled as I can possibly make it--and the best part is that with each passing episode, I get better and better! Crazy how application works, huh?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDrawing with Speed\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my Gaming Deconstructed series, I also have one called \"Drawing with Speed\" where I speed up my process of digital painting whatever the people on twitter vote for. This is, of course, game-related, but I might venture out onto some other properties. The point of this series is to: 1) Show people how I draw the things that I draw. 2) Catalog my personal artistic progress. 3) Give you a chance to unwind and relax. the process of drawing can be very therapeutic--even if you\u0027re just watching it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSchedule:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, the regular schedule goes like this: One Deconstructed Episode per month, one or two extra side videos (called \"Little Bits\"), and one Drawing with Speed. So typically 3 to 4 videos from me a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo the Patrons:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, your funds will go toward buying research material for the show, paper and cost of printing for my artwork (which will eventually go on sale once I work out the kinks), and overall, a better production (sound quality, after effects presets, video).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to support me, I thank you form the most sincerest part of my soul! Right now I do everything for free and some of these books aren\u0027t cheap! Thank you and I hope you continue to enjoy the content that I produce.\u003cbr\u003e"
