    "summary": "View from the Gutters is a comics podcast, recording in the beautiful hinterlands of the Pacific Northwest. Our primary show is the Comic Book Club. Each episode is a roundtable discussion focused on a particular comic book. Our hosts read and discuss a single graphic novel or collected volume(s) of a series, and we spend around an hour having a conversation inspired by the work. Sometimes we focus on the topic comic a lot, and sometimes it inspires us to have a wider discussion ranging to anything and everything under the kinda-geeky sun, from classic science fiction novels to cartoons, movies, math theory, opera, video games, and dozens of other topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe read books from every era and genre of comics, with a vast backlog of episodes (well over 200), so no matter who you are we\u2019re certain to have talked about some book that will catch your interest. Fair warning though our episodes contain massive spoilers for the topic work and explicit language!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition to the main show we also produce regular special episodes in the off-weeks, covering a range of topics. These include discussing longer comic works, movies, TV shows, industry news, and other secret or one-off projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s who we are. Now\u2026 what do we need from you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nProducing a podcast is a lot of work, and often more expensive than you\u2019d think. Aside from the cost of recording equipment there\u2019s also server hosting costs, recording space, buying books to talk about, and a lot of incidental costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a sponsor, your contribution makes a huge difference in terms of allowing us to put out the best possible show. Everyone who donates will get first crack at any special material that we have, when and as it is available. We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to let you folks know how much we love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThose who donate a little bit more receive some extra recognition, generally in the form of credit in the show notes. You can check out the sidebar for details on current rewards. We also have special bonus episodes in mind for when we reach certain funding goals, which everyone will get to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe appreciate your help in keeping View from the Gutters going, and we hope you\u2019ll choose to join us by making a pledge. \u003cbr\u003e"
