    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you probably know from watching my videos - I\u0027m Vress, a YouTuber and Twitch streamer who focuses on creating gaming videos (particularly for the MMORPG genre). I\u0027d describe my approach to content creation as optimistic but honest. There are already far too many content creators who seem to focus on the negative, and the community (especially for MMORPGs) seems to be becoming more toxic and pessimistic than ever. I want to create a place where we can be hopeful and get excited about games together, rather than just hating on every game before it has even released!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Makes Me Different?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I any different to other content creators? What I believe makes me different is the fact that I create content with a optimistic but brutally honest approach. I\u0027ll always say what I\u0027m feeling and I won\u0027t be bought (I\u0027ve been offered A LOT of sponsored videos in my first year of YouTube and I\u0027ve refused them all). I\u0027m not saying I\u0027ll never take a sponsorship, but I certainly won\u0027t take one if it means that I can\u0027t say certain things (which is most of them by the way!). However, despite my honest approach to pointing out a games flaws I always look for the good in things rather than just jumping on the hate-train at the first sign of trouble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... cards on the table. I already put a crazy amount of time into creating content, and I\u0027m currently putting out 1-2 videos every week and am about to start streaming 3+ times per week. However, bills need to be paid, and I\u0027m not able to put anymore time into content creation unless it can start contributing to these expenses - that\u0027s just the cold, hard truth! As you know YouTube ad revenue has never been great, and right now it\u0027s worse than ever, so Patreon feels like an obvious route. The more I can raise here, the less contract work I will take on, and the more content I will create for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do YOU Get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what do you get in return? It\u0027s simple really - more content! As you can see there are several other rewards that you will get for different tiers, but more frequent content is the big one. This applies to both YouTube videos and livestreams over on Twitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUncommon Tier ($1 or more):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou\u0027re awesome for supporting me, it\u0027s massively appreciated.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to Patron\u0027s only Discord channel (Patron Role)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eParticipate in feedback for the channel itself.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatron only videos here on Patreon.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVote on next Patreon Vlog topic.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRare Tier ($3 or more):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou just took it to the next level!
