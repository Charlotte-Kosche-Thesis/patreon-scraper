    "summary": "I\u0027m Angela R. Muhammad, Executive Director of Vanguard Television and originally from Benton\nHarbor, MI. I graduated from Howard University School of Communications in 1993\nwith a BA degree in Film Production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created Vanguard Television Network to show positive images of women of color through the arts. Traditionally,\nwomen of color have been untapped and underserved by the media. Vanguard will offer\nan alternative to negative images shown in the media and expose the public to\nthe diversity of women. VTN\u0027s goal is to empower and uplift by encouraging women\nof color to either star in, write, direct and/or produce their own programming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe provide outstanding photography, television and film services. We are currently looking for original programming such as documentaries, films (full\nlength and shorts), music videos, interviews, and plays to showcase on our network.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur next major project is Vol. 2 of our Million Man March series, \"The Million Man March ~ The Untold Story: The War On Hip Hop and Black Youth\". We know that there is a war on hip hop and the black youth so we will be interviewing hip hop artists and youth to talk about it. We will also get their thoughts on the Million Man March and how it has impacted them, the music industry and the youth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we need your help! With your help, we can continue to tell our own stories and encourage and nurture up and coming filmmakers of color to share their stories too."
