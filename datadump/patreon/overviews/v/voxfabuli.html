These videos will range from film projects (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4yTd_A5fZ4\"\u003eexample\u003c/a\u003e), to video taken live at theatre performances (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MXBNJXlfJk\"\u003eexample\u003c/a\u003e) to big ol\u2019 crowdfunded things (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sRWgT6FBXk\"\u003eexample\u003c/a\u003e). At most I will release 1-3 videos per month. But not to worry: you can set a monthly maximum donation to guard against the unlikely event of my going crazy and doing 20 videos in the same month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will You Be Helping Me Do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJos\u00e9 and The Hawk\u003c/em\u003e - CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS. I am wicked excited about this one. Born from an off the cuff comment made while shooting an episode of The Panel Jumper, as is usual for my artistic process, a title has taken hold of my brain and won\u2019t let go. Jos\u00e9 and The Hawk is a buddy cop/police procedural comedy, where one of the cops is a puppet. Actually, a hawk puppet. After two really positively received staged readings, one third of the pilot script filming is complete. After a successful Kickstarter (YAY!) \u003ca href=\"http://kck.st/2w3Jdjz\"\u003ehttp://kck.st/2w3Jdjz\u003c/a\u003e, we have the funds we need to finish shooting the pilot. I\u0027m planning/hoping to film and release it online early next year (2018).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLOOONG VERSION:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m a Midwestern girl happily transplanted to the Pacific Northwest. I make puppet cabaret acts, puppet videos and occasionally other weird things that are even less easy to explain. I perform at puppet slams, festivals and burlesque shows in Seattle and all around the country (even occasionally in Canada). I like to say my work takes the familiar and twists it into dark and humorous shapes (but I also like to sing songs to-and-about inanimate objects, so my assessments may or may not be trustworthy). This frequently involves my taking a fairy tale and/or something from nerd-flavoured pop culture land and leaping into the absurd abyss with it. Often there is singing. Generally, I go places that are not suitable for young audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNow I know it seems like the gig of being a somewhat-itinerant adult-centric nerd puppeteer would leave one just rolling in piles of sweet sweet cash, but sadly that is not the case. At least not yet. For me puppeteering is a full-time gig that I\u2019m working to bring up to being a full-time-PAYING gig. This is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am asking for your help to support me and my puppet creations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a funding engine designed specifically for people like us (independent Artists and independent Patrons), somewhat like Kickstarter, but more sustained. Think of it as an Art Subscription. Or think of it as a direct puppet awesomeness-to-puppet lover pipeline. It cuts out the middleman so that YOU (the Patron), can support ME, (the Artist), directly, encouraging me to make acts and videos, funding appearances at festivals, etc. It also gives you a way to support my work even if you can\u2019t physically attend any of the events where I\u2019m performing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet me be clear:\u003c/strong\u003e There is no guilt if you choose not to support me in this way. I conceive, write and perform puppet stories. You enjoy puppet stories. I\u2019ll keep producing them whether or not you become one of my esteemed Patrons. Patronage simply exists as a way for you to say thanks with your financial assistance if you feel moved to do so (which I appreciate the heck out of because makes it easier for me to continue to create).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are these \u201cpuppet stories\u201d I speak of?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nMy favored medium has long been live theatre, so a lot of my work happens there. Or at least starts there. There\u2019s no better example than\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sRWgT6FBXk\u0026amp;t=389...\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u201cMANOS - The Hands of Felt\u201d\u003c/a\u003e: a puppet musical version of the worst movie of all time* that mashes up the plot of MANOS with a heavily fictionalized version of how it came to be made.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI usually work in more bite-sized pieces, though.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-76jCS7jg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u201cCharlie and the Princess\u201d\u003c/a\u003e is a short act that started life as part of a stage show called \u201cStories for Bad Children: Chapter 2.\u201d Since then it\u2019s taken on a life of its own and I\u2019ve performed it at the National Puppet Festival, the Chicago International Puppetry Festival and most recently for an ACLU fundraiser here in Seattle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been bending my brain more towards video work. Both for the obvious reasons (it a] lasts longer and b] reaches more people) and because it\u2019s a new challenge for me, which is something I tend to run towards. Speaking of enjoying crazy challenges, two years ago I talked my studio partner and several of our friends into doing something called the Felt-a-thon where we aimed to film 12 puppet videos in 24 hours and live streamed the whole thing. My favourite video to come out of that was\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-WrDDDZyRg\u0026amp;t=15s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u201cLaine Mouill\u00e9,\u201d\u003c/a\u003e which appeared at DragonCon in 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd then sometimes I do things that are even less easy to explain, like \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DinosaurLovesPony/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDinosaur Loves Pony\u003c/a\u003e.\u201d It\u2019s a photographic serial story featuring plastic toys and other found objects.
