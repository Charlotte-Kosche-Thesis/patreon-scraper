    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSexuality and Creativity light my soul on fire.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I am super happy that you\u2019ve stumbled on to my Patreon page! I\u2019ve been going back and forth between wanting to launch a Patreon for almost a year now. I\u2019ll admit that the only thing holding me back was fear. I was terrified of being on a platform that would require me to be more intimate, honest, and emotionally vulnerable with my fans and friends. In my \u201creal life\u201d, I never let myself be anything less, but I\u2019ve been harboring a lot of fear about bringing the very intimate and real parts of myself to a larger audience. But my desire to be raw and my need to create greatly override any fear I have.The last few years have taught me that fear can be a very powerful tool as long as you don\u0027t run from it. And I do not plan to do any more running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you know me at all, you know I\u2019ve never been one to follow rules or do what was expected of me. I break every rule I can, and bend the ones that I can\u2019t break. I will not allow myself to exist in a state of stagnation \u2013 I must always be growing, challenging myself, pushing to be my very best version of myself. My journey in sex work has been a very empowering one, full of so many ups and downs. It\u2019s been one sexy hell of a roller coaster. But, I\u2019ve had some trouble finding *my* path in sex work that would allow me to devote as much time and resources to fusing my Sexuality, Sensuality, Kinky lifestyle and Creativity together in the way I have always longed to do.\u201c\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2026.Kinky Lifestyle, you say? That\u2019s cool and all\u2026.but why on Patreon?\u201d\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My sexuality is Kink \u0026amp; BDSM. And when I talk about my sexuality, I prefer to use the term \u201csensuality.\u201d I crave and seek out play and energy that is centered around my kinks and fetishes than I seek out sex/sexual play/energy. When I am creating, I am often driven and most inspired by the raw, captivating and erotic energy that exists in my play with kinky partners or when experimenting with kinks by myself. This (extremely vital) part of my life often feels too vulnerable to share with 23,000 people \u0026amp; is often not hardcore enough for people to want to see on more porn-y sites. And you can\u2019t have a Violet\u2019s creativity without a bit of fetish\u2026\u2026So, here we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I LOVE creating explicit and hardcore videos for the porn world; I\u2019m an exhibitionist and a proud self-proclaimed slut. But the kind of content I long to create is not the kind of content I can expect to pay my rent each month on the typical porn/adult websites. I\u2019ve been on the search for my creative home on the internet since 2011 and I truly feel like I have found it within the platform Patreon offers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I trying to build with my Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI am trying to do three things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 First, I want to create and share highly stylized, erotic, and sensual videos and photo sets, Both non nude, nude, and explicit. My focus with this patreon will not be on my more explicit content, but it will likely bleed over as it is part of me and my artistic expression.. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I also want to post progress photos, short videos, and gifs of other creative hobbies I enjoy in my spare time and my hope is that  my Patreon grows enough for me to focus real attention on those projects and work them into new tiers. I enjoy learning and working on my creative skills as therapy painting, photography, makeup artistry, flow art movement/dancing (spinning poi, hooping, flow wands) performing music in ASL (American sign language), Burlesque, GoGo Dancing, Pole Dance, and feather fan dancing. These are all hobbies I dabble in from time to time when I seek inspiration, and want to devote more time to in the future so I can start working a few of these talents and\u0026amp; passions into my art videos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Second, I want to build a community with and for the people who believe in me and want to support my art. I want it to be private and exclusive. Those of you who are supporting me DESERVE that and I am hell bent on giving it to you. Some of you have been around supporting me for YEARS, and I want to have a place to celebrate our friendship. This intimate and exclusive community will have all the tools offered by Patreon itself, Discord access for keeping in touch and chatting every day, playing computer games together, live monthly streams on a private server where I\u0027ll run a poll for what kind of show we\u2019ll have, and lastly.... I am a nerdy little girl who LOVES games like League of Legends, Diablo III, Guild Wars 2 and more that I would LOVE to nerd out with my friends on and unwind from our days by wrecking monsters!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And third; I want to be completely, unabashedly, and whole-heartedly myself \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e my supporters. I\u2019ve found over the years that when I am nothing less than myself with someone, they usually end up feeling safe enough to be themselves with me. And guess what? Every time that happens, I get to see another human\u2019s beauty truly shine. I want to experience that with the people that support me."
