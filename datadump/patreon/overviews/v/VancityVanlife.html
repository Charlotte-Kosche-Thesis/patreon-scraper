    "summary": "I am a filmmaker from Vancouver Canada who lives full ....AHHHH there is no need for me to tell you who i am because if you are here then you already know who i am already. Patreon is the backbone to the Vancity Vanlife Channel. As a young growing channel this place allows me as filmmaker to budget my filming days. Fuel, ferry costs etc. And as this community here grows so will the channel. Bigger budgets mean bigger movies, better camera gear, more travel, and more treats for Disco. All i want is to create mini movies, movies about inspiration, Travel, Van Life, Music, Weird stuff...I just want to make movies about life from a different angle. Who knows what i will create...I just want to create full-time. And you throwing a few dollars at this project every month is massive to growing this as a Company. This is business. Lets Make Some Movies."
