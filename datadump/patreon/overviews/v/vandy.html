And if you haven\u0027t heard of me, well, take a look around here, and at my website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.vandyhall.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.vandyhall.com\u003c/a\u003e) to check out the sort of work I do. I work in all sorts of Media, and I want to share my art with you, and teach you to create your own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been making my living as a glass\nblower, specializing in reproduction medieval and renaissance\nglassware. In the past six years, I\u0027ve begun showing more of my two\ndimensional work and sculptural glass at Sci-fi Conventions,\ncomicons, and in galleries. Because I am a chronic migraine sufferer\n(I often have migraines every day, sometimes for weeks in a row), I\nhaven\u0027t been able to work in the glass studio enough in the last\ncouple of years, and I am struggling to afford to pay my bills, let\nalone pay for medicine and doctors. I need to see a new headache\nspecialist in order to keep looking for solutions to my often\ndebilitating migraines and the doctor and many of the procedures and\nmedications I haven\u0027t tried yet aren\u0027t covered by my health\ninsurance. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why should you help me? Because I\nhave a lot of really great artistic knowledge to share, and you will\nhave access to  coloring pages, tutorials, images of my work, and\ninsight into my artistic process.

I have a background in teaching\neverything from felting to glass blowing. I am working to produce\ntutorials, both in video form and as written instructions with\npictures, on many of my arts. I have also already spoken to several\nother artist about doing guest tutorials, including my father who\nwill be showing jewelry techniques such as filigree and granulation. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI plan tutorials and videos on subjects\nsuch as:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-how to color, mount, and frame your\ncoloring sheets as a piece of art on your wall\u003cbr\u003e\n-beginning glass blowing techniques and\ntechniques specific to medieval glass blowing\u003cbr\u003e\n-felting projects and techniques, both\nneedle felting and wet felting\u003cbr\u003e\n-block printing\u003cbr\u003e\n-collage and design\u003cbr\u003e\n-reviews of products and techniques\u003cbr\u003e\n-metal work: soldering, granulation,\ncasting, enameling\u003cbr\u003e\n-simple wiring and lighting for art and\ncosplay \n\u003cbr\u003e\n-medieval arts such as: viking era\nposements (the woven/knotted wire viking era decoration) embroidery\ntechniques, clothing construction (like for my gathered viking\nover-dress)\u003cbr\u003e\n-guest tutorials by people I know who\ndo really cool things\u003cbr\u003e"
