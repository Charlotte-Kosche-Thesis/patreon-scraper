    "summary": "Hey, before you read any more I would like to just say that I DO NOT NEED THE MONEY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Me:\u003cbr\u003eMy\n name is Ryan Murphy and I\u0027m studying to become an electrical engineer. I\n really enjoy making and playing music with many different instruments. \n After seeing videos of different song played on floppy disks many years ago, It \nwas always my dream to have my very own floppy disk orchestra.  Some \ntime around December 2015,  my school was throwing away a bunch of old \ncomputers and I was able to obtain 16 floppy disks and 2 power \nsupplies.  My set up has 12 floppy disks drives and is being powered by a single ATX power supply. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the link to my channel that already has videos of many different songs\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYySwd3a_8KQHTHUjczeOnw/featured\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYySwd3a_8KQHTHUjczeOnw/featured\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI upload videos almost daily if not \nweekly depending on how much free time I have.  Depending on how \ndifficult the song is to prepare and to play on the floppy disks, a video can\n take me anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours to edit the midi file, test\n and record the song on the floppy disks, record the video, editing \neverything together and then publishing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always trying to improve the quality of my videos however I will need your support to get better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith anyone\u0027s support I will be able to obtain some of following items that will help me produce better content:\u003cbr\u003e-Sound proofing foam \u003cbr\u003e-A better camera for recording video (currently using a small digital camera for video)\u003cbr\u003e-Better editing software (you can only do so much with Movie Maker)\u003cbr\u003e-Better lighting\u003cbr\u003e- maybe in time, a much better mic to pick up even more clearer sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank\n you so much for taking the time and reading all of this. I enjoy making\n content and I hope you like everything I end up recording. Please go \nconsider supporting other people before supporting me. There are many \nother people who need the support than I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for reading and have a wonderful day."
