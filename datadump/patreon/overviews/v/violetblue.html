I\u0027m bootstrapping a weekly cybersecurity news roundup that\u0027s free for all to read, and it\u0027s an enormous amount of work. (Work that I love doing.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also researching and writing a book about growing up in San Francisco and Silicon Valley as the child of a female Stanford engineer who became a high-volume drug dealer (and addict) -- that\u0027s my birth mother, who I discovered lied to me about who my real father is.\u00a0I don\u0027t only want to tell my mother\u0027s story, or mine, but also the stories of the little kids I was on the streets with, and the place they occupy in San Francisco\u0027s rich history.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope this project raises awareness for homeless youth and creates compassion for their experiences. That\u0027s my mission. And that I also hope this can bring me closure -- even though I\u0027m fully aware that there will always be a ton of unanswered questions for me. Especially after the private investigators explained to me that my mother\u0027s history was ostensibly scrubbed by the feds when she adopted her last known alias. I\u0027m still hopeful though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read about my experience starting this project and contacting the SFPD\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/dear-patrons-14632717\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m funding this book through Patreon, rather than a Kickstarter, so my patrons can participate closely in the process with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePosts about this book are private posts for patrons at the $25 level (and up). These patrons are experiencing the process with me as it happens, are reading the first draft as it\u0027s being written in serial form, and will get a copy of the book (and more).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis gets me closer to sustainability while I tackle the manuscript, and should help screen out the looky-loos a little bit. It establishes a relationship balanced on cash and access that\u0027s meaningful to me. At this level, every two weeks you\u0027ll get an update (one that is also sent to your inbox when I publish). You can give me feedback, ask questions, and comment privately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a patron. If you follow my work, you see how hard I fight for at-risk populations to have a voice in their own conversations.

I work at industry rates (which aren\u0027t great), I constantly have to chase down people who take months to pay invoices for my writing, and I was homeless as a kid, so I\u0027m out here on the financial edge of things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no secret that I\u0027m having tough times financially, and so is almost every writer I know. The book industry is suffering and everyone who isn\u0027t lucky to have mainstream book industry privilege and access -- which gets you favored by algorithms -- is seeing sales on a hellish, slow decline. The journalism industry is incredibly lean (I know you see me hustling for writing gigs all the time -- hire me!). It blows my mind that even with all I\u0027ve accomplished, I\u0027m still struggling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnything -- even from $1/month up -- is hugely helpful.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far and don\u0027t feel like contributing, that\u0027s okay.

     "description": "If I were to pick one being in the world that was the most important to me, it would be my three-year-old Bengal cat Max. He is my 24/7 support system. Max was found as a baby kitty living rough with his siblings in a feral litter. These days he enjoys cat puzzles, barking at hummingbirds, cuddling in the mornings, and playing fetch. He has many friends. This patron amount covers the cost of his food and kitty litter for one month. Patronage at this level makes you the noblest kind of human, and guarantees your seat on the mothership when they rescue us from this planet.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou also get access to my private posts.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e",
