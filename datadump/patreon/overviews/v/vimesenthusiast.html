However since then above and beyond Real Life (or as I term it RL) changing, three things have changed: \u003cbr\u003e1. The story has evolved well past what I had thought it would be.\u00a0 This has impacted the amount of time needed to research and plan out chapters.\u00a0 the space-based side of things in particular is mostly all me, since there is nothing in canon marvel to go by for the various alien ships/military units outside of their special forces.\u003cbr\u003e2.\u00a0 The number of characters has increased.\u00a0 This impacts again the amount of time needed to plan out chapters so each characters gets enough screen time.\u003cbr\u003e3.\u00a0 My muse has somewhat moved on.\u00a0 While there are still elements of the story which I am enthusiastic about, there are others that simply cannot win against the muse which is primarily driving my writing these days, which is my \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eStar Wars muse\u003c/span\u003e.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eI am afraid that I have already seen the quality of my chapters degrading because of these three issues.\u00a0 Certainly I know that the amount of screen time certain characters get have fallen over the past few chapters. \u003cbr\u003eBecause of this, I just cannot see meeting the original goal, that of updating A Third Path every month. If this changes, the muse for marvel coming back and overpowering the muse for Star Wars, I will make an announcement about that of course, but this is the way my mind is working now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e To make up for this, I posted a new, albeit higher goal: bi-monthly, that is twice every month, I will post small omakes here from my current stories.\u00a0 These will be chosen randomly by me (and my muse, the random bitch), though I will of course watch and see the reactions my omakes get and take that into account.\u00a0 I will also strive to post tiny chapter starters, that is tiny 5,000 word story starters chosen from the story concepts I have shared here on patreon.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, depending on the reception these smaller works get her on patron I would be willing to come back to the question of A Third Path.\u00a0 by this I mean I might be open to creating a new goal to see if I will take A Third Path on a every other month basis.\u00a0 The amount of research and planning necessary at this point just would be impossible in a single month, but every other month might be doable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading,.\u00a0 Again I apologize for the change to my goals, and thank you all for understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
