I got lost in fantasy worlds time and time and time again, but there was always something that left me unsatisfied. There was no one in my favourite books that was like me. I am a demisexual panromantic cis female, marrying a transgender, lesbian woman, and it took me a long time to come to terms with that. There are plenty of books about discovering identities and realizing who you are, but once I had reached that point, there was nothing. LGBTQ+ people where either struggling with themselves or they didn\u0027t exist. I\u0027ve always wanted to rectify that in my own work. No one can deny the lack of representation in YA media of any LGBTQ+ characters in popular series, the gender spectrum being one of the least represented of them all. Gender is still a misunderstood and taboo subject, very rarely touched upon unless in transgender specific novels. I hope to do something about this with my novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I am writing\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am\u00a0aiming to write a full length fantasy novel of around 80,000 words. 20,000 are already down on paper and I have the next 40,000(ish) planned and ready to write. I hope to be updating once a month, but as I work full time and struggle with some mental health issues, I\u0027m unable to commit to that schedule. I\u0027ll be charging based on each chapter for roughly one chapter per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAn ancient evil has reared it\u2019s head and thrown the once peaceful world of dragons into all out war. Most important in their geography is a city known as Kiesset, the site of the battle where evil had been laid to rest, which has been the home of humans for thousands and thousands of years. Thinking it the lesser of two evils, a dragon named Kalinth gives the order to destroy the city in the hopes of chasing the humans out and avoiding a greater number of casualties.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKiesset is home to a diverse range of people, from the ruling Elysiums in their tower, to the little girl living on the streets with her guardian. The attack on their town forces survivors to escape together, travelling many miles to find a safe place to settle. But when this safe place turns out to be less safe than it seemed, a group of friends decide to make their way back to their home, no matter the dangers. There\u2019s simply no place like home.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA novel about friendship in the face of disaster, and finding your home where you least expect it\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe prologue can be found here -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://valencekiller.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/the-lost-and-brave-prologue/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://valencekiller.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/the...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first chapter can be found here -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://valencekiller.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/the-lost-and-brave-chapter-one/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://valencekiller.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/the...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat backers will get\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEach month, a chapter will be released exclusively to patreon backers, on top of original plans, sketches of maps and monthly updates on the novel as a whole.
