With a\nside order of whimsical words?\u003cbr\u003e\nThat I can do, my\nfriend, that I can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve been a writer and general cluster of creative energy all my life and am proud to have a made it into a\nfull time career.\u003c/strong\u003e I am mostly known for my spoken word poetry, which\nI have been privileged enough to take to places like Glastonbury\nFestival, New York, Bangladesh, Sweden, Germany, Vienna and Belgium.\nI have had my work featured on\nBBC Woman\u0027s Hour, The Guardian, Blue Peter, Sky TV\nand TEDx. My first collection \u0027Joyriding The Storm\u0027 came out in 2014\nand I have another book coming out this year! I am also working on a\none woman show called \u0027SEXY\u0027 which is a comedic, theatrical, dance-y\none woman show deconstructing what the hell that word even means. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s\na video of me in action at the Roundhouse Slam in 2014 (which I\nwon!): \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xktP2ksYEXY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0027s\naddress the elephant in the room. \u003cstrong\u003eWho the fuck am I and why do I\ndeserve your hard earned coinage?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEXCELLENT\nQUESTION. Ten points for you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this\nworld where it\u0027s a (supposed) given that we all get compensation for\nour labour, us artists often get mugged off. We work hard to create\nthings that are engaging and worthwhile to our consumers and yet we\nare frequently asked to work for pittance or even for free. \u003cstrong\u003eI believe\nthat art makes our world a more bearable, fun and beautiful place\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013\nI hope you believe in its worth, too. It just so happens that in the\ncapitalist system we live in, \u003cstrong\u003ewe measure worth in cold hard\nmoolah\u003c/strong\u003e. By donating to this Patreon you are saying: \u0027Hey Vanessa \u2013\nI like what you do! I\u0027d like to support you in doing it regularly and\nwell.\u0027 I don\u0027t take that lightly and I\u0027d be so honoured and humbled to have your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve done\nsome pretty bonkers things in the name of my pushing myself\nartistically, especially in the past two years. That has included\ndoing\u003cstrong\u003e a rap battle for Don\u0027t Flop\u003c/strong\u003e as Shonda Rhymez which is every bit\nas terrifying as it sounds \u2013 check it out here:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/diIgiSlpV_k\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get down to my bra\nand pants for my latest show, I talk about \u003cstrong\u003eshaving my arsehole \u003c/strong\u003ein one of my latest poems\u00a0and in the latest endeavour, I\u0027m throwing myself into \u003cstrong\u003eburlesque\nperformance \u003c/strong\u003eunder the name Nina Nunchucks! This is an exciting time\nin my artistic development in which I want to push myself and my\naudience/readers further. I hope you\u0027re as excited at the prospect of\nfollowing my journey as I am to embark on it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis sponsorship will\nhopefully provide a steady trickle (gush? TSUNAMI?) of income that\nwill ease the stress of wondering if I can afford my rent each month.\nI aim to draw attention to political issues in my work, but mostly\u003cstrong\u003e I\nbelieve in the power of stories to entertain, educate and empower us\nto be the most compassionate versions of ourselve\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003es\u003c/strong\u003e.
