     "about": "We have been traveling nationally for the last 3 years playing mostly at festivals and outdoor events. Our music has been codified to the genre \u201c Eurasian Prog \u201c which is Eastern European and Gypsy music with a modern Folk/Rock intensity that is at the core just fun, groovy, dance music.\u003cbr\u003eVaNa MaZi was born out of an interest in culture and a love for the music of the People. With a song bank collected through years of travel, We fuse together the music of Greece, Italy, Central Asia, and the Balkans with electronic inspired beats, and a pinch of our own American heritage. We perform, arrange, and compose music that invites the listener to open their ears and experience something new, something ancient, something contradictory even, yet something that is most definitely moving forward through space at a speed that cannot be measured only in 4/4 time. \u003cbr\u003eWe are interested in participating in more sustainable music projects including outdoor festivals that have an emphasis on social and ecological awareness.\u003cbr\u003e",
