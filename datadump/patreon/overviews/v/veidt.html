You may have seen some of the alt cosplay superheroine stuff i \u003cdel\u003edo\u003c/del\u003e did for an adult audience at the late, great site \u003ca href=\"http://www.veidt.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eveidt.com\u003c/a\u003e. Some of it quite half-assed, some of it more ambitious, but all of it has been a joy to work on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/unaP9QH.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo i\u0027m here to beg for money to keep making all-new nonsense. I\u0027d love to continue evolving, and doing increasingly more ambitious stuff. Have a sketchbook full of designs, several new costumes approaching completion, a short film still in progress, and all kinds of plans and aspirations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s $4. For which you can expect at least 7 alt cosplay pic sets of 30+ big images (most are 4000x6000 pixels), each month...plus occasional gifs and bonus stuff. If you\u0027re at all into this shit, i think we over-deliver. kthanksgodblessbye\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
