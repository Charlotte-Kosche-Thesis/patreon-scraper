We are deeply grateful for any contribution you can make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might be wondering why we do not have pledge levels. Here\u0027s why:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI devote all of my spare time to writing, recording, editing, and distributing the podcast. Stickers and loot will come someday, but right now all of my love goes into making the best show we can make.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe idea of \"bonus content\" (where we give you outtakes and crap that didn\u0027t make it into the show) doesn\u0027t feel right. We want everyone to get our best. If it was cut, there\u0027s a reason.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0At this time we\u0027re just trying to make something awesome for people to enjoy. There\u0027s no need to hustle you for more cash since all we need to do is cover costs to keep going. Donate whatever you\u0027re comfortable with - no pressure!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the way - I really do want to get started on some stickers, pogs, shirts, and other merch. Patrons will get first dibs on these things when we get there. We\u0027ll need a little bigger audience before that gets started though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd why are we monthly instead of per-creation? This is partially to save everyone fees. Mostly it is because as long as the show is running, we will ALWAYS put out a new one hour episode every Sunday. Everything is recorded and edited and polished weeks in advance. We were doing this when we had no patrons, and we\u0027ll keep doing it after we have all the patrons.\u003cbr\u003e"
