    "summary": "Why does everyone always trash talk Mondays? Why did Monday get saddled with the unfortunate duty of representing the start of the traditional work/school week? That\u0027s not Monday\u0027s fault!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow just imagine Monday popping up in your cubicle one day...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The Monday Apologies\" is a flash fiction series that centers around a young woman named Hannah who is stuck in a boring job without any direction in life. Hannah cannot seem to understand why Mondays seem so dour and lonely, uninspired and inescapable. Until, that is, Monday decides that it\u0027s had enough of this bad mouthing and appears in Hannah\u0027s life to set her straight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, dear readers, for coming along on Hannah\u0027s journey of getting her shit together! This series is so close to my heart because in many ways, I myself am Hannah. This girl, this young woman, is very reminiscent of me as a morbidly confused sort of adult transitioning into the big scary world of having to figure out my own path in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGranted, this was not that long ago (I\u0027m 24 now), but I figure this is a pretty cozy spot to look back on those gross yet utterly necessary times without losing a sense of immediacy and the sting of constant self-doubt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut my friend Hannah is very much her own interesting (in my opinion and hopefully yours as well) personality. It\u0027s my guess that there are plenty of folks out there who would find a kindred spirit in our brave heroine. And besides, who wouldn\u0027t want to hang out with their own snarky Monday companion to help them get through life?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m here, writing this series and sharing it with my wonderful patrons, in the hopes that if you\u0027re in the same large, wobbly boat, you won\u0027t feel so alone and be able to fish out some tidbits of inspiration. Or perhaps you\u0027re looking for entertainment mixed with gooey emotions and groovy characters. You\u0027ll find that here too. Whatever floats your boat (and clearly I am into boats at the moment).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, I truly hope that you enjoy this series and I cannot thank you enough for your generous support and encouragement! Hannah and Monday appreciate it too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
