Of course, you can cancel your monthly payments at any time.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no income, so my priority is to raise enough for my living expenses. That works out at around 200 euro a month and covers the cost of not only my essentials but that of my animals as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to this I have specific needs for the vardo ( a small solar panel to keep my laptop charged) and a few other items.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there is the rebuild, although I have the mateials from the winter build that I am living in now, there will be a few other items that I will incoroporate into the final running vardo, this includes replacing the existing wheels. I will be making a comprehensive list of essential items.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, I need my horsepower, literally, or, it might be an ox...it\u0027s all well and good having a horse drawn caravan, but you won\u0027t get far if you don\u0027t have something to pull it. So, I am looking for a suitable animal at present, of course, finding the animal is only half of the story, I need to be able to buy it and get it back to my camp.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, I\u2019m Sold. But What\u2019s in It for Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be blogging and uploading videos on the progress of the rebuild, plus a variety of videos on crafts, in addition, once I start travelling then there will be the ongoing story of the journey, the places that I go to, the people that I meet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully, I will also be able to have monthly live chats with you, sharing stories and listening to suggestions and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow Often Should I Expect New Videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to produce a video a week, this will be a \u0027what\u0027s new in Vardoland\u0027 in addition I hope to be able to upload a craft video every other week, covering a variety of topics, such as weaving, metalwork, things like that, and, showing that you don\u0027t need to buy expensive tools and equipment ( well, they didn\u0027t in the early days, did they?)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, as I said, I hope to be able to do a once a month live chat.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
