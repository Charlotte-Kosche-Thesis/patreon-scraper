    "summary": "I created the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eVoices of Veterinary Medicine Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e to give you a broader\u00a0perspective on the field of veterinary medicine so you can proactively steer your career. Most of us enter this field with little idea of the realities of clinical practice, nor of the incredible breadth of other opportunities available to those with a DVM degree. Break free from the preconceived notions of what it means to be a veterinarian. Benefit from the experiences and wisdom of others by listening to in-depth, candid conversations that include personal stories, struggles and triumphs of a variety of people doing all sorts of different things in veterinary medicine. Episodes range from 60-120 minutes and are published every Saturday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to empower you with practical knowledge so you can create a future for yourself in veterinary medicine that is compatible with your personality, dreams and desires. I want to embolden you to never settle for anything that doesn\u0027t bring you joy and fulfillment. But I need your help. Each episode requires between 6 to 12 hours of work, from coordinating with guests to recording to editing and finally to publishing. There are monthly charges associated with web-hosting, server space and production costs. Please consider becoming a Patreon Supporter. For just a few dollars a month you can help me continue doing what I\u0027m doing, plus you\u0027ll become an intimate member of my podcast audience, and get access to all the valuable bonus material I make available to Patreon supporters only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore resources for future veterinarians are available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.realize.vet\"\u003ewww.realize.vet\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

My mission is to help future veterinary doctors become the best, the happiest and the most fulfilled veterinarians they can be. I want to help stem the tide of burnout, depression and suicide in this profession. Instead, I want to see the field of veterinary medicine brimming over with empowered and successful veterinarians. In order for that to happen though, future vets need honest information and advice so they can proactively steer their future careers.
