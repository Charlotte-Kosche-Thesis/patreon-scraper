If not, allow us to introduce ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Caffeine Rage and Gaming Psychologist. Two friends who love to sit and talk about video games. We produce (mostly) long form podcasts where we discuss a variety of gaming related topics each week. We pull from the news when interesting things happen, and we have a huge list of topics we want to talk about on our own. Our intent is to provide a deep level of discussion and insight to these topics, along with a healthy helping of digression and comedy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth of us worked in the gaming industry as reviewers for several years, and both of us have youtube channels where we continue our gaming careers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe record Tuesday Nights and love when our audience participates by sending in text and audio letters. The podcast releases each week on Fridays at Noon Eastern Standard Time on itunes and on each of our youtube channels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, just in case you are wondering, the Gaming Psychologist is a real Therapist. He obtained his Masters degree in 2015 in Marriage and Family Therapy, and is practicing psychotherapy under a provisional license until his required hours are met to obtain a full licensure in 2017."
