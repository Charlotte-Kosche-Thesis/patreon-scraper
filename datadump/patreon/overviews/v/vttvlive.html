    "summary": "Hello folks. Thanks for taking a minute to check out our Patreon page. We love games and we want to share that passion through livestreams and recorded videos of competitive and casual play for our favourite games. At the moment, that largely means games that are part of Fantasy Flight Games\u0027 Organized Play program.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you\u0027re a fan of X-Wing, Legend of the Five Rings, Star Wars: Armada or any of FFG\u0027s other games, we\u0027ve probably filmed some events you have enjoyed over the past couple years. And we are so fortunate to have fans like you that would consider supporting our efforts to produce more and better content every month.\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center; color: #F06B58; margin: 20px 0px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003eWe know that filming niche hobby games isn\u0027t the kind of thing that one expects a high return from. But, in addition to the many hours we have both invested into filming and producing videos, we have both sunk thousands of dollars into equipment and software licensing costs. After enough people asked how they can support us, we decided that Patreon was the least obtrusive way to help us offset our on-going costs - and maybe even give us the chance to upgrade some of our equipment.\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center; color: #F06B58; margin: 20px 0px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nWe are going to be creating the same types of videos as we always have.  We aren\u0027t creating different reward tiers.  This is simply an opportunity for fans who wanted a way to support our work to do so.  The only perk that our patrons will receive is the ability to access our livestreams after events have ended.  If you missed an event and want to watch it before we\u0027ve finished cutting the individual matches, we\u0027ll post them here exclusively for patrons. We\u0027ll also include a special thank you to our patrons in our videos. I know it\u0027s not much, but we wanted to make sure that all of our time continues to go into producing videos rather than fulfilling rewards.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
