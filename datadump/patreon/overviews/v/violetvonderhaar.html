    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, thanks for stopping by. :-) Welcome to my Patreon page!\u00a0Before we get into specifics of what the heck this Patreon thing is, I\u0027d like to give you some background info of myself as a musician and artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI consider myself VERY lucky to be able to live a life full of creativity through my music and art.\u00a0My musical journey, like most songwriters, began at a VERY young age. I began singing and making up tunes from the moment I could speak. I remember clearly carrying around song books long before I could read, pretending to be \u201creading\u201d the music, however, I was really just making up my own songs. You can hear a snippet of what that sounded like on a track from \u003ca href=\"https://violetvonderhaar.bandcamp.com/track/another-shade\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy first album here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe moment I truly remember everything changing for me, and knowing deep in my heart that I wanted to live a life of music and on the stage, was in 4th grade. I was cast as \u201cLoretta Poinsettia\u201d in the school Christmas Musical, and sang my first solo, Blue Christmas. I was 9 years old when I got my first gig at the annual Earth Day celebration in Columbia, MO. I remember singing my audition in our old cassette recorder (one of my audition songs was \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d  by Woody Guthrie). I asked Lee Ruth, a Columbia, MO folk music legend,  to accompany me on guitar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter that performance, I decided to learn guitar. I went on to take lessons from Lee Ruth from the age 9 until 17. I remember the moment I wrote my first song with my guitar, at age 12. Like most of my songs, I remember the time and place I was when I wrote it and what it felt like sharing with someone else for the first time. My father was usually one of the first people to hear my songs, before they were shared with others. Still to this day, especially as a music teacher, I recognize and am so grateful to have had a person to share my songs with and receive constructive criticism for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e....and THIS is where YOU come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write A LOT of songs (at least 1-3 songs per month) and a lot of those songs never get heard by an audience, as there\u0027s only so many tunes you can fit into a live performance, or they just don\u0027t make the cut for one of my many music projects:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.violetandtheundercurrents.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eViolet and the Undercurrents\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/overtonlanding\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOverton Landing\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/zoryaband\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eZorya\u003c/a\u003e. As soon as I finish writing a song, I want to share it with someone, just like I did when I was a kid when I\u0027d run to play my new song for my dad. But this time, I get to run to YOU and hear YOUR feedback. (Don\u0027t worry dad, I\u0027ll still send you iPhone recordings of new tunes) I want to share with you all the songs I write, the raw, honest, silly, and sad baby songs when they are first born. I want your criticism, your thoughts, your suggestions on these songs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from songwriting, I often find myself inspired by videography, graphic design, photography, screen printing, painting, collaging, etc. I design all my websites, posters, t-shirts, CD layouts, etc. I love becoming immersed in these projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s one of my favorite video projects I designed a few years ago for Violet and the Undercurrents:\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8doX0B4vvVA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron for my music, you get to hear the songs FIRST, in their raw, unedited beauty. \u00a0Before they grow into full grown songs with whatever band I end up passing them on to. You\u0027ll get to see the videos FIRST, before they become public on YouTube.\u00a0Most of these projects will not be exclusive to Patreon, but they will appear HERE first. Which means YOU get to be the first person to hear/see them and you\u0027ll get to know the back story, the process, and the inspiration behind them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you need to do?\u003c/strong\u003e Choose an amount you would like to give per each creative project (song, video, etc.). This can be as little as 1.00 per project. There is an option to set a monthly cap, so on those extra inspired months that I write 3-5 songs, you won\u0027t go over your budget. Think of your contribution as a tip, if you will. If you like what I create and want to support it and encourage me to keep going and creating more things that move you, this is the perfect place to do it. Contributions are collected at the end of each month, so you will only get one charge per month. Your contribution will help me to continue living a life of creativity and not have to carry that weight of money stress as heavily.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt whatever amount you give, it is truly appreciated. Which is why at most levels, you will receive the same \"rewards\" and even if you choose to not be a Patron, but still support my music by coming to my shows, buying merchandise, giving me feedback at shows, you ARE appreciated. Thank YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love and appreciation,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eViolet Vonder Haar\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

The Mid-Missourian has followed her internal muse and metronome, fronting rock bands, acoustic trios and sculpting solo records. But for Vonder Haar, plenty need not be the enemy of beauty. The more music she makes \u2014 and the more she allows it to be shaped by her creative cohort \u2014 the better it seems to get.\u201d \u2013 Aarik Danielsen, Columbia Daily Tribune\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eViolet Vonder Haar believes in music. She was born on the banks of Splice Creek nestled in the river hills near the tiny Missouri River town of Lupus, MO (pop. 29). Nurtured in the thriving folk community of Central Missouri, she has been performing for area audiences since she was tall enough to reach a mic. As a child, she was inspired to influence people to environmental causes through song, and over the years she has lent her voice to churches, benefits, peace rallies and any venue to make a better world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eViolet released her debut album \u201cShades Of Violet\u201d at the age of 16, a 17 track album of all original songs. In 2009 she was voted \u201cBest Female Solo Musician\u201d by Inside Columbia Magazine. She released a three track EP of whimsical audience favorites called \u201cV-Sides and Rarities\u201d in February 2011 which helped fund her newest full length album, \u201cThe Way Home\u201d. Most recently she has released in a six track EP called \u201cGood Morning. I Love You.\u201d that was recorded, mixed and produced at the Holey Acres Studio by herself and her music partner, Phylshawn Johnson.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eViolet manages three successful mid-Missouri bands, Violet and the Undercurrents, Overton Landing and Zorya. Violet and the Undercurrents successfully completed a Kickstarter campaign, created to help fund a month long tour set for Spring of 2014. They released their first full length album, Hour After Hour in July of 2013, followed by WAVES in April of 2014. Other notable recognition includes being nominated for Inside Columbia\u2019s 2015 Best Band and approved for an official \u201cViolet and the Undercurrents\u201d Pandora Station.\u00a0Zorya released their first full length and self titled album in February 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
