    "summary": "Hi everyone! My name is Hyojeong Shim, and I also go by the name Vicky. I am a Youtuber based in Seoul, South Korea. Right now I\u0027m in China, having a very different adventure every day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also in the middle of writing a book based on the idea that one day came to my head like a spark during my stay in China. It is difficult to tell you every little detail about the book, but it mainly deals with the gender issues. My hope and expectation is that this book serves as a catalyst, inspiration and guideline for people to be aware and learn about gender issues, not based on political correctness, but based on biological, scientific and humane (and possibly spiritual) perspective. That way, I believe we can have deeper understanding about two sexes that nobody taught us and be able to communicate and interact with each other better, and ultimately create a happier society where people are appreciated and treated as they are regardless of gender, race, age, look or any \"labels.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined Patreon to ask for help and support to people who agree with my hope, purpose and expectation, or to kindhearted people out there who just enjoy helping others. I know that writing a book is one thing and publishing, promoting, and so on are totally different process that requires so much more (including financial resources), so I decided I should not overestimate my ability and could use a little help. It doesn\u0027t need to be a huge sum of money, I would even appreciate a few dollars and think of it as your generosity for treating me a cup of coffee or tea. I drink coffee and tea every day, because I feel like it somehow helps me clear out mental distraction and become more focused. Your small gift would go a long way helping me write a better book, so please don\u0027t worry about how much or little you can give. I would appreciate any amount of donation and consider it a precious gift.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this. You can come check out my Youtube Channel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/vickyvicky\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/vickyvicky\u003c/a\u003e and hope that my videos make you have a happier day and feel good about yourself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me know if you have any other questions regarding my book or being a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003eVicky\u003cbr\u003e"
