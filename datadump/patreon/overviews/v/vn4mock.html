    "summary": "This is Mock, and you are you. Hopefully. I\u0027m glad you stopped by to have a listen. Below you\u0027ll find a little more information on my clan, my stream, and myself. As time goes on I plan to add more, so check back periodically.\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/9CRsNBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/iybQqx/VN4.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nSince the late summer of 2016, I and my closest friends have been working hard at building up our respective Twitch streams as well as a Discord community that we can be proud of - the clan of \n\u003cstrong\u003eVenture Forth\u003c/strong\u003e. Along the way we\u0027ve met some fantastic comrades and experienced our shares of success and setback, while always trying to stay true to who we are. Although we battle every day to embrace our respective dreams, each one of us has the burning desire to journey on. And we do, as best as we know how.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027d like to visit our Discord for a while, just click on the Venture Forth graphic above.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/vn4mock\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/kGiS3H/Nightwatch.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nThe \n\u003cstrong\u003eNightwatch\u003c/strong\u003e - my Twitch channel - is primarily a Final Fantasy 14 focused stream and has been that way since day one. My niche is in mentoring and lessons on all variety of topics within game, which has allowed me to start my growth as a livestreamer in the first place. And because I\u0027ve experienced each and every feature of the game\u0027s massive catalog of content, there\u0027s no end to the goals I\u0027ve been able to set for myself and those willing to journey with me. Although other FFXIV streamers have come and gone as the patches have too, it\u0027s this mentor focus that will likely anchor me for years to come; that is, until a game that captivates me more than FFXIV emerges\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn a larger sense, on my stream there has always been the need to progress. As gamers. As friends. And as people. It\u0027s not always about the silly jokes, or the unrealistic challenges, or the communal playlist, but about what we can do for one another in the short time that we have. To those who choose to follow me, in a virtual space where millions of people are endlessly searching and competing for either acceptance or fame, I owe everything. More than false promises and false smiles. And more than a hugbox where we\u0027re afraid to speak up. My followers are my world, and it\u0027s their stories, their lessons, and their choice to return each night that allows me to continue finding my way. As the support grows, the number of hours I can devote to my community grows in turn. For something like that, there are no words but words of thanks. And one day soon, I\u0027d like this to be something I can call a career.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo matter what awaits us in the dark, my wish is that we can continue. So if you\u0027d like to join me, just click on the Nightwatch graphic above.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/md1Qqx/Mock.png\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nSince the beginning of all things Mock, my followers have pieced together things from random conversations and monologues, but I don\u0027t mind revealing a little of my backstory for those who would like to know. Granted, I\u0027m not an expert at discussing myself, so...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWhen the sun rises, I go on existing. My formal education is in English Literature and Creative Writing during my university years, which has made me somewhat useless to modern society. My humble career consists of various small contracts and seasonal positions doing phone work and marketing research, which I fit between my VN4 community duties as best as I can manage. I have too many hobbies for my own good, including staring at my navel, writing (both prose and poetry), film study, graphic design, low-quality ASMR recordings, things that would make otaku blush, and games that don\u0027t include Final Fantasy XIV (though that last one is untrue). I\u0027m notoriously immaterial, obsessively abstract, and somewhat of an awkward mess off-camera. I don\u0027t think my eyes quite work right, I sometimes start thinking so hard that I forget to sleep, and often daydream about artificial intelligence and space exploration and artificial space intelligence exploration. Fall is my favorite season, because as a Canadian you\u0027ll get a lethal injection if it isn\u0027t, and my local time is just about 8:00 A.M. You might find that sometimes my diction starts to get out of control, but there\u0027s really no proof of that; it\u0027s a side-effect of some intangible quality known as \"just being weird\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis all being said, I would be honoured if you\u0027d get to know me a little better through Venture Forth and my Nightwatch, and also get to know the other Hosts of our clan, through the links I posted above. It\u0027s appreciated that you\u0027ve read this far.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo until next we meet,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n~ Mock\n\u003cbr\u003e"
