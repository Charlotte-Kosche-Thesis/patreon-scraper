    "summary": "Hi. So you\u0027ve made it this far, huh? Wow, my shameless self promotion must have finally worked... Awesome, now you\u0027re here, \u003cstrong\u003eI need your help.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give you a little context, I started Viewfinder as a way to make educational films, after I dropped out of University due to having no money (a problem I\u0027m sure a lot of you can relate to). The video essays aim to analyse films, music, comic books and other cool stuff like that.\u00a0I find\u00a0a lot of joy in making these videos, which is why I wish I could do it full time. But, still with not very much money, the videos will continue to be created as a hobby, on the side of my day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I need your help. To make more video essays at a higher quality, and to release them at a faster rate, your support is everything. From as little as $1 per video, you can help me to buy better equipment, such as Final Cut Pro, new mics and more, which will increase the quality of these videos tenfold. There will typically be \u003cstrong\u003eno more than 1-2 videos per month\u003c/strong\u003e, I don\u0027t want to bankrupt anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s why I made this Patreon page. I genuinely love to make these video essays, and I\u0027ll do my absolute best to provide you with quality videos, and much more for those of you who decide to take a chance on this channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, feel free to take a look at each of the Tiers of support, to see which one suits your liking. And thanks for the time it took you to read this, it\u0027s time you\u0027ll never get back (sorry), but it\u0027s time that can make a difference.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThank you.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBobby K\u003cbr\u003e"
