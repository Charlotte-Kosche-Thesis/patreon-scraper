I hadn\u0027t the patience to wait until it was a finished work. I believed I could fly under the radar with no one noticing my presence as I got to grips with web-building and content creation. While beavering away on my keyboard from a tiny backroom in my house, sometimes wrapped up in jumpers and scarves to keep warm, I was oblivious to the visitors who were dropping by to read my content. I was only finding my way around WordPress at that stage and had put the STATS Page on the \u0027it can wait till later\u0027 list as the writing was taking up all my time.

An experienced Tarot Consultant, I have used Tarot as an invaluable guidance, counselling and self-empowerment tool. In 2006 after been approached to teach Tarot, I began to write a Tarot Course based on my then ten years of experience, both as a Student and Reader. I called it \u003cstrong\u003eTruly Teach Me Tarot\u003c/strong\u003e which more recently has been abbreviated to \u003cstrong\u003eTeach Me Tarot.\u003c/strong\u003e The aim in writing this course was to pass on all my accumulated knowledge of Tarot to those who were interested in becoming, like I had before them, an Apprentice to this Ancient Discipline. I went on to successfully teach this course, both in a class environment and on a one-to-one private basis. Many of my Students have gone on to become Professional Tarot Readers, some now even teaching Tarot themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 after two years of severe health problems I was forced to withdrawn from certain aspects of my work. Frustrated with my situation, I turned to writing as a means to being productive. In a fit of madness, I decided to rewrite my complete tarot reading course and make it suitable for on-line study. Since then I have been painstakingly revisiting every Lesson and every Tarot Card, both Upright and Reversed, with the view to passing on as much information and detail to the Willing and Serious Tarot Student. To date, Teach Me Tarot contains over 300 pages and continues to develop and grow. My work has attracted over 7 million views since 2012 with a daily viewing audience of approximately 8,000 from over 200 countries. The course content is \u003cstrong\u003eFree To View\u003c/strong\u003e at present and hopefully I can keep it Free. \u003cstrong\u003eTeach Me Tarot\u003c/strong\u003e is a work in progress, a work I believe will never truly be complete for Tarot is forever changing and developing as the world and humans around it do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust like \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Colman_Smith\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePamela Colman-Smith \u003c/a\u003eleft behind a wonderful legacy in the imagery of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider-Waite_tarot_deck\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Rider-Waite-Smith Cards\u003c/a\u003e, I too would like to add my own legacy by leaving a\u003cstrong\u003e Tome of Tarot\u003c/strong\u003e information that will long outlive me and my descendants to come.\u00a0However, I do need to keep a roof over my head,\nand pay bills too.

By diving into my imagination through novelistic storytelling of Gallant Knights, Damsels in Distress, Ruthless Villains, Femme Fatales, Seducers, Sorcerers and The Bold, Daring and Courageous, some Readers and Followers have fondly called me \u2018The Florence Welch\u2019 of Tarot Writing. I, a strong fan and admirer of Florence am absolutely thrilled with this comparison, and admit to how much of an influence Florence has been when I sit down to write. Another endless source of inspiration comes from my love of history where I am a devoted fan of novelist Philippa Gregory whose Tudor series is truly addictive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Teach Me Tarot\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://teachmetarot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://teachmetarot.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/truly-teach-me-tarot-course-main-pic-copy.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://teachmetarot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTeach Me Tarot\u003c/a\u003e is written in a style that appeals to all. I seek to demystify much of the more Esoteric Aspects of Tarot by writing in a language that is easy to understand. I try to relate Tarot to normal everyday living, and the personalities we are surrounded by on a daily basis. I approach the Cards from just about every aspect, which provides the student with a choice of several methods to adopt for their particular Style of Reading. No Card stands alone, and for the viewer or Student, the Journey through The Tarot might be compared to reading a novel. I work hard to build my characters and personalities, breathing life into them by placing them on stage, right into the middle of a drama. My audience can\u2019t wait to find out what happens next as the Journey through The Tarot progresses and builds, with each Story or Suit reaching a dramatic climax or conclusion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeach Me Tarot is very different from any other Tarot Course available on-line or in book format.

The History of Tarot, and its Tools of Trade are covered in-depth, along with the various disciplines required for interpretation. Detailed and extensive descriptions are provided for The Suits of Wands, Cups, Swords and Pentacles; the 40 Cards of The Minor Arcana that play such an integral part in all Tarot Readings.  Become familiar with their particular story-lines as the drama unfolds from Card Ace to Ten in each Suit. Get to grips with The Elements that govern each Suit; Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, as they exert both positive and negative influences on the personalities involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Part Two\u003c/strong\u003e, The Four Royal Families of the Court Cards are closely studied along with their corresponding Astrological Signs. Meet the Stars of Tarot; The Pages, Knights, Queens and Kings of each Suit and begin to dissect their various personalities.  Learn how to build profiles based on their archetypal characteristics and traits.  Discover how they are controlled by their governing Element, and how their personalities can be adversely affected when in Reverse.

Once I had a sufficient understanding of\u00a0Tarot I began to read for friends and family members. Before long, I became a Tarot Reader, but as time went on I was drawn towards the area of Tarot Consultancy which offers far more in-depth readings and interpretations. Eventually I was lured into the area of Teaching Tarot\u00a0as Tutors of this complex subject were hard to find. As my students would need some notes to follow, I was obliged to sit down and write about Tarot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, began an incredible journey which has led me to where I am today.

All I had learned over the years, much I thought long forgotten, and more I thought I could possibly know, came pouring out. Not only did I find an outlet for my Tarot Knowledge, I also discovered my joy in story telling. Truly Teach Me Tarot was birthed and I began teaching it in its raw form to small groups of Tarot novices, many of which have gone on to becoming Professional Tarot Readers\u00a0and even a few went on to teach it themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2007, I lost my 11 year old son to cancer and my world fell apart. In the bleak weeks following his death, I retreated into my home and shunned visitors. I moved my office into my son\u0027s room because I did not want the door closed over on it. I sat down at my laptop and began to completely re-write my Truly Teach Me Tarot Course. I would type for up to 8 hours a day, sometimes not even bothering to get dressed or even eat. This time my writing was different. I probed deeper into the cards and wanted to understand more about archetypes and the personality profiles of The Court Cards. I needed to understand about life, and about death too. I signed up to several online courses in Psychology, Hypnosis and even Past Life Regression. In 2008 I flew to the UK to sit exams and became an Advanced\u00a0Past Life Regression Hypnotherapist. Throughout all this time I continued to write about Tarot and the extra insight I was accumulating began to appear in my writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen my own health began to go into decline I was forced to step back from Teaching and doing Tarot Readings for clients. My life was taken over by several surgeries, loss of balance for over a year, and a sudden jaw misalignment. My most recent surgery was in September 2014. I have recently been diagnosed with yet another condition that requires even more surgery. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDistressed about my situation and inability to go out to work, I turned once more to my writing. In 2012, I discovered WordPress and decided that I was going to start a new chapter in my life. I signed up, found my way around the WordPress Dashboard and began to upload Truly Teach Me Tarot.  If I could not go out and meet the World, I was going to bring the World to meet me. Of course as soon as the first few pages went up I was not happy with it and began to re-write every thing, bit by bit all over again.  I allowed my site to go live from day one, but informed any viewers who happened to drop by that Truly Teach Me Tarot was indeed a work in progress and so must be excused  for its haphazard state and incomplete state. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe viewers came anyway and by the time I discovered where my Stats Panel was I was astonished by what I found. Sitting in my son\u0027s small bedroom in dressing gown and slippers as I hammered away on my laptop, I had no idea that I had drawn the attention of people from all over the world. This ignited my enthusiasm and kept me on track. The more I wrote, the more viewers came, and the momentum began to build rapidly. The more I wrote, the more I could write. Week by week my site Truly Teach Me Tarot began to mushroom and take on a life of its own. My writing began to change once more, and as I worked my way through re-writing all the cards, my imagination took over. No longer was I going through the motions of delivering the traditional meanings and keywords for each card, both Upright and Reversed. Instead I began to develop stories around them. The cards came to life. Stories of drama, intrigue, romance, love, loss and survival carried me through each Suit. The scenes depicted by each card had endless tales to tell and I knew that no one had ever written about Tarot in this broad manner before.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of solely conforming to the traditional way of teaching Tarot, I have stepped into a more novel way of communicating the vital information. Yes, my site is very content heavy for each card, but it is not content that has to be memorised and learned off by heart. My content reads more like a short story or novel. I have always advised my students to approach The Four Suits in Tarot as four individual stories, but stories that can overlap with each other to create an even bigger story. It is easier to remember a story than it is to remember a list. The 78 Cards in Tarot, both Upright and Reversed, contain every story that was ever told, every book or song that was ever written, every TV soap opera or series ever broadcast, and every movie ever filmed. The story of each and every one of our lives can also be found in Tarot. All we need to do is look deeply. The stories are all there waiting to be told. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
