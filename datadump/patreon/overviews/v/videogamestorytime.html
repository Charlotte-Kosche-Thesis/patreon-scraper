    "summary": "Once\nupon a time, two people started a YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is BretonStripes, and I do the voice work for the\nchannel, along with other odd jobs. I got my online name last year, when I was\nmaking an account for Pokemon GO. I needed a username, and I love wearing\nBreton striped clothes, so I figured that name would be perfect!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe other half of the team is Kotor, who draws all the\npictures for the channel. He\u2019s had his name for a lot longer, since back when\nhe started posting Knights of the Old Republic fan comics online. You can reach\nus both on Twitter if you want to see what\u2019s going on in our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut there is a third member of the team that needs some\nintroduction as well: our little Boogle, who\u2019s about to turn two years old.\nIt\u2019s because of Boogle that we\u2019re even making these videos. Here\u2019s our story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack before Boogle was born, we both worked normal jobs. I\ncome from a psychology background, and was working in public health, giving\ntrainings on mental health first aid to local communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMeanwhile, Kotor was working in the complaints department\nfor a bank, and was getting more and more stressed every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we found out that I was pregnant with Boogle, we\ndecided we needed a change. My job was coming to an end anyway due to funding\nshortages, so Kotor quit his job, and we moved to a new town to be closer to\nour family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe weren\u2019t sure what we were going to do next, so we started\ndoing some freelance work. I found that I could give occasional trainings to\nbring in some money, while Kotor decided to try and make a living from his art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUltimately, Kotor ended up picking up whatever work he could\nfind, so he found himself transitioning into writing gaming and entertainment\narticles for several websites. He was much happier with this than he was at the\nbank, and it meant that we could spend more time together as a family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem with freelancing, though, is that you can never\ncount on a good source of income. My trainings have pretty much dried up\nlately, and in March, one of the websites that Kotor was writing for shut down\nsuddenly, leaving us with a big gap in our finances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have faith that things will work out in the long run, but\nto keep Video Game Story Time going, we need your help. If you\u2019re willing to donate to us financially, we\u2019re\nstarting a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019re a bit hesitant to do so. We want our focus to be on\nmaking videos, and we don\u2019t want anyone to feel obligated to give us money to\nget our content. That said, even a small donation every month will be enough to\nhelp us to keep making these videos. The more support you guys can provide, the\nmore time we\u2019ll have to work on Video Game Story Time, and the more videos\nwe\u2019ll be able to put out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you to everyone who has made suggestions about what we\nshould do for backer rewards. We\u2019ve tried to come up with a few benefits that\nwill be fun for the people who can help out, without making non-backers feel\nlike they\u2019re losing out on the standard Video Game Story Time content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you donate any amount of money, you\u2019ll gain our\nappreciation, plus periodic bonus behind-the-scenes videos when we hit certain\nmilestones, such as a blooper reel of me messing up my lines that Kotor has put\ntogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you donate $5 a month, we\u2019ll give you early access to our\nvideos \u2013 although, because we get very excited when we finish a video and want\nto share it as soon as possible, we might change our minds about this\nparticular perk in a few months, depending on how well it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor $10 a month, we have something special planned. All of\nour videos are published under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, meaning\nthat you can edit and reuse any of our content for private or commercial use,\nas long as you give us credit, and publish your work under the same Creative\nCommons license.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut for those who donate to Patreon at this tier, we\u2019re\ngiving our full archive of illustrations, so that you can use these pictures\nfor whatever purpose you like. These will be provided under a Creative Commons\nAttribution license, which means you can use our work for any purpose, even\ncommercial works, and that you\u2019re even able to copyright your creation, as long\nas you give us credit. We have well over a hundred images already from these\nvideos, and we\u2019ll be uploading more as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor $25 a month, we\u2019ll put your name in the credits on our\nendslate as part of a special thank you message. You\u2019ll also get all the\nprevious benefits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFinally, for anyone who\u2019s interested in giving us $50 a\nmonth, we\u2019ll put you into our videos as a background character. There are\nalready a few instances where we\u2019re put real life people into the videos, as\npeople playing games or celebrating over a creator\u2019s success. Those who back us\nat this level will be receive their own likeness, created by Kotor, and will\nappear periodically in our videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we\u2019re hoping to be able to speed up our\ncreation of Video Game Story Time content. We\u2019re hoping one day to be able to\nmake these videos on a weekly basis, but we\u2019re probably a long way away from\nthat right now. As the channel grows, though, we\u2019ll get closer to achieving our\ngoal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for watching, we really appreciate your\nsupport, no matter what form it comes in. With your help, we\u2019re hoping to make\nVideo Game Story Time even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
