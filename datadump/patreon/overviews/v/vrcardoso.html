You can find the first novel and the prequel novella here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2CkFkKW\"\u003ehttp://amzn.to/2CkFkKW\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created this Patreon to help me make the best possible version of my books. Publishing is expensive. Editors must go over the writing, designers and illustrators must create the maps and covers, etc. Also, I need to eat. It\u0027s a nasty habit, I know but, alas, that\u0027s how it is.\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me you\u0027ll be getting early access to my writing as well as some exclusive and signed stuff (depending on the tier).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is my passion. I\u0027ve been writing stories since elementary school, so all my future books would probably end up being written even without patron support. However, your support allows me to speed up my process and make sure the finalised books are as professional as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining me on this epic adventure! Together, we will slay evil gods, hunt mighty dragons, and make lots of books. Well, I\u0027ll make the books, you just need to enjoy them :)"

I mostly ripped off everything that I read or watched. I remember having a hero that was suspiciously similar to Indiana Jones, except his name came from a book cover standing on the shelf behind the computer.\u003cbr\u003eI grew up on a healthy diet of fantasy novels, video games, and daydreaming. After graduating in business, I spent a few years cranking out headlines, scripts, and silly ideas in an advertising agency in Lisbon. Having written about pretty much everything, from laxative pills to car insurance, I decided it was time to start writing about what I truly enjoy. So I\u0027ve taken the plunge and I\u0027m now self-publishing my works of fiction.\u003cbr\u003eI also eat a lot of crepes.\u003cbr\u003e",
