    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Cora, a Makeup Artist and Style enthusiast living in the SF Bay Area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a little girl, my Aunt Susan gave me a trunk of dress up clothes, and I haven\u0027t stopped dressing up since. I\u0027m fascinated by the way that a dress, a wig or a killer shade of lipstick can transform the way you hold yourself, how you think about yourself, and how you project yourself to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTen years ago, long before they were calling us \u003cem\u003eBeauty Gurus\u003c/em\u003e, before you could make money, or become \"YouTube Famous\" I started making videos for fun. My passion was to share tips and tricks with fellow makeup and style junkies; I make videos trade secrets, let everyone know when I found THE eyeliner, the best eyeshadow, and a mascara that wouldn\u0027t smudge... \u003cem\u003eseriously\u003c/em\u003e. Making videos helped me discover my passion of makeup artistry and in the last decade, I\u0027ve become a Makeup Artist working with brides and in reality television. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSix years ago, I started fashion blogging, and I must say that has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. There were no fat role models for me growing up, and it\u0027s hard to love yourself when you don\u0027t recognize yourself anywhere in media. I put myself out there hoping that somewhere there was someone who would see me and feel like they were being themselves for the first time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for becoming a Patron! My goal is to make content and art that is supported by the people who enjoy it, and not influenced by advertisements. I want to expand my creations beyond makeup reviews and hauls into something deeper: Recreating Iconic Makeup and Fashion moments on a Plus-Size body. I want to write books that help women live better, and show them how to love themselves. I want to make videos about taboo subjects like going gray at 32, being fat, grief and PCOS. Someday, I want to create an ethical fashion line inspired by the past, present and future. Your contributions and helping me reach those goals, and for that I am forever grateful!"
