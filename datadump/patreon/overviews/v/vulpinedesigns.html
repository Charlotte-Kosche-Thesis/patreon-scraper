    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi, I\u0027m Danfox Davies, the CEO and Founder of Vulpine Designs. You\u0027ve \njoined us at an inflection point in our journey, at the cusp of funding \nour now thoroughly planned research and development strategy for \ntransforming healthcare, cosmetics and body modifications, through the \npower of genetic editing. \u003cdiv\u003e We are working tirelessly to bring you a future that says:\u003cdiv\u003e You can design yourself. You can write yourself. You can self-redefine thanks to Vulpine Designs. \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/jointheevolutionrevolution?source=feed_text\u0026amp;story_id=10156716123387195\"\u003e#Jointheevolutionrevolution\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re taking the design approach to science. We\u0027re making an artform of genetic expression. Holism meets big data, bioinformatics meets VR and the resulting works of science will each build the most ambitious art project in history: Freedom of Form: an evolution revolution.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll take you on a journey by the seat of your genes, redefining evolution itself as we unravel tangled DNA and write self-changing codes to fulfil our quest. Join us to transcend medicine, beauty, shape, size, form, function, age, expression, inheritance and the impossible in a multi-decadal project like no other!\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a long road to freedom, it\u0027s all the better when there\u0027s someone to help keep the lights on, the servers connected to the net, food on the table and a place to put the table in. Better yet when we can afford premises and bring in the experts. It can all be made possible by you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe broad concept is we\u0027ll be building software in a modular fashion to simulate the entire body, at time of writing there are some 25 modules planned. We\u0027ll be building a molecular bioprinter and to do this we\u0027ll need a few lab tools such as electron microscopes. Those are expensive so we\u0027ll take the opportunity to show you how the open source community is changing the face of scientific equipment design, purchasing and manufacture too, ensuring all contributors know we can get value for hard-earned money. Once we\u0027ve built these we\u0027ll be doing some wetware design and development, before we then apply the full set - software, hardware and wetware - to achieving our goal and making Freedom of Form something everyone can enjoy. This will take a long time but we are ready.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe company website is https://www.vulpinedesigns.com and there you will find more info on who each of our staff are, and the systems we are developing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a more detailed explanation, click this link please (it goes to an article on our PubPub, the Journal of Freedom Of Form (JFOF)).\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.pubpub.org/pub/setting-the-scene-for-freedom-of-form-an-evolution-revolution---introduction\"\u003ehttps://www.pubpub.org/pub/setting-the-scene-for-f...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------\u003cbr\u003eTHE LIST\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere we want to thank our patrons who support us with $5 or more per month:\u003cbr\u003eJordan Eckhoff\u003cbr\u003eStormcloud\u003cbr\u003eAlynna\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much, for helping us keep the dream alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks go out to our early-days supporters who got us this far already before we even had a Patreon and externally of it: Cathal, Dragon, Krad, Al, Zy, Alynna, David, Ben, Alice, Marjorie, Anna, Mircea, Naz, Paul, Micheal, Kyon, Patrick, Dave, Taylor, Alan, Caelum, Luka, Jordan, Nat, Matt, Adam, Adam, Jeremy, Justin, Shawn, Din, Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, Will, Ian, John, Kairen, Aideen and across time and space to Jemma and Corinne who departed this world too soon.
