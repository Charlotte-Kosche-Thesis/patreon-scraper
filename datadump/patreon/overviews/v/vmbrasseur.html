I deeply love helping people in these and other ways. After being told several times, it\u0027s finally sunk in that the people I help also want to help \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e and to support my work. Voila: A Patreon page is born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What do I get for becoming a patron?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides the warm glow which comes from supporting the good work of another human? You\u0027ll also get access to patron-only posts and discussions. These posts will be about things I\u0027m currently working on or thinking about and should come out weekly (when travel schedules don\u0027t interfere).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note: I reserve the right to make these posts public after a certain period of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Wait, does this mean you\u0027ll be putting work behind a Patreon paywall?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no answer to this which isn\u0027t some derivative of \"hell no,\" so I\u0027ll just say that: HELL NO. The majority of my work is now and always will be available under free and open licenses, primarily of the \u003ca href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/\"\u003eCreative Commons\u003c/a\u003e nature. Full stop.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe patron-only posts will just be updates and previews of my work, not the work itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you have rewards?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe primary reason for this Patreon is to allow people to support the work I\u0027m already doing, so adding rewards on top of that feels disingenuous. As I said above: the majority of my work is open. Rewards lead to having some of that work trapped behind that paywall, which is an idea I already shot down in the previous section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"OK, so if I support you, what will you do with the money? You\u0027re just going to blow it all on cat kibble and expensive cheeses, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do love me a fine cheese, no, I\u0027m not going to blow all of your support on expensive cheeses. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(191, 191, 191);\"\u003e(\u003cem\u003eonly some of it\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a freelancer, my income is inconsistent. That makes it difficult to plan for things like, I dunno, paying for my internet, cellphone, or rent, let alone the airfare and hotel required to present at community-organised free and open source conferences. While I certainly don\u0027t expect Patreon revenue to cover even one of these bills, it would certainly put my mind at ease to know there\u0027s some sort of reliable and regular money coming in to buy me a nice coffee during the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, yes, I will buy kibble. I have an obligation to keep the cats in the manner to which they\u0027ve become accustomed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Where did you get that amazeballs rocketship picture for your header?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat amazeballs picture is courtesy of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://juliancash.smugmug.com\"\u003eJulian Cash\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.juliancash.com\"\u003eJulian Cash Photography\u003c/a\u003e.
