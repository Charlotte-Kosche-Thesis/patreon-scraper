    "summary": "Hello there! Welcome to the VO School Podcast Patreon page. VO School is a project that began in the fall of 2017 as a resource for new entrants to the voiceover industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Jamie, host and creator of the podcast. I have been a voice actor for 10 years and in that time the industry has changed a great deal, both for good aaaaand the not so good. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe good part!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day there are more opportunities for voice actors. Innovations in technology, the democratization of the industry and the ability for voice actors to work from home, wherever that home happens to be, are all driving this growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s also easier and cheaper than ever to construct a simple studio to record from home, and with Internet based connections, voiceover talent can plug into the industry like never before!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe not so good bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlongside this growth comes increased competition and a whole other industry devoted to exploiting the naivete of new entrants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd THIS is why I started the VO School Podcast. Every day I would see new voice actors being taken advantage of so I decided to start the podcast as way to set the record straight! Free to listen to, independent and unflinchingly honest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that the only way to become successful in voiceover is to be the most knowledgeable, skilled and business savvy voice talent you can be. But where do you start? How do you know who is reputable? What are the most important skills to learn? And how do you develop them? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week we explore the core skills, industry trends, and emerging technologies that are part of a successful career. We are are also introducing you to some of the industries greatest minds, all of whom have decades of experience under their belts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as helping us to continue making the podcast, being a Patron of VO School will give you rewards each month, including links to your website to help your SEO, customized feedback and access to the pre-production stage. You will also have access to the VO School Patreon feed and a mini course on Pro Tools for voiceover! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel enormously privileged to interview these wonderful guests and it\u2019s extremely fulfilling to hear from listeners how the podcast is helping them on their journey. But putting an hour long podcast together each week is time consuming and studio costs mean that it can get expensive, fast! And this is why you joining our VO School Patreon community will ensure that I can keep making this for many months and years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis journey has only really just begun! I have so many ideas for future episodes, and your contribution (however much you can afford) will help to make them happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e"
