I\u0027m Victor, a self-taught illustrator based in France, working on a\u00a0 very very old dream: a manga.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTarget audience\u003c/strong\u003e: adults and teens (16 +)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContents\u003c/strong\u003e: fantasy, adventure, romance (hetero and LGBT), humor, action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResume\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cem\u003eGwenn, a young \nwoman quite clumsy and quite alcoholic, finds herself against her will plunged into the heart of a conflict of which she knew nothing \nand which will definitely change her life.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis 1st volume has many little brothers waiting to go from dream to reality, so it took me a while to tweak the story and have the courage to get started. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing rather enthusiastic and optimistic, I hope to be able to offer you a chapter a month. Which\n should represent between 20 and 30 pages ... I am perhaps super \noptimistic, we\u0027ll see... Be indulgent ^^,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat brought me here? Well, in short, I am in a break between 2 jobs, the vagaries of life you know. So I have all the time I need to illustrate and ink this first volume :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut despite the immense happiness that it gives me, my financial resources are not unlimited (alas ...). I have tried to live with love and fresh water, but my banker and my refrigerator don\u0027t really agree with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo,\n you, generous donor, know that by participating, even minimally, you \nallow me to pay for the equipment necessary to pursue this dream, since I\n work in the old-style only (paper, pencils, and ink), to\n be able to continue to sketch for hours and to edit the chapters online within the deadlines that I set myself, and why not, if the \nresources are sufficient, to self-publish this first volume in paper \nversion?\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a story that lives and just needs your support to grow :) I\u0027ll never thank you enough for your help.\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy the time spent with my heroes as much as I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe sure that I love you already, dear reader.\u003cbr\u003e"
