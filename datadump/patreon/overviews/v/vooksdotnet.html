    "summary": "For 17 years Vooks has been providing Australian Nintendo fans with everything they need to know about what\u0027s going on in the world of Nintendo. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe cover the latest news, we review games, we have a podcast and create videos and do our best to make sure you\u0027re educated and aware. Vooks is more than just a site with news, we\u0027re also a community. Whether it\u0027s our forum, social media pages or in real life. Vookians have made real friendships both online and offline thanks to our site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the Vooks team and many of the members we have are true friends to me, our team donates their time, effort and even their own money to making the site what it can be and I can\u0027t even put into words how much that means to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why are we making a Patreon? Well it\u0027s simple really, Vooks takes a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of money to run and a lot of time. Time we have, money we do not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started Vooks, the site was on free ISP hosting, we moved to a real host in 2003. Now 16 years later, I\u0027m not a teenager anymore, don\u0027t live at home and have a mortgage - being an adult is expensive. Have you seen the cost of meat these days? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe entire time Vooks has been running we\u0027ve never run at a profit, if I wanted to do this to make money I would have quit a long time ago. We have banner adverts (that no one clicks on anymore) but the income from that doesn\u0027t come anywhere close to what we need to keep the lights on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are, we\u0027re posting this to see if anyone wants to help us out. You don\u0027t have to, we\u0027re never going to charge anyone to read our site and we don\u0027t want people to give if they can\u0027t support themselves first! The ongoing money this Patreon will go back directly into the bills and to ease my poor wallet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVooks will go on, we love doing what we do and hope you enjoy it too. \u003cbr\u003e"
