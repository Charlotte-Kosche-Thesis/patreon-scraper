I am a jack of most trades, and I like making things. From drawings to pictures and stories to music, I want to make all sorts of things that would make an impact on anyone who views or listens to what I\u0027ve made. I\u0027m generally ok in all aspects, but I am improving! I plan on making animations, comics, novels, and build an art portfolio filled sketches and paintings that I make with my iPad, iMac, or my old Asus laptop! I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me on my way to buying better things to make more stuff with, and to ensure I am well fed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make music! I plan on singing in them, but I don\u0027t have the best voice and Zi. am really shy about singing. Other than that, my music is instrumental in nature, and some songs are really simple. Despite this, I am improving and finding out that I am willing to make songs in most genres, from rap to ambience to rock. I have a few albums planned out and they will appear here first!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStories!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write as well! My stories aren\u0027t the best written, but with time and tryi, they will get better! I\u0027ve yet to find a way to convey my ideas in a serial format, so my bigger novels that I plan on writing are in limbo. Not to worry though, as I now have motivation for writing! Do note that these posts would be sporadic, as I am a slow writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePictures!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI take photos and draw! My photos are currently shot with an iPhone 6s+, but I do plan on getting a better camera. I also can draw, to some extent. I mostly upload these kinds of things. I draw with an iPad Air 2 and an Adonit stylus on Procreate and Zen Brush\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideos!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideos are a rarity here as I am camera shy and not too fond of my current environment for personal reasons. Some exclusives, like life updates and BTS access if I ever plan on making any Youtube video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot planned, and I don\u0027t have many employment options in my tiny town. This means I have little to no access to a reliable income so I can help build a kennel for my dogs, afford internet, renovate my house, and allow me to buy healthier food for my family. So please, consider becoming a patron so you can help me help my family and myself. Thank you for reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
