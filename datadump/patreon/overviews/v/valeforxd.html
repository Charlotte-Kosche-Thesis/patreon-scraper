    "summary": "\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xi766XxVkGY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, everybody! My name is Aaron, and I make video game reviews (and other fun stuff) on YouTube under the name valeforXD. In these videos, I use a somewhat exaggerated caricature or myself to look at a whole bunch of different games, both new and old.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making these kinds of videos on-and-off since mid 2014 but recently I seem to have hit my stride, going from \"uploading on occasion\" to putting all my effort into these videos and releasing multiple videos a month. These videos are incredibly fun to make and, thankfully, it seems people enjoy them, which I guess is a nice little bonus!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, trying to build and manage a YouTube channel is a lot of hard work. Most of my time is spent recording footage, and editing that footage on a slow-ish laptop, which can make the process time consuming. As well as that, considering how long these videos can get, it can be a very time- and cost-consuming process.\u00a0Reviewing games that are not only brand new releases but also rare and hard to obtain is quite difficult at this stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I made my Patreon hoping that, through the amazing support of my fans, I would be able to fund and provide the highest quality videos possible. I\u0027ll be able to produce content at a faster rate while also improving upon the overall quality of the content itself. Any donations and support will not be taken lightly. I genuinely appreciate any help that you guys can afford to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"So what do I, the common YouTube viewer, get from throwing money at you every month,\" you say?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, I get a lot of requests to look at specific games - new, old, rare, whether they\u0027re the cream of the crop or you want me to suffer by forcing me to play complete and utter garbage - and with your help I will be able to track down these games and review them for your enjoyment! I\u0027ll also be able to upgrade my equipment and hardware, streamlining the editing process so videos get to your sub box even faster! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the time being, the only actual reward being offered is getting your name featured at the end of a video in a big \"thank you\" end card thing. I\u0027m not exactly sold on the idea of locking content behind a paywall, and whether that changes in the future is yet to be seen. So, for now, feel free to just contribute a dollar. Literally anything helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"But I thought you were just making videos for fun, Vale, you sellout! What happened to that, huh? HUH?!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, yes, of course, that will never change! I make YouTube videos not for profit, but for fun. Making these videos is in fact some of the most fun I\u0027ve ever had in my life, and I\u0027ve made some amazing friends while doing so. But I can\u0027t keep doing these videos for free, as unfortunate as that is. Until recently, monetization had been disabled on my videos, though newer videos feature a few ads. However, as an alternative I\u0027ve set up a Patreon so those who do want to support me can choose to do so of their own volition!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Yeah, well, you\u0027re still a sellout.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNah, I\u0027ll be a sellout when you see Audible\u0027s logo all over my videos. Besides, I\u0027ve decided, at least for the time being, to focus less on reward tiers and goals and instead just open this Pateron account so that people who want to donate, for whatever reason, have a place to do so - kinda like a tip jar, I guess! (Plus streams and whatnot as rewards are out of the question as my internet sucks.) I don\u0027t wanna ask for much money, but if you choose to donate more then, well, thank you! Gosh darn, you don\u0027t have to do that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNonetheless, the support I\u0027ve gotten over the past year or so is why I\u0027d like to keep doing this, whether it\u0027s as a job or just a hobby. I\u0027ll always be thankful for the support I\u0027ve received, as if it weren\u0027t for everyone\u0027s awesome feedback I wouldn\u0027t be nearly as motivated to continue making videos today. So, please, consider donating! I\u0027m not gonna force you, no one\u0027s gonna judge you, but if you do donate you\u0027re not only helping valeforXD become a better channel, but you\u0027ll also have my undying gratitude."
