    "summary": "Hey everybody! We are Reynard, Jax, and Myrra, and we\u0027re here to show you how to cook awesome food and mix awesome drinks in a relaxed albeit possibly innuendo-filled and quite silly environment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Everybody:\u003cbr\u003eIn the show you\u0027ll see us make the food that our fans want to see (that\u0027s to say our Patreon supporters). We will also accompany every show with a mixed drink of some kind (often for dessert since most mixed drinks are very sweet). We of course ask that you only participate in the drinking if you\u0027re of legal drinking age. We will release a full episode once a month on our YouTube account for all to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor You, Our Patreon Supporters:\u003cbr\u003eEvery week (when we don\u0027t post a show) we\u0027ll be making a short video to answer people\u0027s questions! This can include how to debone chicken, how to sharpen a knife, why Jax\u0027s ear is bandaged up, whatever you guys ask! Every once in a while the video may also be released to the general public if we\u0027re clarifying something on a previous video, like why you should butterfly chicken before frying it rather than after, or whatever people may ask on YouTube. But Patreon questions will always take precedence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Us:\u003cbr\u003eReynard is a Red Fox with a degree in Culinary Arts. He will be showing you how to make delicious food and drink.\u003cbr\u003eJax is a Falarin Fox (you\u0027ll have to ask him what that means) with a heart of gold and knack for getting into trouble. He will also be showing you how to make delicious food and drink.\u003cbr\u003eMyrra is a Wolf with a passion for cinematography and just enough spare time to edit the show. He works in the background to keep us in the foreground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy We Need You:\u003cbr\u003eFood isn\u0027t cheap. In addition to the foods required to film an episode, we need ingredients to experiment with in order to improve upon classic dishes and bring you the best we possibly can. In addition, we need to upkeep equipment as well as upgrade from time to time. Then there are bills. Bills suck, and we need to pay them just like everyone else. Between cooktops, cooling, lighting, cameras, action, it all adds up to an inflated gas and electrical bill. And lastly, we need ideas. We can make the food we wanna eat all day and all night but that doesn\u0027t help you guys if you wanna learn something else. We need your input to make the show what YOU wanna see. Let us know what you\u0027ve always wanted to learn to make and we\u0027ll do what we can to make sure you learn it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Plans, Dreams, and Hopes:\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re in production. We are releasing monthly episodes since February 1st, 2018. Every week we post videos answering your questions to us! They may include advanced tweaks for recipes, clarifications, techniques, whatever you ask! In the future, if we get enough support, we may do videos more often. As our income increases our production value will with it, be it better food, video quality, or frequency, we\u0027ll make sure the show is what you all want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by! Hope to see you on our list of Patreon Supporters sometime soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
