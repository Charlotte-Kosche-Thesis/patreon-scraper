    "summary": "Greetings to everyone visiting our Patreon from our staff at ValorPvP!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eValorPvP is a creation and ambition unlike anything the gaming communities have ever seen. We are attempting to create a community that offers memorable experiences across multiple games featured upon the PC. Our goal and pledge is to provide an environment where gamers can enjoy a game to and beyond its potential. ValorPvP was founded by experienced and renowned administrators that now have assembled their own staff for this community and train them with their unparalleled skills and knowledge base to provide you, the gamer with the experience that you seek when searching for a private server.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur servers are some of the finest in the private gaming communities and are monitored personally by our founders. They are hosted in their private datacenter space based in Manhattan, NYC. In order to provide this unparalleled experience with flawless and even unrivaled performance it comes to us, the founders at a cost that we can\u0027t maintain on our own forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDevelopment\u003cbr\u003eRight now we are preparing to enlist a few more admins to help monitor our growing community. In addition we are developing several new tools and assets for our servers to provide our players with utilities that we feel ARK is lacking while providing a truly genuine experience you simply can\u0027t get anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy You Should Donate:\u003cbr\u003eUp to this point our developments and time we\u0027ve allotted for this endeavour has been as a hobby to share with our community our passions and way of caring for such things the way we know best. However, all funds that we are able to receive from our donor\u0027s would not only go towards helping with the maintenance costs and fees it costs us to develop these assets, but also to help keep the lights and internet going on our end as we set aside the time required to develop these things for the community! The more help we\u0027re able to get the more time we\u0027re able to set aside to provide an experience unlike any other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho Are the Founders?\u003cbr\u003eBetween the two of us we frequently discuss and debate content and asset design ideas for the games we feature in our community, but in general, here\u0027s who we are and what roles were mainly filling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMurceal- Founder, Minor Programmer, PR, Marketing, Web Designer, Lead Server Administrator, Content Designer, Content Creator, Writer, Network Assistant\u003cbr\u003eHeya! I\u0027m the guy writing everything you see to do with ValorPvP! The other guy you see listed here and myself are pretty much the go to guys when it comes to everything in this community. All patch notes, announcements, plans and developments are either designed by or go through us. I personally have years of designing and administrative experience behind my name and work hard for the communities I serve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKawaii Kitten- Founder, Programmer, PR, Marketing, Web Developer, Lead Server Administrator, Content Designer, Content Creator, Network Administrator\u003cbr\u003eNow I gotta say, this guy is pretty skilled at what he does and between the two of us, though we\u0027re quite different with personalities, our skill assets compliment each other well and enable us to do all that you see. Because I do most of the writing you\u0027ll probably see Kawaii Kitten respond to things more often than I do but you can be sure we\u0027re both always watching over the community. When it comes to the network and performance of the server this is the guy that makes it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn important bit of information in regards to our tier rewards...\u003cbr\u003eIt is ESSENTIAL that anyone who desires the in game tier rewards that we are make sure they include their steam ID in their message to enable us to know who is who and grant you the favors we desire to give you. And lastly, we have to make it clear, we can only grant one reward to one Steam ID per donation. Listing multiple IDs will null and void your tier rewards.\u003cbr\u003eNow, we also know that not everyone has those newer accounts that automatically create an ID number. For those of you with older accounts, here\u0027s the tool you need to find out your ID! https://steamid.io/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Conclusion\u003cbr\u003eWe would now like to present to you, our community the chance to participate in our journey and be a part of the team that help makes this dream and desire a reality. So whether or not you\u0027re simply visiting our page to grab the link and share with a friend, or actively donating yourself, we want to dedicate this final line to you, thank you for taking this time to support ValorPvP."
