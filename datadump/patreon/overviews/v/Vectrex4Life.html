    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Jason and run the \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube channel \u0027Vectrex4Life\u0027!\u003c/strong\u003e My primary focus and labor of love on the channel are comedic reviews on video games that have been left behind or are not remembered by many. I call this show, \u003cstrong\u003eForgotten Games!\u003c/strong\u003e A good example of what episodes consist of can be found in my LEGO Island Trilogy episode above!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I am doing this? To put it simply, I am a young adult with big dreams in the video production field. Forgotten Games is the biggest way that I can bring out my love for video games and my creative side in writing, videography, and \u003cstrong\u003eespecially editing.\u003c/strong\u003e Since the shows creation in late 2012, my ambitions have grown tremendously to increase production levels. In between I have experimented with very long episodes, different cameras, green screens, and different editing software to make the best content I can. Currently I am 19, in college, with a strive to become an excellent editor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow why am I on Patreon you ask? Well, from the beginning, the passion for creating videos has been high, but there have been limiting factors that have come along with it. While working on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pBa1D0TCk8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShadow President episode\u003c/a\u003e, I decided to make the switch from filming with my Nikon Coolpix S4100 to my Samsung Galaxy S2. Yup. Thankfully when I finally upgraded my phone to a Galaxy S7 in late 2016, I was able to start shooting in 1080p, 60 frames per second, which is great, but I would absolutely love to upgrade to a nice Cannon DSLR or something similar. Hopefully Patreon can assist me in this goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be clear, patrons will be charged for every future \u003cstrong\u003emajor \u003c/strong\u003evideo. What defines a major video? As of now, it\u0027s the Forgotten Games and WTF Craigslist Ads episodes. Patrons will not be charged for videos that are full arcade longplays, music videos, or any other random videos. If there is a heavily edited, major video in production that is not a Forgotten Games or WTF Craigslist Ads episode, patrons will be notified before the video is completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that pretty much sums things up. To make things clear, I will \u003cstrong\u003enever charge\u003c/strong\u003e anyone to view my videos. Patreon is simply a way for those who enjoy my show to express generosity through donations. Creating videos is an art form that I absolutely love to do, and I sincerely thank you for any interest you may have for helping me make them even better. \u003cbr\u003e"
