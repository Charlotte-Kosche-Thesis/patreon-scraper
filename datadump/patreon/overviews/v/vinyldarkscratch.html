In her pre-teen years, she developed a taste for electronic music, listening to artists such as \u003ca href=\"http://lapfoxtrax.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLapfox\u003c/a\u003e. She started composing music in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGarageBand\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://musescore.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMuseScore\u003c/a\u003e, and created many tracks that she kept to herself. Later in time, she has upgraded to using \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLogic Pro X\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.ableton.com/en/live/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAbleton Live\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFL Studio\u003c/a\u003e, which is what most of her songs have been made with. She continues to experiment with music and improve her abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVinyl has been interested in the multimedia and animation industry since taking a summer camp from \u003ca href=\"http://digitalelfstudios.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBev Standish\u003c/a\u003e. Since then she has been working towards a Multimedia certificate, then a degree.

The following year, she started creating her first website for her studio, \u003ca href=\"http://www.nightwave.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNightwave Studios\u003c/a\u003e, learning JavaScript and CSS. As a little side project, she has created a chat bot for \u003ca href=\"http://www.cloudsdale.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCloudsdale\u003c/a\u003e [the website has been killed] called \"Vinylbot\" and \"Fumeibot,\" branching from the original, deprecated \"Connorbot,\" written in C#.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVinyl is the founder of a volunteer-based production company known as Nightwave Studios, founded in 2012 and recreated once again in 2015.
