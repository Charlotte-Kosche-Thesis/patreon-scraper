    "summary": "Hello, and welcome\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve found your way here to my Patreon page you are probably familiar with who I am and what I do, but if not allow me to introduce myself;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am \u003cstrong\u003eRyan van Zeben \u003c/strong\u003e(Also known as \u003cstrong\u003evanZeben \u003c/strong\u003eor \u003cstrong\u003eDesignsbyZephyr \u003c/strong\u003eon the interwebs), a 23 year old software engineer from Ontario, Canada. I have been recording tutorials on how to create games through-out my own learning process, both formal and informal. I am currently working full-time as a contract web developer whilst attending school and teaching others. It\u0027s quite a lot on my plate and by all means I asked for every single grain of rice on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do. I love creating games and explaining to others not only how to perform specific tasks but helping them improve their own problem solving skills at the same time. I try to keep on top of things, but sometimes life gets in the way with work. I created this patreon so that I can, not only, share my thoughts with you, my audience, but also (hopefully) entertain and inform you as-well. But unfortunately the Beetles were a \u0027tad\u0027 incorrect when they said \u003cem\u003e\"All you need is love\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eApparently you can\u0027t pay for your groceries with good feelings. Your landlord doesn\u0027t accept hugs and kisses in lieu of rent. And the tax man certainly doesn\u0027t appreciate it when you fill in your self-assessment with hearts and flowers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApparently all you need is love... and money. And that\u0027s where Patreon steps in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou are probably asking yourself; what has this got to do with me, and what the hell is Patreon? Don\u0027t all Youtubers get tons of money from Ads?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell the simple answer is, no. Youtube ad revenue is pretty tiny and insignificant unless you happen to be one of those lucky channels who attain 100\u0027s of thousands, if not millions, of subscribers. For smaller channels like myself, it\u0027s a constant struggle trying to balance the time required to create awesome and informative content for you with the need to work \"real jobs\" in order to pay the bills, and unfortunately, paying the bills always comes first.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon helps shift that balance a little by allowing fans to directly support the creators they love with small donations which allows them to spend more time creating and less time worrying about bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo is this going to turn into a \"pay-wall\"?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere is a super easy answer for that - no.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am going to continue to make videos free for everyone who wants to learn from them on Youtube. This is simply a way for fans to help support the channel if they want to and can maybe afford to give a couple of dollars a month.\u003cbr\u003e"
