I talk to people from all around the world and from all walks of life about what space settlement means to them and their world. When we talk about space settlement, or when we see it being discussed, it\u0027s so very often in hard engineering terms, I want to change that and open the floor to allow everyone to talk about space settlement. On my show, I have artists, philosophers, anthropologists, lawyers, social scientists and anyone else with an interesting topic and a unique look at the future of humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly believe that these people and these points of view have the ability to inspire people to be passionate about space settlement and colonization, and that inspiring people is the first step in making the dream of human settlement of space a reality - and with your help, I can reach more people, continue to produce interesting and exciting content and push the show as far as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you end up pledging or not, I hope you love the show and I look forward to hearing from you all in the coming months!
