You are only charged the\n$1 when the studio version is released. Your $1 essentially helps me pay for the\nstudio and engineer to get the song recorded, mixed, mastered and into your ears.\u00a0In between new studio releases, I will also be sharing free demos and works in progress as well as updates, videos, poetry, pics of new art and more.\u00a0With every song\nrelease there will also be a drawing for my handmade art and jewelry from my\nonline galleries. All patrons are entered into EVERY drawing. And some Patrons even earn extra drawing entries.

My goal is one new studio release a month. But there will occasionally be months that have more. Likewise, at least in the beginning stages of this\ncampaign, there may be less than one a month.\u003cbr\u003eBut I will always be sharing new content!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd, if you think of something else you would like made available, that I haven\u0027t yet thought of in the rewards section, please let me know. I\u0027d like to make this the best experience for everyone! For the first few weeks after launch I am sure you may find some glitches or discrepancies between here and the website. Please do not hesitate to let me know of these things or to ask any questions about anything, so that I can get everything just perfect!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just want to write and record more music, create more art, make more videos, and perform more live shows, and I want to share it all with you!!! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for your time and support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch Love,\u003cbr\u003e~Voxxy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
