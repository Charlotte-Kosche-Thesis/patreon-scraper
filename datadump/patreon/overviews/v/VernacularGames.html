    "summary": "We are an indie development group in the video game sector, eking out an existence on frothing buckets of passion and pocket change. We formed in response to the rigid, sometimes asinine structure and practices employed by larger game development companies, with the intent of providing a mid-level alternative for aspiring developers looking to gain a bit of professional experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur intentions can be summed up as three color coded tenets:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. The Passion Tenet(Red) ::\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 To build games we want to play\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. The Clean Slate Tenet(White) :: \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0To make opportunities for aspiring developers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. The Efficiency Tenet(Gold) :: \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0To operate in an effective and professional manner\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving done a few development cycles for games and podcasts on shoestring budgets, we\u0027ve been on the lookout for ways to better facilitate the creation of quality games and other media related content to present to the world at large. After finishing our first season of game design podcasts, the idea of attempting to fund our works through patreon was suggested, and collectively we decided \"why not give it a go?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy lending us your support, you will aid the creation of game related podcasts and streams that focus on a more academic approach to analysis when it comes to game design and development.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also help with the creation of games from our studio, allowing for better compensation of those who throw their hats in for development as well as the acquisition of development tools and development locales that aren\u0027t interred in garages, bedrooms, and churches at midnight.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to check out some of the stuff we\u0027ve done already you can click the links below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vernaculargames.wixsite.com/highwaytothemoon\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://vernaculargames.wixsite.com/highwaytothemoon\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/redcoatvernac/sets/games-from-a-developers\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/redcoatvernac/sets/games-from-a-developers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/vernaculargames\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdOnpvr00HN8dCmq59Hpyw\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdOnpvr00HN8dCmq...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you give us your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
