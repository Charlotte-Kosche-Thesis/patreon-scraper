Some of us have been homeless, so we know what it\u0027s like to be in need. Others have encountered homeless vegans and vegetarians who are forced to go without food because plant based meals are not typically provided in shelters. Their stories inspire us. So, we came together because it\u0027s time for a change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur first goal \u003c/strong\u003eis to serve vegan meals on the streets of Dallas. In 2018, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mdhadallas.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SOHA-2018-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMetro Dallas Homeless Alliance\u003c/a\u003e reported that there were an estimated 4,140 homeless people on a given night in the DFW area - 1,341 of those people are unsheltered. With your support, we want to make sure we impact each of these people with a delicious vegan meal every day. It\u0027s going to be a long road to get there. We\u0027ll need a larger volunteer operation, we\u0027ll need to hire staff, we\u0027ll need to expand our food procurement, and we\u0027ll eventually need our own community garden for food supply and our own kitchen for meal prep. But we SEE the vision. We hope you can too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur second goal\u003c/strong\u003e is to serve vegan meals at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.austinstreet.org/volunteer/groups/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAustin Street Shelter\u003c/a\u003e as often as possible. The shelter serves three meals every single day to an estimated 920 people. There are other groups that volunteer to serve animal products on most days. But if we can can serve at least ONE vegan meal a day at the shelter, or even ONE vegan meal per week, we would have made an impact on the health and well-being of our friends there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur value to you\u003c/strong\u003e is education. We want you to get something out of supporting us. By donating just $1 a month to our cause, you\u0027re literally paying for a plate of vegan food for someone in need. In return, we\u0027ll help educate you about ways you can be helpful to your community. We\u0027ll teach you how to organize efforts to feed people on your own. We\u0027ll connect you with resources to build your own community gardens. We\u0027ll post videos of our progress. We\u0027ll show you behind the scenes footage of us cooking in the kitchen. We\u0027ll amplify the stories of our friends, so YOU can see the impact of what you\u0027re supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really need you. And something tells us, you really need us too. You need to be part of this movement. Together, we\u0027ll create a world where no one has to go hungry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSIDE NOTE: Don\u0027t want to subscribe? No problem.
