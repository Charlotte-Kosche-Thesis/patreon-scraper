But we like to think we\u0027re kind of funny and some of you seem to feel the same way. When we\u0027re not recording, we\u0027re busy with school, work, and being broke, respectively. ie: We record in what little free time we have with fairly mediocre equipment. But we love entertaining you folks and would love to offer a higher quality and quantity of content. So, if you\u0027re one those weird people who enjoys what we do, we\u0027ve set up this Patreon as a way to, hopefully, allow you to contribute in a more personalized, fun way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all support is greatly appreciated. We are very much new to this sort of thing, so our rewards tiers are kind of bare-bones at the moment. Hopefully with your continued support we can continue to grow and add even more rewards as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, take a look at what we do have to offer and consider becoming a Patron today!\u003cbr\u003e"
