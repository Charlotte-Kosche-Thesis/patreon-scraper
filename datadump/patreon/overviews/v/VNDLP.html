Our aim has been to create entertaining and informative videos about games that anybody can enjoy, and to focus on the positives rather than endlessly complaining about the negatives, though if one of us has a problem with a certain game, it may get covered.\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMi6IaLvZHZECbFInnl1Zw-G1jaEPb-24\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u00a0Extensively.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough making fun and enjoyable videos is a top priority, we make a considerable effort to ensure that our videos can be enjoyed by anyone. We want people to be able to watch our videos without the fear that some of the content may have a negative effect on them. This means that things like racism, sexism, transphobia, queerphobia and anything that we think could come under the umbrella of a slur is kept out of our videos. These things are also not welcome on our channel in general, We want \u00a0VNDLP to be a safe space for everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMainly so that people have the option to give back to us! If you\u0027re enjoying our videos or have enjoyed them in the past, this is your chance to say thanks! Plus anyone who may consider backing us will be funding things like a Let\u0027s Play backup drive (I\u0027m running out of Hard Drive space!), pop-filters, microphone stands, better video and audio equipment for the very occasional live action bits we do, 3DS Capture Hardware, a dedicated website for all our stuff, and maybe finally getting Vile a decent microphone\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith enough support, you could enable us to make\u003cstrong\u003e higher quality videos at a faster rate\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003ehave a cool new website to put everything on! We may even be able to do more podcasts and streams! who knows!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s wrap things up\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur experience making these fun little videos has been amazing and we couldn\u0027t have done half the awesome stuff we\u0027ve done without the people who support us. It\u0027s for this reason that no matter\u00a0what, all the content that is made possible by this patreon will still\u003cstrong\u003e be available to everyone for free on our channel\u003c/strong\u003e. While there will be \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0minor perks to being a patron, we won\u0027t be locking anything off behind a paywall because we appreciate that not everybody has money to throw around.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this! even if you can\u0027t pledge anything, your support is greatly appreciated!"
