    "summary": "We need funding to spread the word about local creative outlets to the bored masses who are convinced that our city is nothing but country cover bands and oil refineries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVictoria House is a private residence that has dedicated the majority of its space and time to fostering Beaumont\u0027s underground arts scene since 2010. In October 2013, we converted a room of the House into a makeshift art space called High Street Gallery. Since then we\u0027ve been honored to exhibit many visual artists in vastly differing mediums, and welcomed countless guests into our home to view art and enjoy the opening reception festivities. In addition to art shows, we also open our home for acoustic performances with small attentive audiences. We host touring musicians from all over the country, often booking shows at area venues and working with the best local acts to build a solid bill that everyone can benefit from. We run a monthly Band Nite at The Art Studio for new original musicians to gain stage experience, and we run recurring drag shows on Crockett Street. We stay involved with several non-profit arts and humanities organizations,\u00a0are highly supportive of the LGBT community, and strive to continually be more inclusive and a safe space for any marginalized groups or individuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough organizing local events, we have three overall goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u2219 To give more people the chance to have face to face interactions and eye opening experiences in our hometown - be it watching a show, making a friend, or taking in a different perspective - that can enrich their lives in any way.\u003cbr\u003e\u2219 To give original artists (visual, musical, performing, etc.) the best exposure available while setting a precedent for making sure artists are paid for their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u2219 To give willing volunteers the opportunity to hone their own interests and talents into professional skills (in public relations, marketing, live event coordination, social media management, photography, videography, journalism, graphic design, networking, etc.) by learning from first hand experience in a fail-safe DIY environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur experience over the years has been working with a zero-budget, so we are at cactus level efficiency with every dollar that passes through our hands. Any little bitty bit can go a long way to building the creative community that our town deserves to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e"
