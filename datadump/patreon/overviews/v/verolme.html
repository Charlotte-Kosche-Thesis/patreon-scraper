It\u0027s gorgeous here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to be outdoors, photographing beautiful landscapes, cityscapes, portraits, people and events in the streets. I\u0027m working towards an important personal goal: becoming a full-time travel photographer. For me that means setting the bar at the highest level for the quality and gesture in my photographs. I\u0027m striving to tell an authentic story with my photos. When you feel a warm desire to visit the places I have captured, because my photo captivated or intrigued you, only then I\u0027m happy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTraveling the world means you need funding. I\u0027m happy that Patreon, and my dear Patrons, provide a way for me to generate just that little extra funding besides my earnings in print sales and commissions. I\u0027m gladly to take up the challenge in surprising you with my best work, taken on the most fantastic locations, each and every time. Thank you for being a patron!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd remember, the more of you pledge to become my patron, the more exotic locations I will be able to photograph, exclusively for you.
