    "summary": "Hi everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Victoria Dreyer, and my \"thing\" is telling stories. \u00a0Not the little-white-lie kind, though - I\u0027m a writer. \u00a0Let me tell you a little bit about who I am, what I do, and what I hope to achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I was a little girl, it was my life\u0027s dream to be an author. \u00a0I wrote my first novel at the age of 14, and then went on to found and run a comic book publishing house from 2003 to 2007. \u00a0But life intervened, and not in the good way. \u00a0The debts started piling up, and I was struggling to find enough money to eat. \u00a0I burned out and was too exhausted to keep creating. \u00a0Basically, it just sucked. \u00a0So I did the only thing I could do: I abandoned my art, and got a normal job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was miserable, but it was at least working in a call centre was some kind of life... until I was struck by a terrible fever some time around 2009. \u00a0That was when my hearing started to gradually vanish. \u00a0It started with a constant high-pitched ringing tone in my ears, and then I started getting fits of dizziness and nausea that sometimes left me bed-ridden for up to a week. \u00a0In early 2011, I was diagnosed with severe biaural Meniere\u0027s Disease. \u00a0By mid 2012, I was having trouble getting out of bed in the morning. \u00a0I was so dizzy that I fell over, and hearing human voices started to hurt. \u00a0I started having trouble understanding what people were saying to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy doctor wanted me to leave my job then, but I was so afraid. \u00a0I\u0027d taken on big debts to get my first car, and I was terrified that if I left my job without planning ahead then I wouldn\u0027t be able to repay my debts. \u00a0Even more importantly, I didn\u0027t really want to be on the Benefit/Welfare again. \u00a0I didn\u0027t want to be a burden on society. \u00a0I did not want to be a leech. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it was so bad that I could barely leave the house. \u00a0I had to drive to work, because taking the bus made me throw up. \u00a0I had to wear earplugs, because the noise of the office around me made me fall over. \u00a0The specialist said I could go completely deaf at any time. \u00a0I knew I couldn\u0027t keep going for much longer. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn December 2012, an idea hit me. \u00a0I\u0027d always wanted to be an author. \u00a0Why not do that now? \u00a0I didn\u0027t need to be able to hear to write a ripping great yarn, and I could do it from my own home. \u00a0So that\u0027s what I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the 1st of December 2012, I sat down and started writing \u003cem\u003eThe Survivors Book I: Summer\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0I showed it to a few people, and the feedback was universally good. \u00a0They wanted me to publish that book. \u00a0For a while, I wasn\u0027t sure whether to self-publish or try to find a traditional publisher, but in the end I decided, \"Screw it! \u00a0I\u0027ve self-published before, so why not do it again?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I did. \u00a0I used what little savings I had to hire an editor, a graphic designer, and a cover artist, all while determinedly plugging away at the next book in the series. \u00a0Over the course of 2013, I wrote 480,000 words. \u00a0On the 23rd of June 2013, I was forced to leave my job at last, but I had a plan and that kept me from falling apart. \u00a0I was determined not to be a burden on society for long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the 1st of August 2013, I released \u003cem\u003eThe Survivors Book I: Summer\u003c/em\u003e, and it was an instant success. \u00a0Not a Fifty Shades Of Grey success, but it was a success. \u00a0I immediately started getting emails asking for the next book. \u00a0People loved the book, and they wanted more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the 1st of February 2014, I released \u003cem\u003eThe Survivors Book II: Autumn\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0Again, people loved it. \u00a0Again, people wanted more. \u00a0My fanbase grew from a couple of dozen people to several hundred. \u00a0In the first month after the release of \u003cem\u003eThe Survivors Book III: Winter\u003c/em\u003e, I sold 550 copies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where I am at the time of writing. \u00a0I\u0027ve created one successful franchise, and I have so much more in the works. \u00a0I\u0027m working on \u003cem\u003eThe Survivors Book IV: Spring\u003c/em\u003e for an early 2015 release, and after that I\u0027m moving on to the Paranormal series, \u003cem\u003eThe Immortelle\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0I\u0027d love to get back into graphic novels again, too. \u00a0But to do that, I need a steady source of income. \u00a0I need you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most important things to me is that, while I am disabled, I do not want to be a burden on society, and a leech on the taxpayer\u0027s dollar. \u00a0My novels are providing a steadily growing source of income, but they\u0027re not a reliable income. \u00a0They\u0027re not enough to keep a roof over my head and food in the fridge - at least, not yet. \u00a0I have so many stories to tell, but I have to financially support myself while I\u0027m doing it. \u00a0That\u0027s where you come in, potential patron. \u00a0You can help me, and in return I\u0027ll share all the worlds in my imagination with you. \u00a0And there are a lot, believe me! \u00a0For as little as $1.00 a month, you can help me to achieve my dream of being both an author and financially independent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider becoming a patron of my arts. \u00a0I have so much to share with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKind regards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVictoria \"V.
