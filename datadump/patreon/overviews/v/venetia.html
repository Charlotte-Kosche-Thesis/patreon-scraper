All the funds go straight to the talented people around me creating music and videos. We are all trying to spread positive messages with our music that isn\u0027t about twerking, burping or that ho that didn\u0027t call that girl who cheated. The NEW artist age has begun! You don\u0027t have to be owned by a record label who tells you not to eat. \u00a0Which is good because I can get hangry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy PATREON? It\u0027s the NEW way. We don\u0027t need the middle man to take 30-85% of sales. All we need is a small community of people who support the art! I call it #THRIVINGNOTSTARVING.\u00a0What I am asking is that if any part of you at any time supports the music or videos or stories I am creating, please consider donating a super small amount on this platform.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to pay forward to more artists overall. I\u0027m trying to take my background in building startups and apply it to building artists. If I can do it, I know I can help others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support gives me wings and voice.\u00a0\u00a0I am hoping we can all go on this ride together and we all know the little things add up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much love \u0026amp; gratitude,\u003cbr\u003eVenetia\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
