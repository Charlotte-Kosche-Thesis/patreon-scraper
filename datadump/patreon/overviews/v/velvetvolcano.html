It has been gaining some exposure recently in the media, but it is a rare disease (or at least rarely diagnosed, especially in the UK) that in general is not known much about.\u003cbr\u003eTo simplify it, my body essentially attacks things it sees as a \u0027threat\u0027, in a generally healthy person mast cells react in this way towards legitimately threatening substances.. in someone with MCAS it could be absolutely anything and everything. My MCAS is so severe that it has caused me to become housebound and allergic to \u0027life\u0027. I have 5 foods I can eat \u0027safely\u0027 (though this can change sometimes suddenly) without severe symptoms, I cannot bathe in or drink unfiltered water or breathe unpurified air (unless I wear an industrial respirator). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eMe with my respirator mask (that I wear everywhere but my \u0027safe house\u0027) and me without it.. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g87/livingnotruths/work_zpsnboznyw9.jpg\" style=\"width: 229px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g87/livingnotruths/meeee_zpsfzc4cdfl.jpg\" style=\"width: 266px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy skin can erupt in hives and rashes from exposure to sunlight. Almost all scents (even ones like the smell of coffee, food cooking etc) can cause me to experience debilitating symptoms including periodic paralysis (a very scary attack where my body becomes completely paralysed, I experience severe pain, dehydration, heart palpitations and tachycardia, migraines, trouble breathing, loss of vision etc) or anaphylaxis - the list of my allergies is extremely long and effects what I do, what I ingest, what I smell, what I wear etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt is very tough, exhausting and limiting and makes trying to run a business very difficult.

With your patronage I can dedicate more time to making WarriorBiz a reality and work on supporting other disabled artists. The first step is a dedicated twitter promotion hour, but I also want to work on a website with interviews, my tips on trying to achieve a health/business/creative expression balance, showcasing Warrior Businesses, WarriorBiz merch and lots more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy plans for VelvetVolcano and WarriorBiz are many, I am hugely thankful that I never run out of ideas of things to create, but the barrier of MCAS is a huge one that limits what I can do on my own.
