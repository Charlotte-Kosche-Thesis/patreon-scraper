I am also a student studying Veterinary Science because I also have a passion for helping derpy little doges, cats, birds, reptile an pretty much any animal in need. Some hobbies I have besides cosplay is dance (mostly Hip-hop), dance has always been a creative outlet for me to express myself before I even knew about cosplay. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eHOW IT ALL STARTED!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy cosplay journey had begun thanks to a small little last minute cosplay I did of Princess \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eKida From the Movie Atlantis: The Lost Empire. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI didn\u0027t think it was much but i ended up putting a side by side picture of a selfie I took in the car next to the princess and posted it online and it just spread like wildfire!. The support and amazing comments I got from it was inspiring and now here I am! Just trying to create even better cosplays for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003eWHY SUPPORT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I just want to make something super duper clear \u003cstrong\u003eYOU DO NOT HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR PATREON. \u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is for peeps that wish to support my craft to help me produce more cosplays more often, so its all up to you if you wish to join or not.....but if you do....\u003cstrong\u003e S\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWEET BABY JESUS THAT WOULD BE AWESOME ;___;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. So Designing and creating cosplay can be very time consuming as well as expensive since these costumes are 100% made by me. I put a lot of time, effort and passion into all my cosplays, between working my job as well as being a full-time college student finding time and funds to create these costumes and props can be very difficult. Patreon will allow me to give back to those that are so generous to give to me with exclusive content as well as the rewards listed below. With the success of this page with your help, in the future it will allow me to have the funds to travel to several con out of state and give me the chance to meet all you lovely peeps. All of these donations will go towards materials, photoshoots, as well as producing prints and making the rewards below even better! And if you didn\u0027t know before \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI DO NOT DO ANY NUDITY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e so please don\u0027t pledge and start asking for that. I do lewd and sexy photosets and even that is just something extra to help me do what I really love to do which is build bigger and better cosplays.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e**Important Note* Patreons will receive rewards once your payment has been processed.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
