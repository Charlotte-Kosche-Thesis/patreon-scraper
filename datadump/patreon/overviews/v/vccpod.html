    "summary": "THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE! I am a singer, conductor, teacher, advocate, and community activist passionate about building a community of people who are using art to bring about social change in their community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVoices Creating Change presents stories of social change initiatives through the arts. Our conversations open possibilities beyond the limitations that underrepresented populations face daily, specifically in the arts. Voices Creating Change seeks to be a force for change, a vehicle of expression, and a community for all social change initiatives through the arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery episode will have accompanying show notes available online so you can have easy access to: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSummary of the episode\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLinks to resources mentioned during the show\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDownloadable transcript (further down the line)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDownloadable resources (further down the line)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY THE NEED?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood content costs resources to make. Artists, nonprofit professionals, and activists are often already strapped for funding and resources. Making the podcast free means more people from around the world can access valuable information that they can use to make impact in their communities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the podcast, I am also the Founder and Managing Artistic Director of the Omaha Children\u0027s Choir. The result? I am limited in terms of how much valuable content I can create, and how quickly I can create them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith ongoing and regular support, things can change. The Voices Creating Change community can remain sustainable to help even more people passionate about changing the world through their art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW CAN YOU HELP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon, you will giving me the ability to focus more time and energy doing what I do best, and love the most - creating positive social change through the power of art and music and empowering others to do the same. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support not only means more time to work on building the Voices Creating Change community, but it also means more podcast episodes and community resources! With your help, I\u0027ll be able to develop not just more podcast episodes, but also running an online community for changemakers to connect. I will be able to give you the tools you need to implement Voices Creating Change in your own community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHERE\u0027S HOW PATREON WORKS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to pledge money to support our work, in exchange for rewards.
