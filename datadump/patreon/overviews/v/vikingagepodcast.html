They raided churches and monasteries and returned home laden in gold and silver. They established and expanded trade networks stretching from Iceland to Byzantium. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome of them conquered and settled in the new lands they encountered. Others used the riches and reputation they acquired abroad to forge kingdoms for themselves at home. Most of them gladly pocketed the profits from raiding and trading and then settled down to get married, farm their land, raise their children and boast of their exploits at feasts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis podcast is dedicated to telling the stories of these women and men. If this sounds like a story that interests you - Why don\u0027t you consider helping us tell it?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow you can help!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations will help us host the podcast, maintain the website and most importantly - buy the research materials which will ensure the show is packed to the brim with Accurate, Detailed, Utterly Fascinating Viking Age Goodness!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
