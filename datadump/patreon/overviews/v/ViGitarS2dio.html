    "summary": "Hi, everyone! I\u0027m a guitar teacher and I also create music related videos on YouTube and concerts for my students.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e1.\u00a0I created this page because I have a small guitar studio with guitar students (about 70 people) of different ages and experience but my goal is to create a real music school where we could teach also music theory, solfeggio and other instruments with a creative approach and inspire students to be genuinely interested and have love for music. That is the reason I am hoping to get help from you to buy musical equipment and gear and other attributes for the guitar school and our students.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. I also upload YouTube videos from our student concerts (Canon Rock from Concert 2016 \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZgiNnGB8m4)\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZgiNnGB8m4)\u003c/a\u003e, music cover videos and also lessons however I can\u0027t manage and have time to do what I love the most - creating music, guitar school, playing guitar and upload videos frequently because I have to finish building my house due to not having enough money to hire other people to do it. In short - when I was 20 years old I wanted to build a house by myself and started building it from scratch. The work went pretty quickly but at one point it stopped because I realized that it\u0027s not what I should do with my life because I love music the most. After more than 10 years there\u0027s still half of the work that needs to be done but then I don\u0027t have time to do anything else and my hands are becoming more and more like a worker\u0027s not guitarist\u0027s hands and are getting more immobile and it\u0027s harder to play.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI know that I need to have time to create a better learning space for my students and also to create music and lessons on YouTube that is why I\u0027m asking for your help to hire people and not be occupied only with the construction work and leave it to hired workers so I can finally upload videos and music for you and be occupied with the creation of the guitar school. Thank you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZgiNnGB8m4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
