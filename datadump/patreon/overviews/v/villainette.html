     "goal_text": "Milestone goals are a little N/A for me because I\u0027ve already made that great leap of\u00a0abandoning all commission jobs to spend 200% of my time on patreon-related projects, so I can\u0027t physically offer you any more pages or songs than I already do :\\ Which isn\u0027t to say I\u0027m fully funded by any means: I\u0027m always harrowingly scraping by financially, and every project on the table is mournfully underproduced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount of patreon subscription, wishlist purchase or in-kind donation helps me become less anxiously-dependent on sporadic merch sales and allows me to invest in better materials and equipment that helps me expand these art \u0026amp; community projects. Because of this Patreon I was able to double the size of my studio space last year, which directly created the Scout\u0027s Artillery therapy \u0026amp; self-defense community space, built all those 2017 SF Pride parade pieces, etc, and gave me room to get back into music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still relied this year on non-Patreon donations to pay for the self-defense training membership for the entire NorCal Degenderettes chapter, replace a fried laptop, buy groceries, clothes and so so much training equipment. If I could double my Patreon donations I could stop spending so much energy hitting up my already-strapped community for extra cash to keep this all running, and I could focus just on producing work. Someday I hope to have a strong enough Patreon that I could hire an intern or even support staff, outsource some production and help support the other artists in my community \u2014 realistically that\u0027s at least 6x what I earn now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy great goal is to make as much as when i was a student-funded drawing professor in 2005 before I broke free to pursue community-funded artwork. I would love to buy my own health insurance, buy a vehicle, start saving for retirement, maybe settle down in a real house or something \u2014 it seems like such an unrealistic dream at this point, but other artists have done it so I know it\u0027s possible.
