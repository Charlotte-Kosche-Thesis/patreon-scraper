    "summary": "What is to live? What is to dream? Is it to be swimming in an ocean of misery? Festering like a splinter under the skin, crawling your way out of the darkness into the light, only to be singed from the Sun, vaporized into the ether of nothingness, to be un, to be not, and not to be, sent out, energized into wave of the Megaverse? To be alive is to live up to the actualization of who you encompass. To dream is to never stop believing in the Magic and to recognize your potential. Life is not about working, growing old and fading. Life is just that, Living! Obtaining the information through living and experience! Revealing the substance through knowledge, while peeling back the layers of our ever expanding minds. With this platform I want to live my dreams and live up to my absolute potential. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent most of my life working in the restaurant industry, coupled with the entertainment world. I have many connections and bridges I\u0027ve built along the way, now I want to bring them all together through my art and podcasts. Vortex Conducting is when I will connect those dots, when I will harness the darkness and ride the waves, pull the wormholes together and travel through the rabbit hole, where I will take the listeners to meet Alice and show Wonderland. Vortex Conducting is bringing the stream of consciousness to the forefront and letting the waves crash over us, bathing us in pure inspiration. Well, if not pure inspiration, at least pure entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me and be my sponsor along this journey! Life is a team effort and so let\u0027s level up team. \"Buy the ticket, take the ride!\""

     "description": "My rent is $800 per month, plus utilities and food. I have a part time job making sandwiches currently, quite a bit of a different change from waiting tables and bartending, might add a pretty physically demanding job. I\u0027ve worked most of my life in the service industry and find myself really getting burned out. After years of chronic back pain and developing some major anxiety issues, I need to begin the process of transitioning out of the service industry. I am currently living in a great apartment that I have lived in for 4 years and find myself just barely making it ends meet. Some might say the answer is, \"Well move!\" or \"Get a roommate!\" Well, easier said than done and besides the point is that this is a great living situation, I just need to make it happen where I am. I have issues, I have emotional problems, some PTSD, but I am very self aware. I know what I need to do to be happy. Doing what I love! Making art, connecting the dots, making music and most importantly being The Vortex Conductor!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s where you all come into the equation! With my podcast I will interview people of interest, highlighting artists, musicians, actors, entertainers, and just everyday people who have an interesting story / talent. Connecting plateaus, building bridges, shedding light into my Wizard Cave and illuminating a bit of Magic for the world to hear. Help me help myself. I won\u0027t forget those folks who helped me get to the next level. Time is nigh and here I am putting my energy into the world. Please join me on this ride and let the Vortex Conducting commence!\u00a0",
