I have been working a 9 to 5 job while producing a short films and independent feature films for nearly a decade now. In 2015 I began writing comic books and something just clicked. This is the perfect medium for my ellaborate fantasies and science fictions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the intricate ideas I had for movies would cost much more than I could ever afford. By tapping into the comic book world, I am able to make my words come to life on a page through working with one or two artists rather than an entire crew. Production costs are minimal compared to independent filmmaking, and Kickstarter allows me to raise the funding for Art, production, and shipping, all while exposing my writing and creativity to a broad audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always considered myself a writer. I went to college without a clue as to what I wanted to pursue as a career. I eventually settled into studying popular culture because of my interest in the meanings behind art, music, and film.  My degree taught me how to write, but my stories have come to me through living life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have run a number of succesful Kickstarters for two separate comic book series, and will continue to do so while creating exclusive content for the Village Comics Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently working part-time for my local newspaper the Wednesday Journal, I am a full-time comic book writer and creator.\u003cbr\u003e",
