    "summary": "Welcome nerds! So what\u0027s going on with this whole thing then? Good question! Basically I like making stuff, little programs, educational stuff, and varies multi-media entertainment. I\u0027m a software engineering, and I love the fact that I can come up with an idea, build it, and then use it. Well let\u0027s get into details, what exactly am I using Patreon to support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess there are three main things I am currently working on. My video game, open source projects, and software engineering education videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might have seen in the past I was streaming video game development and writing development blogs for it. I want to start doing that. Due to a lot of things happening in my life I had to put it on the back burner for far too long. Right now my computer is not good enough to stream. So for now, until I get my new computer up and running, I\u0027ll have to work offline and just write about what I\u0027m doing and put out builds every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow my video game will be the main focus of my time, but I like working on little projects from time to time. So on Tuesday and Thursday I plan on working on whatever I feel like, throwing it up on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/vifs\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egithub\u003c/a\u003e, and then writing about it. Now I have a bunch of random ideas of things I could make, but I\u0027m always willing to take suggestions on software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly I have started a weekly web series where I cover\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuZbl_nNJIgT4boeqA_Vmz1nXdhFK729g\"\u003etopics on software engineering\u003c/a\u003e. These videos will come out every Wednesday. I enjoy sharing knowledge and if you can\u0027t tell, I\u0027m passionate about programming. The goal of this is to teach people, so I\u0027m always looking for suggestions of topics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, my free time is limited, I only have 2 or 3 hours to work on stuff every day. With your help I would love to spend more time working on all these projects! So thank you so much for anything you can give, even if you could just spread the word!\u00a0"
