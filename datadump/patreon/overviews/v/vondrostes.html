My dream is to someday be able to support myself solely through my writing and other creative endeavors, and I\u0027m hoping you can help me make that happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this Patreon is pretty simple: I want to give you guys a chance to support me and my writing in a way that\u0027s both simple and rewarding for you, as faithful readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy not just write original fiction?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile writing original fiction is something I am actively pursuing (you can read the first three novellas in my original urban fantasy series\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.arcsismedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), I feel that fanfiction can be a gateway to discovering interesting and new ideas. Eventually I would like to take some of my major fanworks and transform them into original works--following heavy conceptual edits and rewrites, of course--but for now I would like people to be able to enjoy them as they are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also, quite frankly, a little difficult in this fandom-centric era to generate interest in new original franchises from unestablished creators.
