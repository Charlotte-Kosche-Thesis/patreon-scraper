    "summary": "Hello everyone!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is Vellum, and I\u0027m here seeking a way to focus on some of my more adult artwork. Patreon helps me serve that purpose by providing a monetary way that my work can be supported. So thank you firstly for considering supporting me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what you\u0027ll see here, my adult artwork focuses on werewolves, monsters, and other anthropomorphic fantasy creatures, many of which coming from the furry fandom. The themes surrounding my work include Soft Vore, Hypnosis, BDSM, and a variety of other subjects. (See the list of things I WON\u0027T do at the bottom of this text)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo thank you all more directly, I have a variety of benefits for supporting me! Please see the rewards section, and descriptions below to learn more. Thank you all for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Mug\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAccess to the character mug allows you to send me a character you would like me to put in a creature pool for me to choose from. What this means is that many of my pieces will feature characters from this pool, and this is your opportunity to put your character in it!\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is not a raffle, or random choice. I\u0027ll be selecting from this pool personally. While I cannot predict when I\u0027ll use this character, I intend to go through this pool repeatedly, and variably. Meaning I will not favor one character over another, your character will be used just as much as anyone else! \u003cbr\u003e\nYour characters may be used in single pieces, or they may also be featured as a short cameo in a comic!\u003cbr\u003e\nThat in mind, here are a few suggestions when submitting your character!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n-Keep it simple: I don\u0027t mind doing complex characters, but balance what you\u0027re hoping for. The more complex a character is, the less likely they\u0027ll be chosen for extended projects. If I am working on a 20 page comic, and I\u0027m choosing between a timber-wolf phase werewolf, and a lizard-fox-tiger hybrid with three polka-dotted tails and tattoo sleeves, I\u0027ll likely choose the werewolf.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n-What\u0027s your fancy?: When you submit your character, let me know all of the DO\u0027s and DON\u0027T\u0027s for them, the things you hope to see them in, and the things you don\u0027t want them in. I\u0027ll follow your requests, and will not put your character in any projects you would prefer them not be in. On that note: look at my content, make sure you know what I regularly do, and what I don\u0027t do. I won\u0027t bite your head off for suggesting something new! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-1-2 character limit.* This has some very important notes on it, so please read carefully if you intend to submit more than 1 character (max. 2). I put this here primarily for the reason that I know some would prefer their characters only be used with one other particular character, perfectly understandable. You\u0027re welcome to submit up to 2 characters regardless of your reasons. Just note that as I rotate through patron\u0027s characters, both of your characters will count as ONE in the rotation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTo clarify, here\u0027s an example. As I\u0027m rotating through characters, perhaps a good project comes along and I decide to use both of your characters together in the piece. Then I\u0027ll continue on through the rotation of others\u0027 characters as normal.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if a perfect project comes along for ONE of your characters by themselves, I will then not use your other character until the rotation gets all the way back to you. So please don\u0027t expect one project featuring just one of your characters, and then immediately after, another project featuring your other character. The rotation of characters is based on the patron, not the characters themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStream\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll be streaming once a month (or more once we reach higher tiers!!!) all requests from patrons! Can be SFW or NSFW per my regular adult artwork policies. \u003cbr\u003e\nRequests will be first come, first serve. Limit one request per person per stream (unless we get through everyone\u0027s first request, then we\u0027ll start over!)\u003cbr\u003e\nThese streams will be scheduled ahead of time so that you can plan ahead!\u003cbr\u003eThese streams are not private, as the public may join in if they\u0027d like. Patrons of the $15 tier or higher get free requests, and the highest priority. All other patrons still get priority over the public, but must pay $25/request minus their pledge (i.e. if you pledged $5/month, you only have to pay $20 for a request).\u003cbr\u003eIf we have enough time, we may do public requests at $25/request. Streams typically last 3-5 hours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe BIG Mug\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis tier level works just like the paint mug level, except that your character will now be considered for a feature role in comics. I\u0027m planning for most comics to be about 7-15 pages, though some may be longer or shorter.\u003cbr\u003eWhile your character is being featured in a comic, they will not be considered for illustrations or other cameos. Their job for the duration of the comic is being the featured role, they need a break every now and then!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThings I will NOT be drawing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get this out of the way, here are a few things you definitely will NOT see coming from me:\u003cbr\u003e-Watersports/scat\u003cbr\u003e-Gore\u003cbr\u003e-Ferals*/Bestiality\u003cbr\u003e-Pedophilia (in any form)\u003cbr\u003e-Incest\u003cbr\u003e-Snuff\u003cbr\u003e-Genitalia/Soul/Anal Vore\u003cbr\u003e-Hard Vore/Digestion\u003cbr\u003e-Hyper (abnormally large/exaggerated appendages)\u003cbr\u003e-Rape (Sure, BDSM role-play is fine, but all imagery of sexual intercourse will be consensual)\u003cbr\u003e-MLP, Lion King, Sonic, etc. (Children-show/movie characters in adult situations)\u003cbr\u003e-Anthropomorphic Marine animals (Not to bash them at all, I\u0027m just completely inadequate to drawing anthropomorphic sharks, orcas, fish, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e-Hermaphrodite anatomy. (Trans is absolutely okay! Anatomy with both male/female genitalia however is just too difficult for me to represent well)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Note that I will draw quadrupedal characters for vore scenes, but I will not draw quadrupedal characters for sexual situations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still learning a lot about adult artwork, and so this is not a comprehensive list. I will NOT do any of those listed themes, but there may be more I discover down the road that I will be unwilling to draw.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis content shown on this account will be for adults ONLY.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy supporting me on patreon, you agree that you are of 18 years of age or older!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
