However I had to\nrealize that the type of work I do is not sustainable with regard to my current\nworking and private life.\u003cbr\u003eBecause of that I need to get to a place\nwhere I can create enough income from my animation work, in order to\nreduce the working times on my dayjob accordingly so to bring everything in balance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere comes Patreon into play!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn order to free up my schedule\nto produce more and better animations, \u003cem\u003eI\nneed your help!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating\nanimations is very time consuming.
