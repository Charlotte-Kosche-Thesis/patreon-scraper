I\u0027m using Patreon to bring people together, to share ideas and to keep my lifestyle and my livelihood connected. I\u0027m crowdfunding my writing and my Patrons get to read all of my poetry, the published and unpublished, they get to see the process, the ideas and the person behind it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write poetry, short stories, novellas, television, novels, playscripts, screenplays...pretty much anything that includes words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you buy me a cup of coffee so I can keep working?\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the cost of a cappuccino you could help me carry on creating original, innovative content. And as a thank you, you get to see unique poetry and prose that no one else has access to, you get to find out about new projects first and even have a hand in deciding what I do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAccess, exclusivity and involvement. All the time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vicklinde.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dscn2405.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"//vicklinde.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/npl1.jpg?w=580\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be bits of prose, some short stories and flash fiction as well as inspirations and community-led projects. My patrons only pay me when I post something new. Not everything I post is charged for, I share smaller things without my patrons paying anything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep the community that I have built on my website - the readers and the writers, reviewers and critics, enthusiasts and beginners. I want this to be a new way to share and a new way to create. \u00a0I want you all to feel free to join in, comment and critique, ask for poems you\u0027d like to see and ask for advice on your own work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//vicklinde.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dscn10952.jpg?w=580\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy poetry has always been an interactive, fun and exciting way of writing. I did a project called \u0027Three Random Words\u0027 where strangers gave me three words that I had to include in a poem. This has since become the basis for my first full collection \"Just Three Words\" published by NewCon Press. I wrote a long poem, broke it into parts and sent it around the world on postcards, I write from prompts and create Found Poetry from existing articles and prose. Everything is unique, original and (most importantly) shared.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had three books published as well as having poems in anthologies and magazines.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCome and join in.

There is also a lot of commentary, links to other writers and creatives, articles and suggested reads as well as reviews.
