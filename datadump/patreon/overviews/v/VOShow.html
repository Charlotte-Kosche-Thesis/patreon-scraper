Being a long time fan of Voice Over Artists in Animation, Video Games and Film, I decided that this talented pool of amazing entertainers should have a Talk Show platform where the fans of Voice Over can see and hear their favorite Voice Over Artists, learn all about them, learn how they got their start, hear about what they\u0027ve done and what they may have coming up. Voice Over artists do an incredible job and their voices are heard and loved by millions of people, but they are not often seen in front of the camera.... until now! Along with my co-host, Xavier Gonzalez, we aim to give you an exclusive inside look at the world of voice acting, that is as informative and interesting as it is light-hearted and fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we close in on nearly a hundred videos to date, check out just some of the fun we\u0027ve had below.
