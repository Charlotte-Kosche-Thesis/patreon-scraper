    "summary": "I am a Brooklyn-raised working musician, singing and accompanying myself on guitar. I perform songs of the 1930s, 40s and 50s and write my own pieces influenced by the jazz and country sounds of that era. To me, the romance of this music is in its smokey, warm, authentic tones. These tones are so powerful because they are recorded without artifice and convey the live setting in which they\u0027re being produced. No overdubs, no synthetic additions or fixing it in post-production. Just a crooning voice, a plaintive trumpet, the vital interplay between a guitar chunking out quarter notes and a drummer tapping out triplets on the snare. The humanity of these old recordings sits right at the surface because they capture a literal moment in time. Please help me keep this music--living, breathing, social music--alive. \u003cstrong\u003eI will repay your generosity with exclusive recordings, video performances, lead sheets and monthly updates on my musical development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhy do I need your help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVintage\u00a0equipment\u00a0produces authentic sounds\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIs there anything more comforting than the crackle of an old record? The warmth in her voice when Billie Holiday sang \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thSfGPZGmnQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLover Man\u003c/a\u003e\u0027 in 1941? Of course Billie brings much of the warmth herself but that\u0027s only part of the story. These records were made differently than they are today, with different equipment. I have begun experimenting, using vintage microphones and amplifiers to create new sounds captured by the tools of a bygone age. In this recording of \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/vilray/my-echo-my-shadow-and-me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWe Three\u003c/a\u003e\u0027 I used a 1930s Amperite ribbon microphone to record a 1936 Volu-Tone amplifier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese tools are expensive but, for the most part, not more expensive than their modern equivalents. It\u0027s a worthy investment to put them in the hands of passionate musicians with ideas for how to use them rather than eBay collectors who\u0027ll leave them dusty in the den.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA real recording is always a collaboration\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am so humbled by the hugely positive response to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/vilray\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e/\u003ca href=\"http://www.vilraysings.com/sounds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evilraysings.com\u003c/a\u003e recordings. These are DIY experiments of mine designed to help me understand the nuances of recording music and it\u0027s been so heartening to hear people say they like them! That said, I am itching to get into a studio or live space and record with some collaborators. Paying engineers, producers, and other musicians to help me realize some of my grander musical ideas is a longstanding dream of mine. If you\u0027ve enjoyed the recordings you\u0027ve heard so far, please contribute to better recordings going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking music takes time (lots and lots of time)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eComposing, arranging, recording, writing out music, warming-up, listening, practicing!--it\u0027s all vital to the final product and it all has to be done when I\u0027m not working a job. Your support allows me the time to pay my dues to the music itself and produce content that you can be proud to listen to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read, listen and contribute to my projects! I hope we can have a rich dialogue about this music and all music. \u00a0-Vilray\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
