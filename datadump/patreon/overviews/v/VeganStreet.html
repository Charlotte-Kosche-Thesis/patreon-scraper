    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAt Vegan Street, we tell thought-provoking and inspirational stories and create beautiful and compelling images.\u003c/strong\u003e We love to share great stories and pictures, but that\u0027s not why we do this. Frankly, we want to change the world. In fact, all our work is created to help usher in one of the most profound and essential cultural shifts the world has ever known. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery year, more than 55 billion land animals are killed for food.\u003c/strong\u003e Besides the horrendous brutality and waste of life, this diet is killing our planet and destroying our health.\u00a0So we\u0027re trying to expand the vegan culture and community as well as shift the collective consciousness away from conceptualizing other animals as ours to use. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe feel the best way we can make this happen is to create practical but artistic and creative works that help people become and stay vegan, by nurturing, strengthening and promoting the vegan lifestyle and community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do this by producing and posting our popular\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eVegan Street Memes\u003c/strong\u003e, which are mini-posters that describe the various reasons to become and stay vegan. We also write essays on the \u003cstrong\u003eVegan Street Blog\u003c/strong\u003e that explore various aspects of vegan life and thought, sometimes satirically, sometimes seriously. And to continue our community building tradition, we provide original and easy (and delicious!) recipes, eco-friendly home,\u00a0personal care and vegan living tips, book, product and film reviews, interviews with a diversity of figures in the vegan movement and much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe put it all out there for for free so people can use and share it as they wish\u003c/strong\u003e. Collectively, these works have been shared millions of times, and many people and organizations have used our memes, essays, recipes and other posts to help them articulate their own views to others and persuade their audiences to consider a shift towards veganism. These materials are used in everything from virtual outreach to presentations, public display to educational materials and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy getting support from our community, we\u0027ll be able to devote even more of our attention to this important work, and even expand into more areas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your help, we can keep sending our compelling vegan messages into the world.\u003c/strong\u003e"

     "description": "We have some big plans to form\u00a0a network of vegan advocates around the world and provide the tools, training and inspiration to expand the vegan culture of their own communities. We would present webinars and online classes and create workbooks and other educational materials, and we\u0027d\u00a0travel across the country and speak and display our works at festivals, conferences and other events. As we get closer to this goal, we\u0027ll present more detailed descriptions of this work.\u00a0",

This content we provide is free and it takes a lot of time - planning, researching, creating - to produce. This level of support would help to cover the time we spend on crafting our materials and allow us to keep producing work at the level we\u0027re going and perhaps even more.",

We have the ability and desire to add YouTube videos to the memes, essays, recipes and other content. We just need better equipment and more time to devote to the effort. Having a better camera would also greatly improve the food photography for our recipes and all the other photography we shoot. We could also create audiobooks and other audio content.\u00a0Also, our website is in need of an update that would improve navigability and interactivity. All of the above would allow us to reach an even larger audience and provide them with an even more access to compelling materials and inspiration.",
