I feel the same way.  ORION (Online Resource Integrated Optimized Network) will be created to simplify the difficult by creating an online app to allow you to create your own video games from within a video game environment, share it with others and finally drag and drop your dreams in to reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy not have fun 100% of the time rather than dreaming of fun while you are waiting to get over the next technical hurdle or just giving up completely and pretending to be happy playing another game while you wait or worse settle for rendering still images?  What the world needs is a fun \"drag and drop\" interactive way for non-programmers to design their own worlds, characters, assets and artificial intelligence.  ORION will be an online place where users, artists and programmers can share \"drag and drop\" assets and building blocks to create real-time interactive simulations or video games using the \u003ca href=\"http://unity3d.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eunity 3d\u003c/a\u003e video game online engine.  The unity engine is $1,200, the mmorpg creation engine design cost is $50,000 and the the yearly web site fees are $2,400.  I would like to obtain starting capitol to buy the engine, pay to secure unity3d programmer technical help for the basic mmorpg creation tool complete with interactive physics/collision detections and secure website credit card programming design and to pay for the first three years of the web hosting fees for a total of $58,400. Please feel free to get involved by paying me via \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epaypal\u003c/a\u003e at veronicazemenovich@yahoo.com or write to me and say money is irrelevant and attach your solution to an email or let me know the world has changed and send me a link to a site that is already doing this.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have analyzed the success of \u003ca href=\"https://us.battle.net/account/creation/wow/signup/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWorld of Warcraft\u003c/a\u003e which has 11 million followers who each pay $15 per month for a yearly revenue of $1.9 billion.  In comparison the \u003ca href=\"http://www.episcopalchurch.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEpiscopal Church\u003c/a\u003e of America only has 4 million followers.  Despite the popularity of WOW it is a very boring interactive environment and I was frustrated immediately that I could not at all import my own \u003ca href=\"http://www.daz3d.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eassets\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAI\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eanimations\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/mars/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eworlds\u003c/a\u003e.  I turned to \u003ca href=\"http://secondlife.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSecond Life\u003c/a\u003e which does allow me to import these things but the servers are mismanaged which caused lag much in the same way \u003ca href=\"http://www.aol.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eaol\u003c/a\u003e was mismanaged in the 90s by overselling modem access to it\u0027s users.  Server cost is finite and is integrally related to user joy.  SL and WOW both suffer from lack of vision regarding user joy which is inversely proportional to lag.  This project will determine how many users can be on a server interacting at 30 frames per second in a 3d interactive environment and subdivide the total costs.  This subdivision will become the monthly basis for the user access fee.  SL does not have monthly fees and LAG is rampant.  WOW has monthly fees but is a poor low resolution 3d environment. \u003ca href=\"http://www.funnyadultgamesplay.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAchat\u003c/a\u003e is much higher resolution but lacks WOW and SL interactivity for $50 per year.  \u003ca href=\"http://3dxchat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e3DX Chat\u003c/a\u003e is $91 a year and is much more interactive, has low lag and would be an acceptable engine for artists, programmers and users to interact.  The ORION mission will always strive to achieve the lowest lag with the highest interactivity while communicating this level of service transparently with full disclosure to the customer to justify the monthly fees. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe website will not be a traditional website and will from its inception be a 3d video game which is currently available using the \u003ca href=\"http://unity3d.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eunity3d\u003c/a\u003e game engine website plugin.  All assets will be browsed in game and all credit card transactions will happen in game.  In this way the user will be able to seamlessly add assets to the existing 3d world. \u003ca href=\"http://renderosity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRenderosity.com\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://daz3d.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDAZ3d.com\u003c/a\u003e currently have over 10,000 artists that create 3d assets for the victoria 5 base character which has been optimized for video game environments.  The creation of ORION will give these 10,000 vendors an interactive online storefront to sell their products which is missing from the market as of today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/video/72850/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSkyrim\u003c/a\u003e is currently the most interactive video game environment for artists to easily generate assets and make them available to the general public but the creation interface is still outside the game interface.  ORION will improve upon all of these well established technologies and human resources by uniting them online in a fun engaging interactive environment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent the last 10 years beating my head against a wall trying to simplify the video game creation process while simultaneously watching the industry becoming increasing complex.  I have taken c++ courses, bought $30,000 of 3d assets, learned 3ds max, java script, hired programmers to do it for me and said to myself... \"When does the fun start?\"  Creating video games is laborious.  I want ORION to be to videogames what youtube was to video.  I want to reduce the technical hurdles of the video game creation process to unleash the human potential to drag and drop dreams into our world. \u003ca href=\"http://unity3d.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUnity3d\u003c/a\u003e has a drag and drop interactive environment and an established programmer community for hire.  I pitched my idea to that community and secured a $25,000 price tag to create my online store/game.  My current web hosting company charges me $200 per month for my site and charged me $10,000 to create it complete with a credit card system.  I secured a quote from them for the interactive upgrades I mentioned above for $15,000. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSocial media has taught me that when you simplify technology for the common man you create a dense network of global human communication that has the power to bring down the government of \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEgypt\u003c/a\u003e by 10 people tweeting.  \"Charley bit me\" on youtube.com has 100 million hits.  One out of 14 people on the planet are on facebook.  No one needs to be a webmaster to post on youtube .  250,000 people bought Skyrim on 11/11/2012 on \u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://store.steampowered.com/\u003c/a\u003e including myself because the game is fun but more importantly because of the revolutionary interactive editor that empowers the common man to create and post content for the game. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mention all of the technology above simply to demonstrate that all of the pieces needed to make ORION happen currently exist.  I simply want to put them together and elevate social media from video and text to the level of 3d game design.  The implications are staggering and will allow everyone to post, interact and be entertained by our dreams.  Please accept my proposal."
