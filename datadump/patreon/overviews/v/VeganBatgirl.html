    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eHi, my name is Connie Spence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Over a year ago, I bought some revolutionary equipment and hacked it to work outside that projects \u003cstrong\u003eGIANT VEGAN MESSAGES\u003c/strong\u003e across the USA.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eSome call this The Vegan Batman Light.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 In the last year I have used this equipment over 75x or 75 nights.\u00a0 The light is super cool in person, it can get over 7 stories in diameter and messages can be seen 1/4 mile away or further.\u00a0 And the interesting thing about my form of activism is that it doesn\u0027t upset people as much as holding a sign would, as people\u0027s initial thought is WOWOWOWOW look at the light.\u00a0 It captivates kids that see it, it captivates adults...it\u0027s really a sight to see!\u00a0 So because of the \"cool\" factor, my conversations that follow are usually very productive.\u00a0 My personality is one that is someone that is very meticulous...so I not only spend a lot of time researching laws and printing them out, but also spend a lot of time finding walls and new styles of activism to reach the masses for a low cost.\u00a0 Also, I\u0027ve been told that I\u0027ve very good at drawing people into conversation and getting them to think or move towards Veganism.\u00a0 I think the recipe you get with me is someone who is:\u00a0 Physically Strong to Carry the Equipment, Fearless with Cops, Knowledgable with Laws and Convincing with Passerby\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI initially tried to create Vegan Batman Light Chapters in different cities, but realized that finding groups that were dedicated to this activism was tough because there is a lot to it.\u00a0 Heavy equipment, finding blank walls, dealing with Police all the time and having some hecklers along the way.\u00a0 So, since I spend countless hours and my own money trying to do as much as I can, someone suggested that I create a Patreon to give those throughout the community that believe in me and my style a way to execute even more creative ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I spend about $200-$400/mo of my own money on activism.\u00a0 I had a recent donation that helped me upgrade my equipment and buy 2 new rounds of Messages, but that will run out soon, and I still have so many great ideas and places that I could take this type of activism too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work very hard for Veganism, as I\u0027m sure you do too.\u00a0 I also work very hard for my money, as I\u0027m sure you do too.\u00a0 This is not asking for anything that you can\u0027t give.\u00a0 It\u0027s only a request that if you believe in my motivation, that you will see I push SOOO hard for Veganism on a weekly basis and your donations will go to multiply what I can and have done on my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers and thank you for your support!"
