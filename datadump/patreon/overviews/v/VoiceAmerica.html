     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I? I am a member of the fast growing un-silent majority that is sick of the insanity that\u2019s been going on in this country for far too long. What insanity am I referring to? Where should I begin?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo start with, what ever happened to common sense in this country? When did the American population become so ignorant that they believe almost anything they hear from their favorite politician or talking heads in the media without first doing an ounce of due diligence? When was a constitutional amendment passed that says people now have the \u201cright\u201d not to be \u201coffended\u2026\u201d ever\u2026 by anyone or anything? Furthermore, when people do get \u201coffended\u201d by something, when did their right to \u201cpeaceably assemble\u201d and protest, become a right to riot, or cause harm to others?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhatever happened to, \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch?\u201d When did equal opportunity morph into equal results? When did it become the \u201cin\u201d thing for everyone to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of something? When did personal accountability cease to matter? When did it start to make sense that as a nation, we could spend our way out of being bankrupt?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToday, more and more \u201creal news\u201d is being labeled \u201cfake news\u201d as part of a larger agenda on the part of both the mainstream media, and their accomplices in social media. You know what\u0027s really disturbing? When did we reach a point in American society when someone who merely questions the statements of \u003cu\u003e\u003cem\u003eknown liars\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/u\u003e is branded with a scarlet letter, and labeled a \u201cconspiracy theorist?\u201d \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I think I have all the answers to the issues I either write or talk about? No, of course not. In fact, I would venture to say I have far less answers than I have questions. The only thing I claim to know with 100% certainty, is that the very institutions Americans \u201cshould\u201d be able to rely on for critical and important news, rarely ever tell the truth anymore\u2026 ever! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u2019s not that the mainstream media lies about every single story they report on, but they almost never convey anything remotely resembling the entire truth on much either. What concerns me most, and why I\u2019ve decided to speak out, is that nowhere near enough other people in this country are asking tough questions about some of the nonsense that comes from either the woefully corrupt and dishonest mainstream media, or from politicians in Washington. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor the record, let\u2019s be clear; so much of what is communicated to \u201cWe the People\u201d by the very institutions Americans have every reason to expect the truth from, is total, complete, and utter nonsense. Nonsense! Countless studies have shown that confidence in the mainstream media is at an all-time low right now, but it\u2019s not enough for people to know the media is not trustworthy. Why? Because for many people, the mainstream media\u2019s version of a story is the only version they ever hear. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
