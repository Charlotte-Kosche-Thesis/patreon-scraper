By night, I become the tumblr\u0027ing dynamo of erotica you\u0027re probably familiar with if you\u0027ve found your way here. I also become my alter ego, Virginia de Volanges, writer of erotic art stories in the grand style of Henry Miller, Anais N\u00efn, Guillaume Apollinaire and the Marquis de Sade (on one of his gentler days). Examples of my writing can be found \u003ca href=\"http://lesbiancockslut.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon my website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a grad student, I make very little money -- not enough to pay rent and eat in the very expensive urban area in which I live. I\u0027m facing having to move away from my school, which would make it far harder to finish my degree and take me away from my family and friends. But there \u003cem\u003eis \u003c/em\u003eone thing I do that some people seem to like, and that I would love to do for a living: write fiction, and especially erotica so hot it\u0027ll have you stumbling to the freezer for an ice pack. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport from my patrons, if it becomes substantial enough, should allow me to give up the side projects I\u0027ve been working to stay afloat, and allow me to concentrate on what I should be doing: writing. Even a low level of support would take some of the burden of my student loans off me, which would help me enormously in terms of being able to concentrate on the real work: art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny erotic story update will be \u003ca href=\"http://lesbiancockslut.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eupdated to my website,\u003c/a\u003e and you will hear about it through an email from patreon. No story update will ever be under 1000 words, and I will try to ensure that they are never entirely overtaken by the plot-monster. My goal is to update about four times a month, but I\u0027m hoping to update more often than that (remember, you can cap your monthly donation at a certain amount, so that if I update more often than expected, you don\u0027t pay any more than \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e expected).\u003cbr\u003e"
