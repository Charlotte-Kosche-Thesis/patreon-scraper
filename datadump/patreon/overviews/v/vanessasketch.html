In the world of Arcane Eon, magic is very real, both in nature itself and in the people. The Venetronus Order, an international organization, protects and monitors magic in all its forms. Adepts, magic users, must either receive special license or serve as a Venetronus once identified. Three Venetroni, Mariel Seier, Nolen Silver, and Jase Allgood, have been tasked with tracking down the first ever thief into the Order\u0027s Archives, where almost every bit of magical knowledge and artifacts are kept. On Jase\u0027s advice they start by seeking information from a former Venetronus, Vera Malnory, who works as a bootlegger in the floating metropolis of Zedor City. While the Venetroni track down their thief, Vera\u0027s got her own problems to contend with. Just what the thief is after, and why, will change their beliefs in magic, and maybe even their belief in the Venetronus Order itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.arcaneeon.com/comic/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/AEC4P124.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been working on this comic for over a decade now, and I\u0027m extremely excited to finally be able to bring it to all of you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 120px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd this will be free to read for everyone?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYep! \u003ca href=\"http://www.arcaneeon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArcane Eon\u003c/a\u003e is free for everyone to enjoy.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 160px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ewill my\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003epatronage do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAllow me to prioritize Arcane Eon, so I don\u0027t need to take as much freelance work in order to pay the bills.
