One of my main goals has been researching and trying to understand wisdom, values, and morality. More than just a self-concerned pastime, my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.ValuesoftheWise.com\"\u003ewww.ValuesoftheWise.com\u003c/a\u003e features three books I worked very hard to create; many free resources such as a fantastic database of quotations on values, ethics, and wisdom; two sophisticated tools for discovering your true values and your unique view of morality; and 80 podcasts about values and ethics. \u003cbr\u003eI have hopes of sending more books out into the world and inviting greater numbers of people to utilize my free website, but you know what that takes: time, energy, and money. \u003cem\u003eYou can help me with the resources I need\u003c/em\u003e, if you see fit and if you would be so kind. You would be much appreciated. You get goodies in return!"

Growing up in Los Angeles, he grappled with sociocultural, familial, and psychological issues that led to much of the insight he has today. Merchey earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \u003cem\u003esumma cum laude \u003c/em\u003ein psychology and social behavior from the University of California Irvine, and was inducted into\u003cem\u003ePhi Beta Kappa\u003c/em\u003efor excellence in liberal scholarship.He went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in clinical psychology from California State University Fullerton and obtain thousands hours of experience counseling clients of all types. \u003cbr\u003eWhile pursuing California\u2019s Marriage and Family Therapist license, Jason became intrigued by studying wisdom, values, and ethics\u2014so much so that he created the Values of the Wise\u2122 website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.valuesofthewise.com/\"\u003ewww.ValuesoftheWise.com\u003c/a\u003e) and book series as a way to encourage not only himself but also his clients to find the insight, consolation, and wisdom from great quotations representing our intellectual heritage.\u003cbr\u003eMerchey\u0027s first book was a book of quotations titled \u003cem\u003eValues of the Wise: Profound and Witty Words of Wisdom to Inspire and Empower Us (2003)\u003c/em\u003e. He followed that up with three similar quote books. He has since published three well-regarded, top-shelf books on the concept of \u201c\u003cem\u003ea life of value\u003c/em\u003e,\u201d all of which primarily utilize quotes, stories and dialogues about values and wisdom as the basis for improving one\u2019s life and gaining valuable insight. \u003cbr\u003eJason moved to the Charleston, SC, area for career opportunities and lives there with his wife and pets. A lifelong learner and voracious reader, he is pursuing a graduate certificate in philosophy and ethics from Harvard University Extension. In addition to his volunteer work and real-estate investing, Merchey tutors college students in writing and academic success.\u003cbr\u003e",
