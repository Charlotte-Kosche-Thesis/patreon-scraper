    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHello all! \u00a0Welcome to my Patreon page! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Sean Schafianski A.K.A. VGMRemastered. I\u0027m a professional music producer, composer, and arranger. I began making covers of video game music way back in 2008, when I knew virtually nothing about audio production. Now, I\u0027m producing very high quality mixes for your listening pleasure. My covers span all types of genres, including \u003cstrong\u003eJazz, Orchestral, Rock, Pop, Metal, and more.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIt has been quite a journey up to this point. And now it\u0027s time to take it one step further!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo games and music are my passion and I would love nothing more than to be able to make a living doing what I love. \u003cstrong\u003eWith Patreon, this dream could become a reality!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Your patronage would support me in this endeavor, but don\u0027t think you\u0027re not getting anything out of it! There are plenty of rewards to be had! \u00a0Any support you can give goes directly to the channel and upgrading my equipment, giving me the opportunity to ramp up the quality and give you better mixes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reward system is entirely dependent on how much you decide to pledge. There is a different reward per tier and the higher tiers include all rewards from previous pledge amounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOnly remixes and remasters will be charged. \u003c/strong\u003eOriginal compositions will not be. I try to upload videos at least once a month, depending on work load. My mixes take a while to get to a level that I\u0027m comfortable publishing. Only the best for you guys! \u003cstrong\u003eWith Patreon, you can set a cap on how much you pledge per month, so there will be no surprises!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEDGING IS ENTIRELY OPTIONAL. \u003c/strong\u003eThough, if you decide to support my channel, I can\u0027t thank you enough. You are awesome!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
