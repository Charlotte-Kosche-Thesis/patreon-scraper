Whatever social media you can think of, I am on it to help you have access to my art in the way you prefer. throughout the month you will receive any amount or combination of my art. examples: photos created by me and not released anywhere else,\u00a0time lapse videos of my days (creating, cooking, walking out in the woods, sitting by the fire, sleeping, baths, etc),\u00a0mp3 files where i talk frankly about how i\u0027m feeling, what i am thinking about, what i am working on, questions i have, interesting things i have found, ideas i am rolling around in my head,\u00a0\u00a0peaceful and artfully done bubblebath with a soundtrack of me singing things which i have never released before. you will receive journal entries that no one else sees, as well. it could be anything. whatever i am feeling up for at the time. little weird movies, animations, songs, really virtually anything i do. whatever i am up to each month YOU will see it and be able to download it and save it if you want. i will also actively participate in talking in the forum which is members only :) if i go live on a webcam anywhere , i will send only you the link! literally everything that i create that i can upload to here will be available to members only! sometimes I will create physical objects, you will get 1st dibs on anything I make. I will also autograph it for you (or autograph anything for you) if you pay the postage for it to be shipped to me and back to you. Sometimes i create one of a kind books full of Polaroids and found objects. Sometimes I make weird hats. Sometimes I will create a limited quantity art magazine, print, or sculpture. Sometimes I will go on a trip and mail you random surprises and postcards (if you provide me a mailing address). I really do not limit myself in what I do so being with me and supporting me is an adventure :) EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS! my family lives on only 1,300 a month. so thank you!!\u00a0Also realize you can cancel this anytime to make this a one time payment and your membership can be completely private.",
