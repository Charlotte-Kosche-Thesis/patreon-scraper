Courtney Floyd, here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a PhD Candidate in nineteenth-century literature and print culture and I want to talk to you about Victorian writers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve probably heard about Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, and maybe even the Bront\u00eb sisters. But what about the rest of them? They wrote the novels that inspired Indiana Jones and those murder mystery shows you like to watch on TV. They created the characters who inspired the Evil Queen in Walt Disney\u0027s Snow White and popular detectives and femme fatales. They lived on ostrich farms and traveled the world and struggled with addiction to prescribed medications and kept mistresses--or mister-esses, in some cases. *crickets chirp* I\u0027m so sorry about that. It just slipped out. Anyway...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWouldn\u0027t you like to know\u003cstrong\u003e their\u003c/strong\u003e names? Aren\u0027t you just a little bit curious about who they were and what they wrote?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf so, I\u0027ve got some good news: now you can. Tune in to my podcast, Victorian Scribblers, to hear me chat about the lives of lesser-known Victorian writers, read and comment on their work, and throw in a few surprise mini-casts along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe podcast is always free, but if you like what you hear contributions help pay for the website and research costs!
