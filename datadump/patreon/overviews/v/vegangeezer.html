    "summary": "Hi my name is Martin (nickname Bob, you choose which one you like the most!) and I\u0027ve had the \u0027Vegan Geezer\u0027 YouTube channel since 2014 where I have been promoting veganism with lifestyle videos, poems, speeches and other inspiring content that would help display veganism in a positive light.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs many of you may know, I have recently stopped working in my full time job, and since being vegan I\u0027ve become increasingly passionate about putting my time and energy into activity and projects that would help promote veganism - namely through my YouTube channel and giving speeches.\u003cbr\u003e\nEven with what little time I managed to put into this around my full time job and around looking after my family, I still received so many positive messages from people telling me that they\u0027ve gone vegan which just confirmed that what I was doing was worth it. Therefore the more time and energy I can put into this the better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been doing various talks around the UK at vegan events, and speaking to a whole year group of students at a school in Bristol, England. Since doing the school talk and uploading it to my channel, I\u0027ve had an increasing number of people that have contacted me requesting that I come to their school and do a talk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBack in 2014, I got in contact with Gary Yourofsky asking him how he got to speak in educational institutions, as it was where I felt my energy could be best served for veganism, so it gives me great joy that I am given these opportunities currently.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI feel extremely blessed to be in a position to not only be vegan, but also to be able to spread the message effectively, and make a difference, as I feel it is very much my calling to do this. I am unbelievably grateful for all of the support I receive from my vegan family on my YouTube channel, through other social media platforms, emails, and from those who have taken the time to attend a speech (some of you have been to more than one which puts a big smile on my face). I have always responded to every single message, email and YouTube comment I have ever received (to my knowledge), as I recognise that those who support me are a big reason to why I feel inspired to carry on as I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI look forward to sharing more of my journey with you all. Together we are stronger, and have a powerful amplified voice that can create some proper big ripples of change, which in turn will become a tidal wave of compassion.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMuch love all :)\u003cbr\u003e"
