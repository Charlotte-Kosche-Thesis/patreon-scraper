    "summary": "Very Bad\nWizards is a collaboration between\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.class.uh.edu/faculty/tsommers/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTamler\nSommers\u003c/a\u003e, a philosopher at the University of\nHouston, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://peezer.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDavid Pizarro\u003c/a\u003e, a psychologist at Cornell University. We first met at a\nconference on ethics about 10 years ago, and have been arguing (and\noccasionally agreeing) about morality ever since, often over drinks.  At some point we realized that our\nconversations were entertaining and repugnant enough that other people might\nenjoy eavesdropping.  We were both big\nfans of podcasts and decided to start our own. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe title\nof our podcast is sampled from the title of one of Tamler\u0027s books \u003cem\u003eA Very Bad Wizard: Morality Behind the\nCurtain \u003c/em\u003e(a title he stole from an obscure movie about a wizard).  David creates most of the music--you can see\nour original soundtrack\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/peezismyname\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the\nlast four years we\u2019ve had a blast arguing about Kant, gender, emotions,\nreligion, free will, revenge, blame, honor, restorative justice, artificial\nintelligence, porn, death, moral objectivity, \u003cem\u003eStraw Dogs, \u003c/em\u003ecomedy, \u003cem\u003eMr.\nRobot, \u003c/em\u003eand much more.  Every so often\nwe\u2019ll even have a special guest to lend some respectability to the show.  We have a fantastic intelligent group of\nlisteners from all over the world who aren\u2019t shy about telling us when we\u2019re\nwrong.  We love interacting with them on\nFacebook, twitter, and email.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s been a\nlabor of love but it has been a lot of labor. \nFor every episode we put in hours upon hours of work recording, editing,\npreparing, and producing the podcast.  We\nalso have plenty of expenses, from equipment to hosting fees, which keep\ngrowing along with our audience. Thanks to Patreon, if you\u2019re a fan of the\npodcast you can help support some of this work by pledging a certain amount per\nepisode.  We appreciate all levels of\nsupport!  We hope to keep doing this\npodcast for a long time.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eRepugnantly\nyours,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDavid and\nTamler\u003cbr\u003e"

Poor judgment led them to start recording a podcast in the style of their after-hours conference discussions, and to begin referring to themselves in the third person. Support from listeners has kept the podcast going for over two years, so they figure that they can\u0027t just stop now. (Plus, they #$@%^ up and gave us tenure.)",
