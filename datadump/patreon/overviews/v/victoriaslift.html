These costs include hosting the websites, storing the audio files you hear, and maintaining and upgrading microphones, cables, and other recording equipment. Starting in season 3 we will be paying, authors, voice actors and composers for each episode. After two seasons of hard work, we can no longer expect these amazingly talented people to give away their work for free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur patrons help us focus more time on the quality and development of the podcast, and also create the opportunity to reward the people who give their time and talent.
