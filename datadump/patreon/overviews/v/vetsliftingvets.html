    "summary": "I am steven Hays an OIF combat Veteran/recovering addict-alcoholic\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA network of veterans and civilians serving veterans suffering from PTSD with a behavioral treatment, substance abuse treatment, support groups for vets, and families, professional therapy service dogs, and communityoutreach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI struggle everyday with a war in my own mind. After living 15 months expecting to not come back home.\u003cbr\u003eHaving combat around me every hour of everyday of every week to every month. Not being able to discern\u003cbr\u003efrom hostile and friendly. 2006-2008 2007 being the highest casualty rate of entire operation.\u003cbr\u003ethefallen.militarytimes.com\u003cbr\u003eThis is my letter of conviction. I joined the Army right out of high school during war. Knowing I would go to war. I had such respect for my\u003cbr\u003efather that I wanted to die in the place of a father. Saving a son or daughter from the misery of them being\u003cbr\u003egone. I made my way to the 82nd in early 2006 and in Nov 06 we were on our way. I joined as a 63B all wheel\u003cbr\u003evehicle mechanic. Hearing of all the IEDs thought that would for sure get me into the danger as much as\u003cbr\u003epossible I had a death wish. When we touched down I found out we would be attached to JSOC and we would\u003cbr\u003ebe performing hellasault missions. That meant to me I would not be going out. After a few months I seen they\u003cbr\u003ewere struggling bad with the a/c units due to it being so hot and the a/c mechanic having no clue what he was\u003cbr\u003edoing I went to my 1SG and made a deal I would maintain and repair all a/c with an additional 10 back ups if i\u003cbr\u003ecould go on mission. He said as long as there\u0027s 10 extra the night we left then yes. I busted my ass learning\u003cbr\u003ethem in and out and within another month i went outside the wire. That first ride on a chinook was a feeling that\u003cbr\u003ecan never be duplicated or explained. Its dark silent but loud gripping the pistol grip on my my thumb resting on\u003cbr\u003ethe safety. Then you hear, WEAPONS HOT! Cock lock ready to rock. I would go out and kick in doors with the\u003cbr\u003ebest, and loved it. When we would return from 4-7 days out conducting patrols and sweeps. We would come\u003cbr\u003eback and all the Infantry and Cavalry guys would go shower and rest getting much needed sleep. I would go\u003cbr\u003estraight to work because i would only have around 4 days to fix everything and have the 10 backups so i could\u003cbr\u003ebe on that bird with my brothers. I did very well one of my first missions the 1SG coming up asking can you fix\u003cbr\u003ea generator. I eyes getting big then realizing why i packed a few tools. I got it running and then suceruing my\u003cbr\u003espot on his team. The mission SGT Rod took his last step on the way back we landed at a different LZ and got\u003cbr\u003eon busses to go back to the tents and i was covered in blood and still in shock, there was an E5 SGT i\u003cbr\u003eoverheard him talking about the 88M drivers calling them no good pogs and fobbits both terms meaning soft\u003cbr\u003ejob. I at that point jumped up and blew my lid the first time ever loosing it like that screaming at the top of my\u003cbr\u003elungs crying just completely lost all military bearing. After the SGT apologized and said he didn\u0027t realize i wasn\u0027t\u003cbr\u003eone of them. Eventually feb-14th 2008 came around and we shipped out losing 11 Falcons and making it\u003cbr\u003ehome. When i got home i felt different. Felt scared out of place. I felt very angry. I turned to pot to help cope\u003cbr\u003eand it did help with my PTSD. a few months back and 3 of us got U/A\u0027s and they kicked the other 2 out keeping\u003cbr\u003eme thanks for my 1SG going to bat for me. I turned to alcohol since it was acceptable to puke out the side of\u003cbr\u003eformation as long as you didnt fall out. A year later I had a son and a wife and life was ok. Orders came down\u003cbr\u003eshipping off to afghanistan. I didn\u0027t want to die overseas leaving my son without a father. Knowing the multiple\u003cbr\u003eclose calls to death watching men fall in front of me hearing grown badass paratroopers scream crying\u003cbr\u003eremembering all the hell. I knew I wouldn\u0027t make it a second time. I wasn\u0027t leaving my son without a father . So\u003cbr\u003ei turned back to the pot failing 4 U/A\u0027s they finally court martialed me. I traded my identity that day for my son. I\u003cbr\u003eserved overseas honorably getting no help on return. On my way out going thru mental health. That Dr told me\u003cbr\u003ethat i did not have PTSD and being a strong soldier I believed them. After 4 DUIs looney bin 5 rehabs and\u003cbr\u003emuch more i was diagnosed with severe PTSD. Knowing this helped me work on my self and be able to cope\u003cbr\u003ewithout self medicating. Today I still struggle everyday with symptoms of PTSD losing good people in my life\u003cbr\u003ebecause I am not the same. I am broken I am damaged and if you try to stand by my side all I can say is\u003cbr\u003eeveryday I heal a little more. Please understand once in my life the way i tied my boots had life or death\u003cbr\u003econsequences. I will use my pain for others gain God took me on my journey to learn and understand. Through\u003cbr\u003eVets Lifting Vets Foundation. I now have the chance to help and save more than just 1 father with my life. I can\u003cbr\u003ego as far as I let myself go. Thank you for reading.
