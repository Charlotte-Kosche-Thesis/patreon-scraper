At least partially due to the response of this channel, I have personally made a huge step in faith by building a new shop at my home - at least partially so that I can have access to the machines and a space to create new videos right in my back yard rather than having to travel to another location to shoot video.\u00a0 It is my hope that my home shop can become a studio that is better suited for video work to make more frequent and higher quality videos than what I am able to do now.\u00a0 But, as I am sure everybody knows, this takes a lot of time - and money.\u00a0 You can\u0027t help me with the time part (but having the shop at home helps make it more convenient), but you can help me with the money part.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support of my channel will help me to take my YouTube videos to the next level.\u00a0 Your financial contribution will help me to purchase materials, tooling, pay the power bill, improve the shop building, as well as to expand the machinery that I have at my disposal to teach on.\u00a0 And because a large portion of the project that I work on are used at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.abac.edu/museum\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGeorgia Museum of Agriculture\u003c/a\u003e where I am a dedicated volunteer at, your contributions are indirectly helping the museum at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like the sound of that, then please show your support with a \nmonthly pledge, and know that you are helping to create something of \nvalue for all of us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\nKeith Rucker\u003cbr\u003e"
