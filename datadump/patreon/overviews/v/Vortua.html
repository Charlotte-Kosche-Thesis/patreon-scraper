What does that mean?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo some, it is only something actors do to portray a character in a movie. To others, it is a fun pastime in which one takes on a character either through writing or in small scenes with friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout our young lives, we have had the immense pleasure of stumbling into the world of literate roleplay where we could safely take on another persona and become amazing heroes or fearsome villains for the fun of writing stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt isn\u0027t hard to go on the internet or Facebook and find someone offering a small plot in various genres, clich\u00e9 story lines, or the usual stagnant set of less than surprising twists. After a while, one\u0027s muse, their inspiration to write, becomes bored and looks for something more. Something they can sink their teeth into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI desperately wish for Vortua to be that very spark to rekindle inspiration and set free a stream of new characters, new souls into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVortua, Pioneering into a Whole New Way to Roleplay\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVortua is a project myself, my partner, and a small team of moderators have relentlessly been working on for about a year now. We were tired of the lackluster plots and overpowered characters and we sought to produce a refuge for those seeking somewhere they can escape to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world itself is an archipelago among the clouds that is cradled within the massive roots of a colossal tree known to the inhabitants as the Mother Tree. She is the only one who stops the world from plunging into the mysterious and lethal Mists below her. The Mists are home to massive creatures known as profane that roam around in an endless hunger, their bodies distorted and their souls corrupted as they only travel the abyss to find their next meal. Profane come in many shapes and sizes; each animal, race, and even some plant life can be infected and distorted to become profane. They travel the islands of Vortua attacking it\u0027s inhabitants to feed their infinite appetites.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way Vortua became something more than just a pastime we worked on, it became a true passion. A passion for writing, creating, drawing and having a great time entertaining the world with our developing vision. It is now a part of our lives, something we tend to daily, almost therapeutic in a way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe, the administrators are a couple that were both raised and influenced by the world of roleplay. We met at a young age within one and have never let go since the experiences we have shared have shaken us to the core. It has given us chills, nail-biting suspense, and countless laughs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to not only give that experience back to lovers of literature and roleplay, but to enhance it and make it an absolutely new and unique jewel among other written adventures offered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe truly feel there is amazing potential within this roleplay. We can see it harboring thousands of people and though that might be very ambitious of us, we are absolutely certain that Vortua will grow into the gem we know it to be one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a very small team of creators that have been passionately working on this project of ours for nearly two years now. We have worked long hours and sleepless nights, we have spent hundreds of dollars, tears, sweat, and blood just to make this world as compelling and rich as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, we hope to have a literal 100% interactive world, only limited by your imagination, creativity, and writing! Our vision is to have a world so expansive and tangible, it is as compelling to play as a good video game, but without the limitations that it brings.
