    "summary": "For our music, merch, live dates and more, check out https://www.vowofvolition.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHELLO everyone! Thank you all so much for going out of your way to check out Vow of Volition\u0027s Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE LOW-DOWN\u003cbr\u003eWe love making things. Videos, music, all sorts of things. But turns out\u2026 funnily enough, it\u0027s kind of hard to make a living AND putting the time and effort into create awesome material (I swear NO ONE told us it would be like this :) )\u003cbr\u003eThere is so much we want to do and many of the obstacles we face will be easier to overcome if we have sufficient financial support from people like YOU. We do have day jobs\u2026 and that limits how much content we can put out, period. We figure, if someone is willing to support us in creating, we\u2019ll give them the time we would have to a day job.\u003cbr\u003eIf we could do nothing with our lives but put our time into writing and creating, producing and mastering, conceptual exploration and astrophysical metamorphosis on an ever expanding dimethitolesisnasiumastrix, donkey beaver toaster gymnasium 817324%^#@!?\u003cbr\u003e(If you\u2019ve read this far, you might as well subscribe, don\u0027t ya think?)\u003cbr\u003eBut to be real\u2026 we don\u2019t exist without you. You are our everything. Let us love you.\u003cbr\u003eTHE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY\u003cbr\u003eAll joking aside, we really do love what we do and want nothing more than to continue to do so for as long as we are able. The harsh reality of, not only our situation but, the current state of the metal industry is that fans do not have very many ways to directly support the bands that they love. While we appreciate beyond words the support that all of you have given VoV, much of that money goes to the industry figureheads that provide the platform for us to internationally market and distribute our music. Without them so much music would go unheard, and their role is an extremely pivotal one in allowing the world to hear our music. However, the costs of fulfilling their role are very high and do not leave much left over for the musicians involved to support ourselves.\u003cbr\u003eTHE GOAL\u003cbr\u003eRelease our EP, go on tour, begin recording an LP and continuously create YouTube content. We have close to 30 songs that have not been professionally recorded and mastered. There is so much to be done! Our Audio/Video studio is ever growing and we need your support to buy new equipment, which will in turn give you higher quality and increasingly innovative videos and music. We need your help!\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and consider supporting Vow of Volition."
