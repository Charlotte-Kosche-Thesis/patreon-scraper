Strong like single malt, smart like a spanking, sharp like a stiletto. She\u0027s a guide and a temptress, she\u0027ll light up the dark spaces in your mind that you never knew existed and show you the freedom that you\u0027ve secretly craved all along. She knows you better than you know yourself. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce you meet her you\u0027ll never forget her, and you\u0027ll never be the same. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does Vichey Pueblo Want?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShe wants what she wants.

Vichey Pueblo is a collective of talented, diverse writers working towards a common goal.\u00a0 VP (me) crafts the series, the writing bibles, the arcs and the tropes.\u00a0 Then the team hit it hard.\u00a0 Vichey\u0027s\u00a0novels are crafted\nthrough a defined outline and the first draft is penned out by a collective of\nghost writers, several working on one book at once.  The second and third drafts are completed by VP, then edited and formatted by a professional editor and self-published\nmonthly by the social media bunnies.\u00a0 All are members of the Vichey Pueblo Writing Collective (VPWC).\u00a0 We are a virtual team using\u00a0 online writing tools, project management, social media management apps and conferencing software.\u00a0 It takes about $10K to write a novel, design a simple cover, pay for a professional edit, manage social and maintain the subscription tools.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does Vichey Need?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the last six months VPWC has written eight novels, it could have been ten.\u00a0 I shit you not.\u00a0 VP put together a group of like minded writers who want to remain ghosts but are talented and have produced eight first\ndraft books in six months, two of which are published, three at second\ndraft stage, two in peer review and one a new-to-VP genre manuscript.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nVichey is an engaged and focused team, that up till now has funded out of my personal funds.\u00a0 Everyone is paid for the work they do, at living wage levels as a minimum and profit-sharing is based on hours contributed by project.\u00a0 But the coffers are dry and I have had to put writers and myself on-hold until I solve the surviving situation.\u00a0 \u00a0As a new writer Vichey Pueblo hasn\u0027t sold enough books as we are in the process of building a fan-base and it will be some time.\u00a0 Some writers are students studying Phds, some travelers looking for flexible, remote work and some are workers looking for a creative outlet. VPWC has people in the UK, Oz, NZ, Italy and Germany as well as native English speakers from Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India.\u00a0 \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t Need A Knight In Shining Armour I need A Sugar Daddy Or Mommy...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen there is me, VP, the real deal.\u00a0 I left my corporate job and used the small payout to start my dream.\u00a0 I had started writing in Germany some years ago but life gets in the way - a lot.\u00a0 The VPWC would have published at least six of the eight books if I had been able to free up my time to write, edit and contribute full-time.\u00a0 I\u0027m a single parent of a young boy and I work full-time in marketing.\u00a0 I write in the wee hours.\u00a0 My long-term dream is to make the VPWC self-sufficient from the proceeds of the book sales and to encourage the writers to express their own stories, however we need a Patron to support our efforts with the VPWC model.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFuture\u0027s Bright - What\u0027s Next In The Vision?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs writers, our world can be very isolated and solitary.  I have made a process to increase the\ncollaboration with like-minded people towards the same goal. Collective writing isn\u0027t a new model, but it\nhas been out of fashion for a few decades. \nBut this new world order, the added desire to collaborate to create, the freedom of location, the design of the schedule and IP tools I have built it makes our work so very exciting and fresh.\u00a0 In the future, I would like to piggie-back of a writing-craft conference and hold our own workshops pulling in the team once a year for the VPWC retreat.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
