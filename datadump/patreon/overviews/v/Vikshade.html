    "summary": "First let me thank you for your time. I have been creating material for Role-Playing Games since I was a kid 30 years ago. I have always wanted to make all my games and notes available as a resource to other gamers out there, but I never had the reach that we have today. Now with Patreon and YOUR HELP I can make my ideas, insights, and experience available to everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to launch a full product line of Adventures, Encounters, Locations, Characters, Magic Items, Spells, Tech Gadgets, Tips on Campaign Management, and Running games both at home and online Virtual Tabletops. I hope to soon be putting titles up on DriveThru RPG and Open Gaming Store, as well launching Youtube videos, a Twitch Stream and eventually a Podcast. But to do it I am going to need better technology than what I have now, so I will begin with everything I can share in writing, and that is a LOT of material!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know you will find something interesting here because even if you disagree with a new rule or idea, you will be forcing yourself to think about what works and doesn\u0027t work for you as a gamer, and that alone is a helpful exercise. More than anything I want to see feedback on my work so I can use it to improve on the next thing I release. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks again, and I hope to see you in the forums. Game On!"
