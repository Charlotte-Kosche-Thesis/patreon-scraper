The idea behind setting up a Patreon is to help me take more time out of my work schedule to do even more awesome streams/videos! I do get ad revenue from YouTube and bits on Twitch, but it\u0027s not yet enough to turn down opportunities to make money elsewhere. That\u0027s the goal! The more time I can spend making content, the more fun we all have.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you continue to pledge, I can keep adding to my reward tiers as time goes on. For now, I have a few fun things to offer and I just ask that you only give what you can \u003cem\u003eafford\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to give. As always, thank you so much for your support! Patron or not, you being here keeps me going every single day. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eReward Tiers\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e$1/Month - Every Bit Counts!\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this tier, you\u0027re simply supporting what I do online every day. Every little bit counts and adds up quickly! Thank you so much for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e$5/Month - \"Vorscriber\" Discord Rank\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA \"Vorscriber\" is the equivalent of being a tier 1 sub on Twitch (minus the ability to use emotes in Twitch chat). You\u0027ll get the Discord rank and also if any updates pop up regarding Vorscribers you\u0027ll get those notifications as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e$10/Month - Game Server Access\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy signature reward tier is $10 per month, which grants you access to whatever game server we\u0027re running at the time. Currently, we\u0027ve been playing a lot of Minecraft with our community. We\u0027ve presented Twitch Subs and Patrons both modded and vanilla Minecraft servers. We\u0027ve also played Unturned and Eco within Vojtopia as well! We do our best to keep things fresh so you always have a fun place to play the games we enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e$25/Month - Offical Sponsor\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an official sponsor of my channel, you\u0027re going above and beyond when it comes to showing your support! As of now, this earns you a huge THANK YOU!!! I hope to carve out more time in my schedule in the future, which will give me time to include even more perks for supporters like you. If that happens, this group will be included. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember: Patreon will bill you instantly when you sign up for any reward tier and access to your rewards will also be available\u00a0right away. However, Patreon\u0027s billing periods are still on the 1st of each month, so you risk getting charged a second time before a full month has been up. For example if you subscribe on the 12th of June, you would be charged on the 12th and then charged again on the 1st of July. Keep this in mind when subscribing to my Patreon page. :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
