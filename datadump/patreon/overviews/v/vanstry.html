    "summary": "So, this is where I tell you about me, and ask for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an independent author. That means I\u0027m not signed on with any publishing house and I\u0027m not under contract to anyone. I make my money solely by the books I sell (ebook, paperback, or audio). That\u0027s pretty much it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat may sound simple, however it isn\u0027t. I have to do all my own marketing, advertising, formatting, editing, and anything else that is involved in the process of writing and selling a book. There are of course a lot of hurdles in the way. The trad publishers, also known as \u0027The Big 5\u0027 hate people like me, because they don\u0027t make any money off of me, and they believe I\u0027m stealing their sales. Pirates come after me, because I don\u0027t have the resources to stop them, and I don\u0027t use things like DRM, because I don\u0027t want to insult my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, because I don\u0027t have an editor to correct me, or a publisher to threaten me, I can write whatever politically incorrect thing I want to. So yeah, I get a certain amount of hate over that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut on the plus side I get to write the stories I want to write, to tell the tales I enjoy telling. Yes, being a full-time author is tough. I work long hours. I don\u0027t get vacations. I often work weekends. The boss is a jerk. The hourly wage I get is often embarrassingly low, when you look at the hours I put in. Then of course there\u0027s the whole \u0027self-employment\u0027 tax. That\u0027s right, you have to pay the government for the right to be self employed. Who knew? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo come on, sign up, and help feed a starving author. Maybe one day I\u0027ll be one of those rich ones you see on TV or in the movies. You may even get a peek into the strange process that writing novels can sometimes involve, or find out how little money an Amazon best selling author really makes!\u003cbr\u003e"
