Not just a place for Femmes!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a small town country femme who is passionate about the LGBTQIIA+ community, the Leather community, writing, and traveling. I have a fancy degree in English\u00a0from a liberal arts college in California and know more about horses than I do just about anything else. All this is to say, I am full of different contradictions, different perspectives and different ideas about the world. I write to better understand myself and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was\u00a0a writer who did not share their work. I have ideas, passions, and stories that need telling. I plan on mixing it up a good deal. Articles, Stories, Erotic pieces of poetry and fiction, as well as a place to showcase my novel, the first in a queer high fantasy series I\u0027ve spent over a decade working on. On occasion, if there is interest I may show off some original art in the form of paintings or drawings. These will include topics on Leather, Intersectionality, Gender, Size Positivity, and topics of a sex positive nature. I might do the occasional video if I feel particularly inclined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to support myself as a writer. I would like to set up a website for my work that is ad free so that you can enjoy my work without distraction. I do need to be able to travel to find inspiration and stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eHow to be a Patron:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t believe in the tier system. I am not going to withhold my work from you because you don\u0027t pay me or don\u0027t pay me \"enough\". Fund me because you want to fund me and you believe in the work and the space that I am trying to create. Ultimately even if you do not fund me, enjoy my work and share it, as that is how it is meant to be enjoyed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eFull Disclosure:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in honesty, especially when it comes to what you may or may not be funding in regards to an endeavor like this. First and foremost, my ability to maintain a life comes before any travel. My entrances to events and conferences will not be funded by my patrons. My travel when I am being paid for other types of work; I do work occasionally in the sex industry or as a makeup artist, these travel ventures will not be paid for by patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting my work, whether you choose to become a patron or not. It is incredibly humbling to be able to share my work in this way and it would not be possible without you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~\u003cem\u003eVivian\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
