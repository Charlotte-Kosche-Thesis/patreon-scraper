If you\u0027re new to Patreon, this page here helps to facilitate individuals to pay whatever they\u0027re comfortable with in relatively small amounts for the maps I create.

This allows you to ensure that you won\u0027t be billed over a certain amount, regardless of what rewards tier you\u0027re in or how many maps I release in a given month (note that some rewards are dependent on you \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e having a maximum pledge set). If for some reason I fail to release any maps or am below my average threshold \u003cem\u003eyou will not be billed\u003c/em\u003e.
