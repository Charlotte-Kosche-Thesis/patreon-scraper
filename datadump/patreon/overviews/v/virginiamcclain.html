It\u0027s my full time job now, but it doesn\u0027t exactly pay full time.

So, I\u0027m now working on figuring out how to make my passion actually support me. Book sales help, and I am working on making those even more effective, but they don\u0027t yet create a substantial enough income to keep the lights on at home.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn terms of content I produce... I post once a week onto to two different blogs, create youtube videos sporadically, write short stories whenever inspired to do so and am constantly working on at least one full length novel. I am currently working on revisions for a novel that I plan to release in late August. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also working on my YA Urban Fantasy parody,\n\u003cem\u003e Victoria Marmot *Average Teenage Girl\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c3m8pc-at9k/Vq--pFUiY5I/AAAAAAAAOLs/UpVobu4xPAo/s1600/VicMar1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat parody, which is intentionally silly and is some of the most fun I\u0027ve ever had writing a story, is going to be a big part of this Patreon (though I should warn you, the main character curses a lot, so if that\u0027s likely to offend you, I don\u0027t recommend following the series).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s the deal: your contribution to this Patreon is directly supporting me in ALL of my writing. It\u0027s letting me pay my college loans, pay for food, pay for internet, and keep a functioning laptop with all of the software I need to write. And, as such, I will share lots of behind the scenes stuff here in regards to all of my writing, as it comes up. So, if you\u0027re interested in the ins and outs of my creative process, you\u0027ve definitely come to the right place. However, the real bonus material that I\u0027m guaranteeing on a monthly basis, is at least one chapter from\n\u003cem\u003e Victoria Marmot *Average Teenage Girl\u003c/em\u003e every month (and sometimes two chapters a month).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s going to be exclusive to Patreon patrons after the first three chapters (which I will be using as teasers to entice new Patreon subscribers). The only way to read the web serial beyond the first three chapters is going to require supporting the Patreon. And, you may not be surprised to find out that this is just the first book in a parody series...\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce the first book has run its course as a web serial, I do plan to publish it on amazon. But then I\u0027ll start the second book here, and no one else will be able to read \n\u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e until its run its course here, and then I\u0027ll start the third book here and... You see where this is going right?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, to have exclusive access and read it as it comes out you have to be a patron here on Patreon. If you want to wait months and months to continue the story you can wait for me to release it on amazon, but that\u0027s going to take a while and you\u0027ll miss out of being a part of the web serial process. This is a parody after all, so since it\u0027s going to be silly anyway there are going to be fun ways for patrons to participate in the story. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWant to learn more?
