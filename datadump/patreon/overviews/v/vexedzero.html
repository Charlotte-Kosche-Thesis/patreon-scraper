Whatever I can get, however small, will go a long way in helping to keep myself afloat. \u003cbr\u003eYour support will go towards keeping my gear maintained and my family fed and will net you some nice exclusive artwork and stuff not allowed to be posted on Deviantart. ( Hey hey, Sexy time! )\u003cbr\u003eIf you are not familiar with my work on Deviantart and have somehow stumbled on my patreon, Welcome! I hope that you find whatever is here to your liking. I mainly specialize in artwork depicting female fighting, but am fond of dabbling in all sorts of other things. Its my passion to bring detailed, personalized work and really try to bring your characters to life to the best of my ability. \u003cbr\u003eIts my aim to provide you with some personalized artwork of your OCs or desires, bring you some good laughs and just overall enjoy yourselves.\u003cbr\u003eI hope to be able to allow these donations to let me grow and obtain some more freedom in what I can and cannot depict and with any luck, be able to give back some more into the community we\u0027ve built. I hope that together, we can build close bonds of friendship and trust with eachother and really get the level of work that I think you deserve, and help me develop along the way. \u003cbr\u003eI aim to be as transparent with you all as possible, So I have provided my Skype and Discord below. Please, feel free to contact me on either of them, as I have come to learn that Patreon\u0027s website can be a bit funny about its notifications. \u003cbr\u003eSkype - VeXeDZERO\u003cbr\u003eDiscord - Veximus Maximus#6600\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to everyone, thanks so much for the support, it really does go a long way and I truly, from the bottom of my heart, appreciate it. \u003cbr\u003eIf you have any thoughts, suggestions or questions, Again, Please do not hesitate to contact me and I will do my upmost to accommodate them where applicable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVex\u003cbr\u003e"
