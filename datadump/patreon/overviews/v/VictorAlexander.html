My name is Robb, my pen name is Victor Alexander, and I am a short story writer who works in a variety of mediums, ranging from erotic fiction to fantasy and Sci-Fi. I just recently discovered what Patreon is and thought it might be a good way to get my work seen by a wider audience, and finally be able to get paid for doing what I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my erotic fiction short stories are available online through my Tumblr and my Literotica page, and I\u0027m planning to set up a separate Tumblr page for my none-erotic works of fiction very soon. I want to upload at least 2 stories a month - one clean and one not-so-clean - for the foreseeable future: however if this takes off at some point and I get more support I\u0027d be more than happy to increase my workload as much as possible to create more original content.  If you like what you read from me, please let me know! And if you\u0027d like to see more of a specific type of content from me, please let me know that as well! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will try my hardest to be flexible as possible and give people what they want while remaining true to my own artistic visions as an author. While there are mediums in which I\u0027m not familiar, I\u0027ll be happy to try and expand my base of genres and subject matters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy generalized plan is to have stories which could easily be first chapters in ongoing story series, and if the general response is positive I\u0027ll certainly continue them. I\u0027ll keep myself available to people out here to reach me with feedback and advice, and I look forward to hearing from you guys!"
