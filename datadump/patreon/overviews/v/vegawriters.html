    "summary": "Hi everyone \u2013 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo. Why something random like vegawriters when I could be all normal and use, you know, my name? Because when I was like 17 years old, Contact came out. Yeah, that movie with Jodie Foster and I fell in love. And I had all these story ideas in my head and it felt like my brain connected to the wormhole in the Vega sector, and so, the \"Vega\" username survived.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere I am. 20 years later. Still trying to describe myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write. I try to be funny and I fail. I try to do good in the world and I hope I succeed. I write fairtytales about America\u0027s Princesses and Queens - our rockstars and our actors. I direct you to smarter people than me for commentary. I\u0027m a terrible poet. I want to love myself more than I do. I drink Manhattans because my grandmother taught me that they are to be enjoyed with people you love, and there is nothing I love more than making them for the people I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by.
