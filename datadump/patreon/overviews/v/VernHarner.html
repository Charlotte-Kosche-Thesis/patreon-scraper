By becoming a patron, you can help support me in fully focusing on my goals, which includes my building community and mentorship among trans and queer social work students. For more about my work, including free resources I\u0027ve created, visit tiny.cc/VernHarner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout my work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a social welfare researcher and scholar, I am working towards futures for trans individuals--including myself. Reflecting on patterns I was noticing in my community, as well as how much of trans research seems to slightly miss the mark, I have spent the past year refining my research interests. I have landed on examining the relationship between historical/personal trauma, intergenerational knowledge, and community defined success and goal setting among trans young adults. Further, I plan to examine how narratives--the stories we tell one another--shape these mechanisms, and how these experiences shape the life course of trans individuals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically, I am questioning how a community of trans young adults, who often lack mentors and experience a range of trauma, sees themselves (or fails to see themselves) as adults. \u003cstrong\u003eBy learning more about how to leverage my community\u2019s ability to protect and sustain ourselves, I believe we can work towards trans wellness and liberation.\u003c/strong\u003e"
