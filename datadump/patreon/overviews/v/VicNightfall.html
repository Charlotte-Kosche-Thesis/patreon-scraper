    "summary": "Hey there. You might know me for my Minecraft Mod\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/228489-integrated-circuits\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIntegrated Circuits\u003c/a\u003e. Or perhaps from when I was active on the Minecraft Forums, doing various mod support. No? Awesome, that means you won\u0027t mind that I\u0027ve pretty much turned my back on all of these things!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what am I here for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve always liked to draw, starting from barely noticeable sketches as a preschooler to various Rube Goldberg machines later on. After some time letting it rest, I decided to revive my hobby about two years ago. I always cheated myself around drawing humans, so that had to stop! Given my interest in anime and Japanese subculture, this seemed like the perfect field to experiment on. I\u0027ve visited a course last summer and I\u0027m legitimately getting better at drawing manga style, but not anywhere as good as I\u0027d like to be. One of the things I definitely want to do in the future is creating my own web comic.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd this is where you come into play! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027d like to help me getting better at drawing, it takes as little effort as to nag me about drawing something you might like. While I might not do it right away, I always like to challenge myself and I get better this way. If you want to do a bit more, consider pledging your two cents! I would use the money to buy the necessary equipment, and perhaps visiting another art course. Or I use it on excessive amounts of manga, I don\u0027t know about that part yet ;) \u00a0Overall it\u0027s a great motivation and gives me the courage to try new stuff!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll my works are free of charge and for everyone to (hopefully) enjoy. They mostly end up on my twitter page.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI sometimes stream drawing on my mixer channel:\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://mixer.com/VicNightfall\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://mixer.com/VicNightfall\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C_5AFYbW0AAgDlv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
