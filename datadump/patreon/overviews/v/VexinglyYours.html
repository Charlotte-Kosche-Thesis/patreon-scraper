I\u2019m a graduate of Savannah College of Art and Design, with a BFA in Sequential Art. I\u2019m a black and queer artist. My ultimate goal as an artist is to provide material for entertainment, and thanks to Patreon, I\u2019m capable of doing just that in addition for being paid for my contributions. At present, my biggest ongoing project is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://forgotten-roots.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eForgotten Roots\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a story with the central theme on the importance of memories and chosen families.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://forgotten-roots.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/PatreonMiniBanner1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nStarted in April 2014, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eForgotten Roots \u003c/em\u003e(FR)\u003c/strong\u003e is a comic about four guys who have been hired by a widowed woman and have a single goal: take over and reunite their country after the fall of the Gods that used to preserve it. The unfortunate thing is\u2026 these guys are all shitty people and are having a hard time trying to fulfill their goal! FR is a drama, mystery, and romance story and is largely character-driven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a Queer POC artist, it is important to me to reflect that representation in my own artwork. FR features characters that fall on various parts of the sexuality and gender spectrum, as well as characters with diverse racial features. Currently, FR has over 200 pages of content and by the end, I\u2019m hoping for roughly 1000+ pages. In addition to the main comic, there will be side comics meant to compliment the main story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://forgotten-roots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PatreonMiniBanner2.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tapastic.com/series/Whats-Under-My-Bed\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\u2019s Under My Bed?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (WUMB)\u003c/strong\u003e is a pseudo slice-of-life comic where monsters and humans coexist. Much like FR, WUMB features queer characters, but also tackles real world issues while remaining humorous and lighthearted. The entirety of the first chapter of WUMB is available here on Patreon, but you can read it as it updates on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tapastic.com/series/Whats-Under-My-Bed\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTapastic\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nDoes this mean your work is being put behind a paywall?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main comic pages will definitely be released to the public as a much, much slower rate than on Patreon, but sidecomics and minicomics will not be available outside of Patreon or print copies.
