I own and host Von Spookelton which is a community for programmers, gamers and just general people to chat and have a good time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is server 0_o?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started out hosting servers for personal enjoyment, and because of the large lack of decent servers with quality hosting and administration, especially in the Oceania region where your lucky to get a ping below 200ms... Von Spookelton started off as me just hosting a public server for a few friends since I had the hardware and connection to do it. It has now grown into a wonderful community of people from all over who play and chat together on a daily basis. We host a variety of servers such as Minecraft, Factorio, Killing Floor, StarBound etc... And other occasional ones requested by our community members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow is Spookelton different?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a massive amount of different communities and server hosters out there, and I have personally played on a lot of them. While most are good, a lot are maintained on poor hardware with bad administration. We try to offer a different environment where the user is put first, be it at the cost of sleep, spare time or literal cost (Dedicated servers aren\u0027t cheap ;P), if anyone ever has a issue we always attempt to address it immediately and never presume that a user is doing something wrong unless it\u0027s blatantly obvious. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe try to work with users to sort problems in a way the impacts their experience the least, instead of pushing them around and fixing things in the quickest most invasive way possible which has sadly become the norm for a lot of communities. We never ban or kick anyone unless they very directly and intentionally violate our rules at least twice and always approach talking to users who have done something wrong with the presumption that they were ignorant of what they were doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall we just try to be friendly, fun and give users the best experience they could get. Because its something that can be really hard to find now days in communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHosting powerful dedicated hardware has its costs, hardware and internet can be quite expensive... Especially when you\u0027re hosting a large amount of players across a number of servers. Originally we never intended to have a donation system, this was and still is my personal hobby. But after so many offers of support from our community I decided to put up this page to offer people a place to help support the community and also help grow it, with things such as better internet, hardware and even more dedicated machines in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn no way do you need to donate or anything :) This is just a place where you can help support the community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also get cool perks on the discord and our servers xD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFree Games?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile its not really a major part of the point of patron, we have started doing a monthly game giveaway with 4 games for our normal active users and 1 special game for all our patrons contributing more than 5$ monthly!"
