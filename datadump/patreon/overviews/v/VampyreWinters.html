    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi guys! Writing is my passion, but it is a difficult field to get into, so I turn to you, the patrons of the arts. As a writer, I can promise you looks into my original, creative content, previously unpublished and maybe even sneak peeks at my novel...\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMy writing is fantasy for the most part, but I also like to write Gothic fiction, historical fiction and poetry. But if there is something you would like to see in my next piece, feel free to let me know! If you think that there is some kind of improvement needed for my writing, do not hesitate to let me know. Constructive criticism is always welcome. Before you make any decisions to support me, here is a little writing sample to give you an idea about my writing!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe whistle blew loud, I knew. But the machines had been whirring in my ears so loud and so long that I didn\u2019t notice the work day had ended until I looked up and saw the other girls removing their aprons and trying in vain to brush the lint from their skirts. I removed my apron and cleaned up my area. By the time I finally stepped out of the factory, the streetlamps were already being lit. Snow had begun to fall; it must have begun after the other workers had all gone home, for there were no footprints. The white specks dotted the black sky, though whether that was smog or the night sky I would never be sure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI tried to take in a deep breath of the crisp air, but instead I ended up hacking and coughing into my hankie. I ignored the moist splat of black on it and shoved it back into my pocket as I started on my way home. I tried to avoid the road; the high traffic made the snow turn to slush before it had settled. If I stayed near the walls of the shops, the water might not seep through the holes in my boots. I was trudging along, trying my best to keep the wind at my back. I was just about to cross the street when a crash came from Old Mr. Kelley\u2019s dry goods shop. I turned around in time to see a gaggle of young boys racing away in the other direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe police showed up moments after the boys had disappeared \u2018round a corner. They stared at me as if to say they knew it wasn\u2019t me. I just stood there, pointing in the direction the vandals had gone. The officers dashed in the direction of my finger. When they were gone, I continued the rest of my walk home, the snow beginning to make its way through my stockings. I climbed up the stairs to my apartment thinking of what to cook the little ones for supper. But when I got to the top of the stairs, I saw a policeman standing at the door with my son, Jimmy, in hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWant to support but can\u0027t commit?
