I\u0027m currently (2017) 50 years old. There\u0027s been a longer break inbetween where i did nothing CGI related but since 2014 i\u0027m back and better than ever! I\u0027ve digged deeper and deeper into the subject matter of 3D character design, lighting and postwork in photoshop. I\u0027m still not perfect but i constantly learn new things and i will let you participate!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI improved a lot as you can see here (click to see full image):\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/19105682_1500559783298326_5196949927363469268_n.jpg?oh=9361d5ca1151f57262178eafbf31cac5\u0026amp;oe=59D895DD\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/19105682_1500559783298326_5196949927363469268_n.jpg?oh=9361d5ca1151f57262178eafbf31cac5\u0026amp;oe=59D895DD\" style=\"width: 203px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAnd here is the \"why\" answered for you: I love to help other artists to improve themselfs. I will show off anything i\u0027ve learned, i will reveal any secret that i\u0027ve found and i already work with. You can literally watch over my shoulder when i\u0027m doing my images in the videos i offer to my patrons (supporters) kind of regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAdditionally you will get almost anything that you see in my images for your own Content Library! Whenever i do a pose on my own, a skin, a shader preset, an expression, a background or whatever i\u0027ve created myself, i will upload it to my patreon page for you to download in the \"Content\" tier! This means with the order of that level you will get a flatrate to all of my content which grows almost daily! And if you miss something you\u0027ve seen in one of my images, just go to the \n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/vdgfx/community\"\u003ecommunity page\u003c/a\u003e and drop me a note, for example like \"Hey, can you publish the light settings from the image named \"Carla\", please?\". And you can be sure that i will do so, IF the light settings has been done by me! I don\u0027t give away anything that has not been made by me, because i don\u0027t want to get credits for other peoples work, nor do i want to \"sell\" the stuff that\u0027s been created by other awesome content creators.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18485657_1477890135565291_3796617955995902131_n.jpg?oh=875bd34b4d057fa2e2a9b8de137dcce6\u0026amp;oe=5A1192BE\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18485657_1477890135565291_3796617955995902131_n.jpg?oh=875bd34b4d057fa2e2a9b8de137dcce6\u0026amp;oe=5A1192BE\" style=\"width: 212px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHow to use this patreon page?\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThere are several tiers (or levels) you can choose from. You can order only one at a time but you can switch them month by month!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFor example: In the first month you want to get all the content i\u0027ve already uploaded to the page. So you subscribe to the \"PLUS CONTENT\" level where you\u0027ll get the \"PLUS VIDEOS\" and \"ALL IMAGES\", too! The higher levels always include the lower levels! After you downloaded all content published to that date, you dont need to be subscribed to that tier anymore. You can switch down to the \"PLUS VIDEOS\" tier, the \"ALL IMAGES\" tier, or even cancel the subscription completely and come back any other day when there\u0027s again enough content for you to download!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18425497_1474701659217472_2986402897330102014_n.jpg?oh=6c2b8bbdea2123f20537326544664766\u0026amp;oe=59D29BAB\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18425497_1474701659217472_2986402897330102014_n.jpg?oh=6c2b8bbdea2123f20537326544664766\u0026amp;oe=59D29BAB\" style=\"float: right; width: 155px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eAnother reason to open this Patreon page is to build up an Artist Studio for Promotional Images where the Artists get paid for their work.
