    "summary": "In a nutshell, I\u0027m what you\u0027d call a \u0027Late Bloomer Baby Boomer\u0027. I write songs in whatever genre excites me; rooted in: Folk, Country, Blues, Oddities and lots of Ballads. I thought I would\u0027ve grown out of it by now or run out of material to write songs about,  but the songs just keep coming. And now I want to immerse myself full-time .\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With your help, as a patron, this is now possible. Regardless of whatever level of support you feel like offering, my commitment to all my patrons is to deliver this:  \u003cem\u003eFOUR\u003c/em\u003e albums in the next two years; totaling at least 54 original songs.  \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn the beginning\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, each month, you will be the first to hear four or more song sketches/month (MP3\u0027s  sent directly to you via email or text). These are stripped-down versions of the songs that will serve as basic layouts for developing the\u00a0final tracks. After completion of the 54 rough sketches, you will receive as many fully arranged and mastered album-ready songs as I can complete each month. Who knows how fast this will go? I\u0027m thinking - \u003cem\u003epretty fast\u003c/em\u003e. At least 1, but more like four or 5 per month.  Your feedback and monetary support adds so much more inspiration and encouragement than you can ever imagine. And since, the muse(s) are still finding me useful, no doubt, this 4 album project is only the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I want to give a very special thank you to my first donor, who after hearing a few of the rough sketches, generously granted the funds necessary for me to build an awesome recording studio in my home. Your patronage has played a very significant role in catapulting me headlong into this project. \u00a0Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To all of you, a big Mahalo, for considering and/or joining me in this project as a patron.\u003cbr\u003e"
