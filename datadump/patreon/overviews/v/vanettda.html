It was a random drawing attached to a small written vignette. It was moderately popular, but life got extremely busy with teaching at a college full-time and operating an illustration studio full time. So... I stopped it. Life has become a lot more simple. I wanted to get back to the AG groove... but I wanted to do it different. First of all, I wanted to do them in color. Second, I needed them to be independent of a story line. Random. Highly polished brain farts. So I created Alternarrative. Often, I\u0027m at a loss for what comes out of my head and gets published. Sometimes it is funny. Sometimes it is poignant. Sometimes it just \"is.\" It is a random distraction from life. It is nonsense, in a world that demands order. It\u0027s real. I think it is fun. I hope you do to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your patronage:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese flights of fancy take time. The writing is consuming, and the painting is not fast. I don\u0027t work to a schedule. But I am driven. Anything I receive as a patronage helps fuel other creative forays into the obscure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dubiousity.com/randommess/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Angel.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create installments. When I do, you agree to pay per installment. \u00a0 I doubt that it will happen more than a few times a month, but Im committed to at least one a month. It is billed at the end of the month and then you get access to: warm fuzzy feelings, and the REWARDS!\u003cbr\u003e"
