So, I know a little bit about big stories and what they can mean in our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey help us see ourselves anew. Like looking through a warped piece of glass and laughing at how we can look short and fat when we tip it this way and noodle-skinny when we tip it that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly it\u0027s a way of looking at your soul instead of your love-handles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories are true, made up and everything in between. They\u2019re about love. Love served cold. Of getting caught in history\u2019s massive tailwind and blown to the other side of the world, yet despite everything, discovering the meaning of faith and love. They are about the real-life magic that happens when we open ourselves to grief and dreams and destiny.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s what I want to do here. No irony. No sarcasm. No cool. I just want to bring magic back into the world one post at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo who am I, anyway, that I think I can do such a thing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cabingoddess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cold-war-princess1.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the author of \u003cem\u003eThe Bone Church, Welcome to the Hotel Yalta, The Hungarian\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eCold\u003c/em\u003e. And I write fiction, drama, and essays that revolve around lovers, killers, curses, and destinies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got the idea for writing short essays when my Modern Love piece was published in the New York Times a few years ago. It was about my relationship with my mother and how it changed when I had an infant born with cancer. I received so many heartfelt letters from readers telling me all about what my story had meant to them. How it had changed their perspectives and their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thought maybe I was onto something and started my blog, COLD, which\u003cbr\u003efeatures my short essays on faith, family, love, and writing fiction.\u003cbr\u003eBefore long, all sorts of people started reading and I got even more letters and comments. WordPress, the blogging platform that hosts some 70 million blogs worldwide, even singled out COLD as one of their top Recommended Blogs by writers or about writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve had a mother write to me about the child she lost in childbirth \u2013 the utter devastation of that event made bearable by crazy moments of levity. Like when her family broke into her hospital room at 3:00 am and an impromptu party ensued. Yes, even after the death of an infant. Sometimes our best times are during our worst, and I like to celebrate that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReaders tell me about the haunted house they live in, and the way the spirits whisper for them not to be afraid. It is such a privilege to be privy to a virtual stranger\u2019s greatest fears, heartbreaks, most gushing stories of romance, confused tears, anger, yearning, loneliness. Private, beautiful stories that honor the special relationship between a writer and her readers. That transcend the page. It is the most fulfilling part of doing what I do, and it means a lot to me that so many of you are willing to share with me parts of your own journeys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*K4oG-P2d92u4wqzY.\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBecause my master plan is to re-introduce meaning into our lives. In short star bursts and long-blazing red giants. With words that feel like a kick in the gut and pictures that make you stare. It\u0027s a powerful combination that takes you in to that mile deep and inch wide place. It\u0027s the polar opposite of a Kardashian.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I can\u0027t do this alone. Writers not only need readers, but need to buy things. Like cover art, research, great editors and designers, computer programs, and even the occasional pet snake for one of their kids. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd readers are patrons. Not only with the odd dollar, but with time and passion.\u00a0You badger your friends, families and libraries about good books that need to get read, and without you, the world would be a much less interesting and meaningful place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting me on Patreon and helping to spread the magic,\u003cbr\u003eVictoria\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

It\u0027s for my daughters, my son, my husband, and anyone who has ever stumbled, ached, longed-for, and believed in beauty, honor, and destiny. In that intangible something that takes flight at a glance. Is sealed by a touch. Burned into a soul by a single breath.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a long-term project. As big as a love affair. It will be visual and prolific, spanning several books and novellas. Audio books and original art work will also be a part of the series, and I want you to be part of the magic from the ground up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work is crafted, detailed and time-consuming.
