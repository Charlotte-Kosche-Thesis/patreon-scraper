That\u0027s clearly something foreign.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy parents are from Haiti and it\u0027s one of my favorite places on Earth!\u003cbr\u003eMy last name is French and I\u0027m proud of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaitian? Sex? You\u0027ve lost your way.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLol! Well, talking about sex, sexual health, and women are all my favorite things. I haven\u0027t lost my way, I just feel that conversation\u003cbr\u003eabout sex are one of the most important that a person will ever have in their lives... it determines the kinds of relationships we\u0027ll have, even the most important one... The relationship to ourselves and our bodies. And you\u0027re right, I didn\u0027t really have conversations about sex at school or at home, so I\u0027m always pumped because I get to bring those conversations to others!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSex at school? Girl, what in the world do you do?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the pleasure of teaching sex ed. from the young to the seasoned and it rocks. Like really rocks. Like I really love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do you reside?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay nosey. Baltimore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Wire....\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t you dare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s keep it to VagEsteem then, what\u0027s that? Why that word?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, VagEsteem is a workshop series I created in 2014 for women. It\u0027s also an independent podcast, that came along in 2016. I created VagEsteem because I realized that once folks hit a certain age, they don\u0027t keep up with sex education. Folks leave high school and never learn a new thing about sex... and that\u0027s not good.\u003cbr\u003eI also found through my personal work, that women are reluctant to speak about sex openly. Sure, they\u0027ll probably talk about it with their gynocologist once a year... but I doubt it\u0027s a fun conversation with giggles, loud laughs, sisterhood, experience, and new techniques being discussed... but maybe that\u0027s just me.\u003cbr\u003eThird, why not?!?!?! Talking about sex is fun. VagEsteem is not only a noun, it\u0027s also a safe, empowering space for women where we learn from each other by having courageous conversations about love, sex, relationships, and everything in between. \u003cstrong\u003eEverything is independent and I need and appreciate your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so why couldn\u0027t you just name it Sex Education for Women, why VagEsteem?\u003cbr\u003eWell, first of all, \"sex education for women\" is sorta blah. Would you come to something named that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eVagEsteem is a term I coined during a workshop educating the women about \"Vag\u0027 and body confidence. It became the mantra for all of the workshops. I believe that if women have confidence in themselves, their bodies, especially their vaginas (vulvas)- they are more likely to care for them, love them, and bring them pleasure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s interesting.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think so too. I meet so many amazing women and we all end up having a great time. My goal is to create a safe space for women to come together, laugh, and learn.

Thanks so much for coming and feel free to ask a question, request a class for your group or your friends, or leave a comment!\u003cbr\u003e"
