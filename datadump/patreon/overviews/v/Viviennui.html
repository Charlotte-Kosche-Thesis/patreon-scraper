But the biggest and most emergent issues are currently basic needs (shelter, physical therapy and transportation).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe the struggles I am facing today are temporary. \u00a0I know I can recover from this with your help. \u00a0No bloom in nature lasts forever, otherwise flowers wouldn\u0027t be so spectacular.\u003cbr\u003eI am a prideful person and wish I didn\u0027t need to ask you for this... But my soil is dry and my petals have fallen off, for now. \u00a0Will you water me and help me bloom again?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003eVivi\u003cbr\u003e"
