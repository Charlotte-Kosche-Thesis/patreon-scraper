This surprised me and so I decided to start my own. There were some ups and downs in activity level; it took me a while to find a rhythm. I have been going strong since November 2012, in part thanks to the followers I have accumulated and their various contributions, and I don\u2019t intend to slow down any time soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Personal Interest\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy own interest in the Vietnam War began in June 2005 when I visited Washington, DC with my family. I was 15 at the time. At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (or \u201cThe Wall\u201d), my father stopped walking and cried. I had never seen my father cry and immediately wondered what could bring a man who hid any softer emotions to the point of tears. I began reading anything I could get my hands on, mainly memoirs, in my attempt to understand what exactly it was about Vietnam that could bring out such emotion in my father. I figured it out long ago, but I can\u2019t shake my interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Blog and The Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI advocate education. All the information posted on my Tumblr blog is as accurate as possible. I double check anything that I reblog from others. Unless asked, I try to avoid posting my own opinions as I want people to come to their own conclusions with the information that I present. That being said, I welcome discussion on any related aspect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work to make this blog as inclusive as possible. There are so many aspects to the Vietnam War that it gets difficult at times to make sure every bit is represented.\u00a0 To this end, I have always encouraged suggestions and requests for content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing Forward\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWriting more posts summarizing the military operations of the Vietnam War, like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://vietnamwarera.com/operations\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethese\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vietnamwarera.com/operations\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eEstablishing a collection of posts dedicated to major players in the war, from both sides\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eResearching and writing more posts about specific aspects of the war, like this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://vietnamwarera.com/post/135054323334\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eone\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vietnamwarera.com/post/135054323334\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThose are just my immediate goals. For long term goals I\u0027m considering developing a podcast, interviewing veterans, and setting up a website independent of Tumblr.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does it mean to be a VWE patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be a patron means to support me as a content creator. I love what I do here. It is my dream to develop a website to take the place of my blog and have that be my job. To be a patron means to support that dream.
