I have participated in\n several high-level game mod communities, released\nmy own (solo-work) games and game mods, and have completed game-balance \ncoding work\non several larger titles. I have also done a large amount of beta \ntesting, and play testing for both video, board, and table-top games, \nand have been\ninvited to attend various conventions as a \u201cpro guest\u201d, talking on \npanels about\ngame design and gamer culture. And while game design and programming are\n my passions, I also have a strong history of non-programming IT work \nand involvement in the Deaf community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a gamer for as\n long as I can remember, starting with classic D\u0026amp;D in 1986, and \nadded video games not long afterward with a NES that my cousins got for \nChristmas that year. In HS I taught myself how to build PCs and began to\n use the internet as a resource for finding and building new table-top \ngames and game systems. It wasn\u0027t until a few years later, after working\n in the IT industry for quite some time, and doing quite a bit of game \ndesign work, modding, and play testing, that I decided to go back to \nschool where I received my Bachelors in both Sociology and Psychology \nwith a minor in ASL and Deaf Culture. During that time, I began getting \ninvited to gaming conventions as a professional on the topics of gaming \nculture, game design, alternative culture, Deaf gamer accessibility in \nthe gaming world, and generally all things related to nerds and video \ngames.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduation, I worked with members of the Deaf \ncommunity in a regular (non-gaming related) job, and despite my passion \nfor the Deaf community, quickly realized that I wanted to go back into \ncomputers and gaming. So I decided to go back to school to get a masters\n in Computer Science and certifications in several programming languages\n including, but not limited to: Python, C#, C++, and JavaScript. It is \nmy hope to eventually be able to get a job at a major game studio where I\n can put my game design knowledge and experience to work while \nsimultaneously focusing on promoting game and gaming accessibility for \nthe Deaf.",

He gathers his friends for a journey to his family\u0027s lands to rid it of the evil infesting the area, but will the group of adventures survive the horrors that await them, and will they retain their sanity long enough to save Varisia, and all of Golarion, from the ancient corruption leeching it\u0027s way into world?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be pitching this campaign/adventure path to Paizo upon it being fully completed (I have some contacts in the biz, so I feel confidant that this is a possible publication path for me). If I get enough backers/patrons/investors before it is done/sold, then I will publish it on my own through other means rather than through Paizo and all backers/patrons will receive a free PDF copy of the book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, upon reaching this goal level I will being writing and publishing adventures and software part-time for patrons.

Rather than simply doing a little math and figuring out that a CR4 encounter can consist of x goblins, it will build (multiple) full encounters for you to choose from, complete with a high CR leader, several lower CR grunts, and possibly even mounts or additional monsters that make sense to appear with the base monsters in the encounter. They will also include treasure that the monsters can use against the PCs (with monster stats pre-adjusted as if the gear was equipped) that can double as loot after the encounter is over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter finishing the software and achieving this goal, all backers/patrons will receive a free copy of this software on which platform it ends up on (most likely PC and/or Android), as well as me doing regular updates on it as long as people seem to be using it (based on software metrics/analytics).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this app is already finished by the time this goal is met, I will update this goal to something else - possibly even leave what software I make up to a vote/poll of current patrons.\u003cbr\u003e",
