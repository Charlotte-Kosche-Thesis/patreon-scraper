I\u0027m a graduated international student at a university in Montreal, and I\u0027m currently in the process of obtaining a post-graduate work permit. I\u0027ve been writing since 2008, and I\u0027m pretty good at it at this point. I\u0027m planning to stay in Montreal and become a video game writer or level designer. This Patreon is helping me bridge the gap from international student to a full time employed writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already finished my first game, \u003ca href=\"https://victoriaroot.itch.io/terra-johnson\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTerra Johnson\u003c/a\u003e, which was inspired by TellTale Games and Bioware game mechanics. I used \u003ca href=\"https://twinery.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwine\u003c/a\u003e to create the game, and I really enjoyed using it. My new project for Twine is in its planning process so all you have to do is follow me to get more information on it as it happens!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny contribution would be greatly appreciated and help me keep writing and designing!"
