    "summary": "Hello! To all those who\u2019ve found their way to this page via\nmy blog, \u003ca\u003eFashionable Tinfoil Accessories\u003c/a\u003e; from my\ncontributing work at \u003ca\u003eThe Mary\nSue\u003c/a\u003e, or my work as a team member of Anime Feminist, welcome back! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your kindness and\nsupport. For those of you who\u2019ve wandered here from Patreon itself, a different\nbut equally enthusiastic welcome! Now, I imagine you have some questions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name\u2019s Vrai \u2013 essayist, fiction writer, and lifelong\nunshakable nerd. Twice a week, every week, I write about popular media (a vague\nterm, I know, but my essays have covered film, TV, anime and western animation,\npodcasts, and beyond). That can range from lists of forgotten classics to\nexaminations of storytelling tools in specific works to old-fashioned reviews\nto what would most likely be labeled \u201cthink pieces.\u201d As a queer individual that\nperspective indelibly colors my work, though it is by no means the sole scope\nof it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy most famous work is a series called \u003cstrong\u003eThe Consulting Analyst\u003c/strong\u003e, an episode by episode breakdown of a series\nthat breaks it down to its composite parts: visual elements such as\ncomposition, direction, and framing; themes and motifs, narrative elements,\ncharacter arcs and actor performances; and where the work fits into the context\nof its creative team, the medium then and now, and the culture at large. It is\nan extremely time intensive series, and some of my proudest work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition to my self-published writing, I also recap\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSteven Universe,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eRick \u0026amp; Morty\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eat The Mary Sue \u2013 posts where I strive to combine\nnarrative examination and review with little bite-sized analyses of the show\nand its characters based on what we know in a given week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also an editor and contributor to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/animefeminist\"\u003eAnime Feminist\u003c/a\u003e, a site dedicated to spotlighting marginalized voices and having a conversation about diversity and feminism in anime and anime fandom. I\u0027m very proud to be part of the team, even when the indie nature of the site means doing some additional unpaid work to keep things rolling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is the tricky thing about the internet. See all that\nwork up there? A lot of that\u0027s done for free. And while I love my work and my\nreaders, I would also like to continue having internet access and electricity\nin order to keep writing for them. And while I do have an option my website for\nPaypal donations, I wanted to offer an alternative avenue for people who might\nwant to contribute through a more structured, stabilized route.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are You Getting? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll of the work I currently produce will continue to be\nfree. I\u2019ve said that before, and I\u2019m firmly committed to it. No pay walls, no\nexclusive content. This is a chance to support my work if you believe in it and\nwant it to continue, not a holding of content to ransom. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe $100 dollar goal is for a weekly liveblog - this would let you, the audience, have a chance at directing what works you\u0027d like to see me comment on in a slightly more freeform style than a formal blog post. While not as formal, it would let me cover a wider breadth of content with more frequent patron input.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnalyst for Hire\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, say you\u2019re interested in pitching a few bucks but are\neven more interested in getting some extra bang for your buck. This is the\nsection for you. Have a series you\u2019ve always wanted to see covered? A topic you\ndesperately want to see me take on? Hey, I\u2019m not proud, internet. I will absolutely\nlet you tell me what to write about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t an invitation to a paid mouthpiece \u2013 while a\nbuyer can name a topic of their choice and can tell me some things that\ninterest them about it that they\u2019d like me to take into consideration (i.e. considering\nspecifically the soundtrack of a work or comparing it to X or Y competitor), my\nopinion and content are ultimately up to my own discretion. If I really think I\ncan\u2019t do what you\u2019re asking, I\u2019ll either help you find something else that we\ncan both agree on or hand you your money straight back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nHow do you hire the analyst?\u003c/strong\u003e Just send a message my way:\neither here on Patreon, at my blog, on \u003ca\u003eTumblr,\u003c/a\u003e or via Twitter DM. We can iron out the details from there.\nWhile I offer the option to pay by way of a one-time Patreon donation, I generally invoice through PayPal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat does it cost to hire the analyst?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, pricing\u2019s a\nlittle in flux since this is an experiment, but here\u2019s roughly what it looks\nlike right now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n$30:\u003c/strong\u003e a single post on the subject of your choosing, at least\n1000 words. This is limited to content less than three hours long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$50\u003c/strong\u003e: a single post on the subject of your choosing, at least 1200 words. For 13 episode/\"single cour\" half hour seasons and series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n$75\u003c/strong\u003e: a single post on the subject of your choosing, at least\n1200 words. If you want a full season of a series covered \u2013 either 24 half hour\nepisodes or 12/13 hour long episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n$25/post\u003c/strong\u003e: Your very own Consulting Analyst, broken down\nepisode by episode on the series (animation, live action, anime, podcast,\nwhatever) of your choosing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I\u0027d say that covers it for now. Take care of yourselves, readers. Thanks for sticking around.\u003cbr\u003e"
