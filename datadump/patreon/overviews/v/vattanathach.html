I have invested in compostable, reusable and eco-friendly products after coming across the Zero Waste movement in early spring of 2017.

I carry reusable straws, cups, utensils, and bags with me whenever I go out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in fair trade, green energy, and sustainability.

Through self-love, I have been able to accept people for who they are and not judge them for what they have done. I am imperfect, but that\u0027s what keeps me going. I dream big and I fail a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy successes serve as stepping stones to the next chapter. I regret absolutely nothing in my life. The law of attraction is my code. \"Why\" is my favorite question.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat I do\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePASSION \u0026amp; PURPOSE\u003c/h3\u003eI see life as a game and I choose to play using empathy, patience, honesty, and self-awareness. I choose to be vulnerable with people because that is how bridges are built. I love listening to people\u0027s stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m obsessed with bringing value into people\u0027s lives. For work, I dabble in dance, education, marketing, event organizing, and driving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePROGRESS \u0026amp; PROSPERITY\u003c/h3\u003eWith self-awareness came perspective. Perspective has shown me that I have it good while many others do not. On my journey, I learned that the biggest illusion of this world is that we see everything as separate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen in actuality we are all one; all parts of the same whole. If I can help people become self-aware, self-loving, and empathetic then they will learn how to overcome and more importantly, not be consumed by their own struggles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey will learn how to trade their time with people who need it. I feel that we have a responsibility to each other. For those who were dealt a bad hand and have the odds really stacked against them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who flirt with death every day, I see you, I hear you, and I feel you. I do not take my life for granted. My trials and tribulations are not in vain. I hope I can inspire you to not give up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day I want to be able to give you whatever resources you need so you have a chance to thrive and prosper. No one deserves to suffer the way that you do. My \"why\" is why I wake up every morning. You have my love. One love.\u003cbr\u003e",
