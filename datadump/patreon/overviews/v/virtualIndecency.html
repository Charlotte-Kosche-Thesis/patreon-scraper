    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\nHello, and welcome to my Patreon page! You can call me SD.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll cut right to the chase. For a long time I have enjoyed writing and reading erotic fiction with taboo themes. Recently I have been combining that with my love of video games to make erotic video games in a visual novel format.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eThe Games\u003c/h1\u003e\nI am currently working on the episodic game \n\u003cem\u003eSister, Sister, Sister\u003c/em\u003e, in which you take control of a recent high school graduate who lives at home with his mother (Lucy) and three sisters: your fraternal twin, Gwen, and identical twins Zoe and Chloe. Zoe and Chloe decide to make a \u0027project\u0027 out of the main character, and they plot to help him become a lady\u0027s man and, eventually, lose his virginity. But are Zoe and Chloe completely selfless, or do they have ulterior motives? Why are they so \u0027friendly\u0027 with one another? And what secrets are Mom and Gwen hiding? Will you be able to find out? Will you be able to finally lose your virginity?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe game is being released episodically on a cycle of about one chapter per month (chapters released toward the end of the month). The game goes out first to $5+ patrons, with $2 patrons receiving the game three weeks later. One month after the initial release, each game goes out for free public download.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have other games planned after the conclusion of \n\u003cem\u003eSister, Sister, Sister\u003c/em\u003e, including a prequel that covers the twins\u0027 mysterious past, a sequel about the main character going to college, as well as other stories involving entirely new characters!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eThe Characters\u003c/h1\u003eThe game currently includes the following characters, each with their own story arc, backstory, wants, desires, and secrets to uncover:\u003cbr\u003eLucy (mom)\u003cbr\u003eZoe and Chloe (the identical twins)\u003cbr\u003eGwen (your fraternal twin sister)\u003cbr\u003eJennifer (Gwen\u0027s best friend. She lives across the street)\u003cbr\u003eBethany (The head cheerleader from your high school)\u003cbr\u003eLauren and Tom (Jennifer\u0027s parents)\u003cbr\u003eAddison (your cousin)\u003cbr\u003eAunt Liz\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd YOU!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore characters will be added if I reach certain patron goals. New characters will be voted on by my $15 patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat to expect\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nAll images are rendered in Full HD (1920x1080 resolution), so you\u0027ll see no shiny, plastic-looking models or background images littered with \u0027white-noise\u0027. See my screenshots below for the proof!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI put a lot of thought into my dialogue, so the script is descriptive and contains none of the broken English and poor translations of many other visual novels. My games take a while to produce, but you\u0027ll appreciate the extra quality and attention to detail when they release!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf this sounds like something you would like, please consider becoming a Patron. I hope to make this a full-time job one day (or nearly full-time, as I rather like my day job) and I can only do that with your support!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for visiting, and especially thanks to all my patrons for making this game possible! Look below for some screenshots from the first chapter of the game, and feel free to download the latest public release of the game to see if you would like to enter a pledge! (To find the current version, go to the \u0027Posts\u0027 section and search for the keyword \u0027release\u0027.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eScreens\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/k02lhw8.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6nzL2LP.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nRSgBj5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/zYESKtb.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhy should you donate?\u003c/h1\u003e\nRight now I am a one-person, completely self-funded operation (with a little graphic design help). That means that I work on my games in my spare time, as I\u0027m able to, while juggling a full-time job. This is a labor of love for me and I would happily do it for free (as I have been)! However, by supporting my hobby, you give me the freedom to put more time and effort into my games, which means that you as a player will receive faster and more frequent updates, larger and longer games, more and better content, and eventually I hope to be able to work on my games full-time. In the beginning I am putting 100% of my Patreon funds back into game creation so I can afford to have the highest quality art assets, models, and environments to make my games look, play, and feel the best that they can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*None of the characters in this game are blood related. All sex in consensual, and all characters depicted are over the age of 18\u003c/strong\u003e"
