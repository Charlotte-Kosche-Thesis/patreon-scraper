As I figure it out, I want to share what I learn with my fellow Sugar Sisters. I want to help empower every femme \u0026amp; nonbinary SB to take down the patriarchy one PayPal transfer at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst\u003c/strong\u003e, I am interested in connecting with other Sugar Babies (or Sugar Sisters). I think that having a community of Sugar Support is one of the most important parts to being a successful SB.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond\u003c/strong\u003e, I am interested in normalizing mutually beneficial relationships. I am in a serious, open, vanilla relationship with a cishet man \u0026amp; love him dearly. I am also a privileged cis, white woman who is tired of getting kicked around by the patriarchy \u0026amp; all of the Man Trash. I recently realized that I can commodify the every day sexist shit men force on me; if men want to solely view me as a sex object, fine, but then they\u0027re going to fucking pay me for it.\u003cbr\u003eI want to take from men everything they have taken from me. If the patriarchy insists I\u0027m to be a helpless pretty girl in need of her knight in shining armor, then I am going to exploit the hell out of it.\u003cbr\u003eIf society refuses to pay me a decent wage because misogyny says a woman\u0027s place is in the home, then I am going to exploit the hell out of that role.\u003cbr\u003eI will be your sweet, sultry girl-next-door. I will be a lady in the street, but a freak in the sheets. I will be your Sugar Baby. As long as it is understood that my life philosophy is now: FUCK YOU, PAY ME.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eFemme \u0026amp; nonbinary people deserve to take back our power any way that we can. It thrills me to no end thinking about using men the way they have used me my whole life. I want to normalize the way Sugar Baby/Sugar Daddy (SB/SD) relationships allows us to take back some of that power. I want to show the world that it is possible to profit from our righteous anger. I want the world to acknowledge that sex workers are brilliant, skilled, \u0026amp; incredibly resilient \u0026amp; that we are an important part of society.\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging your support, you are allowing me the freedom to document \u0026amp; share my journey with the rest of the world. Transcribing my life takes a lot of time \u0026amp; energy, but I think my experiences are important enough to commit to paper. By becoming a patron, you have joined me on the journey to take down the patriarchy one PayPal transfer at a time."
