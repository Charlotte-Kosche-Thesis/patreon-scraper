I initially began this website out of passion to write down my thoughts, opinions, rants or raves on the Visual Novels that I played. I thought it would be a great way to interact with, inform and expand the Visual Novel/Otome Game community. I never would have expected that in less than a year, my website would have grown so much and developed such an amazing following from it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot thank you enough for the support and it\u0027s the wonderful feedback that I read from my readers that inspires me to keep writing. I read \u003cem\u003eevery\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0single comment, and they never fail to make me smile or make my day. It makes me feel like all my hard work is recognised, and I\u0027ve had amazing opportunities to work with companies such as Aksys Games, Idea Factory International, MangaGamer and NISA America with reviewing their new game releases. These companies continually localise games that I have been a fan of since the very beginnings of my endeavors into the genre of Visual Novels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWHY DO I NEED YOUR HELP?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately as much as I would like to devote more time to writing, it really isn\u0027t feasible with the amount of funding and schedule that I currently have. I am currently a fourth-year university student, aspiring to be a clinical psychologist specialising in child psychology. As my masters program has a high GPA requisite and my course is very demanding; I spend four days a week at university and the bulk of my time at home is spent studying. Whatever time I have left over, I am working at university as a tutor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently how I fund my website is through advertisements on my side panels and affiliate links, however this pays for \u003cstrong\u003eonly 30% of my monthly website cost\u003c/strong\u003e. The other 70% is completely out of my own pocket to keep the website up and running, and to purchase games to review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWHAT KIND OF WORK DO I DO?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite how it looks, behind the scenes a review takes me \u003cem\u003ehours\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to write. I only want to post quality content for my readers, and I continue to work on them until it is to a standard that I believe people will enjoy reading. My average review count is 5000-8000 words, although some of my reviews such as \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://visualnovelreviews.com/2017/04/09/black-wolves-saga-bloody-nightmare-review/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlack Wolves Saga: Bloody Nightmare\u003c/a\u003e\u0027 totaled 13000 words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, this takes me anywhere between 10-20hrs to write. This does not include the time spent afterwards proofreading, formatting and editing. My website itself I have spent well over 30 hours coding and learning how to design and format. Prior to this, I had absolutely no idea how to use CSS or HTML.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS MY GOAL WITH PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently making \u003cstrong\u003eno profit whatsoever from my website\u003c/strong\u003e, despite the time, effort, money and work that I place into it. The hours I spend on it does not translate into profit, and as a result it will only be a hobby at best in my current predicament. It is something I am personally funding out of genuine enjoyment as part of the Visual Novel \u0026amp; Otome community. My\u003cstrong\u003e aim with Patreon is not to make it a full-time job\u003c/strong\u003e, but to be able to self-fund the website without having to constantly dig into my own expenses every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the worst case scenario which I would want to avoid is for the website to shut down, if in the scenario that I am unable to personally fund the website anymore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWHEN WILL REWARDS BE RECEIVED?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey will be received on the 5th of every month, once patreon processes through your pledge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY HAVE I RECEIVED NO DISCORD INVITATION?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eA discord will be created once there are at least 10 patrons in total.
