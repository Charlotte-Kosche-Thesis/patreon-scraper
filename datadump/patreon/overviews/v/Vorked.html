I\u0027ve been playing tabletop games for a decade, now, and making my own games since 2012. My longest running game is Mythic (fan-made Halo tabletop game), which will be celebrating its fifth year of development this November.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been slowly crafting my own tabletop game system known as 100DOS. This patreon is to help support me during the work I put into the many games in development, and the development of 100DOS 2.0.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for now, 100DOS is home to multiple games; Mythic,\u00a0Medieval Europe,\u00a0Middle\u00a0Ages Asia, and\u00a0The American West. We also have many games in Development;\u00a0The Armory,\u00a0Legends, and The Great War.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also run a fairly popular blog known as \"\u003ca href=\"http://penandpaperadventures.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTales from the Tabletop\u003c/a\u003e\" where tabletop players send in their experiences while playing various tabletop game series. There are some amazing stories out there and I\u0027m glad this has given them a way to share them with others. It has surpassed 18,100 followers! Thank you, everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027m also a moderator and one of the community heads of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/\"\u003er/halo Reddit Halo Community\u003c/a\u003e.

The subreddit is a good place for longer-term discussion or questions you may want answered, or even just to keep up-to-date with news on Mythic and 100DOS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWHAT IS 100DOS\u003c/h2\u003e100DOS is a heavily-modified D100 system which slowly transformed into its own system. 100DOS is like many other d100 games, but instead it has an emphasis on an Opposed System. The Opposed System is when two players or NPCs roll against each other, and the one with the most Degrees of Success (DOS) will determine the victor. An example of this would be one Player rolling an Investigation Test to try and find someone using their Camouflage Test.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e100DOS only uses one type of dice, which are two D10s. One for the \"Tens\" digit, and one for the \"Ones\" digit. Using these two D10s, we\u0027re able to roll for 100-sided tests, percentile rolls, 10-sided tests, and even 5-sided tests. It gives us a very wide range of abilities while only using two die.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eMYTHIC\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/file/7seeojflbi6b3je/Halo+Mythic+2+Beta+2.5.zip\"\u003eDownload Halo Mythic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMythic is the attempt at the most all-inclusive Halo Tabletop Roleplaying Game possible by a single designer and a small team of helpers. Nearly, every weapon, vehicle, vehicle variant, and equipment was dug up and added to Mythic.\u00a0Our entire system has been done over, again and again. Redos, reworks, overhauls, every little thing in our document has been gone over or entirely gutted at least once. I do my best to make sure Mythic is evolving to be the best it can be with such limited development time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo check out Mythic, check out the subreddit for the most recent versions of the tabletop game and the character sheets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloMythic/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eCOMMISSIONS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also take commissions for Supplements and Splatbooks on my 100DOS game system. I can take splatbook commissions for a price based on the expected size and time needed, which can be negotiated. Message me through our Discord, my twitter, or my email at vorked@gmail.com. The starting price to a personal splatbook is roughly $70. This will usually span 10 to 15 pages of content, including equipment, Character Creation options, weapons, armor, and any special rules that may need covered by your request. The longer the book or more in the request, the more it will cost. This can be negotiated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupplements are more expensive, as they are larger-scale books. A supplement ranges anywhere from 30 to 70 pages (upcoming additions for the unreleased 100DOS 2.0 Core book), and pricing begins at $250 due to the size, time, and effort needed to make these books. Anything larger would be considered a full handbook, and pricing would vary greatly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe sure to keep up-to-date with 100DOS news by following my Patreon, subscribing to the subreddit, or joining the discord!
