It all started a little less than a year ago when I was at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://voguishgeek.com/post/138872807107/sdcc-2015-roundup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSan Diego Comic Con 2015\u003c/a\u003e where I met a woman who was lost and overwhelmed at all that there was to see at Comic Con. She asked me where she should go to take her kids of various ages and where they should eat that wasn\u0027t going to cost an arm and a leg, and I told her. She said that no one else had showed her that kindness and what should have been a fun event for her family had been a disaster up until that point. She then suggested that I should start a blog where I could share that kind of information to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fsan1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/988476_295642053927741_4584851163072816766_n.jpg?oh=18ecc7fdaf2ecf26faff36e728cd4163\u0026amp;oe=5776C579\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked on writing blogs and news articles for several video games in an official capacity such as for the prestigious EverQuest franchise, Planetside 2, Dragon\u0027s Prophet, WildStar, Lineage II, and others. I thought about it and it just clicked - I \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e create a blog where I can share with others all the things I love, as well as share tips and tricks I\u0027ve picked up along the way. And thus, Voguish Geek was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started doing a few guides and reviews and have since branched out and honed in more of a focus on my blog. Since the blog began in July 2015, I\u0027ve already written over 35 articles, including a handful of video blogs. That roughly translates to approximately 3.88 blogs per month, or around one per week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePurpose Statement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo highlight and celebrate women who love to geek out about traditionally nerdy things and encourage them to express themselves through fashion and accessories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoals\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe a safe space for nerdy girls to geek out about video games, comic books, tv, movies, pop culture, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe a thought leader for things that interest geeky ladies.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe a trend setter for medium to upscale nerdy clothing and accessories.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe a top place to find the latest news on fashion, accessories, events, etc. that are interesting to geeky women.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe a trusted source of reviews on video games, books, comics, movies, television, fashion, accessories, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the Funding For?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all of this sounds like something you\u0027d dig, please consider becoming a patron so that I can continue to produce content more regularly and make sure that content is as high quality as possible.
