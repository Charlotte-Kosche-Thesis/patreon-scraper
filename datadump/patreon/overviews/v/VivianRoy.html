    "summary": "Well hello there, so glad you stopped by! \u003cbr\u003eI have spent two days typing and back-spacing to come up with an intro, and finally came to realize that I am great at writing about nearly anything except myself. Even when I\u2019m using a pen name, evidently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a non-fiction author and freelance writer who has been working the 8-5 grind for the past seven years instead of doing what I know I was meant to do - write. I have decided to begin publishing my fiction under a pen name for many reasons - a topic which I will be writing about soon - and my ultimate goal at this point in my career is to commit to steady work on the books I really should be writing. My biggest challenge as a fiction writer has been to allow myself to prioritize my creative work. When there are bills to pay and kids to raise, it gets easy to set aside the projects that bring me joy for the ones that generate an income. Driven into literary prostitution, if you will. A hundred pledges to myself that I would always find time to write, yet an empty day-job and part time freelance articles always won my time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where Patreon comes in - I\u2019m not pledging to myself, I am pledging to you, my loyal readers and creative brethren. With your patronage comes my commitment to generate work on a regular basis, and the priceless reminder that my work is valued by others. This is a partnership, and I look forward to finding out what we can accomplish together. My goals are simple - to gradually replace the non-fiction freelance with my books and stories. The more work I have here, the less dry and mindless clickbait and web-junk I will need to take on to make ends meet. You may need to bear with me while I get the hang of this self-promotion thing, but I promise to do my best at generating content that is interesting. And maybe - just maybe - I\u2019ll make a fool of myself by getting with the times and shooting a video to say hello.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll be working on various projects, but ultimately I\u2019m going to let YOU guide my primary focus. As a patron, you will have access to some of my favorite projects, and I will continue to post new stories and ideas in addition to the continuing chapters I will be adding to the book. Depending on your patronage level, you will be able to vote on which projects get my attention, have access to rough drafts and provide feedback, get an inside look at my creative processes, and even name new characters. And, of course, you will get my unending appreciation, which will include a personal thank-you in the final published work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, grab a cup of coffee (I recommend Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, it\u0027s by far the best in the world), and check out some of my work. I look forward to the journey ahead!\u003cbr\u003e"
