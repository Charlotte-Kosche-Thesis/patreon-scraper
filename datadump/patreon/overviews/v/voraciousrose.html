    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello everyone!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those of you who don\u0027t know me, my name is Rose and I am a fetish artist most commonly known for my drawings and stories. I started drawing fetish art and writing stories in the Spring of 2013 and surprisingly became a much bigger part of the community than I first expected to! The fetish community has become my home and I\u0027m very happy to be a part of it! I\u0027ve made so many friends and I feel I\u0027ve grown a lot as an artist in the past few years and I\u0027ve grown to love drawing even more than before and I anticipate the times that I get to stream and talk to all my wonderful friends and followers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a website that helps Creators, allowing Patrons (That\u0027s you guys!) to support their favorite Creators with pledges! Most Creators will set up a form of Rewards for their Patrons each month and those Rewards usually depend on how much the Patron is pledging. You can see below all the Reward Tiers I offer to my Patrons, and if by chance you have an idea for a Reward please don\u0027t hesitate to let me know! I love to hear ideas from you guys on how I can better reward you all for your love and support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Pledging/Payment work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nPledging differs from Creator to Creator in the sense that some Creators may charge per finished piece of work/video/comic/etc. while others my charge Weekly/BiWeekly/Monthly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you can see in the upper left of this page, my Patrons pledge \u003cstrong\u003eper Month\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0so whatever you pledge is what you pay each month. Pledges can be canceled at any time and you can set a monthly limit of how much you would like to pay the Creator (This doesn\u0027t really apply to my Patrons considering I do use the Monthly Pledges)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHow do Rewards work?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRewards are a Creators way of telling their Patrons \"Thank you\" in their own little way. Creators will normally set up Reward Tiers for each pledging amount.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you can see to the right, I offer my Patrons things like Exclusive Content that I do not release on my any of my other accounts, these things normally range from WIP shots of what I\u0027m currently working on, Full and Unwatermarked versions of each of my works for you to enjoy, Raffle Tickets to monthly Colored Sketches, Lower commission Prices, and even Commission Priority!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can find more details to the right under \u0027Rewards\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow do Milestone Goals work?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEach Creator normally sets Goals/Milestones for the amount of pledges they receive each month. These Goals/Milestones usually have more Prizes and Rewards that everyone can benefit from!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI like to offer things like Request Live Streams (Where I spend a set amount of time just drawing for the community whatever they ask for! Within limits of course), MORE Colored Sketch Ideas each month, or even the ability to have the Colored Sketch Ideas upgraded to Fully Inked, Colored, and Shaded pictures!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can see our upcoming goals on the right under \u0027Next Goal\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see Patreon Exclusive Drawings, have access to Patreon Only Live Streams, get access to Drawing Packs I plan to do in the future, and much more then please consider becoming my Patron. I\u0027ve recently had to go back to working a full time job to be able to keep the bills paid and I would love to come back to art full time if given the chance, if I can get enough support through Patreon I\u0027ll be able to do that much easier!\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a huge goal though, so honestly I\u0027m keeping my Patreon as something fun for those who wish to support me to do so and for me to give little extra things in return.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nFinally allow me to say \u0027Thank you\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone for your support! When I first joined the community as a fetish artist, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would have gained so much love and support as I have from you guys!\u003cbr\u003eIf I could reach through my computer screen and personally thank and hug all of you, I would! Honestly, I don\u0027t think works can even describe how wonderful you all have been to me and how grateful I am to be surrounded by such wonderful people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat else on the web can you find me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://voraciousrose.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantart\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://aryion.com/g4/user/VoraciousRose\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEka\u0027s Portal\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://picarto.tv/VoraciousRose/\"\u003ePicarto.TV\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/voraciousrose/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/VoraciousRose/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHentaiFoundry\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://voraciousrose.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/AM1343\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDonate\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
