It is an educational tool that sets to help kids feel part of a larger community and be excited about animal rights. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever wondered what the world would be like if veganism was taught in schools? It\u0027d be pretty cool, hey? I am optimistic that this will happen one day. In the meantime we need ways to teach kids how they can be a friend to the animals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Melissa Vanderhorst and I am the creator and founder of Vegan Kids Magazine.\u003cbr\u003eI had the idea of creating the Vegan Kids Magazine when I was brainstorming how I could combine my passion for cartooning with my passion for educating kids about the vegan message. As soon as the idea of starting the magazine hit me I started reaching out to inspiring vegans, plant based health professionals, vegan parents and of course vegan kids. The response that I received was more than I could have ever hoped for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason this is so important to me because kids in our society are taught nutrition from the meat and dairy industry and cruelty is normalised from birth. This often causes a deep-seeded disconnection from animals later on in life. Educating people as kids means that we have the chance to remove some of that disconnect which will lead to a healthier life as well as a brighter, happier future for the gorgeous animals we share this world with\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the first magazine I had the opportunity to interview YouTube\u0027s That Vegan Couple, James Aspey and Tammy Fry from The Family Fry. They each shared vegan story, their favourite things about being vegan, some of the challenges they have faced and advice that they have for vegan kids. I also had the opportunity to include articles from awesome plant based health professionals. This includes articles from dentist Helen Voronina, Dr Anthony Hadj, Counsellor Hugo Jorge and nutrition student Emily Hyland. All of these articles are so engaging and help answer the questions kids might have about being plant based. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone for all of the support. It has really touched my heart. I have big plans for the magazine and I am so excited to see it grow!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you like what I am doing and want to help support the initial stages of the magazine then please sign up to be a Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1GlgydP.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
