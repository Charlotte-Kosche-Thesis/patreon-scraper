Art allows me to be as big, loud and powerful as I want to be- to encourage others to live boldly, challenge structures, and create experiences that connect across boundaries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFreedom in art\u003c/strong\u003e for me involves learning to recognize disenfranchisement, detaching its weight from my shoulders, to let it be carried by collective struggle. I am inspired by stories of resilience and revolution, in particular by Malcolm X, Assata Shakur and Angela Davis. The freedom I achieve through creating comes from my passion for beauty and the power of people. Using a combination of watercolors on wood, watercolor on Yupo and Dura-lar, poetry, movement and voice, I orchestrate performances where we may challenge our fears, craft our freedom and nurture our empowerment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy\nhunger for artistic development\u003c/strong\u003e has persisted in my current collaborations.

     "description": "One of my favorite things to do is introduce people to watercolors. Watercolor is often seen as a challenging medium due to it\u0027s fludity and quick drying time. In these workshops, we learn how to let the water take control to create dynamic natural texture. Participants have ranged from people who have never painted before to seasoned artists. My approach focuses on play, an important part of the learning and discovery process, community and technique in controlling your water to color ratio.\u00a0\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Photos and descriptions will be posted on Patreon incase you are unable to attend so that you may follow along wherever you are!\u003c/p\u003e",
