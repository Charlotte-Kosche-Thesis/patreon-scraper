    "summary": "I\u0027m a\nwriter/illustrator living in Montreal, Quebec. I\u0027m the author of two\ngraphic novels, most recently Ginger Goodwin: A Worker\u0027s Friend,\nwhich is available from Between The Lines Books via your local\nindependent bookstore. My short comics have been collected in several\nanthologies, including Connections, Indie Ladies, and Dirty Diamonds. My work has also been featured in Bitch and\nBriarpatch magazines. I have two cats and I like eating\ncheeseburgers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI primarily publish\nnon-fiction comics dealing with the history of social movements in\nCanada. My most recent graphic novel dealt with labour and union\nhistory on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, and the life and\ndeath of labour leader Albert \u201cGinger\u201d Goodwin. (I also publish\nautobiographical and semi-autobiographical short comics.) \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I\nsubmitted a proposal to my publisher for a new graphic novel. The\nbook, which my publisher approved, is\na series of short comics exploring the legacies of reproductive\nrights struggles in Canada. These comics cover topics such as the\npast (and present) impact of eugenics on marginalized peoples in\nCanada, the historical fight for the legalization of abortion, and\nsignificant issues in child welfare such as maternal poverty. My goal\nis to provide a holistic and comprehensive look at the Canadian\nlandscape of reproductive rights \u2013 not just a book about abortion,\nbut a book that examines abortion and advocates for abortion access\nas part of the larger picture of reproductive autonomy. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking for your\nsupport so I can focus less on the freelancing which pays my bills\nand more on this book in the coming year. My last book suffered\ndelays due to my intense work schedule at the time, and I want to\navoid that happening with this book. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI also want to\nengage with my audience and provide content relating to the book\nleading up to its release! Patreon gives me a way to do this while\nhelping to finance the project. Contributing to my Patreon campaign\nwill give you access to patrons-only content, including interview\ntranscripts, sketches, and more. Backing me here will basically\nprovide you with a behind-the-scenes look at how the book is\nresearched and put together, as well as other rewards depending on\nhow much you donate.\u003cbr\u003e"
