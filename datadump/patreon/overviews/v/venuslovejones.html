I\u0027m still developing my niche but I will always tribute heroes and sheroes in this world. I\u0027m working on a podcast and a book about my journey. I\u0027ve won awards as an actor, a poet, and a radio personality.

When I focus on the cost and time it takes to share, I am easily distracted by part time work in other fields. Yet now more than ever I\u0027m told that the world needs my poetic vision. Yet I am only one woman. I am A woman. Amen.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eWill you join me? Will you become a\u00a0bonafide Venusian?
