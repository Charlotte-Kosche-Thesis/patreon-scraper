You might recognize me from my work at GameSpot, Maximum PC or IGN. Well, I\u0027ve left the games media industry and have started my own YouTube channel dedicated to VR and AR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVR has been a big passion of mine ever since I tried the Oculus Rift DK1 back in 2012. It was pretty janky, but after I tried it, I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about entering the Matrix. Since then, I\u0027ve reviewed or have purchased every major VR headset and peripheral out on the market. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving worked in the industry for so long, though, the dirty truth is that VR content doesn\u0027t traffic as well as it should. This means that working at these game sites, I was often prevented from making VR-related videos. You can\u0027t blame these sites considering they have so many mouths to feed and need to make content that appeals to a mass market, but I think it could work if there was only one mouth to feed. I\u0027m talking about me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe excitement that I see online in the VR subreddits is not echoed in the mainstream games media. So I want to use my decade of professional gaming/tech experience to bridge that gap by dedicating myself to making the best VR videos possible. I\u0027ve made hundreds of videos in the past and want to break new ground when it comes to producing in-depth VR reviews, features, and interviews across hardware, software, and games. There are so many interesting stories to tell here, and I\u0027m deeply excited to tell them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking in the industry, I\u0027ve had long-lasting relationships with Valve, Oculus, HTC, Sony, and more. I want to be the conduit between you and these game companies. That\u0027s why I\u0027m calling my channel VR Conduit.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTraditionally, if you wanted to launch a successful YouTube channel, you had to deliver content that offered a super wide appeal, but I\u0027m doing this channel for those who care about VR or for those who are interested in learning more about the tech. If you\u0027re reading this, I want you to feel like this is your channel. And to ensure the channel stays strong, I\u0027m going to need your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany critics say VR is a gimmick; that it\u0027s a fad like 3D TVs and that there are no good games to play. If you\u0027ve ever had an intimate moment in VR and experienced presence, you know this isn\u0027t true. There are numerous games worth highlighting. So, let\u0027s show them that they\u0027re wrong. With your support, I want to debunk these myths, highlight the coolest games worth playing, and better explain the technology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on how much you donate to the Patreon each month, I\u0027ll provide you awesome things like written articles versions, early access videos, allow you to vote to see what games get covered next, hang out with you in VR, and much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding my Patreon means I can acquire more gear, hire additional help, and ensures that I can dedicate myself to this for the foreseeable future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we can set an example of how the games media should cover VR. If you want the industry at large to know that you care about the medium, and if you want VR to grow even faster, please consider supporting the patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you."
