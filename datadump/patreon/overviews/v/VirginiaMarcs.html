I knew I was destined to be the next Madonna. I veered off course for a bit and spent the next 15 years studying and performing classical music, jazz and some musical theater. I lost track of my dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eOn my 30th Birthday my sister sent me a guitar and that was it. Life made sense. Now the songs keep coming. In truth, I\u0027ve spent my entire life preparing for this moment.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eHere it is, the moment I jump off the CLIFF.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are you doing right now, Virginia Marcs?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWell, I just released my first album ever, Climbing the Wall! The Release Show was at LetLove Inn in Astoria, Queens and it was pretty extraordinary. You can read about it in the Times Ledger \u003ca href=\"https://www.timesledger.com/stories/2017/46/astoriamusician_2017_11_17_q.html\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck it out on Bandcamp \u003ca href=\"https://virginiamarcs.bandcamp.com/album/climbing-the-wall-2\"\u003e HERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eI\u0027m really proud of Climbing the Wall and all the work that went into it. We Kickstarted the album with the help of 216 backers and a lot of love and support from fans, friends and family. Now that I\u0027ve gotten a taste of what it\u0027s like to do something like that I\u0027ve gotta admit I am HOOKED and I KNOW this is what I\u0027m meant to be doing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\u0027s NEXT??\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eI\u0027ve spent my entire life studying and working in and on music. In fact, like so many of us, I am still paying student loans for this education. I\u0027ve worked in opera, musical theater, jazz, regular theater... I\u0027ve music directed, been the lead, the backup, the bandleader... The goal has always been a CAREER IN MUSIC. And I have a plan to get there. In fact, I have a right now plan, a one-year plan, a five-year plan, a 10-year plan and a forever plan.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eOver the last three years, since my very first solo Virginia Marcs\u0027 show, I\u0027ve amassed a pretty large catalog of music. I\u0027m also constantly writing more. What I want to do next is put it out into the world. Climbing the Wall is out there, but why stop now? I have SO much I want to do! Music videos! New releases! A tour! Dozens of tours! Collaborations! The sky is the limit in the mind of this little Unicorn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow do you plan to survive in the new Music Business?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhen I was growing up the dream was to get a record deal. It was THE GOAL. That was MAKING IT. As it turns out, getting a record deal just doesn\u0027t really mean a guaranteed existence in the music world. It never did and it definitely doesn\u0027t now in the Age of Digital Music.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eIt can seem appealing. Big label record deals generally involve a lot of money. But it\u0027s a lot of money that the artist doesn\u0027t actually see. That math is not promising. There\u0027s a great article detailing how the money gets distributed on TechDirt \u003ca href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml\"\u003eHERE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4788891305_c9eecd1fdd.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere\u2019s where it gets kind of COOL \u2026\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eBasically, if you\u0027re following me here, you see that a traditional record deal isn\u0027t actually IDEAL for the Artist. Especially not for UNICORNS who want to RULE THEIR OWN DESTINY!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what is a record deal, anyway? Essentially, it\u0027s just an agreement. An agreement on the part of the Artist to create and an agreement on the part of the Label to fund that creation. Well, why does the part of the Label have to be played by a bunch of millionaire producers looking for the Next Big Thing. Why couldn\u0027t it just be the fans? Why can\u0027t there just be a direct link between The Artist and The People!?!?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTHE RECORDING CONTRACT OF THE PEOPLE!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eIt has a nice ring to it, doesn\u0027t it? I mean, I don\u0027t actually need millions of dollars to survive and create music. To me, MAKING IT means paying the essentials with MUSIC, which is my chosen career path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are. You\u0027re the one who wants to listen to my music anyway. Why don\u0027t I just put it directly into your hands/ears? Then you give me what you want directly. No middle man, no cuts split a thousand ways. It\u0027s just You. And Me. You take the music. You give me what you feel it is worth on a monthly/per project basis.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eTogether, we can make some beautiful music.

Well, the amazing folks at Patreon actually made the perfect short video to explain better than I ever could:\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwvUjAv6pxg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for visiting my Patreon.
