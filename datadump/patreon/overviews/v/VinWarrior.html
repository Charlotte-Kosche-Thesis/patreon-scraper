    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eGreetings and Salutations!\u003c/h2\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m Vincent, though I go by the handle VinWarrior incredibly frequently as an homage to my time on Xbox Live and the name I decided on so long ago. As a preface, I\u0027m a New York-native, Italian-Irish roots and a fierce stance on positivity and constructive change. I try my best to exemplify the humble, socially accepting, and energetic attitudes I was raised on. I am a frequent writer on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.podtacular.com/author/vin-warrior/\"\u003ePodtacular\u003c/a\u003e but I also run my own\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://vinwarrior.wordpress.com/\"\u003esite\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy should you become a patron of mine?\u003c/h2\u003eThat\u0027s... a good question. I won\u0027t lie about my position in life, I\u0027ve got enough to survive and be happy, but juggling AP courses and theatre productions and a stock-room job leaves the craft of writing almost impossible without monetary income. This is a field which I have adored since I was young, and it is one of my few emotional outlets to project the stress and joy of being a young adult. I absolutely do not expect absolute, out-the-gate support, and I sympathize with everyone\u0027s monetary issues. I would outwardly recommend donating to my fellow embattled writers in serious conditions\u00a0before you donate to me. They need it far more than I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat do you have to gain, and where will the money go?\u003c/h2\u003eAnother good question! All funds will go toward making my writing better, giving me the opportunity to write about more topics and broaden the work which you consume. Video games (sadly) cost money, and without those funds, I cannot supply content whilst also keeping up with schooling. None of my monetary goals are extravagant, nor do I honestly expect much. This is a hobby for me, and your support, even morally, is enough! Now... What do you have to gain?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a patron, you\u0027ll have (depending on the tier) access to articles early, which I will supply you with, a stake in what I write about next, as well as personalized poetry later down the tier list. As a standard, those who donate $3 or more will get a mention at the end of my articles! Woot!\u003cbr\u003e"

Whether analysis, critique, commentary, or re-imagining, I truly believe it is the personal responsibility of writers to harness their abilities in ways that benefit foremost them, but also, the world around them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting about video games and other niches of nerd culture might sound a bit hilarious when paired with such grandiose musings, but before gaming can be recognized as art, perhaps its our duty to build up a cabinet of legendary artists. I hope to, with your support, be one of them.",
