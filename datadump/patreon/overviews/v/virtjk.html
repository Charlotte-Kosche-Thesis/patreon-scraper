Others too, but we five are in the process of launching a company called\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMint Potion Studios.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStraight to the point:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThe state of music education in our country sucks donkey balls\u003c/strong\u003e, and most of the people reading this barely know anything about music. I mean, you all LISTEN to music, but unless you studied music in higher education, \u003cstrong\u003eyou probably barely remember a thing from school, and your kids certainly won\u0027t, because public schools get no arts funding!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an amateur music educator and veteran video game composer, I have composed for live orchestras, but I\u0027m a high-school dropout. I never even got a GED. \u003cstrong\u003eThe system failed me utterly, and I failed it.\u003c/strong\u003e I succeeded wildly despite this, because I studied independently and developed a keen understanding of music theory, and a passion for teaching and demonstrating it to others. Look, I\u0027m not all talk, here\u0027s me and my dude doing it earlier tonight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVZNTde2K6c\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to think this Patreon\u0027s success shows that I\u0027ve reached a bunch of great people already. \u003cstrong\u003eNow, Mint Potion TV is ready to attempt to reach out to millions of people, and help improve our general cultural understanding of, and love for, music.\u003c/strong\u003e I can\u0027t reach these millions of people by myself; I need a super-talented team, trustworthy business partners, and adequate facilities to produce a staggering amount of content each year, and promote the hell out of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMINT POTION: THE STREAMS\u003c/h2\u003eLive-streaming services like Twitch Creative, YouTube Live, and Periscope allow our large personal studio to become a public schoolhouse, a free improv theater, a circus, and a gaming den, potentially at the same time. \u003cstrong\u003eIn April we will launch an 8-hour, Tue-Thurs block of original shows\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ethat include VR game development streams like the one above, fully produced music being written in unbelievably small windows of time, Alton Brown-style cooking shows where we talk about the music of the food\u0027s culture of origin, free music constructive critique call-in shows, and even a show where we compose music live by remotely triggering and recording synthesizers located 3000 miles away, in the studio of a retired rock star!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the people and the technology are assembling, and we need only build rooms and work on the graphics and show lineup.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe plan be the most interactive streamers in history.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur studio itself will be custom-wired from day one to be uniquely audience-interactive, from dozens of remote-control devices installed which viewers can trigger on-camera from our website, to polls about what direction to take a song in, to Skype video calls from audience members where we record them beatboxing. Viewers with VR headsets will be able to watch gameplay live \"on the couch\" (or in a virtual baseball stadium) seated next to our hosts. Other streamers will have open invitations to crash the party in inter-channel rap battles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe development of many of our shows will be streamed live as well, reality-TV-style, so that you can see what goes into not only our music, but our channel itself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMINT POTION: THE BUSINESS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eWe are producing all of this in a 4,000 sq. ft., fully remodeled space just north of Los Angeles; \u003cstrong\u003ethe same studio where you helped rent me an office last year\u003c/strong\u003e. Our setup now includes three sound-isolated music rooms, a band recording room, a vocal isolation booth, a video editing room, an in-house indie game development team working rent-free in my former loft space, and two luxuriously appointed game-streaming areas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur studio recently co-created an album,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.bigbadbosses.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBig Bad Bosses: Power Overwhelming\u003c/a\u003e, that took #1 on the iTunes Comedy Charts for three weeks over the holiday season, and hit #3 on the Billboard Comedy Charts. So we\u0027re geared up to go, and have a winning formula!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that we can build even more patrons here who believe in our cause, and we\u0027ll be interacting with you on a semi-daily basis to achieve that growth and honor our commitment to you. But we also have plans for a constant revenue stream based on frequent small music releases that we think is pretty amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a dozen dedicated professionals already collaborating, including an attorney and an accountant, and an egalitarian and transparent financial policy, so that our fortunes rise together. \u003cstrong\u003eUntil we can\u00a0pay professionals fairly, we go without their services\u003c/strong\u003e. So, with your support, I hope to be able to fairly pay all kinds of cool talented people to do stuff with us, and we\u0027ll make you a part of the story as we post our financial goals on the site and celebrate reaching them together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe can do it together!
