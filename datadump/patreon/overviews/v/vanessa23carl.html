Vanessa Sinclair is a psychoanalyst, psychologist, poet, and artist \u0026amp; Carl Abrahamsson is a writer, filmmaker, photographer, and musician, who also owns and runs the publishing company Trapart. One of many reasons we got married was that we were both already immersed in the same kinds of creative interests as individuals, so we decided we might as well create together. A great decision! This has led to even more books, films, music, collages, photography, exhibitions, conferences, LPs, DVDs, etc. We are now a creative team involved in multi-platform, cutting-edge creations, and active on a global scene of art and happenings. We also love networking and would love to hear from you here at Patreon. Thank you for joining us on this multifaceted journey of life\u2026To us, a patron is a friend!\u003cbr\u003e"
