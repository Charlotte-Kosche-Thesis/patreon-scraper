Part blog, part comic, part bitchfest, it\u0027s meant to help me express my feelings about being increasingly poor and disabled in a world that supports neither.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIronically, I had a terrible paralyzing relapse in January and since then haven\u0027t been able to work full time. My freelancing gigs are not covering living and I\u0027m not getting benefits yet. Thanks to a fundraiser online, I have survived and gotten a scooter but in order to maintain independent living I need to start getting ongoing support. That\u0027s where this Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople who support me at the five dollar level will receive that week\u0027s comics in a PDF on the Sunday before they start to post to my Tumblr,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://me-and-martin-sheen.tumblr.com/!\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://me-and-martin-sheen.tumblr.com/!\u003c/a\u003e Supporting my work helps keep me in pens and sketchbooks, and also provides ongoing moral support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy eventual goal is to start collecting these pages into comic zines that I can print out and publish."

     "about": "Victoria Morris makes neon sculptural installations that seek to remove neon elements from their signage past by eliminating the wall and incorporating aspects of being seen in the round. Her work seeks to establish a referential connection between lighting and the desert landscape of her youth. A native Las Vegan, she graduated from Las Vegas Academy of Performing Arts\u0027 visual art program before attending the College of Southern Nevada and then later the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for her BFA.\u003cbr\u003ePreviously, Victoria Morris created indie and small-press comics and zines. Her work ranged from humorous auto-biography, historical biography and analysis of pop-culture media works in a melange of feminism and fannish concerns.\u003cbr\u003eVictoria Morris currently lives and works in Chicago.\u003cbr\u003e",
