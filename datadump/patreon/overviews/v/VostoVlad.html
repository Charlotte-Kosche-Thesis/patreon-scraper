    "summary": "I like to see myself as a free thinker . Since I made my first steps in life I have always been a critical thinker , not in an offensive way of course but just pointing out the flaws of society and not accepting injustice or secretive malicious behavior from what I was told were my authorities .\u003cbr\u003eMy mission is to call out the problems of our society and the snake oil sails men . \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say the things that others don\u0027t have the courage to . \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube has become a landscape in which you are forbidden to talk about controversial topics if you want to stay monetized , recommended and trending . Many creators have therefore stopped making videos and have ceased to make their voices heard and I don\u0027t blame them .\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe are now living in a dystopian world where nothing is allowed on the main-stream unless it has been reviewed by \" Big Brother\u0027s Experts \" and approved . Everything is subject to censorship similarly \u00a0to a communist state . Seriously this is how it was back in the communist days of my country , Romania , before an artist was allowed to be printed the art work would have had to be reviewed by the censors . If an ideology contrary to that of the communist party was spotted then\u003cbr\u003ethat art work would have been banned .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create what many call conspiracy videos but for me these are more like investigative journalism videos of a not so perfect world .\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFrom the more speculative interpretations about the influence of secret society symbolism and ideology in our entertainment to the more down to earth corruption and analysis from a business and less speculative information side , I talk about all kinds of subjects \u00a0in a way that can be watched and understood in a small video . I try to make my videos around 10 minutes and create them with a clean aesthetic that will be pleasant for the viewer . There will also be variations , sometimes I may just want to show a 20 second clip from a movie \u00a0( which is what I consider truth in plain sight and the viewers will be able to make their own interpretations or use that clip in their own work ) and other times I may make a large 45 minute documentary on a specific topic .\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe possibilities are endless ! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebut I am not your average conspiracy theorist , in fact I have no respect for some of the practices that other youtube conspiracists apply , not everything on this planet is illuminati confirmed , I don\u0027t see only doom and gloom ... where people see problems , I see solutions but it is important to talk and study the problem of course , without click baiting , without resorting to the same tactics that the enemy uses , that would be complete hypocrisy . Let us act rational and civilised \u003cbr\u003eand not like mental patients\u00a0because only in this way we stand a chance to be taken seriously .\u003cbr\u003eI will try to stay true to my work and remain unbiased .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a world where there are a ton of channels that have non-constructive \u00a0biased content I feel that it is my duty to inform the public about the con artists that surround us .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also like gaming , since I was a kid I have played and enjoyed games but I feel like they lack true criticism these days so I will make videos of that nature as well .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost gaming channels are payed to make reviews by the game developers and if they don\u0027t make a positive one next time they won\u0027t receive the game before release thus the creator won\u0027t get as much attention if he does the review after release .\u00a0So very few gaming channels on youtube keep their identity . In this particular area I will never sellout and will not be afraid to give that game the sincere criticism it deserves .\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eso that being said I thank you for your interest and trust in my information and let\u0027s work together to expose the malicious parts of this shark machine system .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand when we see something good , let\u0027s also point that out , there are plenty of good games out there made by indie devs ...just like there is also quality food that has not been killed by the claws of greedy industry and movies that are not made by hollywood , let\u0027s promote those things !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003estay conscious and thank you for your time ,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e This is Games Exposed\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 signing out"
