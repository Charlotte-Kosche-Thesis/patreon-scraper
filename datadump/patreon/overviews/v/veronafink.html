BANG! POW!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eHi there! Verona here. For those of you unfamiliar with my work, I am a full time Model, Fire/Sideshow Artist, Dancer, Designer, MUA, SPFX and Photographer. The list of creativity doesn\u0027t stop there but if I listed it all we\u0027d be here forever. My work can be found on numerous websites as well as my own! \u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027m just your every day tattooed, clown loving, hip shaking, uninhibited ball of chaos and fire! I have found a love within artistic expression and fire (let\u0027s not pretend and act like I wasn\u0027t a little Pyro) since I was a child and found it all came very naturally to me. I am a professionally trained dancer for 20+ years (with fire/sideshow for 13+)\u00a0 in multiple styles of dance and currently working to be a Belly Dance Master. I dance to anything that puts a boogie in my bones! Bookshelves full of poetry and prose. I\u0027m obsessed with bulldogs and cheese. Snack Master. Whiskey Neat. I collect oddities and have a fascination for the spooky and twisted. Human Pincushion. Lingerie, Corsets and Boots Fanatic!\u003cbr\u003e\n\tYou\u0027ll most likely find me being a dragon, zipping down the highway or having a no pants party alone on my couch with a large pizza.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy118/veronafink/Untitled-2_zpseivgctub.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have evolved my craft exponentially over the years to create the best content I can!\n I have taken a huge liking to using my creativity in original artwork, writings, costume designs, choreography and more! I  want to use this as a way to showcase my art, help me travel to \nnew locations and work with new people so I can challenge myself into \npushing beyond the limits as a model and artist. Art is in my blood. With your support I can build my creative skills and learn new ones. I can put focus on my dreams, create new artistic visions, purchase new camera gear, appear at more conventions/festivals, travel to new territories and hopefully even publish a book one day! Your support not only \u201cbuys\u201d you the incredible loot I\u2019ve created\n for you- it gives me the power to turn my wildest dreams into reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGiving back to my community is paramount to me.

It\u0027s not breaking news that what I do is not cheap. Prop/Costume/Set build alone can range between $150-$1000+ depending on the project and even though I do try to be as conservative with my materials as possible while not sacrificing the quality of appearance and content, not having proper resources can sometime force me to take time off from my work. I still do my best to make my Facebook, Instagram, YouTube (recent development) as quality and interactive as I can with my free \ncontent. Patreon will allow me to give back so much more to those of you that \nmake it possible to do what I do without sacrificing my sanity!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy118/veronafink/BeFunky%20Collage3_zpsjfxayaqo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI desire to share even MORE with all of you! Being able to share these experiences of creation and completion is \nsomething I truly cherish. Though you can find my images all over the web, my aim for this Patreon \nis to provide EXCLUSIVE high-quality content to my fans and supporters, \nand offer a rare insight to my personal life as a full-time model, artist and photographer. But this way I can \ngive you all my sincerest gratitude, exciting personalized perks, and tons of media content! So i want to share as much as i can with you! Not only will I be sharing my life; expect to see vlogs, shenanigans, exclusive sets, original \ndesigns, fan-choices, exclusive physical perks, social media, adds, but also unseen content and a peek into my experience and life as I explore my voyeur side.\u00a0 I want to give back, and hear what\n YOU want to see and get in return! It\u0027s truly a blessing, to do my very best and fill your days with fun \ncontent and art I can be proud of!
