My first notebooks were full of made-up worlds, and I pressed my siblings into helping me build them in elaborate games of make-believe. (Both of them still have me listed in their phones as one of the characters from my earliest known story.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I\u0027ve been doodling out worlds and characters in the margins of my life; keeping a Word document open on my computer desktop became a sort of reflex. And as I grew up and came into myself, one of the things I realized was that \u003cstrong\u003eI wasn\u0027t seeing very many people like me in the genres and worlds that I love\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want it, make it, right? So that\u0027s why we\u0027re both here: me, because I want to make fiction that looks more like the people I love, and you because you want to read it. I hope that\u0027s why you\u0027re here, anyway. \u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s make more inclusive fiction together\u003c/strong\u003e. Allow me to entertain you and bring you more good words in worlds that include people like us as part of their essential warp and weft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am chronically ill and permanently disabled, so all of my rewards are set up on a per-item basis. That means that if I\u0027m too sick to write, I don\u0027t write, and if I\u0027m too sick to write, you don\u0027t pay. I will post at most 2 to 3 times per month, but Patreon allows you to set a max pledge on your per-item pledges, so if you have a maximum you\u0027re able to pay monthly, \u003cem\u003eplease set one\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my writing is available at the one-dollar level, because I understand a lot of us have limited budgets. Higher-level pledges allow you to \u003cstrong\u003ehave input \u003c/strong\u003einto what I write or post next, to have \u003cstrong\u003egreater access\u003c/strong\u003e to the process, to \u003cstrong\u003eask me to write you something\u003c/strong\u003e, or to \u003cstrong\u003eshow up\u003c/strong\u003e in the universes we\u0027re creating together as a character.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mandyperry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/AllegoryHeader3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks to my patrons, and to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thebibliosphere/\"\u003eJoy\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/seananmcguire\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSeanan\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/RoAnnaSylver\"\u003eRoAnna\u003c/a\u003e, who have provided invaluable support and tutorials and the occasional kick to the ass as appropriate.
