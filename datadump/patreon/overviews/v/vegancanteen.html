    "summary": "Hi Folks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Sophia Banks, I have recently started Vegan Canteen, a vegan home cooked meal delivery service. I am hoping to expand Vegan Canteen by featuring lots of amazing vegan recipes on the blog. I want to focus on lots of areas of vegan cooking, from easy to cook healthy vegan meals, to classic brunch items, and that delicious comfort food we all crave so much. Even lots of vegan cheeses you can make at home. I really want to work on a vegan cookbook.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every $10 pledged I will post one recipe a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a trained chef and have been working with food for nearly 20 years. It\u0027s my passion. I want to start working on a vegan cook book in addition to posting recipes on my blog. Ideally spending the next 8-12 finalizing a lot of my recipes to perfection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to use this patreon to fund the research and development of my recipes and work towards putting together a truly great vegan cookbook and food blog. One that features a variety or recipes from quick dinners to fermentation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am looking for about $500 a month which will allow me to post a recipe a day. That would cover the cost of the food and time to break down the recipe into measurements, to take photos and post the recipes, as well as other additional costs that come with food prep and blogging. It\u0027s finding a balance with my catering and also having time to run a vegan food blog and research and develop new recipes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a queer trans woman and by helping me pursue my goals here you are also supporting me as a trans woman working towards building a sustainable business and writing a cookbook. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it will also be great to take recipe requests from folks and post them on the blog, as a way to thank you and also for us to engage with each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently become super passionate about vegan cheese making and much of what I hope to do is also work on vegan cheese experiments and towards a monthly cheese box. Certain cheeses can take up to 5 weeks to mature so it\u0027s s slow expensive project to work on. Sort of like creating great craft beers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of what I am aiming to do is bringing around amazing vegan food modeled on community supported agriculture. I have done lots of research on this practice and how restaurants and craft breweries have used to grow business. The community you are supporting is great vegan food and if you are contributing a certain amount you will also be receiving my cookbook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a big believer in food being accessible. I will work to create affordable recipes and offer multiple versions of recipes where ingredients can be swapped out for other ones. I will use soy and nuts but also offer alternatives and talk about what modifications may be needed to the recipe. Vegan food can be delicious and affordable and I think cooking great food can be accessible and taught. I have trained cooks for almost 20 years and I enjoy it. I am patient and love explaining the how\u0027s and why\u0027s of food.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome folks have asked if they can donate a one time pledge to help me reach my goal. Absolutely. My paypal is sophiadbanks@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to ask me any questions you may have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoph\u003cbr\u003e"
