    "summary": "Hi!\nWelcome! Thank you for coming here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d like you to consider being one of the very\nfew people who get early access to my Don Quixote duology, \u003cem\u003eThe Squire\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eThe Knight.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0When you support my\nPatreon campaign, you\u2019ll get access to not only the novels as they\u0027re written, but also a first\nlook at the behind the scenes of making them. Depending on the level of access\nyou choose, you\u2019ll get chapters, notes, and regular engagement from me as I\nwrite and go through the process of completing the book. You can also get short\nstories and novellas as well, released on a regular basis. Feel free to drop\nout any time, but this adventure is one we can share together. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough I\u0027ve been writing since I was twelve, I\nhave only been submitting stories since 2012. In the past four years, I\u0027ve\npublished three books, two novellas and have had short stories in anthologies\nand magazines, including \u003cem\u003eCrossed Genres \u003c/em\u003e(to read a fun interview\nthey did with me, please \u003ca href=\"http://crossedgenres.com/magazine/002-spotlight/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eclick\nthis link\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Current Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe Squire\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Knight\u003c/em\u003e are Don Quixote in space. No,\nliterally, Don Quixote in Space. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen Don kidnaps his niece Antonia and makes her\nbe his squire, she has no idea what she\u2019s in for. There\u2019s a method to Don\u2019s\nmadness, but can she find the solution before he succumbs to the computer virus\nthat\u2019s been implanted in his cybernetic brain? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese novels take the plot events of Miguel de Cervantes-Saavedra\u0027s \u003cem\u003eDon Quixote\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and re-imagine them in the context of science fiction. Using the plot, characters, and dynamics of the original novel, I am rewriting the original in a way that is not only entertaining to science fiction readers, but also approachable to the modern reader. If you\u0027ve always wanted to dive into the classics, this would be a perfect place to get started.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo give you an idea of what you\u0027re in for, I am\nanticipating approximately thirty chapters per book ranging from about\n1000-5000 words each (depending on the number of scenes in each). I\u0027m\nanticipating releasing a chapter a month, but maybe more if I get adventurous. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eObjectives\nand Goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first objective is to share \u003cem\u003eThe\nSquire\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Knight \u003c/em\u003ewith you. The chapters will be\nreleased once a month. I also would like to share short stories and novellas. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to engage you on a level that, prior to\nnow, was impossible for many authors. One of the things we authors rarely get\nis direct interaction with the community during the process of writing itself.\nI would like to change that with these novels. I want to hear your feedback,\nyour concerns, and your questions. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAn overview of my financial goals with this\nproject:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFund my ability to\nwrite, publish, and edit these novels\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFund my time to write novels, novellas, and short fiction\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFund my ability to go\nto conventions and speak about writing, editing, and diversity as well as\npromote my work\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
