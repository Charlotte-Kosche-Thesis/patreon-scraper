Once a year, we\u2019ll write you a short ditty about whatever you\u2019d like and perform it for you via video. Want a song about raisins? Done. Are you trying to propose to your sweetie via vocal music love? We\u2019ve got you covered. Are you an axe murderer who\u2019s yearning for an evil theme song..?
