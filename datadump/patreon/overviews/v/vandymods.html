My work has culminated in the releases of\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eOld World Rites\u003c/strong\u003e and the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eRunic Forge\u003c/strong\u003e.

As well, I\u0027m in the process of building various campaign mechanic mods, bringing more exciting mechanics to factions, building a \u003cstrong\u003efull\u003c/strong\u003e modding wikia for new and seasoned Total War modders, and a larger project I\u0027m \u003cem\u003every \u003c/em\u003eexcited to share about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eModding has become a culmination of childhood passions - video games, creative writing, and creative play. I now spend plenty of time modding, and love it more than I thought possible. I began frustrated, confused, and hell-bent on decoding all of the information laid in front of me. I am now dedicated to producing high-quality projects, usable with bothvanilla \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003eoverhauls, that can make the campaign overall more interesting, challenging, and hopefully more lengthy and enjoyable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI personally \u003cstrong\u003edo not believe in paid mods\u003c/strong\u003e, and my content is here for free, for the enjoyment of a community I\u0027ve been involved in for over a decade. Being a Patron can give you access to a behind-the-scenes look into the trials and tribulations of being a modder, early access to upcoming content, guaranteed talking sessions with yours truly, and plenty else! It can also give you the knowledge that you\u0027re doing the world a good cause - there is so much demand for good mods, and so little supply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to now thank the people that have helped me get this far:\u003cbr\u003e- My girlfriend, for all her endless support\u003cbr\u003e- My mom, for telling me to put my dreams before anything else\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/f2wXwyw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe C\u0026amp;C Modding Den\u003c/a\u003e, for helping me not give up even though it would\u0027ve been really easy to\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/CataphTW\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCataph\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Crynsos\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCrynsos\u003c/a\u003e, for building a fantastic and supportive community\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0DrunkFlamingo, for being an excellent partner-in-crime and surprisingly adequate mate to complain to. \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/drunkflamingo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHe also has a Patreon\u003c/a\u003e, check it out!

     "description": "Long-term, I\u0027d love to be stable from modding. It\u0027s a heavy task, and what I\u0027d love to do takes lots of time. Unfortunately though, my second-hand computer isn\u0027t the hottest - I\u0027m running on the lowest possible GPU and CPU for modern gaming, with only 4GB of RAM and about 250 GB of disk space. I\u0027m more than grateful that I have what I have - best computer of my life so far! - but with a bit of an upgrade, I can do things like keep the game up and my modding tools simultaneously, take prettier screenshots, and set up some modding tutorials with recording software.\u003cbr\u003e",
