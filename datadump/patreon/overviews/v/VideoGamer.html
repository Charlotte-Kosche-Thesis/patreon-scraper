    "summary": "\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eVGBGs - Helping VideoGamer Make Fun Stuff Since 2016\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February 2015 we launched the VideoGamer Community Club on Patreon. We were blown away by your support and it enabled us to continue making content that you don\u0027t see from other video game publications. We\u0027re a small team and your funding meant the world to us. Last year that became the \u003cstrong\u003eVGBGs\u003c/strong\u003e (VideoGamer Boys and Girls \u0026amp; All The Brilliantly Fantastic People)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a hell of a year, and we couldn\u0027t have got through it without you. And, along the way, you\u0027ve let us know what you want from the Patreon. And that\u0027s podcasts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a \u003cstrong\u003e$1 tier\u003c/strong\u003e, and you can pledge at whatever level you would like, but there\u0027s only one reward tier: the \u003cstrong\u003e$4.50 tier\u003c/strong\u003e (it was going to be $5, but then because of the Patreon fees thing we changed it to $4.50, but then Patreon dropped the fees but we were like, \u0027Whatever, it\u0027s too close to Christmas and our Patrons are cool,\u0027 so we aren\u0027t changing it back). Here\u0027s what your rewards are: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusively extended and early VideoGamer Podcast every Tuesday\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatron-exclusive Discord\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive extra VGBG Radio podcast every Friday\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn exclusive monthly prize draw of fun stuff we\u0027ve been sent, exclusively for you exclusive lot\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe extra podcast is a rolling schedule of four themes, one for each Friday of the month (you can think of it as getting four different monthly podcasts if that helps, but it may in fact be more confusing so forget we said anything). They\u0027re based on stuff you said you like us talking about, and collectively are called \u003cstrong\u003eVGBG Radio\u003c/strong\u003e because we think that\u0027s cool. VGBG Radio is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDialogue Options\u003c/strong\u003e - Us having a bit of a chat, talking about the month that\u0027s gone, and maybe showing you behind the curtain at VG a bit, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHit Box\u003c/strong\u003e - Each month Colm Ahern gives us a classic professional wrestling match to watch and discuss\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWanted Level\u003c/strong\u003e - We watch some of the best and worst that police procedural television shows have to offer (this is great because the best police procedural shows are also the worst ones).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe VG Game Club\u003c/strong\u003e - Like a book club, but for games! We\u0027ll play through some notable and/or interesting titles and discuss them together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe VideoGamer Discord has separate channels for you all to join in and discuss what we talk about on the podcasts with us. Neat-o!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of why we\u0027re running a Patreon, the reasons are the same as ever. Your funding is a massive help in our continuing efforts to punch above our weight amongst UK games media. With your help, we want to grow into a juggernaut that won\u2019t let up and is second place to absolutely nobody. We can\u2019t overstate how important you are to us in getting to that next level and at the end of the day, it\u2019s all for you. Without the VGBGs, there is no VideoGamer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that in mind, we want to ensure that we are delivering content that you want to consume. When I fork out \u00a310 to Tim Cook to listen to the latest T Swift record, I expect to hear the voice of the Pennsylvanian angel rather than a croaky Taylor that\u2019s been out on the lash the night before. If our content isn\u2019t what you deem of a high enough quality, then tell us. We want to create things that you enjoy and we\u2019ll be damned if that ever changes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, VGBGs. You\u2019re the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eX\u003cbr\u003e"
