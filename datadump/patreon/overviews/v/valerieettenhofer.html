    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Valerie and I write things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m passionate about looking thoughtfully at pop culture--as art, as social commentary, as an emotional experience, as a reflection of culture, and as pure entertainment. I especially love film, TV, and literature, topics I will gladly chat with you about at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work part-time in an office setting, but put most of my blood, sweat, and tears into writing for \u003cem\u003eFilm School Rejects\u003c/em\u003e, IndieReader, the \u003cem\u003eEast Bay Express\u003c/em\u003e, the podcast \u003cem\u003eTalk Easy with Sam Fragoso,\u003c/em\u003e and other projects that aren\u0027t yet announced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always and will always work to shine the spotlight on artistic voices that deserve to be valued and heard, and to pay it forward whenever possible. I just need a little help keeping the lights on while I do. Check out the right-hand sidebar for information on all the great perks you can get when you choose to subscribe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion: Why do you need to raise money through Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnswer: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are a couple of reasons that creators use Patreon. Mostly, it\u2019s due to the structural problems within creative industries which make generating a living wage during one\u2019s first few years in the field nearly impossible. In my case, this is also an ideal way to engage with the people who support me. I\u2019m excited to write for and to you all, to keep in touch with you, and to know that you value the work that I put into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion: What are you spending the money on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnswer:\u003c/strong\u003e First and foremost, this money will go toward necessities like the cost of rent, transportation, food, student loans, healthcare, and phone and utility bills. I have already consolidated these costs as much as humanly possible on my own and can answer more questions about them privately if you\u2019d like. Additionally, I do spend a good chunk of money (more than I make writing) on the services I use in order to write: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Filmstruck, and Moviepass. Eventually, I will become eligible to join groups that offer free press materials, meaning I will be able to access more work-related content for free and cut down on these costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion: When do I get charged?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnswer: \u003c/strong\u003eYou should not get automatically charged when you sign up, but let me know if for some reason you do. Charges will post on your card on the first of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion: I have a different question.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnswer: \u003c/strong\u003eCool, message me!"
