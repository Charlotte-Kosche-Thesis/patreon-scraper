By supporting me on Patreon you are directly helping with the production costs of creating the Learning By Doing videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Vernon Deck. \u003cbr\u003eI named my You Tube channel \"Learning By Doing\" as thats exactly how I live my life. I prefer to go out and just DO things and learn about it on the way. Sure, I make mistakes along the way, sometimes big mistakes but the fear of making mistakes is not enough of a reason to not try something at all. The easiest thing in the world is to sit back and do nothing. My biggest fears are regret, not making decisions, taking the easy way out and just doing what everyone else is doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron is a great way to get to know me and the lifestyle that I chose to live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Producing videos on the move is hard and time consuming. I love what I do but the costs to produce videos is amplified by computers breaking, salt getting to the camera. That is why I am on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is Patreon and why use it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wH-IDF809fQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is like a tip jar.  If you liked my videos and they made you laugh, help support my videos! I take your donations and purchase equipment that brings you a better viewing experience, such as underwater gear, sound equipment or video editing software.  It also offsets our uploading costs which can get out of hand real fast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, you designate your monthly contribution amount per video and you can even set a maximum amount. I try to release a new video every second week. Patreon handles all of the work on the back end and deducts a few fees for processing, credit cards, etc.  They send us some love the first week of the month.  We receive approximately 90% of what is pledged on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
