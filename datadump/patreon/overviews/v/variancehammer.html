Where did the name, and the idea, come from?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever read a website talking about miniature wargaming on the internet, you\u0027ve probably encountered a phrase like the following: \"Well, on average, the Plasma Megablaster should kill 12.667 Space Marines per shot...\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is, that statement doesn\u0027t actually contain all that much information. First of all, you cannot kill 2/3rds of a Space Marine - he\u0027s either dead or he isn\u0027t. Second, what\u0027s the variability associated with that? Is it possible that the Plasma Megablaster will kill zero Space Marines? 100 Space Marines? All of these statements are built on what\u0027s known as the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLaw of Large Numbers\u003c/a\u003e, which assumes essentially an infinite number of die rolls. And that\u0027s the core of the problem: games of Warhammer involve very \u003cem\u003efew\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0dice rolls. Essentially, there are no \"average\" games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been trying to address that, by looking at simulation-based analysis (what I also do for a living as a computational scientist) and statistics to actually look at the variability inherent in the game, and question some of our closely held assumptions about it. So far, this has included everything from product reviews to a statistical analysis of the Las Vegas Open, with more to come. I\u0027ve also tried infusing this with a fairly positive attitude about the game as a whole - inspired by the good folks at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theindependentcharacters.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Independent Characters\u003c/a\u003e I think the best discussions of the game should make people more excited to play, not less.\u003cbr\u003e"
