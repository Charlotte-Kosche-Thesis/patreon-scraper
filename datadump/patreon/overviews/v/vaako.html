I do work full-time, but it would be great if I could afford to take a little more time off to work on these projects. Some of you may know already, but 3D animation is an incredibly time consuming task. It is one thing to create 4-second gifs, which can still take hours, but I only create 1+ minute animations, and I never re-use or loop any animations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out my existing tumblr blog here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://vaako-7.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://vaako-7.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis might give you a taste of the kind of content I am producing. You can also check an archive of all my past animations in Naughty Machinima here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.naughtymachinima.com/user/vaako7/videos/public\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.naughtymachinima.com/user/vaako7/videos...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of animations in my pipeline in varying degrees of completeness, but the rendering and post production processes are just so long that I can\u0027t afford to take the time to complete them. If you have been a fan of my animations and posters in the last few years, please consider giving what you can to help support the creation of more! I always want to expand my projects, and I think you guys will be very happy with the quality increase of my work, especially when you compare it to when I first started.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should be noted to new people that I primarily animate with a certain cast of characters, and adding new ones to my roster takes a lot of time to both choose and to work on. So if you came here expecting me to make Mass Effect animations or something, then I\u0027m sorry to disappoint you. There are many other extremely talented people out there covering all those large franchise animations, I am here to just work on this little niche so I hope you guys understand that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to mention that I am still open for commissions, and I will leave it to the buyer\u0027s discretion if they want the animation posted publicly or not. Just remember that I work on a certain scope of projects, and there are things that I am not willing to do, but I can point you to people who can. I have made many friends in the animation community, and there is definitely something for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any other questions, my tumblr is an open book, and I answer every question/message that comes my way unless they are incredibly similar to recently answered questions."

With enough donations per video, I can start to set aside more time and maybe take a day off here and there to let my PC churn through these CPU intensive tasks.",

With enough pledges, it will be much more viable for me to spend the time adding audio to every new piece that comes out, and maybe even retrofitting audio to some older productions as well if people want me to.",
