    "summary": "Hello. My name is Ms. Larsen. I started VYVA as a student leadership club in the high school were I was teaching video editing and running the school film festival. Since then the school discontinued the program. Because of that a friend of mine suggested turning VYVA from a school club into a 501(c)(3) non-profit to keep the film festival alive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe festival is now in it\u0027s 16th year. I believe in providing visual media art education and opportunity to students who no longer have access in school. I realize there are hundreds if not thousands of festivals out there but EYE Light is truly based on education. Students submit their films, receive critique from judges, and are given one week to make changes. Winning students receive (at the moment) small scholarships for their effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis program is vital to our area and is capable of being launched across the globe if VYVA can grow. However, that will take more than one dedicated teacher, it will take patrons like you to make that happen.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition I work with students after school and on weekends, as well as with community partners to provide internship opportunities. Some of the organization students have work with are: Kaiser, The Grand Jury Association, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Pink Lemonade, The Children\u0027s Nurturing Project, Farm to Fork, Desert Bus, The Solano County Justus Department, LZ Photo, 3R Rescue, The Davis Art Center, and Nature of Sound\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have included a whimsical video students made at the school I was teaching for the year VYVA Inc was founded.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "VYVA Inc is a 501(c)(3) and was originally founded to keep the EYE Light Student Film Festival alive. Now it offers visual media art training, internships, and hands out scholarships to students for art and film. To date VYVA has been funded out of Ms. Larsen\u0027s teachers pay and in case you didn\u0027t know teachers do not make even half as much as other Master\u0027s Level Professionals. Therefore, after trying other forms of getting donations (like spending $2,000 for a grant writer to not write a grant) Ms. Larsen has chosen to try alternative means to earn more money for VYVA to be able to grow the festival and hand out more scholarships.\u003cbr\u003e",
