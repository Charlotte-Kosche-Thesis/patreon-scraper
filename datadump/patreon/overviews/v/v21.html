    "summary": "hi, i\u0027m George (also known as v21)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\ni am the creator and maintainer of\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheap Bots, Done Quick!\u003c/a\u003e, a free and accessible way to make Twitterbots without any technical expertise. it\u0027s been running since May 2015, and there are now over 5000 active twitter accounts running on there! wow!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\ni created CBDQ because i thought that twitterbots were a fascinating creative form, and that it was a shame it was one restricted to people who could write code, set up server hosting, and wrangle twitter API keys. i still love the feeling of making a little entity that can exist independently of you, tweeting things that you designed - but can also surprise you. i\u0027m really glad that CBDQ has let me share that feeling with so many others.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\ni also make my own bots - most notably\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/softlandscapes\"\u003e@softlandscapes\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/manygradients\"\u003e@manygradients\u003c/a\u003e, but also\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/unicode_garden\"\u003e@unicode_garden\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/cant_miss_it\"\u003e@cant_miss_it\u003c/a\u003e (all of these run on CBDQ).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://v21.io/files/softlandscape_eg_for_patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(^^ this is an image from softlandscapes)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nand finally i\u0027m a videogame designer and curator. i\u0027ve worked on\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://v21.io\"\u003ea whole range of weird projects\u003c/a\u003e, from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://beastsofbalance.com/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://v21.io/cubes/\"\u003edodging cubes\u003c/a\u003e to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://v21.io/punchthecustard\"\u003epunching custard\u003c/a\u003e. that\u0027s not why i\u0027m on Patreon, though.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ewhy am i on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCBDQ has gotten pretty popular, and i\u0027ve recently expanded the server it\u0027s running on, which costs a bit more. so i thought i\u0027d turn to Patreon to cover my server costs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nif i cover those costs: thank you. but what else? i would like to carve out more time to work on the site, expanding it and adding more features (while still keeping the focus on being approachable, of course). more money would allow me to set aside some of my freelance work and work on CBDQ instead.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nand maybe i\u0027ll make some more bots! there\u0027s some ideas i was playing with before...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ewhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nthis is a tricky one. normally, it\u0027s a good idea to offer some exclusive rewards for supporters. but the whole point of CBDQ is to make creative technology more accessible to people - so any cool extra features just for backers feels against the spirit of that. maybe i\u0027ll think of something that makes sense in the future, but for now what i\u0027m offering is the satisfaction of supporting a thing you want to exist. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nand, of course, time spent making those extra things exclusively for backers is time away from working on CBDQ. here are some things i have on my todo list:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- reliability work, better testing and general infrastructure work\u00a0 - this is boring, but helps keep it up and makes adding more features more manageable\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- updating tutorial docs and examples, to make it even clearer to use\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- a forum for sharing bots people have made and for people to support each other\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- better error reporting, to make it clearer when things have went wrong (while editing, and while it\u0027s tweeting)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- support for attaching images and videos directly\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- improving the tweet reply feature (for instance, it\u0027d be cool if you could pull out keywords from the tweets you\u0027re replying to)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- integration with Glitch and other services?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- and maybe larger, more open ended expansions - please get in touch if you have thoughts on this!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eoh, also!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\ni would be remiss if I did not link\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/galaxykate\"\u003eKate Compton\u0027s Patreon\u003c/a\u003e. she is the creator of Tracery, a tool for writing generative grammars that sits at the heart of CBDQ, and without which CBDQ would almost certainly not exist.\u003cbr\u003e"
