    "summary": "Are you a fan of horror? Do you take delight in watching fun\nbad movies? Do you miss the days of horror movie hosts like Elvira, Joe Bob\nBriggs, and Grandpa Munster? Then this new show could be just the thing for\nyou.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  Join the\ncrazed vampire-scientist, Count Vigostein, in this mad and macabre series, and\ndelve into the pits of hell itself, to unearth cheesy (and sometimes wretched)\nhorror films. Listen to Vigostein review the films, explain their tropes, and\npoke fun at them as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an amazing thing. With the help of donations from incredible people, many creators have been able to create amazing things. And it\u0027s through Patreon that I hope to create a project that I\u0027ve been working on for many years. With enough donations (and the ultimate goal being one hundred dollars), I would be able to purchase make-up, costumes, props, and (hopefully) professional lights and camera. All things that would greatly benefit this type of show.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  I used to\nwatch monster movie nights on television, and saw clips of horror movie hosts\nsuch as Joe Bob Briggs and Elvira, and thought they were a lot of fun. My goal\nis to bring back this type of show, and add similar humor from them, as well as\nfrom my all-time favorite show, \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  Each\nepisode will be five to ten minutes long. As stated, the ideal look and feel of\nthe show is to be similar to \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000\u201d, while also having\nthe same touch as \u201cMonster Vision\u201d, and a dash of \u201cTurner Classic Movies\u201d, with\na man (Vigostein) introducing the films, and giving the history about them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  The set is\nsupposed to look cheesy, very much like an Ed Wood production, with gothic\nlighting, and very fake looking bats, to the point where you can clearly see\nthe strings. There will also be a model castle that is intentionally supposed\nto look fake. The cheesier looking it is the better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  The show is\nan episodic comedy. It is similar to a variety show, with occasional skits. For\nexample, when the movie being featured is about a gorilla, at some\npoint in the episode, a man wearing a gorilla suit could show up, as a\nreference to the featured movie, as well as the countless horror films that have\npeople in gorilla costumes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  The host,\nCount Vigostein, is a vampire-scientist, who lives in a haunted castle. He will not talk in a stereotypical Transylvanian accent, but\nwill have a similar voice to Christopher Lee. He has lived for centuries, and\nis morbidly curious about horror films, specifically ones that are forgotten\nand bad.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  The reviews\nare not meant to be serious or very analytical. Again, the show is meant to be\ncomedic, and while the reviews will bring up specific points, it\u2019s more about\nhow the character will react to them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the end\nresult and want to see more, it would be a lot of help if you could continue to\ndonate. Anything would be great, and there would be rewards given based on the\namount donated. All money will go towards the production of the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  I hope you\nwill consider this as something you\u2019d like to support, and that together, we\ncan bring back this type of program.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCount Vigostein.\u003cbr\u003e"
