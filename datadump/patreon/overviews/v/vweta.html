I am Vweta and I love to write stories about diverse\ncharacters who could only exist in an equitable world and in my head :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am the Founder of Project ASHA, a World Pulse 2017 Global Ambassador, a 2016 Mandela Washington\nFellow, a 2015 Coady Centre for Women Leadership Graduate and Fellow, a 2015\nUnited States Institute of Peace Generation Change Fellow, a 2013 Carrington Youth Fellow, a 2013 LEAP Africa Social Innovators Award Recipient and Fellow and World Pulse Voices of Our Future Correspondent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince 2013, I have written articles about realities women\nand girls face in low income communities across Africa, especially those\nmarginalized due to disability, illiteracy and poverty. You\u0027d find some of\nthese articles published on World Pulse, TIME and other platforms under my\nname.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also been living with a disabling health condition for the last 14 years and have had 12 major surgeries and a few minor ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently moved to the UK, where my love and passion for writing, especially writing on subjects I never could get around to has been rekindled.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSimple answer. I want to earn while adding something of value to your lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to write more, but I want to write more sustainably. That\nis \u2013 creating these essays and short stories without the pressure and strain regular employment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my disability impacts my health in unpredictable ways, no 2 days are the same for me. I am gradually coming to terms with how to work around my condition.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI intend to use my periods of a measure of good health to write one essay and one short story each month and patreons\nwill be able to subscribe to my materials by pledging a set amount monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Essays and Short Stories?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruthfully, because they are bite-sized goodness that can be devoured at a go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLiving with a disability amplifies the feeling of the \u0027outsider\u0027 that I often feel. By writing about minority characters like me, who feel like they are walking against the crowd, never quite fitting in, I hope\nto do justice to our struggles, bring our diversity to the fore and foster a culture\nof acceptance, tolerance and understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy stories offer a unique perspective into the world as I\nperceive it and as it still is in most third world and developed\u00a0countries. They will feature\ncharacters many today consider as \u0027the other\u0027: people of colour, disabled\npeople, Sexual minorities, religious minorities, those on the fringe of\nsocietal conventions and norms. The fluid and non-binaries. The unapologetically\nnonconformist, the pathfinders inspite of everything life has thrown at them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNope. Can\u0027t Wait!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese stories will be written one way or another, however, I\ncan\u2019t think of a more appropriate time to write these stories than right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am inviting you to come on this journey with me as we birth these stories and gift them to the world, now, more than ever when the\nworld needs them most.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAh\u00e9hee\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
