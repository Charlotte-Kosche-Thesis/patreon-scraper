Through exercises and group songs that are as silly as they are revelatory, \u003cstrong\u003eInside Voice\u003c/strong\u003e shows that the only limits on our voices are the ones we impose on them and that to work on the voice is to work on the self. You\u2019ll learn to harness powerful, heartbreaking, visceral, fragile, and otherworldly sounds you never dreamed were inside you all the while dramatically extending your range, building your confidence, and strengthening the emotional links between you and your voice.  Inside Voice synthesizes my research and training in the extended voice techniques of Roy Hart/Richard Armstrong and the transcendent group songs of Thomas Richards and the Grotowski Workcenter. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to bring this transformative opportunity to all who might want it, not just to those who can afford it, so\u00a0I\u0027ve partnered with the fine folks at Judson Memorial Church to offer two days of Inside Voice experiences each month.\u00a0 Each day features both a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sing-a-secret-a-free-introduction-to-inside-voice-with-jonathan-stancato-registration-31003272623\"\u003eSing a Secret workshop\u003c/a\u003e and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hearing-voices-a-bi-monthly-candlelit-mindbody-vocal-jam-session-tickets-42023475346\"\u003eHearing Voices experience\u003c/a\u003e, both of which are offered free to the public as an experiment in a pay-what-you-wish, pay-it-forward model.\u00a0 Participants who find value in the experience are asked to join the Patreon community so that future sessions can continue to be funded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!"

I did not, like so many, come to teaching through work as a professional singer. In fact, when I went off to college, I thought I\u0027d never ever get to sing along happily to the radio without torturing myself and others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then something happened. A lot of somethings actually. In my early twenties I trained with two legendary men, \u003ca href=\"http://richardarmstrong.info/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Armstrong\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/a\u003e (\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.roy-hart.com/index.htm\"\u003eRoy Hart Theatre\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e) and \u003cstrong\u003eThomas Richards\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e(\u003ca href=\"http://www.theworkcenter.org/\"\u003eGrotowksi Workcenter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e), who with philosophies and teaching styles which could not have diverged more, helped me understand that \u003cstrong\u003emy voice is not an instrument at all, but simply me.\u003c/strong\u003e Period. Full stop. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began feeding my voice (and therefore my self) a steady diet of \u003cstrong\u003eself-love and curiosity\u003c/strong\u003e and heard my \u003cstrong\u003erange expand\u003c/strong\u003e, stretching from the octave below bass way up to coloratura soprano, all \u003cstrong\u003ewithout a \u201cbreak.\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d I began to paint with my voice, drawing colors from truly \u003cstrong\u003einfinite permutations of tone, resonance, and intent\u003c/strong\u003e, and discovered a whole realm of \u003cstrong\u003echorded, broken, visceral, and otherworldly\u003c/strong\u003e sounds. I learned to sound like my favorite artists, to sound like my favorite animals, to sound like me, all of the beautiful and terrible parts of me.  I found songs in me that no one ever taught me, songs from another time and place, that made\u003cstrong\u003emy whole being vibrate. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an instructor of physical theatre in the \u003cstrong\u003emasters program of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London\u003c/strong\u003e, I began experimenting with other\u2019s voices. I found that all this work on my own voice had taught me a keen new sense of \u003cstrong\u003edeep listening\u003c/strong\u003e that allowed me to hear what a voice was expressing and what it was hiding. I began creating exercises that \u003cstrong\u003ejoyfully allowed these secrets to be revealed\u003c/strong\u003e.  Inside Voice was born, and what originated as an actor training model soon became\u003cstrong\u003e accessible to any human\u003c/strong\u003e longing to understand and love their voice and their self more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I started working with people in these vulnerable states, I supplemented my background in voice and performance with a wide assortment of modalities, including \u003cstrong\u003ecraniosacral therapy, tarot, holotropic breathing, sound healing, aromatherapy, plant medicine, meditation, visualization, and shamanic journeying\u003c/strong\u003e. Through these practices, I\u2019ve found that many times, the most significant vocal obstacles I am able to unlock for my clients can happen without them singing a single note.",
