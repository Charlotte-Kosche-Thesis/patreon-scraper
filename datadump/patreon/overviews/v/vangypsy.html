Poor Chester was just an empty box on wheels back then. I didn\u2019t know a thing about building out a van and wasn\u2019t even sure I would make much money freelancing, but I was willing to take that leap and see where it would take me. Today, I\u2019m still living full time in old Chester, who is now a legit home, and have a bunch of knowledge under my belt after DIYing the crap out of him. I\u2019ve also had some breathtaking experiences traveling around in my tiny home on wheels and have had the pleasure of meeting some amazing people in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u2019ve Learned\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m passionate about a lot of things and really relish experience of all sorts. Anything new, new sport, new adventure, new people to hang with: sign me up! And in this new age of exponentially growing technology why should I have to choose just one thing to talk about? Sharing just one side of me feels so limiting. I\u2019d rather find a way to combine all my passions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNext Steps\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u2019s time to take my journey to the next level and share those experiences with YOU! I\u2019ve had a lot of help along the way and I\u2019d like to be there for others. I\u2019m all about fixing up Chester and learning as much as I possibly can about maintaining him mechanically and building out the interior to better fit with my lifestyle. I\u2019m also very passionate about staying healthy and eating right while on the road. And I do all this while having amazing adventures, rock climbing, camping, hiking, backpacking and pretty much anything related to the outdoors. And yes, I do me some yoga. :) But the journey hasn\u2019t always been easy to figure out. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on Patreon means I can further share my message of taking a leap to do what I want to do and not what society tells me to do.
