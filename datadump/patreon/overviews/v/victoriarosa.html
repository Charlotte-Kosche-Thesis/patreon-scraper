    "summary": "Everyone deserves to get the support they need. Non-monogamy is not the easiest of endeavours. Jealousy can rear its head, you can have communication breakdowns... and there\u0027s just a lot to learn and unlearn. Some people don\u0027t know anyone who is doing it and may not have access to a polyamorous/non-monogamous community. Some live in countries where there isn\u0027t much support for this. I have had people reach out to me from China, Mexico, Nicaragua, Argentina, Brazil and a range of other countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a coach that specialises in non-monogamy and healthy, ethical relationships. I come from an activist background and feel passionately that access to support should not be restricted based on income. For a few years I have been offering some low-cost or pro-bono sessions for underprivileged people, as well as videos and blog posts on different aspects of open relationships and polyamory. However, that still makes it difficult for me to balance my need to put food on the table with my values around offering the people who need it the right level of support. I\u0027m glad that Patreon offers a way to bridge that divide - with your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho counts as underprivileged?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. People on low incomes (earning under $25k per year)\u003cbr\u003e2. People from low income countries. This means that they may earn ok money for their country, but still be unable to pay for my services. For example, a teacher in Latin America can earn $500 per month.\u003cbr\u003e3. People with multiple levels of oppression, like people of colour, LGBT, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a couple of examples of people you could help:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMaria lives in Santiago de Chile. She had a brief open relationship that ended badly and then reverted to monogamy, for years. She has a parter of 10 years who she loves and wants to spend the rest of her life with. Yet she has fallen in love with Miguel. He has lots of things that are great for her and she feels alive. Her partner is supportive, but very afraid due to earlier bad experiences. They are battling with jealousy, bad negotiation skills and dealing with all the issues in their relationship they never had to deal with before. Meanwhile Miguel is waiting on the sidelines and feels messed around. Maria is a student and works part time. She earns under $500 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCris is a development worker. Originally from France, she has been living in Belize for the past few years, employed by a local project. There she fell in love with John. They are great together. She has been curious about polyamory for years and the pressure has been building. She knows that now is the time for her to go for it and that she can\u0027t realistically do monogamy much longer. She really loves John and wants a future with him but is afraid of non-monogamy wearing down the relationship. Cris is getting paid at the local Belize rates, which means her disposable income is under $100 per month.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow am I going to help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to help people acquire the skills and awareness they need to have successful relationships and be able to really choose the type of relationship they want with as much freedom as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do that, there are a number of things I do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e These are available openly to a broad range of people. They are a good way to reach many people. People send me questions and I answer them or speak around common topics and themes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e2. Coaching\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e I work with people individually. They tend to come to me with a relationship crisis or when they are wanting to have a relationship after a while. The main problems they face are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Jealousy\u003cbr\u003e- Infidelity\u003cbr\u003e- Partners who want different things\u003cbr\u003e- Having made big mistakes in non-monogamy that have hurt their partners\u003cbr\u003e- Not being able to find people to connect with\u003cbr\u003e- How to manage balancing different partners\u003cbr\u003e- Dealing with the outside world\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe work on clarifying what they want and then build a plan to get there. That might involve learning some new skills or ways of doing things. Typically we work over 3 months so that while the person is working towards the relationship they want they are getting support every step of the way, not only on making changes, but also in terms of dealing with what they may encounter. My interventions are short, because my aim is for people to be able to carry on by themselves or with support from a community rather than professionals whenever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is very transparent. You\u0027ll be able to see how much money is coming in. I have set\u00a0some income goals and I will let you know what I am doing with that money on a monthly basis in the community side of the page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I start working with clients, I will share some basic information about them so that you know who you are helping. This will be done with their consent and in a way that maintains their anonymity. Once they are finished I will collate a few sentences about how our work together has impacted their lives and share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are my income goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eVideo editing - $100 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmploy a videographer to create graphics and find music for my video\u003cbr\u003eEmploy a professional video editor to edit my videos\u003cbr\u003eThis will allow me to create more videos and have them be more engaging and visually appealing\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCoach 1 person - $400 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCoach 3 people - $1000 per month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCoach 5 people - $1600 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will coach 1 or more people on low income/low privilege who would usually not have access to a coach.

We will find out what they want happen in their life and relationships and start working towards that goal. I offer clarification, support, I teach specific tools (around communication, negotiation, managing jealousy, etc.) and I help people as they progress through their difficulties.",
