    "summary": "Thank you so much for visiting the Patreon of Devotion to Self, LLC. This business is one of service run by a black lesbian, childbirth doula, aspiring yogi, self-love advocate, and writer, LaNichol Young.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis business was created with the intention to create representation and resources for black women and lesbians in birth and wellness spaces.\u00a0Devotion to Self offers services that empower women, create space for their full Self, and provide education resources about pregnancy, childbirth, and shadow work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChildbirth doula services are low-cost and holistically focused, offering compassionate support for black women during this maternal health crisis in the black community.\u00a0There are many injustices in this world, so much trauma enacted upon our mind and bodies, and this all begins from birth. As black women our experiences in healthcare and childbirth are uniquely traumatic, navigating childbirth is when we are in need of even more support. This support should be compassionate, acknowledging trauma and fear, creating a birth experience that honors your needs, values, beliefs, desires, and past traumatic experiences. Black mothers and their children die at much higher rates than their counterparts and this is a crisis that needs to be addressed and the solutions are DOULAS. You can contribute to the solution of the infant and maternal mortality rate by supporting Devotion to Self, a business devoted to the care of communities most in need in birth spaces. Devotion to Self offers low-cost childbirth doula services to lesbians and black women in the Ann Arbor \u0026amp; Detroit area. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with in-person doula services, Devotion to Self offers tarot readings and guidance. Tarot is a form of divination used to connect to the intuitive Inner Self. I\u0027ve studied tarot as a youth and began to offer services to others at 21. The tarot is a way to heal and communicate with the subconscious self that uses beautiful imagery and collective archetypal energy. I am also a writer working on self-publishing a fiction, biomythography, and affirmation series. I post most of my writing on my blog and am working on a few art series as well. I am working on a education series that will be a podcast or youtube channel. It will offer videos about pregnancy, birth, spirituality, and wellness. Topics could range from water birth, crystal healing, essential oils, visualization and so much more! I am a creative expanding and exploring ways that creativity heals the soul and the collective. Supporting Devotion to Self means supporting a black lesbian artist, healer, and creative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to create a website to offer my services and share my affirmations, educational series, newsletter, and resources. Currently patron support would go to funding the creation of my website ($196). This business is one of passion and service, it is run by one woman and is slowly blooming. This business is devoted to compassionate care, self-love, and self-exploration. Once I have the cost of the website patreonage would go to my survival, as this business is run full-time without any supplemental income (currently $400/month for living expenses) from there doula supplies. I am hoping to share and support the collective and be supported in return. I am always hoping to expand the ways I facilitate healing. Please check out the gifts \u0026amp; rewards for Patronage and consider sponsoring a business devoted to healing birth \u0026amp; reawakening self-compassion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSupport this transition, see the whole process, and heal the world with Devotion to Self!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a blessing to serve and be seen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLaNichol"
