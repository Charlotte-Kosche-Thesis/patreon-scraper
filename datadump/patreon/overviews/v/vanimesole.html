My name is Amador Molina aka Vanime Sole. I\u0027m 26, I have 3 kiddos, and I\u0027ve been customizing Vans with anime related designs full time since 2012. I use Copic marker as my medium, which is what makes my work so unique compared to other designers. The designs are water resistant due to being coated with a beeswax, and completely crack proof due to Copic not being a form of paint. I started chasing art as a career 2 weeks after my older brother passed away. He believed in a career I could have that I just couldn\u0027t see at the time. I proudly carry that weight of being successful in his name. It\u0027s not a matter of if, but when I\u0027ll reach my goal. This line of work is so much more than just money. It\u0027s about giving back, helping others, and proving a point anything can be made into a career. I\u0027m currently working my way back towards Twitch, due to a recent move to take care of my father who is sick. My internet connection for streaming is not strong enough. All in due time I\u0027ll be back on Twitch, for now I still have my eyes set on greater purpose than just myself. Above is a pair I created for a great friend of mine Dillon Price aka FaZe Attach.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eTHE PURPOSE OF PATREON\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSo... for those of you wondering what this Patreon is for its actually extremely simple. I want to do giveaways for people who truly believe in the reasoning for why I chase art as a career. I want a sense of family, not customers. A group that doesn\u0027t hold me high, but sees me as a equal. Once my first goal of 10 patrons is achieved the giveaways will launch. Every month those who pledge at any reward will have a chance to win a custom pair of Vans designed with a anime/cartoon related theme. All of you as a community help design through social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, etc. Shoe style will be picked by me to fit the winning theme best and shoe size will be men\u0027s 13 for the most canvas space to maximize details.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only will this Patreon be used for giveaways, but its main focus will be used to raise money for Save the Children through Tiltify. Special events will be announced along with info on how to participate in a greater good other than ourselves. Being a young father I know what its like to struggle. These kids can\u0027t control the life they\u0027ve been dealt. If my work can help in anyway, its worth investing time into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time spent reading this through, Below I will provide a few examples of my work along with a link to more pairs I\u0027ve created.
