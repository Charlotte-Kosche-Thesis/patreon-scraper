    "summary": "Hello! I am the Violin Monster. I play the violin. I am a monster. I\u0027m a 496 year old werewolf, (oh my, how the years are creeping up on me!) and I\u0027ve been a full-time artist and street performer since 2011. I feel guilty about parts of my past, when I wasn\u0027t able to control my savage nature, but I\u0027ve found that playing my violin soothes me and quells my Hunger. Most of the year I live in my beloved hometown, Ann Arbor, Michigan. I migrate South in the winter for warmer climes so I can continue performing on the street, usually having strange adventures along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy brain is a chaotic place where wisps of brilliant ideas dwell, and I want to bring them to life. I\u0027m excited to see how interacting with fans can drive my art, and I will direct my focus on the projects that patrons want to see the most.\u00a0The possibilities are endless, but here are some of my dreams that you could help turn into reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Music Stuff\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethis includes releasing an album of my favorite songs, making videos, livestream practice sessions, learning requested songs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Writing Stuff\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ethis includes more and better social media posts, reflections on my first five years as a street performer (perhaps compiled into a book at some point?), personalized postcards, more conversations, more questions answered about my troubling werewolf past\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Comics Stuff\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ethis includes creating a violin monster comics series that will explore my unique experience as a (almost) five hundred year old werewolf who is trying to atone for past sins by playing violin on the street, it will have scenes from my present life in the places i travel to and the people i meet, it will also have flashback sequences as i attempt to process and heal from traumatic events of past centuries\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Travel Stuff\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ethis includes a larger travel budget so i can (hopefully!) come to your town (yes \u003cstrong\u003eyour\u003c/strong\u003e town!) and play a street show, video equipment so i can better capture and share my journey, finding a way to live broadcast my street shows\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. ???\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ethis includes ideas suggested by patrons and fans, projects born out of a moment of sudden inspiration,\u00a0things borrowed from twisted dreams and alternate dimensions"
