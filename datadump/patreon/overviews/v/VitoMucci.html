    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBlessings and welcome!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n Thank you for being here! I am inspired to offer a more expansive set of consciousness training, and Patreon is the exact place I\u0027ve been waiting for. Until now, you have seen myself and my mate Claudia on facebook, YouTube (DivineUnionTV), Pinterest, twitter, and Instagram. Much of the content that I have had to \"de-prioritize\" over time now can come back to the surface on this medium, specifically \"Daily Manifestational Menus,\" \"Question Sessions,\" and \"Group Energy Clearings.\" Of course, these will be focused on expanding consciousness, processing emotion, and forming healthy internal and external relationships so that the whole of society can evolve into a more heart centered collective.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a shaman and psychological theorist, living with bipolar disorder, social anxiety and PTSD. I have found over time that recognizing and processing emotion is the most important skill that no one is taught, and I have dedicated my life to bringing it into the mainstream. I have written two books, both self-published, based on theories I have been developing and tracking for years about the nature of consciousness and the raw truths about relationships (Both available on Amazon ... Coffee for Consciousness 101: The Application of Perspective to Reality and Party of 2: Path to Union). Most importantly, I am stepfather to two amazing boys, who belong to the love of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was raised as a shaman by a generation of my family that included a Licensed Therapist and Professor of Psychology (Mother), a Logician/Statistician (Father), Medical Doctor/Naturopath/Homeopath (Uncle), and a Channel/Medium (Aunt). Apprenticing in each area of study was my life\u0027s focus (along with the everyday American lifestyle for kids of the 80s). I suffered from traumatic fear and anxiety in my youth multiple times as my cherished older brother dealt with health issues. That would pave the way for the development of my PTSD. As my abilities, knowledge, and consciousness grew, so did my inability to handle everyday life, and with that came multiple addictions and emotional instability. I was diagnosed bipolar at 26, and spent 3 more years in suicidal seclusion before finally being diagnosed with PTSD. The treatments, along with the development of my theoretic focus on processing emotion, helped me pull out of addiction and depression, as well as giving me the tools I needed to be able to function as a bipolar with anxiety and PTSD.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe tools I have discovered could only have been discovered by the truly lost ... but they can be used by anyone. Self-trust, Observation Consciousness, Conscious Validation, Focused Rehabilitation, Heart Centered Awareness/Intuition, Perspective Shifting, and the 5 Step Method of Processing Emotion is what I am here to share.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be going about sharing these tools in a multitude of ways, as everyone needs a different level of involvement to make their connections to these ideas as they present within the self. Besides the expressive and group focused items I mentioned above, I will also be doing limited one on one engagements as well. My goal for each of you who decide to walk through this door with me, is that you expand, learn, and incorporate these ideas to such an extent that I am no longer needed.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for seeing me ... thank you for honoring yourself ... thank you for being here. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
