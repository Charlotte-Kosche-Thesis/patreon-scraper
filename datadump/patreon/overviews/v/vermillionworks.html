He returns months later to Christine\u0027s house...very much changed. Now a horrifying creature of the night, Daniel\u0027s true personality is fading away, leaving only his unquenchable desire for blood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Horror of the Vampire\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVampires have always been one of my favorite mythological creatures of the night, though I have always been a bit more fascinated with what makes them disturbing rather than the \"sexy immortality\" aspects of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine the psychological horror of having someone you love die and come back as a shadow of their former self; a lifeless \u003cem\u003ething\u003c/em\u003e with a rotting soul. These sort of vampires stories seem to be becoming rather scarce in recent years, and I personally find them more interesting than any misunderstood vampire romance that plays it safe, or even a \"vampire hordes have taken over the Earth\" tale where it\u0027s all about survival.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I want to bring some horror back into the vampire genre with Daniel. Oh, there is romance and drama as well, but it is first and foremost a horror story. I even tried to give the whole thing an \"old horror film\" vibe with the grayscale coloring and early setting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Lowdown\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDaniel is free to read on it\u0027s main website and this Patreon won\u0027t change that, you can simply get new pages faster and other goodies no one else gets to see by becoming a patron. Sometimes, I will aim to get my patrons an extra page, or even a page ahead of everyone else. You can also just get a good feeling of helping a girl survive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s also make it more awesome and say you would be supporting more creepy vampire stories. =)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile Daniel is pretty long, it does have an end in sight, but it has a while yet before it gets there. Once it does though, and especially if Patreon is helping me, I will jump right into the next free comic with bonuses for all you lovely patrons! This story is my current baby and by donating you\u0027d be helping see it through to the end and would make me feel confident about going forward on future projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the record: I\u0027m currently working without a buffer - meaning pages are posted here as they\u0027re completed. While I consider myself generally reliable on\n getting pages out, sometimes \u003cem\u003elife will happen\u003c/em\u003e, especially since \u003cem\u003eI suffer from very serious arm strain in BOTH arms \u003c/em\u003ecaused by too much drawing and computer use. So just giving you \nguys a heads up that this is a \"making pages one day at a time\" project. I do aim to please, so even if I miss a week, I\u0027ll still try my best to get you guys some extras to look at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOUR DONATIONS DO!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSupport from Patrons will go to site hosting, living expenses, upgrading my art programs \u0026amp; equipment, getting ads for the comic out more, possibly printing the comic and so on. Most of all it will assure that Daniel keeps going until it\u0027s completion and I can kind of survive while I\u0027m at it. =P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY CURRENT GOALS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nProbably the two biggest goals I\u0027d like to achieve are to attempt to at least make a lean living off of my comics as it\u0027s just what I\u0027d love to do (or at least feel compensated for the work), and, if possible, save up to finally print Daniel so you can read this creepy little story of mine in book form as well, with low lighting around you...during a thunderstorm.\u003cbr\u003e"
