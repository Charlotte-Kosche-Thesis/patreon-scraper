    "summary": "Hello the World!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Name is, as you of course know, Rana Roy Choudhury. I am primarily a writer, its what I love doing. To be honest I think the reason books in general are to be revered to a certain extent is because, it literally creates a movie inside of your head. The beautiful place that you call your mind. Yes many great works of fiction have been adapted into the big and even the small screen. And indeed they have been and will continue to be a source of inspiration to many including myself. However, what we all see in movies and televised series is the imagination and depiction of someone else, yes very good ones, but someone else\u0027s nonetheless. Reading a book, no matter of what category will feed your imagination to create the things you read about, such a beautiful thing words are, that no matter the language, your mind will grow if you read. It is in my opinion the single greatest salvation of humanity, seconded only by the discovery of fire. But that\u0027s enough of me rambling, essentially I have a passion for writing, and epic fantasy is something I covet. Very much. I have been inspired for a long time by the likes of Tolkien, C.S Lewis, Robert Jordan, the more main stream J.K Rowling and of course the most recent G.R.R Martin. The list is literally endless, from the immortal Tolkien to the recently astronomical Rick Riordan. Nonetheless, I have started working on my own little piece of fantasy fiction, I am hoping to make it into a trilogy (I know, cliched right?), the first book is called Age of Immortals: Doomed Ascension. It deals with the fictional world of Paralox, it is of course filled with weird and wonderful races, the usual goings ons etc etc. What it completely entails? well you will have to read and find out I\u0027m afraid. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDISCLAIMER AND WARNING: Firstly the disclaimer; all characters and plot points are in no way related to person or persons known or unknown. It belongs solely to me and any resemblance that it may or may not have to anything that you have come across in the past is purely co-incidental and there will be certain elements that are similar to most fantasy works. Because similarities can be found between any two works of fantasy at any time.\u003cbr\u003eNow the warning; the reason that my works is classified as adult is not because it is in any way pornographic. Yes it will have certain adult themes and some strong adult language and certain points. Reader discretion is always advised.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat set aside, I welcome any and all of who wants to read my works and enjoy them and even provide me with helpful criticism and pointers. Any support that you give in any form is welcome and thanked for. Thank you for living through that atrociously long ramble and on to the wonderful world of fiction!"
