    "summary": "Before I say anything else, I want to thank you. \u00a0Yes, YOU! \u00a0For taking some of your precious time to learn a bit about me and what I do (and dream of doing). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t figured it out already, I\u0027m Vera. \u00a0I\u0027m an opera singer, makeup artist, and private music teacher that\u0027s passionate about sharing my music and experiences in each of these mediums. \u00a0On the music front, my YouTube channel is my way of reaching out into the vast unknown and trying to connect with folks that might not get to hear or talk to an opera singer in person. \u00a0As a musician I\u0027m keenly aware that my craft\u0027s audience is shrinking. \u00a0Opera and operatic voices are no longer part of mainstream entertainment, and with drastic cuts to music programs everywhere, so many folks never even get introduced to this incredible art form. \u00a0I want to change that...and I\u0027m asking you to help me. \u00a0More on that in a bit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I said previously, I also work as a makeup artist, and absolutely love teaching people how to make themselves feel good. \u00a0I know what you\u0027re saying in your head right now. \u00a0You\u0027re thinking that there are already BAJILLIONS of beauty gurus out there doing exactly what I just described...and you\u0027d be right. \u00a0I\u0027m not claiming to reinvent the wheel here, but as someone who does not fit the typical \"beautiful\" mold, I want to spread the body positive love as far and wide as possible! \u00a0I also want to help shift the beauty community away from filtered, facetuned, photoshopped pictures that simply aren\u0027t realistic examples of what makeup can do. \u00a0This is important for ALL of us, but even more so for young, impressionable minds. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why am I here? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am lucky enough to scrape together a living mostly within the aforementioned avenues. \u00a0But when I say scrape...I mean it... \u00a0I want nothing more than to have the time and equipment necessary to reach people on a new level. \u00a0My goal is to make more recordings that help bridge the gap between contemporary music and opera, and to help shift the massively unattainable standards of beauty while teaching useable skills and having fun! But I can\u0027t do either of those things alone. \u00a0This is the very beginning of the journey and I so hope you\u0027ll join me. \u00a0Any donations will be used to bring you bigger and better content that just might inspire the next wave of music lovers. \u00a0Are you in?"
