We strive to do our best to make you feel like you\u0027re one of the crew week in and week out. We cover every thing from video games, comics, movies, and tech. We may get off topic from time to time but its all apart of the fun. The VGB has been all over covering just about all the major events in the geek world. From E3 to speaking \u00a0at San Diego Comic Con, we\u0027ve been able to bring you the latest info on what you\u0027re into. We\u0027ve also had the great pleasure of interviewing some of the mover and shakers in the geek industry like \u00a0Michael Rooker, Katrina Law, Freddie Wong, Ashly and Anthony Burch from Hey Ash Whattcha Playin? and we don\u0027t plan on stopping there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re always striving to make this show bigger and better. The problem we run into is that as the show keeps growing, so have the expenses. Aaron, Cory, and David all juggle full time jobs, families, and together have shouldered the total cost of the show. The idea of the Patreon is to help the show to be better than it was yesterday, and to give back to the ones that help us out in the process. There is no way we could do the show without the fans, and hopefully with your help we can continue to entertain and grow for a a very long time. From the bottom of every Videogame BANG! member thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"

While we are in a good place with the studio functionally, we are still needing odds and ends. Currently 3 out of the 4 hosts and guests have to sit in flimsy dining room chairs borrowed from Cory\u0027s Mom\u0027s House.
