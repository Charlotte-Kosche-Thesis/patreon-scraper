    "summary": "We believe that when great minds work together, \u003cstrong\u003ewe can forge the\nfuture. \u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are an electronic music duo, and we want to\nforge the future of music. We want it to be a future in which music\nperformances are engaging and authentic expressions of emotion\u2014not just DJs\npressing play on stage. We\u2019ve been working on this mission for a while now, and\nit\u2019s led us to create technology that enables us to create music like no one\nhas ever done before. The core of the technology is a pair of gloves that allows\nus to control music in thin air with motions and gestures. With this tech,\nwe\u2019re able to literally shape sound\u2014molding and sculpting it as we please.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019re using these gloves to craft a distinctive musical\nstyle, and to put on live performances that have never been seen in EDM. Our\nfans are able to engage with our music on an entirely new level, being able to\nboth see and hear the music created in front of their eyes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho Are We?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re a team that started out as just college\nroommates. We were two engineering students that connected over a shared\npassion for both music and technology. Being bright-eyed students, we had the\naudacity to believe that we could make a musical instrument that was more\nexpressive, more intuitive, and more powerful than anything else that was\nalready out there. We imagined an instrument that would allow us to shape sound\nas if it were an object held between our hands. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe found out quickly that creating\nrevolutionary technology is not easy\u2014our first prototype was held together by\nhot-glue and sounded like a dying mosquito, but at least it was a start. Over\nthe next few semesters, we built many new prototypes, researching and experimenting\nwith all types of technologies, from movie motion-capture suits to medical tracking\ndevices. Two years later, by the time we were graduating, we found that we had\nactually created something pretty cool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter leaving college, we went our separate\nways, and went to work in the \u201creal world\u201d. This project was almost lost to the\nchurn of everyday life, but we found that what we created kept calling to us.\nOur story and our instrument had begun inspiring others about the what the\nfuture of music could be, and that was when we knew we couldn\u2019t let go of the\nidea.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSix months ago we quit our jobs and went all\nin. It was a big risk that we took. We didn\u0027t know if we would succeed or fail,\nbut we believed in the vision of the future that we had imagined. We were\nwilling to take the gamble because we felt that the music we wanted to create\nwas important, and that it was important for us to share it with the world\u2014with\nyou.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere are we going?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince committing to this project, we\u0027ve been\nworking out of our apartment in Las Vegas, doing everything ourselves. Ray\u0027s in\none corner soldering circuits and sewing the gloves together while Mike mans\nthe computer and programs software to make everything work. We write all the\nmusic together, and we\u2019ve spent hours refining our distinctive sound. We\u0027ve\nhaven\u2019t been afraid to roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty because we\nknow that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary to bring you the electronic music you deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u0027s been a whirlwind of a journey jumping headfirst\ninto the music business, trying to learn how to gain fans and get our music\nheard. We want to thank you for being here. This is the start. This is the\nmoment in time in which we are getting off the ground\u2014and you\u0027re a part of this\nnow because you recognize that this is going to be something huge one day. We\nhope you\u2019ll be a part of shaping the future of music, not just for us, but for\neveryone who wants to see something new in EDM.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is the record label of the future\u2014where\nthere is no label. Patreon allows us to get financial backing directly from our\nfans, cutting out the middle man and allowing us to have complete creative\ncontrol of our music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy signing up to back us, you\u2019re pledging to\nsupport us with a monthly donation. Your support is a statement that you\nbelieve in our vision for the future. To show our appreciation, we\u2019ll be giving\nour supporters access to special perks, like exclusive behind-the-scene videos,\naccess to improvised performances that will never be heard elsewhere, and the\nability to participate in weekly livestreams where you can talk with us\ndirectly. You can think of it like subscribing to our fan club of future\nforgers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do We Need Your Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaking music is expensive. Making music\ntechnology is even more expensive. We are essentially running an advanced\nresearch and development music lab out of our apartment. We\u0027ve needed to\npurchase sensors, LEDs, and conductive fabrics to make the gloves, and as we\ncontinue to refine our instrument, we\u2019ll have more expenses. We\u0027ve also got a\nlot of other ideas we want to implement\u2014an LED light suit that\u0027s synchronized\nto our motions and music, better lighting effects, and projection-mapped visuals.\nIt\u0027s all in the works. We want to be able to take our music and our performances\nto the next level, and demonstrate to the world what the future of music looks\nlike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOf course, food and water for staying alive is\nalso important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u0027ve been lucky enough to have some savings to\nlive off of, but those savings are diminishing every day, and even though we\u0027re\ngetting a lot of attention, we\u0027re not at a point yet where we\u0027re making a lot\nof money (or much at all) for what we do. That\u2019s why we need your help. Even\n$2 a month goes a long way towards keeping this project going. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want you to know that even if you can\u0027t\nsupport us financially, your enthusiasm for building the future of music with\nus is what keeps us going every day. Supporting us by sharing our content,\ntelling your friends about us, and listening to our music means just as much to\nus as a financial contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for being here. This\nis the future.\u003cbr\u003e"
