    "summary": "We strive to create quality content that is both informative and interesting. Our goal out of the gate is to provide a thorough resource for Imperial Assault players, which we think we\u0027ve accomplished quite well so far. We\u0027ve covered a lot of ground, but we have a lot of projects in the works that are only possible with your support. We both have full-time jobs and families, but Patreon support will help us devote even more time than we already do to producing this content at the only level we deem acceptable: the highest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will never be any cost required to enjoy the podcast, but your support will help us devote more time to Vader\u0027s Finest, soften the blow of hosting and website fees, improve our audio hardware and software, and will even keep the Cantina Corner rotation robust.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve received a lot of support already, which has allowed us to bring our loyal fans exclusive content: \"Hilarious\" outtakes, patron meet-ups at gaming events, and extensive personal help keeping their competitive edge. Continued and greater support will allow us to add even more benefits to our Patreon contributors: unofficial alternate art promos, special access on our website and forum, and free or deferred cost access to our Vader\u0027s Finest shirts and accessories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur end goal is to earn enough support to make a living producing this content. That\u0027s still a long way away, but with the support we\u0027ve been shown already, we\u0027re confident it\u0027s a reachable goal. We\u0027ll always be your number one source for competitive-minded Imperial Assault discussion, but these contributions are an investment in more than just the current Vader\u0027s Finest. We want to provide multiple episodes weekly so we can be that same resource for a variety of games, even moreso than we are already. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVader\u0027s Finest has produced episodes for a variety of competitive tabletop games and more casual board games, like Star Wars X-Wing, Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn, Star Wars Rebellion, and others! But that\u0027s just a drop in the bucket. We\u0027re excited to support and cover every competitive and expandable game produced by Fantasy Flight Games, including Star Wars Destiny, and many other games from other publishers, too!\u00a0We also want to become more involved with our listeners, and will happily play and talk about any game our patrons decide we should.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly through your support is this dream achievable. May the force be with you!\u003cbr\u003e"
