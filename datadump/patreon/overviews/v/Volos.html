    "summary": "I\u0026#8217;m a devoted husband, father, and full time clinical researcher. I realized that I needed a chance to do something more artistic than decades of nonfiction science work.  In the past I\u0026#8217;ve dabbled in sculpture, photography, and even fine jewelry making.  I enjoyed all those pursuits, but none have opened up my imaginative energies like writing fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI come from a more diverse background than most. That pairs well with my long and varied cosmopolitan life to this point.  I hope to capture a more complete and varied world view within a fantastical fiction setting.  To that end, I have two works posted on Royal Road Legends:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://royalroadl.com/fiction/5803\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMonition of Magic\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://royalroadl.com/fiction/7895\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHandyman\u003c/a\u003e.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0026#8217;m in the process of very slowly rewriting Monition of Magic, because I want it to be an epic poem, not prose.  I also want it to be readable to the modern sensibility.  There are currently no scheduled updates, but I will allow my Patrons to view drafts of the work as requested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHandyman was born from an attempt to work out some writer\u0026#8217;s block in the story of Monition of Magic.  I had the first few chapters and a substantial portion of the middle completed for Monition, but was struggling with the best way to connect the fragments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHandyman is written in prose, which I find to be far easier than poetry.  The plot follows a scientist, Talo, who was thrust into a world where magic exists.  It will deal with ideas of culture, assimilation, religion, ethics, and love.  All wrapped in an epic narrative with both science and magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you all for even taking the time to read this, and even more for considering being a patron.  I commit that I will spend 100% of the gained funds on gifts for my wife, because I\u0026#8217;m quite certain that will lead to her being happier with me spending time writing."
