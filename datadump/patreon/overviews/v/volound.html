    "summary": "For 20 of my 25 years,\nI\u0027ve been a hardcore PC gamer. I uploaded my first video to youtube over 8 years ago and ever since I\u0027ve been putting whatever I can spare towards this,\nwithout expecting or asking for anything in return. It\u0027s been a lot of fun and\nhopefully I can keep doing this for a long time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0My online activities are something I will always want to be doing, and will always be doing for free. Patreon means you all can help me do it better. Being able to volunteer to support me in this, either to spur improvement or simply to show appreciation, is a great thing, I think. Feel free to pledge as little or as much as you want, whatever you think is fair is fine. I\u0027d like Patreon to be the centre of my social media activity and I\u0027ll be checking in as often as I can. See you in the feed or through PM :)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0My focus is always on competency and skill - that won\u0027t ever change. Right now, I\u0027m most passionate about short (5-10 minute) and flashy skill sequences. I sometimes make speedruns of classic RTSs from my childhood. I also occasionally do streams.\u003cbr\u003e"
