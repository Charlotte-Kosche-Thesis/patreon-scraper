We\u2019re fighting back with a spry, independent news operation fit for the 21st century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSacramento media is in trouble. We\u2019ve seen it in massive layoffs, reduced local coverage and the bizarre move to clickbait by formerly reputable media companies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to fight back, and we believe we know how: with hyperlocal, agile, web-based news that puts more focus on the \u003cstrong\u003ecommunity voice\u003c/strong\u003e than anyone\u2019s done before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u2019re VOICES: River City.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019ve missed out on our first year of existence, we won\u2019t hold it against you. But here\u2019s what we\u2019ve pulled off in just 365 days:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Played home to essays and commentary by Sacramento scientists, historians, sex educators, youth advocates, homelessness experts and comedians.\u003cbr\u003e- Provided breaking news on important regional issues such as Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones\u0027s uncouth letter to the leader of Black Lives Matter Sacramento.\u003cbr\u003e- Created a publicly available database of campaign donations to the District Attorney and Sheriff\u0027s elections.\u003cbr\u003e- Interviewed Smash Mouth. (It was weird for us, too.)\u003cbr\u003e- Expanded our live theatre coverage after other outlets cut their arts writing staffs.\u003cbr\u003e- Learned that people actually care about what we\u2019re trying to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s been an amazing ride. We\u2019ve gotten loads of traffic, feedback and angry/funny/weird comments from the community. Most important\u2014we\u2019ve started some impactful conversations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVOICES: River City is ready to take it to the next level. And while we pursue funding in earnest (through grants, events, some hyperlocal advertising, etc.), we\u2019re asking for help from you to keep us afloat in the meantime to pay our writers and reporters what they deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s what VOICES: River City wants to do next:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Expand news coverage so we can more effectively comfort the afflicted and speak truth to power through research-based depth reporting.\u003cbr\u003e- Expand arts coverage so we can fill the void left by Sacramento media\u2019s major losses in music, theater, art, food and drink reporting.\u003cbr\u003e- Support community voices as they use our platform to take a stand and speak out against injustice.\u003cbr\u003e- Create a base for our founder as he edits, writes, pursues seed funding and goes into communities that have had little to no voice in traditional Sacramento media, and helps provide them a platform to make a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u2019re on a good path so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFolks are paying attention. They\u2019re learning that we\u2019re not some old-school, ivory-tower news organization. We\u2019re offering our site as a platform to speak out and change the narrative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we need your help to take it to the next step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you care about an independent media that maintains an adversarial dynamic with the powerful, and gives voice to the most vulnerable among us\u2014consider donating to VOICES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you understand that we\u2014all of us\u2014are today the media, and you want to see more citizen voices (and not just those with money) in the news you read\u2014consider donating to VOICES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you want to keep the conversation going in this town with someone independent, weird and unflinching\u2014please donate to VOICES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.
