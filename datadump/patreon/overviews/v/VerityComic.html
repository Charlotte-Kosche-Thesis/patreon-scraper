The actual work portion of my job was maybe an hour a day, and the rest of the time I was writing stories, working on my Heroes Unlimited campaigns, or programming games. I ran a Necromunda campaign with its own newspaper. I took on my brother in small-scale robot wars challenges using Lego. I wrote 50,000 words during the month of November, 2009. I drew a webcomic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5 years ago, I quit that day job and became self-employed, hoping to turn my skills into a fortune. It hasn\u0027t happened yet, and money is super-tight, so I\u0027m turning to Patreon to help make my dreams come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, my goal is this: I want to tell stories, be they in the form of comics, written work, or games. I\u0027ll engage you guys in all progress, methods and observations, incorporating your ideas and suggestions along the way. That way we\u0027ll end up with something we can all be proud of.\u003cbr\u003e"
