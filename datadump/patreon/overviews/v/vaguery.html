    "summary": "I\u0027ve worked as an engineering consultant for more than 25 years, helping software engineers and scientific teams in industry and academia plan and release adaptive systems. For a decade before that, I worked in the academic world, right at the interdisciplinary bridge between Systems Biology, Complexity Theory, and Artificial Intelligence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, I\u2019ve watched countless teams of enthusiastic beginners and thoughtful professionals propose, plan and launch great projects... only to\u00a0freak out when things start\u00a0to \u201cgo emergent\u201d. No matter how smart you are, traditional project management and technical skills don\u0027t always prepare you for building systems that are \u003cem\u003eintentionally surprising\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in the most exciting and fruitful projects, \u003cem\u003ebeing surprised\u003c/em\u003e should actually be your goal. Whether you\u0027re hoping to apply genetic programming to inspire human inventors, or just want to \u003cem\u003ethink reasonably\u003c/em\u003e about self-organizing social systems\u2014and whether you know it or not\u2014when you undertake these projects, you\u0027re establishing a novel, active relationship between yourself and \u003cem\u003ethe thing you\u2019ve made.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Not only can this be technically challenging, but it can feel like an affront to a lot of folks\u2019 habits and expectations. What does it mean to \u201cplan\u201d a project that\u0027s exploratory? How can you develop automated tests, when the thing you\u0027re testing is supposed to \u003cem\u003eself-assemble?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve learned a lot in my professional career. Now that most of the NDAs I (foolishly) signed as a kid are elapsed, I want to share what I know more widely.
