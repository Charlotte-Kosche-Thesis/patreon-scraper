Listening to our podcast you will find we are about more than just the movie itself. We try to talk about it in a way that expands our knowledge and enjoyment beyond the time it takes to watch the film. In that way, I think we offer something unique in the horror podcasting arena. We may not have a huge following, but we hold dear each and every person who takes the time to listen to us (more than once). \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We started our Patreon page not get some easy cash for ourselves, but to help some of the expenses that are incurred by doing the show. Indeed, just this last year our patrons\u0027 support was enough to cover our podcasting fees for the next year. We are grateful! Still, we would love to have more patrons! On the right you can see the levels of support. Even support of $1 a month helps; especially on those days when we start to question ourselves. It happens to everyone... the darkness comes and we question if what we do matters or makes a difference. Sometimes the smallest thing can trigger it. The thing is we know it matters. People touch each others lives everyday, and I am sure we can all think of people that have influenced us even if we only met them once. That being said, YOUR patronage helps keep that darkness at bay and reminds us that we have touched others in a way that means something...for better or worse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway... thanks for reading all this and thanks for your consideration!"
