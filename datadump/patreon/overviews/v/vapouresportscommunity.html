We have a team of dedicated volunteers who provides support in coordinating and hosting regular community events for games including Rocket League, Minecraft, and racing games such as WRC7.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service where you can pledge to send a regular payment to creators, so they can support themselves and keep making new stuff. Patreon is better for creators than advertising or sponsorship. \u003cbr\u003eThe content is 100% uncompromised, payment is more predictable, and creators don\u0027t need to stoop to clickbait content or other shady practices. Patreon means that creators serve their viewers, not advertisers and where the viewers and players can have a say in the creative content that is produced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I end up paying?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou pay once per month. This will help us host events every week for Rocket League\u00a0for the best players to show their skill and a chance at winning a lucrative prize pool and help us maintain our game servers. In the very unlikely circumstance that we don\u0027t host a single event for the month, we will not charge anyone for that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we need the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2017, we created Vapour eSports to grow a community in the Oceanic region a community that can come together and rival the best in the world, a community built on strong ties, great games and generous prize pools and fun giveaways. Running Vapour eSports is a full time job. A job as of now that goes unpaid except for the lovely donations of our supporters which is funneled right back into the community. \u003cbr\u003eTherefore we need the money for prize pools,\u00a0casters, giveaways, designers and you know, eat and stuff. All while together spending upwards of 100\u2019s of hours per week content creating, organizing events, researching, moderating, and growing our humble community molding it to take on the world scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledge $1\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0thank you for supporting our events and community\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will receive a special \u003cstrong\u003e\u2018Patreon \u003cstrong\u003eBronze\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u2019 role in Discord\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to the Patrons text and voice channel where you can hang out with the mods and admins and join us once a month for discussions and feedback about Vapour eSports\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledge $5\u003c/strong\u003e thank you your kind contribution events and community\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will receive the rare \u003cstrong\u003e\u2018\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eSilver\u2019\u003c/strong\u003e role in Discord\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAutomatic entry for all giveaways\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlus all previous rewards\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledge $10\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0that means so much to us, thank you for your support\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will receive a\u00a0custom supporters banner\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will receive the limited\u003cstrong\u003e \u2018Patreon \u003cstrong\u003eGold\u003c/strong\u003e\u2019 \u003c/strong\u003erole in Discord\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlus all previous rewards\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledge $20\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0wow thank you so much you are an absolute champion, the community will benefit greatly from your contribution\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will have the privilege of having your name displayed at the end of our new videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will receive the exclusive \u003cstrong\u003e\u2018Platinum Patreon\u2019\u003c/strong\u003e role in Discord\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlus all previous rewards\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
