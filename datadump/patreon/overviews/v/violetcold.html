     "about": "\u201cViolet Cold\u201d is an experimental music project formed in the beginning of 2013 by Emin Guliyev in Baku, Azerbaijan. What makes \"Violet Cold\" unique is the fact that every piece of the puzzle is totally \u201cDIY,\u201d from artwork, instruments, lyrics, and vocals to recording, mixing and mastering. This is all done by Emin Guliyev, who doesn\u0027t have any formal musical training. The result is a disregard for the rules and a totally fresh sound. Addicted to freedom and inspired by space and nature, Violet Cold released one of the most interesting metalgaze albums of 2015, called \"Desperate Dreams.\" It\u0027s a unique blend of black metal, shoegaze and 80\u0027s style electro-pop - creating an album which is raw and intense yet, at the same time, beautiful and uplifting. Violet Cold doesn\u2019t adhere to a particular genre, and tries to convey many feelings in many different ways. You can find a huge variety of genres in Violet Cold\u0027s discography: from post-rock to black metal, from ambient to sludge, from witch-house to neo-classical, from electronic to jazzcore.\u003cbr\u003e2016 saw Violet Cold continue to expand its sound with the release of the instrumental Magic Night, incorporating stunning piano movements and ambient passages, adding more elements to the ethereal sound established in Desperate Dreams.\u003cbr\u003e2017 saw the vocals return to Violet Cold\u0027s sound, somewhat blending his previous 2 releases into yet another beautiful album titled Anomie which received widespread acclaim among listeners of all kinds.\u003cbr\u003e(\u003ca href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Violet+Cold/+wiki\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elast.fm\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e",
