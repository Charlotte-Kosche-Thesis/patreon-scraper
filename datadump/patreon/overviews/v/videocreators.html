    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Patreon and why do you use it?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/what-why.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m so excited to use this platform to connect with you on a deeper level! This place is\u00a0for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to support what you\u2019re doing: growing your YouTube channel so you can further spread a message that changes people\u0027s lives!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s videos and podcasts on how to grow your YouTube channel.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping creators (like you and me both!) bring more value to the world by making it financially sustainable long-term. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like) per YouTube training that I create.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gears.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery month I tend to publish about 4 YouTube training videos to the Video Creators channel, as well as a few podcast episodes to iTunes and Soundcloud. Each time I do so, I share that YouTube training here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of YouTube trainings I publish that month determines how much you contribute.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example, \u003cstrong\u003eif you pledge $1 per YouTube training and that month I publish 4 videos and 2 podcast episodes, you\u0027ll contribute $6 for that month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you can pledge $10 per YouTube training, get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $10, thus supporting 1 YouTube training that month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either. You will still continue to get my YouTube trainings even if I publish additional YouTube trainings that go beyond your maximum contribution limit for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/give-money.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support enables me to invest into producing free YouTube training videos and podcast episodes for the YouTube community of creators who have a big mission behind their work online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlus, whether it\u0027s the stay-at-home mother whose video on how to help a newborn baby sleep through the night brings peace to countless other homes, or it\u0027s the high school video gamer who talks about being bullied at school and gives hope to other teenagers, I want to support those messages and the creators behind them. I know you do, too!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt also helps me replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do more important things, like investing time into my wife and kids!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eShoot, I don\u0027t have money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/no-money1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo problem at all! Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money or are struggling financially. I know what that feels like and want you to take care of more important priorities first. I will continue to make videos and podcast episodes that I hope will help you not only change lives, but even earn a bit of extra revenue from YouTube to alleviate some of your financial pressure.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/patreon_fam.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Tim Schmoyer and I\u0027ve been active in developing audiences online since 2005. For a few years prior to YouTube I lived full-time off my blog.\u00a0During that time I used YouTube to publish videos with the girl who I would later marry. At the time we were just having a good time. Now those videos are known as \"vlogs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2952738?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/youtube-certified-dark.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 25px 15px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eToday we have created and published over 3,000 YouTube videos, amassed millions of views, and won several YouTube video contests. I\u0027ve worked with some of the country\u0027s top brands on YouTube and, in 2013, YouTube themselves invited me to become\u00a0officially certified in \"Audience Growth.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSeeing the unmatched potential of video to reach and influence people, I decided to move away from my blog and focus on helping YouTube creators effectively spread their message to reach people online. In 2013 I launched the YouTube channel, \nVideo Creators, to do just that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your support! It really does mean a lot to me. My family and I really appreciate it!"
