We review new episodes as they\u0027re airing, and when they\u0027re not, we talk about all manner of fun (and sometimes important) \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e-related topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do we release the podcast?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe release content every week on Wednesday! (Wednesday not guaranteed if you live \"in the FUTURE\" -- Hello Australia!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe release\u00a0regular episodes biweekly, and those have a theme for each year. In 2013 year we counted down through the Doctors and talked about representative episodes from each one. It was all about \u00a0\u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0villains in 2014 and this year we\u0027re turning our eye toward the Companions. But not in a way you might think!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor our \"off\" weeks, we release \"Extras\", which are usually shorter, sillier, and can be about anything--from costumes to companions to fandom to feminism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do we record?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI think we already covered that. We\u0027re all over the globe! I suppose if you consider Skype a \"location\", then that\u0027s where we do it. Yes. We record in cyberspace!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do we put it together?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want each podcast to be a naturally flowing conversation. We don\u0027t edit out content, though we do strive to give you the best sound quality possible! To that end, we talk to each other on Skype, but we each record our own voice to a separate mp3 file. Everyone sends their file to Erika, and she works some technical magic to put all the tracks together, add music, and make it sound as clear as possible. If you want details about the technical mumbo jumbo, Erika talks about it in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2138120/how-to-get-started-in-podcasting.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis Macworld article\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we do it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt boils down to the fact that we all passionately love \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e. Some of us grew up with it. Some of us came to it later in life. But we all love it so much we\u0027d be talking about it even if we weren\u0027t recording it for all the internet to hear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, we, along with a lot of other women, \u003cem\u003ewere\u003c/em\u003e talking about it--at conventions (often at the bar), via email, on social media...wherever we could! And while there are some really great \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who \u003c/em\u003epodcasts out there, we couldn\u0027t find one that looked at the show from a female perspective. Our goal in creating Verity! was to take those casual and sometimes passionate conversations and transplant them to the internet.  And something really great happened along the way: people of all ages, genders, and levels of fannish devotion listened!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think fun, friendliness, and serious topics aren\u0027t mutually exclusive. We aren\u0027t kidding when we say we\u0027re opinionated and we frequently agree to disagree. We think that just makes things more interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeyond the basic questions...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNow that we\u0027ve covered the questions, we want to point out a couple of things. First of all, we\u0027re not offering any rewards. We\u0027re not giving extra attention/stuff to people who pledge money. We\u0027ll continue to put out the podcast just has we have been, and we hope each and every one of you enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, we might add some nifty goals soon. If we do, they\u0027ll be equal-opportunity fun things that will be open to ALL listeners. Maybe we\u0027ll do a ridiculous commentary as a bonus release. (Yes--that would mean two releases that week!) Or we\u0027ll schedule some random drawings for cool stuff! (We can afford occasional cool stuff if we\u0027re not shelling out as much for hosting costs every month.)\u00a0If you have ideas for goals that would be fun for everyone, let us know here, on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://veritypodcast.wordpress.com/?s=welcome\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0or on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/VerityPodcast\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027re not here to soak you for cash. If you like the show and want to support us and help cover our costs, that\u0027s fantastic! If you simply want to continue enjoying the show for free every week, that\u0027s fantastic too! We love you all. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
