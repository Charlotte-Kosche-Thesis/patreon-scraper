Vincent has posted four 1,000-yard receiving seasons on his way to being named to three Pro Bowls following his performances during the 2009, 2011, and 2012 seasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe son of two military parents, Vincent knows all too well what it\u0027s like growing up in a military family. As a child, his father was deployed with the US Army, and Vincent lived in many different places throughout his youth, including a few years in Germany. Feeling a strong commitment to serve the community in which he lives and to support other military families sharing the same experiences he had as a child, he and his wife, Lindsey, launched the Jackson in Action 83 Foundation in November 2012. The mission of the foundation is to provide support to military families, focusing on the educational, emotional, and physical health of the children. The foundation includes many programs that uplift military families, including the Salute to Reading, Salute to Scholars, Military Home Makeover, Military Moms Baby Shower, and more. In June 2014, Lindsey and Vincent Jackson announced the publication of their children\u0027s book, \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eDanny Dogtags: Dealing with Deployment,\u003c/em\u003e a book they wrote in hopes of helping families discuss the emotions and personal challenges that arise when a parent is deployed. Proceeds from book sales go back to the foundation to support ongoing events and programming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cinput class=\"btn submitForm bePatron\" style=\"width: 400px;\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Become a Patron\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
