    "summary": "Salutations! I am The Vengeful \u0027Vadam, and welcome to my Patreon page! I am the Halo YouTuber responsible for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The Halo Edition of Lemme Smash videos\u003cbr\u003e-The Full Analysis of the Halo Betas series\u003cbr\u003e-The Halo Custom Edition Map Showcase series\u003cbr\u003e-The Halo Mods Showcase series\u003cbr\u003e-and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a content creator for the Halo franchise, I aim to provide a wide variety of Halo videos to my channel, such as machinima, analytic and descriptive videos, my own Halo trailers, Halo project showcases, and a plethora of other themes as I come up with them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the videos that I have done has been completed on my own, even my machinima skits. I\u0027m used to working by myself on these sorts of projects. but I\u0027m open to collaborate with others in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what brings me to Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had quite a few requests from some of my amazing subscribers, as well as some of my close friends, to form a Patreon account, and I feel this is a good idea going forward because I do plan to make YouTube my full time job very soon. However, relying on YouTube ad revenue alone isn\u0027t going to do the trick for me, especially if some of my videos get demonetized for whatever reason or advertisers start to back away from YouTube altogether. Funds from this will also go to better equipment and software for higher quality videos in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRest assured that I\u0027m not going to lock video content behind this Patreon account. No one should have to fork up money to see anything that I upload to YouTube. The fact people can watch my YouTube videos as well as choose to subscribe to me for free is an honor and a privilege on its own, and I refuse to force anyone to pay for something they shouldn\u0027t have to. Even donating to my Patreon isn\u0027t something I\u0027m going to force down everyone\u0027s throat. I might plug my account in at the end of each of my videos from now on, but I\u0027m going to try to keep that section of the video as brief as possible going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI humbly thank you for visiting this Patreon account of mine, and I\u0027ll see you on The Great Journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~The Vengeful \u0027Vadam\u003cbr\u003e"
