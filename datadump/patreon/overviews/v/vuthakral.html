    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eDraconic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Draconic\" is my game community I created in 2014, in which I host several servers for several games. The general idea/purpose behind Draconic\u0027s servers is to have minimal rules (outside of the obvious) so people can actually have fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information on what the community is about, check out or Steam group at \u003ca href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Vuthakrals_gms\"\u003ehttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/Vuthakrals_gms\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDraconic Discord Server: \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/6Y7WXrX\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/6Y7WXrX\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGames\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- Garry\u0027s Mod Sandbox\u003cbr\u003e- Garry\u0027s Mod Deathmatch (Basically Half-Life 2: Deathmatch)\u003cbr\u003e- Garry\u0027s Mod Co-op (Basically HL2DM\u0027s Co-op mode/maps)\u003cbr\u003e- Halo Custom Edition\u003cbr\u003e- Aliens vs Predator (events \u0026amp; private use only)\u003cbr\u003e- Team Fortress 2\u003cbr\u003e- ARK: Survival Evolved\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the money be going to?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe reason I\u0027m setting up a Patreon page for the servers is because as I leave my younger ages and have started my first few years into college, I\u0027ve realized how harsh the job world can be, and I do work hard to keep my servers up and running without issue. So I\u0027m adding this 100% optional patreon option. I\u0027ve never taken donations for my servers in the past and want to keep them up and open free of charge so people can play the games they like for free. To answer the section\u0027s actual title though; there\u0027s a few things. One is that I would like to build a proper server hosting machine for my servers. Otherwise, the money would go into college supplies. I want to keep this community alive as long as I am. There\u0027s a certain enjoyment to managing my servers, creating the automated processes to help me manage them, etc. I\u0027m not looking to make it a full-time profession, but at the same time if I end up homeless, these servers are pretty much gone. So I need to keep my education going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause of how Patreon\u0027s \"Goals\" work I can\u0027t actually make a \"when I reach this much money raised I can do x\", only \"this many patrons\" and \"this much per month\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals with this, aside from obvious financial reasons (as running these servers is basically a side-job) is to raise enough spare money so that I can build a dedicated server hosting machine, as detailed above. I\u0027m currently using an older computer of mine to run them all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I am currently a supporter, and stop supporting, what perks will I lose access to?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAfter your current month\u0027s support ends:\u003cbr\u003e- All perks. If you have custom loadouts, player attributes, etc on the sandbox server, they will be kept on the server but you will not have access to them. (This is in case you ever decide to become a patron again, I can just easily re-add you.)\u003cbr\u003e- You will lose your current supporter role on our Discord server, but will be given an \"ex-supporter\" role which will match colour to what your supporter tier was, but you will lose access to any private channels you previously had access to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"What if I refund?\" These changes will take effect immediately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"What if I was a Dedicated/Maximum supporter and switched to a lower tier?\" Same as above. For example, if you went from \"Dedicated supporter\" to just \"Supporter\" you will be given an \"Ex-Dedicated Supporter\" role, which keeps the old \"Dedicated Supporter\" name colour, but your perks will still only be what the \"Supporter\" has access to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA few notes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- If you are a part of server staff, or Discord moderators, name colour perks will not apply for you. Your staff position has a special colour already so you can be easily identified as staff.\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027m only human, and only one person at that. Please understand it will take a little bit of time for me to give people access to all their supporter features.\u003cbr\u003e"
