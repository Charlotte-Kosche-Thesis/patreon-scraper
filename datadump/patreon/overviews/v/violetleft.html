    "summary": "Hello Lovlies! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an indie actress, model, writer, \u0026amp; youtuber and I\u0027d love your support. Patreon is a website that lets fans support their favorite creators on the web in exchange for awesome perks. This concept is great because it will allow me to create more content, and share it with more people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFreelancing means I find all of my own work and am a collaborator on set. I am a stylist, an editor, a makeup artist, and on-camera. I\u0027m a creator. Creating indie media has been a dream come true, but I\u0027ve taken many financial blows to make great content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing independent also allows me to exist outside of the mainstream media\u0027s standard measurements, which I believe is not only healthier for talent, but for the people viewing the media. I think a variety of sizes and body-types should be represented in all aspects of our society. Being independent means my body is allowed to naturally fluctuate, and as you\u0027ll notice in my photos, I range from sizes 8-14. All bodies are beautiful. Supporting independent media means supporting an alternative industry to what\u0027s on cable TV. Alternative Industry creators can set their own rules for their bodies \u0026amp; content, live authentically, and are creative forces in their work, not objects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help me buy new and interesting wardrobe and makeup, airfare so I can shoot with new filmmakers, and eventually hopefully better video gear so I can release higher quality work of myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange, I\u0027d love to give you merchandise and access to exclusive digital media via my patreon feed where I post daily, or close to daily content. If there is a product you\u0027re interested in but don\u0027t see listed here, send me an email and I\u0027ll see what I can do! You can reach me at violetleftcollab at gmail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll giving levels $5+ will receive access to my patreon feed which will be updated often, and is already loaded with fun content. You will get access to the full feed the moment you pledge! Check out a small sampling of my patron posts below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll merch include domestic shipping.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have an Amazon Wishlist where gifts can be purchased directly.\u003cbr\u003e"
