If you follow me on social media you know I\u0027m a weirdo from up North that builds prop armor and weapons for a living! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost weekly I have some of you suggesting or requesting custom builds because you want to see me tackle them! Well, as someone who is trying to do prop making as a living, I can\u0027t always do that. D: But with your help, I can! I plan to do some cool builds as we unlock milestones or tiers in funding. Milestones will begin unlocking some cool stuff like exclusive videos/streams, allowing time to do tutorials or reviews as many of you ask me things often and even larger builds! There will also be monthly Patreon exlusive giveaways that everyone is eligible for no matter how much you pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make some awesome stuff together!\u003cbr\u003e"
