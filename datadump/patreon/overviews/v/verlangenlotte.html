Thanks for visiting my page, any support is immensely appreciated and it means a lot whenever someone checks out my work.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the creator of the webcomic Potentia which you can check out on my\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/verlangenlotte\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFacebook page!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003eI started the first book early 2012 and am currently writing the fifth one. The story and characters have developed quite a bit over the years, and although I consider it to be mediocre in terms of print quality, its a series I work hard on. I\u0027m also the creator of the \"Genwun Guy\" Pokemon comics on Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, not all of the content I create for Potentia is suitable for a wide ranged audience. I\u0027ve always indulged in drawing nsfw art of my characters which obviously isn\u0027t appropriate to share with all of my readers. \u003cstrong\u003eThe art here is not only sexual in nature but also gives a degree of spoilers for the main series since it is mostly post-story content\u003c/strong\u003e. Not everything is canon but those familiar with the characters will be able to draw many conclusions, and \u003cstrong\u003eits important that the integrity of my series isn\u0027t jeopardized by those who view this content\u003c/strong\u003e so the trust between me and my Patrons is very crucial. I want to reward anyone who shows support and interest in my creations with art that has been largely exclusive to myself and a handful of others. \u003cdel\u003eAnd possibly make you all cringe with my bad smut and trashy out of character portrayals.\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlong with my original content, you\u0027ll see fanart and various commission work!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
