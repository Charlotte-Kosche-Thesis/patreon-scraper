I\u0027m also an activist, philanthropist, an advocate for human-rights, a proud male feminist, a single father, a businessman, a motivational speaker, and an Army Vet. I am the original Invisible Gaylord Ninja Dom. I wrote my first story at the age of ten and haven\u2019t stopped writing since. I love reading about anything and everything and am a proud member of the little known U.N. group:Gay Society (Undercover Nerds-That I started myself) because while I live, eat, breathe, and sleep sports, I also breathe history and science fiction and grew up a Trekkie.\u003cbr\u003eBut don\u2019t ask me about Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, because I have no idea how to play that game.\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to writing I write everything from paranormal to contemporary to fantasy to historical, from gay romance to mainstream heterosexual romance. From young adult to children. From science fiction to horror. From comic books to screenwriting; and I\u0027m known not only for being the Epilogue King but also for writing stories that cross lines and boundaries that I don\u2019t know are there (or maybe I just refuse to acknowledge them).\u003cbr\u003eI am\u00a0a proud father of two daughters one of whom watches over me from Heaven with my deceased partner Christopher. When I\u0027m not writing, I am hanging out with my friends, my kid, or being distracted by videos of John Barrowman, Jussie Smollet, John Cho, Adam Rodriguez, Scott Hoying, and Shemar Moore. Vicktor has published numerous bestselling novels and has a WIP list that makes him exhausted just thinking about. He knows that he will be still be writing about people falling in love with each other, and aliens discovering the pyramids, long after he is living in an assisted living facility, flirting with the hot, male nurses.",
