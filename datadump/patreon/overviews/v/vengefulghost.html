    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Parker, and Vengeful Ghost is a magic trick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I take the jokes and ideas and myths that rattle around my head and chisel away at them until the bones of a story take shape. Then, I hand them off to virtuoso collaborators--editors and designers and artists who apply their own talents and skill to bring those bones to life. Through the mystic power of art and the internet, they become beautiful, short comic stories for you to read. They\u0027re about all sorts of people across all kinds of genres. Our opening lineup includes a romance, a psychological espionage story, and a darkly humorous crime story. You never know what you\u0027ll get, but you know it will be fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re publishing these stories a page at a time\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://vengefulghost.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon our website\u003c/a\u003e, and we\u0027re shooting for one page a week. You can be a part of it! Go, read the stories, comment--and, if you feel like the world could use a little more Vengeful Ghost, come back and press that big orange button that says \"Become a patron\". As thanks for your support, you\u0027ll receive fun benefits like producer credit, access to a monthly video chat with me and special guests, and influence over which stories go up on the website when.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks! I hope to see you over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://vengefulghost.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVengeful Ghost\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eParker\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you\u0027re not sure about this whole Patreon thing, here\u0027s how it works: After you click the orange button, you make an account and give Patreon your credit card information. You tell Patreon how much money you\u0027d like to give us per page. Patreon keeps track of how many times we publish a page in a given month. Then, at the end of the month, Patreon charges your credit card according to how much you pledged and how many pages we published. You only get charged once a month, no matter how many campaigns you support or how many pages we publish (which helps us all save on credit card fees). Finally, if you\u0027re worried that we might publish more pages than you can support, you can put a total cap on your pledge. No matter how many pages we publish in a month, you\u0027ll never be charged more than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can cancel your pledge whenever you like, but I hope you\u0027ll stick around. Patreon isn\u0027t like Kickstarter or GoFundMe where we\u0027d be trying to scrape up the cash for one big project--instead, it\u0027s a way for you and us to build a long-term relationship. We can take our coats off, get to know each other, and learn from each other as Vengeful Ghost keeps publishing page after page and story after story of exciting comics for you to put in your brain.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
