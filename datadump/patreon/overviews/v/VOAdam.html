As you can imagine, it is challenging to make a living as an actor/voiceactor and my income is not always consistent.  I work 3 other jobs to make this channel a possibility. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love voice acting, and I want to bring you the best quality content I can.  The more financial backing the channel has, the better content I can produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny sort of donation at all helps immensely, and I really appreciate all of the amazing support the VO Crew has shown me! I want to be able to bring you bigger and better projects, and someday even original productions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY GOAL\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIs to make a new Comic Dub for the VO Crew every single day.  In order to do that though, I need financial support.  Each episode takes at least 4 hours for me to create.  While working 3 other jobs, it is definitely a challenge to make sure that I have at least 4 hours available every single day.  With your help and support, I can have the financial backing to open up my schedule to create more, higher quality content.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now, everything you donate here on Patreon will go directly into improving the quality and quantity of my YouTube content.  The first thing I am hoping to upgrade is my recording system.  Sound equipment breaks and is very expensive to repair.  My very fancy PreAmp has recently broken so that will be the first thing that will be repaired.  (Basically it is the thing that makes the characters like with low voices, like King Dice, sound so cool.)  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m also coming close to being able to reach out for guest voiceover artists on the channel.  I want to respect my fellow voice actors so I won\u2019t do that until I am confident in my ability to produce finely edited content.  With your help, guest voice actors will be on the channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m also working on putting together a Twitch Stream for live VOs and my current setup needs some work before that will be ready to go.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE VO CREW IS AMAZING\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSeeing the support that you all have given me, each other, and the artists of the comics has been unbelievable.  The amazing supportive community that we have been able to build together, inspires me as an artist and as a person.  Your comments continually make my day and hopefully I help brighten yours...  and, ok, sometimes make you cry\u2026 With your help we can continue to grow the VO Crew and inspire other artists to follow their passions."
