The techniques of that art i am not here to replicate, but to continue the spirit, and\u00a0the legacy of catching slices of life, keeping them on paper for all to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://vokabre.com/box/patreon-vokabre-2017-11-16-k.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a Jewish\u2013Russian raccoon of 23 years who now lives on the eastern border of Moscow in Russia. My dream is to create artworks of moments from all over the world, moments beautiful and horrible, create with great truth and with no censorship.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter smaller sketches from travels, after a rough album of a railway circumnavigation across Canada and Russia, this is what i do, what i begun doing after bringing from my half-a-year life in South Korea an album of slice-of-life paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://vokabre.com/box/patreon-vokabre-2017-11-16-n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nToday i create artworks of slice-of-life Moscow in this strange times, and albums about adventures in Saint Petersburg, Finland, Friuli, Venezia, Austria, Japan and other travelled places are waiting to be painted.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStories on some paintings were enough to get a ban from any kind of major publicity in the country. It would take a fearless gallery to host the pieces and even the bravest would have to overcome the biggest fear of a forgotten art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://vokabre.com/box/patreon-vokabre-2017-11-16-d.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTimes of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts are long gone, but I feel, that you can be brilliant as Nicholas Roerich, you can make this all happen. I invite you, to the endless and wonderful journey of light and lines.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Patreon campaign is here to become the main income, and now there aren\u0027t any other ones for me.
