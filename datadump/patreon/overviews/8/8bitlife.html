    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hey everybody, I\u2019m Roberto Villegas and I make podcasts. I do a little show on the internet called My So Called 8bit Life. It\u2019s conversational podcast and I\u2019ve had the privilege on having such guests as Brian Brushwood, Tom Merritt, Mega Ran, and the creative team behind the Undergrads cartoon. I\u2019ve done this show for over 100 episodes and I think its time to take it to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0To do that, I need some time. Time to direct the passion that\u2019s pushed this show as far as it has to push it even further. Time to let me do what needs to be done to help out all the people who\u2019ve helped me along the way. That\u2019s where you guys come in. If you\u2019re able to throw some support, feel free to kick into this. I\u2019ve got some tiers setup and initial goals, but as this gets bigger, I\u2019ll unlock some more. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Some of you out there just can\u2019t spare anything, but still want to help and I fully respect that. Bottom line, the best alternative way you can help is give the show a review on wherever you hear it, share it with some one who you know will love it, or just simply keep listening. All of these help the show out. So thanks for watching and supporting. \u003cbr\u003e"
