    "summary": "Hello! And welcome to my Patreon page! I\u2019m Rob Kovacs, a professional\u00a0pianist and NES (Nintendo) music enthusiast. I\u0027m making piano arrangements of the music of the original NES games and performing them under the moniker, \u003cstrong\u003e88bit\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up on this music and it has influenced my own music quite a bit. I want to join a growing group of musicians to help shed light on the greatness of video game music, especially the less well-known music of the NES and bring it to new audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho should pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople who:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eenjoy video game music\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eenjoy piano music\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eenjoy video game music played on piano\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ewant to discover and learn more about Nintendo music\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewant to help preserve video game music\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eplay piano and want to learn to play these arrangements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewho just want to support me on this project!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome Background on 8-bit Music\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music from these early games is some of the first examples of computer music - music written for a computer to perform. This allowed for composers to create some truly groundbreaking music. For the first time, a composer didn\u2019t have to worry about pitch, speed interval, tuning or difficulty. It was all programmed and performed back exactly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one major limitation, though, was that composers only had three tracks, or voices, to work with, plus a noise track and a primitive sample track. These limitations combined with the power of the NES music chip, composers created some truly groundbreaking music. Composers could program just about any pitches at any speed and not have to worry about playability or limitations of a human musician. The NES music chip would perform precisely whatever it was told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, much of the music went unnoticed. The majority of the people who would ever hear this music were kids playing the game on a 13-inch mono-speaker TV. \u003cbr\u003eI was one of those kids and without realizing at the time, the music of these games have majorly influenced my own compositions and musical tastes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, I want to give back and give this music a second life and the exposure it deserves by creating piano arrangements and recording and performing them live. There are nearly 700 games written for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The big goal is to eventually arrange every one of these songs for piano. There the famous games like Zelda, Mega Man, Contra, etc. but plenty of less popular games with hidden gems like Arkista\u2019s Ring, Rygar, and Journey to Silius.\u003cbr\u003eAnd I know I will need help along this journey. If you are already a supporter, thank you for helping me make this possible. If you are considering being a supporter, please know I will do my very best to create the highest quality arrangements and recordings, and give the respect it has long deserved. If you haven\u2019t seen any of my videos yet, here is the first NES arrangement I made which was of Airman\u2019s theme from Mega Man 2 - \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guszz2k8Qww\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guszz2k8Qww\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading and for your support! \u003cbr\u003e- Rob"
