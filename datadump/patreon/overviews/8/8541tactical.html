    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my Patreon page. The simple fact that you are reading this means that you are looking for ways to support our project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://8541tactical.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e8541 Tactical\u003c/a\u003e almost a decade ago in order to give back to the shooting community. Through my life as a Marine Sniper and then later a SWAT Sniper I have been given the opportunity to learn quite a bit about the practical application of long range precision rifles. As the equipment and techniques evolved, the options available to the average shooter became mind boggling. I became increasingly distrustful of glossy magazine articles promoting gear that was produced by the companies who bought expensive ads on the next page.\u00a0I saw an increasing need for \u003cstrong\u003eunbiased information\u003c/strong\u003e that was obtainable for recreational shooters. I have attempted to serve that need by providing high quality video reviews and tutorials on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/8541tactical\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e and in-depth articles on our website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/18489794_1316586458377049_4765291376446230797_o.jpg?oh=15384fc95bf92863def13292a2f485b0\u0026amp;oe=59ABB5B2\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSupporting 8541 Tactical will give us the resources to replace camera gear when it is damaged, travel to the SHOT Show as well as matches and most importantly, upgrade our video editing equipment. This will allow me to produce more content, faster. Hopefully it will allow me to spend a little more time with the family and less fighting with four hour render sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eHow?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I have setup several cool reward tiers that allow you to choose the level of support that makes you most comfortable. Even as little as one dollar a month really helps us. Not only will that $1 give you the knowledge that you are helping us out, it will also give you access to a private feed here on Patreon where we will announce new projects and let you in on what we are doing behind the scenes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e If you have the resources to go above and beyond, we have setup some higher level tiers. These will move us closer to being able to upgrade equipment and cover travel expenses. This takes just a little more pressure off of me and eases the financial burden that our family has absorbed up to this point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe end goal is to transition 8541 Tactical into a company that can support my efforts full-time. I can\u0027t do that without the help of viewers like you. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to serve the shooting community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
