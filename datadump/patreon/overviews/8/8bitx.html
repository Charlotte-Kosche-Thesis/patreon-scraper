I was a meek, shy kid, was too nice, I waited my turn, and pushed around. I was being crushed by life and everyone around was to self absorbed to be aware of it. I wanted to be heard.\u003cbr\u003eRadio stations are all about giving people a voice. 8bitX was originally a cool shorter URL for my show the 8bit Extravaganza. This was a fun project of mine that Shaun \u0026amp; I resurrected after college to connect and keep some fun going as our lives evolved into adult nonsense. What happened was other shows (Radio Free Gamer was the first) started to come around and wanted to join up. I was grateful and honored to have other shows want to join our station.\u003cbr\u003eAs a show host the time invested in the show is huge, show research, show prep, technical gibberish, making sure everything is perfect, just so it goes perfectly wrong. We\u0027ve all been there. We\u0027ve all done that because it\u0027s our PASSION. That passion, that drive, that commitment of time should never be taken for granted. Yet time and time again I see stations violating this trust between host and station.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the station that operates a platform for the host to connect to the audience. The station is merely the stage for the performers. The station is the mechanism for the hosts who are VOLUNTEERING their time away from their friends, families, and other activities because they have a drive and a vision of greatness. It\u0027s our job as a station to foster this dream and do our best to promote and drive that host on to bigger and better things.\u003cbr\u003eThe hosts of all shows deserve a voice. There is a story behind each show, and a person behind each microphone. We simply try to treat people the way they should be. With respect and caring to encourage that inner child to step up and be heard for once in their lives.\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e-Will\u003cbr\u003e",
