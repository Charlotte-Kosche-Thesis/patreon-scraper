    "summary": "One year of our ten-year-project is now finished and available, and producing those 13 podcasts has taught us an enormous amount about the show that we\u0027re making and the show that we hope to make as we move forward. We release the show once every two weeks, and it is released right at midnight on Sunday night/Monday morning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find us here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/80s-all-over/id1149616726\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOur official iTunes page\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.80sallover.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOur official website\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who are new to\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u002780s All Over\u003c/em\u003e, it\u0027s a pretty simple idea. We decided that there is a huge amount of nostalgia for the \u002780s, particularly in terms of movies, but it almost all seems to focus on a small handful of movies. You know which ones. \u003cem\u003eBlade Runner\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eThe Goonies\u003c/em\u003e. Anything with Indiana Jones in it. Ahnold. \u003cem\u003eThe Monster Squad\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0027s a list that has become more and more ossified over the last ten years or so, and we decided there had to be an antidote.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter all, both of the hosts of \u003cem\u003e\u002780s All Over\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0are old enough that they were actually around for the films when they came out originally, and that led us to the idea for the show. We\u0027re going through month by month, starting with January of 1980, and reviewing every film released in the US for the entire decade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlready we\u0027ve managed to turn our listeners on to tons of movies that were familiar to us but brand-new to them, and it\u0027s terrific to see the conversations that have developed around the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat has become clear is that this is a very labor-intensive podcast for us. We\u0027re tracking down the movies, some of which are completely obscure, we\u0027re putting together the research, and we\u0027re making sure we cover everything. There\u0027s a fair amount of money involved in tracking things down, even if just for digital rentals, and a ton of effort involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are dedicated to continuing to provide a free podcast via iTunes and other outlets, but we need to figure out a way to turn this into something that can support itself. For that reason, we wanted to open this up to a Patreon community. In exchange, we want to provide you a ton of extra content that will make this a vital and interactive community. We want to make sure that you feel rewarded for being part of the show, and we have some great ideas for how to make that work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s do this as a monthly thing. If you\u0027ll commit to a certain level of sponsorship, we\u0027ll commit to way more than the two episodes of the show you can already expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you say? Ready to join us on this adventure?\u003cbr\u003e"
