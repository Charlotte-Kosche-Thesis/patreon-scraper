His hip-hop \u0026amp; electronic works are fresh spins on soundtracks you\u0027d know and love if you were an 80\u0027s or 90\u0027s child. To him, the content he grew up with is all a big nostalgic blur, so why not mash it all together and see what sticks. 8-Bit Mullet regularly invites local artists to perform at his private parties in Richmond, VA.",
