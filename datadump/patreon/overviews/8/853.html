    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://www.853london.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e853london.com\u003c/a\u003e has been reporting on news and issues in Greenwich and south-east London for seven years. Now it needs your help to continue and grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the traditional local media has abandoned investigative journalism, 853 follows decision-makers and those who influence them to get to the heart of the issues that affect our lives. And it also covers the local campaigns that the legacy press has forgotten about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut all this takes time and effort. Exclusives such as revealing the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://853london.com/2017/07/26/greenwich-council-to-review-civic-awards-after-giving-prize-to-church-which-calls-homosexuality-darkness/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eanti-gay sermons at a church backed by Greenwich Council\u003c/a\u003e take time and effort. Even run-of-the-mill tales take a couple of hours to produce - sourcing photos and double-checking documents. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also direct financial costs, such as site maintenance, travel to and from events and Land Registry searches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, I would be hugely grateful if you would consider supporting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.853london.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e853\u003c/a\u003e with a monthly donation. The more people support the site, the more time I can spend looking at the documents and the issues that the legacy local press gave up doing years ago, and the more time I can spend writing about them. I\u0027ll also be able to start looking at different issues, as I\u0027ll have the time to properly understand them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027d like to build the site up to get other people involved, to provide a real picture of what life is like for us in our very special part of south-east London.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverybody who gives some money at the basic tier will get a report every three months detailing what\u0027s happening with the site. But if you can afford to give half-an-hour of London Living Wage each month, then you\u0027ll get a monthly newsletter with a special take on the issues affecting life in SE London.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoing this is a bit nerve-wracking. But I\u2019m up for the challenge. I hope you are too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you like what I do, please do your bit to keep local journalism alive in Greenwich and SE London.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDarryl Chamberlain\u003cbr\u003eeditor, 853london.com"
