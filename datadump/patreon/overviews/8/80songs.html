     "about": "(New York, NY) Multi-cultural folk-rocker, guitarist and singer-songwriter, Liah Alonso, announces her newest project and subscription-based website, \u201cAround the World in 80 Songs,\u201d which aims to unite the world through music by documenting the singer\u2019s travels across the world. Alonso\u2019s mixed heritage of Mexican, Jewish and Spanish fuel her gypsy-cowgirl soul and drive her desire to travel internationally for the sake of music. The project, shot as a docu-drama, will follow Alonso from city to city, where she will face the challenge of immersing herself into an unknown culture and then creating a song with the locals. \u003cbr\u003eNow focusing on her solo career for the past three years, after being a touring musician for eight years, Liah Alonso began her music career by busking on the NYC subway. She was a founding member of the acoustic rock duo, Left On Red, who wrote satirically witty, catchy and politically-fueled music that Lucid Culture calls \"A vivid reminder how much of an audience there is for accessible pop music that\u2019s not stupid.\" After four years touring and recording multiple albums, Alonso was presented with collaborative opportunities and graced the stage with industry heavyweights, like Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine), Jackson Browne, Cyprus Hill, G Love, Wayne Kramer and Ben Harper. Currently, Alonso is diligently working as the creator and host of \u201cAround the World in 80 Songs,\u201d a web series that takes her fans all over the globe with her, as she performs and collaborates with the locals. Only yielding her guitar and her luggage, Alonso emerses herself in the culture of each destination by creating a band and a song everywhere she goes, recording in the local musical style and language of the city. Without pre-existing contacts or knowledge of the language, Alonso argues that music becomes the international language of harmony that bridges all cultural gaps to create a universal equality and passion. \u003cbr\u003eNow, anyone with access of the internet has the opportunity to be a part of Liah Alonso\u2019s gypsy-cowgirl lifestyle and adventure with her all over the world by tuning into her subscription-based web series, \u201cAround the World in 80 Songs,\u201d that debuts on June 30th, 2015. Liah Alonso will be playing in NYC at Mercury Lounge on that same day, hitting the stage at 9 p.m. EST. Don\u2019t miss out on this worldwide celebration of music, collaboration and unity!",
