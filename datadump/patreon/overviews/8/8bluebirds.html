    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Bit About Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can have a tough time sharing my personal story with others. On social media I tend to hide myself behind my art and my birds, but if you would like to know a little about the person behind the art here is a bit about me: From the time I was little I have always loved creating. I wanted to experiment with every media, and few days went by when I wasn\u0027t drawing or shaping something. I struggle with anxiety and sensory processing issues, and art was a source of self-therapy. Even when I was busy with schoolwork, I managed to carve time for my art until I hit college. The stress was enormous, so much so that when I had free time I was too mentally and physically exhausted to even doodle. I decided to take a break after university to recoup my mental health, and during this break I made the decision to give my art a chance. It is my dream to make a living using my skills, sharing my passion with others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a huge bird lover. I have had a bird sharing my living space since I was 8 years old. Birds are amazing creatures, and when you gain the trust of an animal that\u0027s so intelligent and free, the feeling is beyond words. Right now I share my life with two birds, Asa and Nym. Asa is a white cockatiel who\u0027s sweet as a marshmallow (though he\u0027s nervous around new people), and Nym is a turquoise lineolated parakeet with a lot of spunk. These bundles of fluff provide me with endless joy and inspiration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Story of 8 Blue Birds\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy online shop,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://8bluebirds.com/\"\u003e8 Blue Birds\u003c/a\u003e, was born in January 2016, along with my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/8bluebirds\"\u003eEtsy store\u003c/a\u003e. This business is a combination of my two loves, art and birds. 8 is a significant number for me, and blue is the color of a bird that changed my life, a little budgie named Sky.\u00a0He lived in my room for 11 years, and was my feathered friend through high school and nearly all of college. Sky was an adventurous and cheerful bird, always curious about the world around him. He never learned any words, but he loved to mimic the birds outside, my whistling, and the animals he heard on TV.\u00a0Sky always seemed to know how to cheer me up after a tough day.\u00a0He didn\u0027t really show his age until he reached 10 years. He would still chirp and come to the front of the cage when I came in, but didn\u0027t have the spark he used to. Sky passed away in October of 2014 after a long illness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created the 8 Blue Birds gift shop to\u00a0provide quality handmade bird miniatures, artwork, and jewelry to fellow bird lovers. With every bird I create, I am discovering new poses and expressions, and I will continue to push myself to make more creative and ambitious sculptures. Customs are my favorite. I love being able to provide unique handmade creations inspired by people\u0027s beloved birds. It\u0027s always a fun challenge to capture the character of each bird and bring it to life. Through providing customs I have been able to meet bird lovers from all over the world, and it makes me feel blessed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Join the 8 Blue Birds Journey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my hope 8 Blue Birds can continue to grow. My goal in creating a Patreon is to provide a way for me to have a more stable income, allowing me more time to expand my business and create better content. At this point, I spend nearly all of my time between commissions making charms, figurines, and jewelry for the shop. I depend on these to make enough money to buy more clay, pay my website fees, and keep my business running.\u00a0If you enjoy what I do and would like to support me, please consider donating $1 a month. Your money will go toward my supplies, fees, shipping costs, and eventually recording equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI offer free domestic shipping on all orders, and I don\u0027t ever plan on changing this. It\u0027s a dream of mine to also offer free international shipping once I make enough income. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also plan to provide scheduled livestreams to demonstrate techniques and chat with my viewers. I have made a few livestreams in the past, but carving the time to do the streams has been difficult and I haven\u0027t found a good location to record them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI receive a lot of requests for tutorials. I would love to provide these once my income is more stable, but until then it isn\u0027t feasible for me to make them. With your support, I hope to be less dependent on my shop updates. I would gain the time and equipment to provide quality streams as well as tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to be completely financially independent. This is a high goal, but with time and dedication I hope to be able to make a living wage doing what I feel I was meant to do. Every dollar I earn brings me closer to that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am grateful for every order I receive, every custom, positive comment, constructive tip, and every like and share. Even if you can\u0027t afford to donate at this time, please know your support means the world to me!"
