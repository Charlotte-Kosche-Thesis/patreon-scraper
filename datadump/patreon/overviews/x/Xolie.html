    "summary": "Hey everyone,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Xolie and I am an all encompassing creative type. \u00a0My time is split in many directions, but mainly it\u0027s just spent attempting to make the world a better place using music. \u00a0I am in a band called Xolie Morra \u0026amp; the Strange Kind that has been on National TV and small tours around the US. \u00a0And we have been doing this 100% independently. \u00a0My main focus these days is my volunteer work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT I\u0027M ABOUT:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am an artist on the Autism Spectrum and I spend my time working to bring awareness to the reality of Autism from my own personal experience living with it daily. \u00a0I work with children on the spectrum, teaching life skills through music (which I\u0027m legally not allowed to video and share without parental consent **smiles**, but I can certainly tell you all about the funny things that happen as they happen). \u00a0I also started \u003ca href=\"http://www.inthespectrum.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.inthespectrum.org\u003c/a\u003e which I hope to grow into a 501c3. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough \"In The Spectrum\" we plan and produce the \"Seattle Concert For Autism\" which benefits multiple Autism related charities such as the Academy for Precision Learning in Seattle (the school I sometimes teach at) and we plan on expanding into other projects including a documentary that we have been filming for the last 6 years. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you donate?:\u003cbr\u003eThe music industry is changing. \u00a0We can\u0027t stop streaming sites like spotify or youtube and I wouldn\u0027t want to, they are a great platform to meet people who otherwise wouldn\u0027t have heard our music before, but we also currently can\u0027t make those companies pay a fair price for streaming our music and as working musicians, it is one more blow to those of us who rely on music sales to pay our bills and continue to put out more quality recordings. \u00a0By donating monthly, you can still enjoy those sites with a new sense of freedom, because you know, you are doing your part to support artistry in this ever changing industry. \u00a0By donating monthly, you are investing in me and allowing me to give freely of my time. \u00a0You are giving me the space to create, support my band and make the world a better place with my music. \u00a0YOUR donations allow me to put the time necessary into doing all the things I need to do to compete with artists who are signed to major labels and help raise awareness about the lack of persons with disabilities in the mainstream music industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eON THIS PLATFORM:\u003cbr\u003eI will periodically give away music and post videos from my live streams as well as exclusive content you can only get on this site. \u00a0I will post video of concerts and open mics so you can keep up with what is going on and see what you are supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a lot of animals, so look forward to photos of my hairless dog \"Little\" and my evil kitty Boo Boo. (oh and my crazy Basenji Mix Arthur and my pit bull Big Giant Scary Chocolate Easter Bunny among others.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to make new friends who love music as much as I do and I hope to make you proud as we push our way into the spotlight.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being amazing and supportive."
