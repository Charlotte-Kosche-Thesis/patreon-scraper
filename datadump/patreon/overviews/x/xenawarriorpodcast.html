With a reboot currently in development,  it\u2019s more important now than ever to give the original show its due, and that\u2019s where we come in.  On our podcast, we\u2019ll be exploring the many ways that \u003cem\u003eXena\u003c/em\u003e pushed the medium forward: longform storytelling, formal and tonal experimentation, fandom development and fan interaction with the producers, representation and celebration of marginalized identities, you name it \u003cem\u003eXena\u003c/em\u003e was doing it! If you already love \u003cem\u003eXena\u003c/em\u003e, rewatch along with us, and if you\u2019ve never seen the show, what are you waiting for? Prepare to experience the power, the passion, the podcast!\u003cbr\u003e",
