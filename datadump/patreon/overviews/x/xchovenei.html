If you\u0027re ready for the next step in our relationship, I\u0027d like to tell you about what I do. I draw comics, write adventures, compose characters, and create rules. Think of Pathfinder content, d20 content, Dungeons and Dragons supplements, combining genres into a collectively different world, fantasy settings with comedy, romance, horror! I have lots of ideas for the future and want to eventually have my adventures\u00a0published. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone supporting my dreams of these works will gain access to supplements, influence creative curves in content by brainstorming or offer suggestions to things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommission Work, too! The commissions I get will be posted here for your viewing in hopes that maybe you will make another leap to aiding me in content creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to keep up drawing and writing all kinds of work. Mostly RPG and tabletop related compositions and comics (one-offs and sagas). To support me, I will be able to post more frequently and with inspiration on my side it\u0027ll be easier to compose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re thinking about donating for a specific reward, I\u0027ll let you know that it is very much appreciated and any input you have with your reward benefits will be discussed through email or skype (or other media if you prefer).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
