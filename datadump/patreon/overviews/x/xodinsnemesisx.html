Thank you guys for what you have done in the last year of me doing youtube and supporting what I have been doing by your viewership. I appreciate it so much and hope that my videos continue to help you progress in the game. Donating here is completely unnecessary, however, if you do wish to donate, I would be very thankful for anything that you decide is the worth it\u00a0to you. All of the money donated here will be going back towards the game and helping me progress further to bring you guys updated and higher tier content that I am currently lacking in. Again, thank you wether you donate or not and good luck to everyone who is reading this!"
