    "summary": "Salutations, I\u0027m a comic book writer from the Bay Area. I\u0027ve had some of my work published in an annual anthology, BAAU DOWN. I have a long running comic strip, Living With Robots, drawn by my best friend Sterling. I\u0027ve written and collaborated with\u00a0different artists on mini comics such as a tribute comic to Make A Wish kid, Miles Scott aka Batkid. I always make it a mission to incorporate diversity into my work. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m currently trying to make my webcomic, LIVING WITH ROBOTS, a diverse cast of characters where humans and robots co-exist. It\u0027s being penciled by my long time friend and collaborator Sterling Gee (artist of LIVING WITH ROBOTS) \u003ca href=\"http://silvertide.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttp://silvertide.deviantart.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m also developing The XUniverse. \u00a0A shared universe of comics featuring a diverse cast. I loved the avengers film and the whole set up to that. I want to do something like that but with diverse characters and my own flavor to it. I\u0027m inspired by the works of Lovecraft, Orwell, Kafka, Kirkman, and others. I plan to cross into genres, of scifi, horror, action, and fantasy. I hope to attract many artists from different background, since I want diversity not only in the work, but behind the work. I\u0027m hoping with support of $1/month I can pursue my goals, all listed on my patreon. Patrons get to be rendered and appear in my comics as part of promoting diversity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are some other ideas, I\u2019m developing and with your help, I hope to afford the talents of artists to make these ideas reality. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1) SF\u2019s first superhero, this is The Phenomenal Specter X, and issue one is being worked on by Sterling Gee whose drawn my comic strip Living With Robots. \u00a0Phenomenal Specter X is the traditional superhero story, but with a different take, a Latino teen named Rick Alvarez who loves theater and loves martial arts and after an accident becomes part of a bigger world and embodies what I love about superheroes. Specter X will be a fun action comedy with drama feature a diverse cast.  Specter X is to jumpstart this unique shared universe\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2) Tamara Amazon Warrior is fantasy and Arthurian influence. My love for Masters of the universe, WW, and ray harryhausen movies will be fueling this along with satire on feminism and what it means to be a feminist. \u00a0I\u0027m rewriting the script and plan to hire a team of female artists to help shape this epic inspired by works of Orwell and John Milton.This will be a sci fi fantasy in the vein of ray harryhausen or george pal, which a pinch of masters of the universe. It\u0027ll feature amazons but with a new spin that is a commentary on what it means to be a feminist. Inspired by works of paradise lost and animal farm.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3) Daring Damon Demon is my love of horror and real life paranormal events. Half human and half demon, he stands in as someone whos biracial. Personality wise he\u0027s a cross between Daffy Duck and John wayne.  The pilot minicomic will introduce him so I can pursue his true debut of a miniseries with a tone inspired by ghostbusters and evil dead. I\u0027ll be featuring the likes of slenderman, Roswell, the lost colony and other true inspired paranormal events, since this comic will be influence by my interest in the paranormal.  The first miniseries will have the theme of fearmonging.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4) I\u0027d like to work with an artist for an action cyber thriller. It\u0027ll feature someone of Fillipino descent as he is given super powers and it framed for the murder of his parents. He\u0027s on the run from the police, US government and the secret group of people who set him up and now after him for the secrets he has. Itll be in the vain of the fugitive meets the bourne films with elements from enemy of the state. I went to capture that cyber war felt and depict a small world and big brother feel. \u00a0It\u2019s still in early development but with time I will develop it further.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nultimately, these characters will unite and help save the world from an other worldly threat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease help support diversity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGive a like on the Facebook page:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PhenomenalSpecterX\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/PhenomenalSpecterX\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "In addition to my previous ideas,\u00a0I\u0027d like to hire an artist talented in horror art, as I do a horror related miniseries featuring a character inspired by Hellboy and Vash Stampede from Trigun, but he\u0027ll be his own character. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe\u0027s a half human half demon representing biracial individuals. Personality wise he\u0027s a cross between Daffy Duck and John wayne. the story\u0027s tone will be in the vain of ghostbusters and evil dead introducing many unique individualS. This will be inspired by my interest in ufos and paranormal from 90\u0027s shows like sightings and unsolved mysteries as well as pay tribute to Lovecraftian lore and some modern creepypastas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA mini comic has been done to promote the character and mini series and can be featured here.",
