This platform will give you a chance to pledge for the projects you want to see happen. The more pledges I get, the more time I\u0027ll be able to apply to creating these projects. Finished books will go\u00a0up for sale as soon as they\u0027re done. The people who show up just to pledge for the Sterek book, or any other project, should downgrade their pledge once the book is completed. If you believe in a project, tell your friends. Even small pledges go a long way toward endorsing my efforts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also take requests for one on one tutorials and lessons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople like the content I create independently.
