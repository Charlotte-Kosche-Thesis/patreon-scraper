My own projects ( Script it!, The Unicorn Conspiracy, and the upcoming Skink\u0026amp;Ocelot vol3) are free. Free to read at your leisure.  \u003cbr\u003eYou see, I am a strong believer in free content that is as widely available as possible, if possible. And if you like it - support the creators and buy it. And if not - why on Earth would you buy things that you don\u0027t like? \u003cbr\u003eBut since I am mostly busy drawing and writing stuff, I tend to put off the merchandising for a better day. Which never comes. But everyone still gets free comics, so everyone\u0027s happy. I hope.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I have to take on additional work in order to cover the living expenses and that takes away time from working on the comics. In other words, I\u0027m too busy making free content to worry about making money off of it. \u003cbr\u003eAnd that was all fine and dandy, before the economy had gone bottoms up. \u003cbr\u003eSo here I am.

It\u0027s almost a stream of conscience, and any form of input and commentary is welcomed. We try to touch upon the general issues of script-writing, regardless of what the script is for, but since we\u0027re making comics, the main emphasis is on comic books. This is by no means a definitive guide to writing, only a supplementary. So far it\u0027s turning out better than we hoped it would be.
