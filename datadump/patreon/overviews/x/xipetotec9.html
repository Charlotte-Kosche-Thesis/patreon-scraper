    "summary": "Heya! Thanks for takin the time to check out my patreon page which I hope will become my dreams made reality by supporting my intensive artistic endeavors. \u00a0I\u0027ve been an art freak ever since I developed the motor skills to grab a crayon. My father influenced me at a young age to be artistically inclined. Then my obsession with comic books blasted my passion \u0026amp; desire to draw into orbit. I\u0027ve drawn nearly everyday of my life and presently I feel I\u0027m exploding with so many ideas \u0026amp; concepts that I end up tagging walls wherever I go, even got inna lil trouble @ work (UPS) fer writin on the wall as of trailers \ud83d\ude1c\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne would think that by now, @ age 37, with my inherent talent \u0026amp; my honed skills, I would have \u0027made it\u0027 in some kind of artistic arena, that I would be able to identify myself as a \u0027professional artist\u0027 by now. Sadly my life path is a twisted, curved, looptyloop road. \u00a0I became heavily involved in drugs \u0026amp; became a junkie, nearly died multiple times, seizures, respiratory failure, the works. Thankfully, I was arrested \u0026amp; placed in the drug court program. I sobered up, faced some hard truths about myself, \u00a0\u0026amp; realized in group therapy that my high levels of empathy, comprehension, \u0026amp; communication made it easy for me to help others work through their own problems. I was encouraged by others to become a Licensed Addictions counselor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI loved all my clients, having been there myself, I could connect \u0026amp; help fellow \u0027addicts\u0027 and motivate them to pursue personal growth \u0026amp; push past their failings. It was incredibly fulfilling, so fulfilling  that I ignored all the gross failings of chemical dependency treatment that were never addressed. However I obtained my Masters in Social Work I was educated \u0026amp; enlightened enough that the failings of 12step treatment programs couldn\u0027t be ignored. While some thrived with this treatment model, i saw too many round or triangular client pegs being shoved into a square hole \u0026amp; ultimately ended up back on junk/sauce/degenerative gambling. \u00a0The treatment provided for them didn\u0027t fit, but the treatment program didn\u0027t bother to adjust their approach. Gah! I\u0027m ranting! Sorry, but reliving this part of my life still really aggravates me. Ultimately, as one would surmise, after over nine years of my life, I quit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you know what it feels like to have devoted yourself fully to something, to have given over a quarter of your life to something you thought would last to your dying days, only to realize you \u0027chose poorly\u0027 \u0026amp; your reality was just a joke? I felt crushed, destroyed, broken, \u0026amp; then worst of all: numb. \u00a0I got a part time job @ UPS \u0026amp; just started putting one foot in front of the other in a malaise of self recrimination \u0026amp; judgement. \u00a0I gave up basically, \u0026amp; this cost me my marriage (almost a year ago now), my home, and worst of all: my dog Tui \ud83d\ude14 (I miss my marriage to, but lately I mainly miss my 90+ Doberman, he was my first dog \ud83d\ude1e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOWEVER! This wretched little story of mine still has hope, it\u0027s only when you lose everything that you can find the truth that was buried underneath it all, I....am....an artist. I have been feeling this intensity \u0026amp; desire to create \u0026amp; share my art growing more fiercely every day, with every pencil stroke, \u0026amp; every painting brush. Underneath all  the idealism \u0026amp; societally acceptable facade I put on I found me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis me I found is a creator of fantastic colors \u0026amp; radical ideas I want to pin down on a canvas, trap in comic, or restrain on a piece of paper long enough for me to share with the world. \u00a0Would you help me create \u0026amp; develop my craft into a reality where my main task in life is to do what i love?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
