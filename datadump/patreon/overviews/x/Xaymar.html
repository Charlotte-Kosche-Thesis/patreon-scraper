    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy nickname is Xaymar, but if you\u0027re met me in real life you probably know me as Michael Dirks. I love programming Software and Games, love 2D and 3D art (any kind) and also love listening to Music for hours on end (Drum \u0026amp; Bass mostly).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Kind Of Software And Games Do I Create?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty much everything and the quality also varies wildly. Most of what I write doesn\u0027t ever reach the light of day, some however do, and those work absolutely amazing, rivaling other software in the area. As for games, I usually write the engine and game logic parts - I\u0027m not an artistic person at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of projects have you released so far?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe first actually big release was the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Xaymar/Old-Projects/tree/master/Java/Inception%20(CraftBukkit)\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInception\u003c/a\u003e plugin for the Minecraft server mod CraftBukkit. It added the ability to combine multiple worlds into a single one, with almost instant world travel and next to no server lag. Unfortunately CraftBukkit no longer exists and I have no interest in Minecraft at the moment or in the near future.\u003cbr\u003eThen there is the AMD Encoder for OBS Studio which handed the full performance of their GPU or APU encoder to users on a silver plate - rivaling other existing solutions both in speed and features. It started off as a side project that quickly turned out to be what a lot of people wanted and eventually got merged into the OBS Studio project itself.\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally there is the AMD Encoder for ffmpeg and Handbrake, two projects that are still in the works, and another project I was hired for to do obs-studio programming (more about this when it is released - stay tuned!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen Did I Start With Programming?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s actually rather difficult to answer. If we only take into account the things that actually made it onto the internet, then I\u0027ve been programming since 2007 starting with Blitz3D. Though that was the first actual game language i started with, at first I programmed on Amiga back in the year 2000. So somewhere between 2000 and 2007 I actually started doing useful things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big dream of mine is to be able to do my hobby full time, but without any of the usual work restrictions. Patreon gives me the ability to work towards that goal and gives supporters a way to directly send feedback to me. So if you like what I do and you feel that my time is worth your money, feel free to support me here.\u003cbr\u003e"
