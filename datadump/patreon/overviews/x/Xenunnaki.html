My dream is to create content that showcases these strange and amazing things for everyone to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me as I bring this dream to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eSo, what kind of content does Xenunnaki make?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThe primary focus of the channel is on a unique series named Crypto Xing, a show where monsters fight. The aim of the show is to look at the lore of each monster to figure out how powerful they are, and from there determine which of them is the strongest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re talking creatures of cryptozoology, killers of urban legend, advanced extraterrestrials, ancient evils from literature, B-Movie monsters from the big screen, any boogieman who goes bump in the night, and everything in between.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgfJE_D885w\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Crypto Xing isn\u0027t alone, along side it is a sibling series titled Spook Stop. A more typical paranormal show which talks about various topics that otherwise wouldn\u0027t be covered in CX. These also act as subtle hints to the theme of the upcoming CX episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hNBxXgeCSYo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the only 2 shows in production currently, but there are many plans for more to come. Ideas which will hopefully reach fruition after enough success is gained by the former shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eHow many people work on this channel?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eOne. There has been talk of expanding the team to include additional members, but at the moment the entire bulk of responsibilities falls on my shoulders. Researching, writing, scripting, calculating, voice acting, editing, art creation, and all other loose ends, courtesy of yours truly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is however a small list of names included in the Special Thanks before each episode of CX, these are people who had inspired me and helped me get the ball rolling and I couldn\u0027t have come this far without them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to thanking them, I\u0027d like to thank all of you once again for reading this far. You may not have a mention in the Special Thanks, but it\u0027s this community of interested individuals that has really motivated me to keep doing what I do. I\u0027m greatful for all the support I\u0027ve gotten, and am excited to be able to create content for you guys to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e"
