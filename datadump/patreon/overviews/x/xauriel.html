    "summary": "I am Xauri\u0027EL Zwaan, a mendicant artist in search of meaning, fame and fortune, and pie (where available). \u00a0I am a socialist greenpunk transhumanist, a genderfluid bisexual, a Satanist, and a Goth. \u00a0For over two decades now I have been writing Sci-Fi and Fantasy, largely for my own amusement but always with an eye to publishing for a wider audience. \u00a0If you would like to see samples of my previous work to whet your appetite, you may access a (now sadly defunct) blog-based experimental sci-fi project at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://futuristical.blogspot.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFuturistical\u003c/a\u003e or read some more traditional short fiction at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://garbledtransmission.com/2013/01/07/featured-fiction-time-and-time-again/#.WNdPj_nyvIU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGarbled Transmissions\u003c/a\u003e or \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://365tomorrows.com/2013/03/08/for-the-one-who-has-everything/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e365Tomorrows\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0Some of my greatest influences currently include Charles Stross, John C. Wright, Ann Leckie, Hannu Rajaniemi, and China Mi\u00e8ville. \u00a0Most of my work deals with transhumanism and/or is experimental in some way, and I take a lot of themes from the political and social problems we face in this new millennium and from left-wing and genderqueer politics. \u00a0I feel like if I\u0027m not able to change the world, at least I can help illuminate it a bit through my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a weird in-between kind of person, and it\u0027s a weird in-between kind of world we live in. \u00a0Being paid to write and being able to do that and only that as a job has long been one of my dreams, but it\u0027s getting harder than ever to make it in the world of traditional publishing. \u00a0On the other hand, getting your work out there and into the hands of your fans has never been easier. \u00a0I\u0027m an experimentalist, and although I feel drawn to the \u0027legitimacy\u0027 of traditional publishing I have to say that my past experiments with putting my writing directly on the web have been exhilarating, even if they did not bring me fame and fortune. \u00a0Therefore, I am starting a new web-based project, a serial novel to be released on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/user/XaurielZwaan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWattPad\u003c/a\u003e, and I am asking you, my fans, to support me in this endeavour. \u00a0Completing this work is going to take a long time and will require a considerable time commitment from me, but I want my patrons to know that they are going to get some consistent output in exchange for the support I am asking for from you. \u00a0In thanks for your support, in addition to this work, I will be releasing some of my back catalog of stories on SmashWords. \u00a0Others will be asked to pay for these stories, but my generous patrons will get free copies as a little incentive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also looking forward to building a community here, stretching myself a bit on social media, and building my skills as a writer. \u00a0Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to getting to know you better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
