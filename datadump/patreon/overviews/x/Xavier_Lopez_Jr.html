Join me and let\u0027s make some magic together! My name is Xavier Lopez and I am a mixed media artist.\u00a0 I am probably best known for the series of events I have done with the Seattle Art Museum, or perhaps you have seen some of the murals I have painted around the Seattle area, or the sculptural installations I have done at the Center on Contemporary Art.\u00a0 What you may not realize, though is that I can\u0027t do any of it without you.\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have big goals and big goals cannot happen alone.\u00a0 I hope you will take a moment to pledge a little help, whether you saw me painting at Sasquatch, perhaps even danced under the Narwhal stage that I painted there.\u00a0 Maybe you are a regular at the Echo Echo Gallery in the Greenwood Collective, perhaps you really enjoy my writing at the Post Inteligencer Art and Culture Blogs or maybe you own an Xavier Lopez original--there are a lot of them out there!\u00a0 If I have ever brought you any joy or respite from your daily woes--please consider becoming one of my patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few of the things that your patronage will be instrumental in making happen:\u00a0 I am currently working on putting together my first big survey book of my art career and you will be helping with that.\u00a0 I am working on a graphic novel based on one of my most important characters named \"the Muse,\" which only patrons will be able to see as it progresses and will even have opportunities to purchase original artwork, see preview sketches and preview pages.\u00a0 One of my big goals is to start making large-scale public sculptures and that requires a lot of monetary outlay, but it would be a very exciting new turn in my career--one that you can be instrumental in making happen!\u00a0 I am also working on gathering my interviews and critical/theoretical writings together in a book, as well creating some smaller picture books of my paintings.\u00a0 Patrons will get first options to purchase new artwork, prints, stickers, t-shirts, etc., and will get behind the scenes views of what it is like being an artist in Seattle. When I interview an artist or go to the Seattle \"Artwalks\" you will be there and get access to some pretty neat art events!\u00a0 On a more personal level, your patronage will help me to pay rent for our art gallery, purchase paints and materials, and I will work very hard to find ways to repay your generosity!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
