    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! I\u2019m Xina ~ known online as Xinachu!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/BKJbiRqXo9o\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI fell in love with dancing at a young age, and\nafter stumbling across Kpop I started learning the choreographies in my bedroom\nwhenever I wasn\u2019t in class, and since 2015 I began to venture out onto the\nstreets of London to film dance covers. Originally a\nhobby, there is now nothing I love more than creating videos to entertain\npeople and hopefully brighten their days\na little with some Kpop fun! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut Xina, why do you need Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSomething you may not be aware of is\nthat 99.9% of my videos are copyrighted by Kpop entertainment\ncompanies, therefore I am unable to monetise my videos which means I cannot make any\nmoney from the content I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTherefore, during the past year to 18 months anything from hiring studios to film tutorials in, bringing on board people to work with on filming videos as I cannot film a lot of them alone, as well\nas travelling to shoot locations and conventions to host kpop dance games, perform and give you guys the\nopportunity to dance on stage \u2013 all this and more comes out of my own pocket. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhilst I wouldn\u2019t give it\nup for the world, between being a full-time student and the various part-time jobs I work to cover school fees, rent, and general all-round surviving \u2013 all whilst trying my hardest to keep uploading 1-2\nvideos a week\u00a0\u2013 I find myself with less and less time I can afford to spend learning dances, and as a\nresult am unable to film as many videos as I once could, even having to turn down convention\nopportunities because I simply cannot afford the travel. If I were to receive support from Patreon, these are difficulties that I would be able to overcome more easily and work towards a more frequent upload schedule with more crazy videos such as \u0027Pikachu dances Kpop in Public\u0027. No longer having to turn opportunities down I could also host more events for you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support me through Patreon, not only will you gain access to tons of exclusive content as well as various other rewards, but you will be helping me to bring on more talented people to work with on exciting projects, being able to spend more time working on more frequent videos and improving their quality as I learn new things (my housemate is teaching me the wonders of photoshop!), host more Kpop dance meet ups across the UK, and lastly, in my ventures to begin teaching dance classes in 2018. Even the smallest amount helps more than you\u2019d ever know, and my gratitude would be eternal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaranghae~\uc0ac\ub791\ud574\u003cbr\u003e\n\nXina ^-^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
