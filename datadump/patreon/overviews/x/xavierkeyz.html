     "about": "Xavier Keyz\u003cbr\u003e Burgeoning singer, songwriter and music producer Xavier Keyz has no intention of redefining R\u0026amp;B. On the contrary...: It is his passion for classic soul that continues to make the artist a standout among so many gimmick-ridden acts currently pervading the airwaves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e For those looking for proof in the number, Keyz\u2019 recently released melodic pop/R\u0026amp;B single \u201cClap\u201d has garnered more nearly 9,000 hits in under a week. Adding fuel to the fire, he is set to release his full-length album \u201cMonday Thru Sunday\u201d on\u00a0this Fall\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Born and raised in Chicago, Keyz (a.k.a. Cameron Frazier) began singing at age 2(!). He recalls, \u201cIt was Faith Evans\u2019 hit \u2018Soon As I Get Home.\u2019 I sang it out loud to my parents and friends and they all gave me this look of surprise. I was just learning to speak and yet I was delivering verses and choruses\u2026 and they were in tune!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom that point on, there was little doubt that music was destined to become the major force field in his life. He took to the piano as if he had played it all of his life\u2014playing any song by ear. And thus was born his lifetime moniker: Xavier Keyz.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Ever working to increase his talent, Xavier Keyz was in the right place at the right time, joining Chicago\u2019s Children\u2019s Choir, and then a cappella sextet the Harmony Brothers at Kenwood Academy during high school. They sang at basketball games and other local functions around Chicagoland area, hoping to make a name for themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e After downsizing to four members and then to two (as J2), Xavier Keyz and his partner released a full-length album, \u201cAnother Level\u201d in 2012. It was three months later when Xavier realized that his best shot at notoriety was as a solo artist. Meanwhile, he was wise enough to fortify his talent with college studies in Television Production and Communications at Kennedy King. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e But music remained Priority No. 1: Keyz\u2019 first official step into the solo music realm was single \u201cTrip To Mars\u201d in the fall of 2013, which was followed in February 2014, by love song \u201cNobody Else but You,\u201d a collaboration with songstress B.Lin. That became the game-changer for Keyz, creating massive buzz in the Midwest\u2014and then beyond\u2014including positive press on \u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FUSAToday.com%2F\u0026amp;h=OAQGGAY6U\u0026amp;s=1\"\u003eUSAToday.com\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fthisisrnb.com%2F\u0026amp;h=8AQE2ZTXz\u0026amp;s=1\"\u003ethisisrnb.com\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FYouknowyougotsoul.com%2F\u0026amp;h=cAQFMJ7mc\u0026amp;s=1\"\u003eYouknowyougotsoul.com.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI\u2019m the perfect example of someone that knows that if you believe in yourself and never allow your vision to be diminished by circumstances or the negativity of others, success will find you. I know I have what it takes to shine in a crowded field. It takes perseverance, of course, but this is where I belong. Next year by this time, I have a strong feeling that my name will be known!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e",
