I lead video and social growth, and host our inflight TV channel (#10) on Virgin America. Ongoing treatment for breast cancer, recovery from that treatment, and the process of developing an awesome life after the losses of cancer is challenging. I tweet my way through the news, appear weekly on KCRW\u0027s \"Press Play,\" and am grateful for your support. You allow me to do what I can, where I can, when I can, and be supported for that work by a supportive community of awesome patrons. That\u0027s you. So thank you."

     "description": "In late 2016, I underwent surgery for damage caused by long-term treatment for breast cancer. I was diagnosed on December 1, 2011, and inadvertently live-tweeted my diagnosis that day. Five years later, I\u0027m exploring in tweets, short form video art, and blog posts the strange depths of the series of medical and spiritual challenges that come with cancer. We should speak the truth about what women experience in health care, before we lose the access we have when Trump kills ACA. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps me work online and clear the residual personal financial wreckage that resulted from having cancer in America, pre-Obamacare. Even with ACA, having cancer in America is financially devastating if you\u0027re a freelance indie creative single working female who earns what she produces. For many of my fellows with cancer, the financial blow is irreversible within their lifetime. I\u0027m working with professional help to be the exception to that rule, so that my quality of life can be as awesome as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI continue ongoing cancer recurrence prevention treatment my life depends on one day at a time, and I want to continue being a creative person bringing something good into the world one day at a time. Thanks for helping me kick ass and focus on doing my part to be of service to you, my fellow humans\u2014 and to our beloved country. Love will prevail.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201c\u003cstrong\u003eDo what you can, with what you have, where you are\u003c/strong\u003e.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Theodore Roosevelt\u003cbr\u003e",
