    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h2\u003eHi! I\u0027m Will - 01010111 on the internet - and I am a game developer who uses HaxeFlixel to make games! My games have won several awards, and have been featured in a few festivals and conventions in a couple of different continents! Just a few years ago I had no idea how to make games, even though I\u0027ve wanted to for just about my entire life. I still feel like I have so much to learn, but when I think about where I used to be, I know I have a lot of knowledge, advice, tips, and tricks that I can share with people who are passionate about making games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHaxeFlixel\u003c/h2\u003eHaxeFlixel is an open source game development framework written in the Haxe language - basically it\u0027s a toolbox that makes it super easy to make games! You\u0027ll have to use programming, but it\u0027s all very straight-forward once you make the initial dive into learning it! I struggled with programming for decades, so I know how hard that first leap is, but I hope I can make it easy for you. I\u0027ve been a visual artist my whole life, a musician for almost two decades, and it wasn\u0027t until I started programming and making video games that I felt fulfilled as an artist - and it wasn\u0027t until I learned Flixel that programming made any sense to me. HaxeFlixel is maintained by a group of dedicated developers, and if you want to help them out, you can\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/haxeflixel\"\u003econtribute to their Patreon\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e"
