I have been diagnosed in 2014, but have had it since 2011, due to poor stress management and pressure from my A-Level days.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u0027ve been starting on a journey on learning and coming to terms with my mental illness -- and others besides -- and I wish to be an advocate for mental health as I continue to rediscover and redefine myself. Art is a way for me to heal, so I\u0027ve been making a lot of comics that deal with issues like mental health and the self. Besides that,\u00a0I just like making people happy \u0026amp; get them laughing, so my comics tend to all be on the light side, with a little snark and wit here and there. I think the world could use a little bit more laughter and color even when there\u0027s so many good funny stuff out there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(251, 213, 181);\"\u003eII. WHAT FOR?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis Patreon is basically just set up as a way for me to have a steady sort of income. Due to being mentally ill and constantly tired out now, I don\u0027t have the energy to go out and work proper. This is how I generate income now; if you like what you see on all my social media, do consider supporting me! You can support for as little as $1 a month -- a great bargain for both me and you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for pledging and supporting me! It means a lot to me and I cannot thank you enough!"
