    "summary": "Hi guys! Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to set this page up because i have received so much encouragement from you guys on how to pursue my dream...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is my dream?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, there are MANY dreams that I have, big and small. One of which is to have an impact on people who think they are forgotten about or looked down on. My ultimate goal is to encourage people to be themselves and step out of the monotonous routines and patterns that keep them stuck.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best way I know how to do that right now is to continue my writing (which I should have mentioned was one of the dreams. LOL) and to continue making my YouTube videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have to let you guys know, that YouTube for me had been far more than funny cats videos or reality show reviews. I have come across some of the most inspirational beings on this planet by just a random YouTube search. There are many speakers and \"life coaches\" online that I have had the chance to listen to and learn from. But I am also conscious of the fact that those voices are already spoken for. They have their targeted audiences. And I am more than certain that there are people who are from \"my world\" that just need to hear a voice that sounds like theirs to make impossible hopes and wishes begin to, at least, seem tangible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why the Patreon page? Where will these funds be going?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I make all my videos using either the camera on my iPhone or the webcam on my computer. I am very grateful to have even these resources, but as I continue to do these videos and other projects (like my regular show on Blab.im) it is evident to me that my\u00a0\u00a0equipment could definitely benefit from some upgrading.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso my lighting is horrible. Its not even something that I have spent a lot of time thinking about until very recently. Looking back at videos that are hard to see can cloud my messages. And obviously I don\u0027t want that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I need?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, with your help, I am looking to get Cannon T6i camera and a MacBook for editing, a ring light and the translucent white umbrella lights.\u00a0I can understand it if you\u0027re thinking that these are pretty lofty purchases but they are absolutely well worth the investment for what it is I\u0027m DESTINED to do...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am happy to keep you guys posted on my progress and would love for you to take this ride with me...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is just another chance for us to prove together to those who don\u0027t believe, that ANYTHING can be achieved as long as we declare that it can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks guys! Love and gratitude for your time... \u00a0:)"
