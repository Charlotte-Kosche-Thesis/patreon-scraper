    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Christopher Sebela. I\u0027m a writer. I\u0027ve written comics like the two-time Eisner nominated HIGH CRIMES as well as other creator-owned books like HEARTTHROB, DEAD LETTERS and WE(L)COME BACK. I\u0027ve also written stuff like KISS/VAMPIRELLA, INJUSTICE: GROUND ZERO, DEMONIC, SUICIDE SQUAD: MOST WANTED, ALIEN VS PREDATOR, GHOST and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and co-written stuff like CAPTAIN MARVEL, FANTASTIC FOUR and GREEN LANTERN/SPACE GHOST. I also write prose, most notably (to my horror) the non-fiction accounting of 30 days spent living in Tonopah, Nevada\u0027s Clown Motel called I LIVE IN A CLOWN MOTEL.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of my ideas are self-funded. Sometimes it\u0027s just paying for pitch pages, sometimes it\u0027s paying for the whole thing myself all the way through. This is where you theoretically come in. I have a few projects that getting this kind of seed money would help support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a book that is in progress that would be my follow-up to the Clown Motel book called YOU PAID FOR THIS SYSTEM that I\u0027ve been wanting to do for a decade or so. It\u0027s nonfiction. It\u0027s about conspiracies, one very specific and very real conspiracy that only me, the creator and handful of others were ever aware of. A conspiracy responsible for every awful thing that\u0027s ever happened in this world. Here\u0027s what some of the source material looks like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54b08553e4b08d0f48c0ae4a/54b251ffe4b070274a8979e4/58f5dd8537c58159357f3037/1492508047543/ao.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother\u00a0project is with Jonathan Brandon Sawyer, my co-creator on WE(L)COME BACK. If enough people become patrons and we raise $1500 a month, a big chunk of that will go towards funding a comic already in progress with Jonathan. 48 pages are already completed, we just need enough to pay Jonathan to do the other 112. And a colorist. It looks something like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54b08553e4b08d0f48c0ae4a/t/58f5db79be6594319f5f6f57/1492507518578/?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money would also pay for me to live and not die and work on that book. It would also go to help me make more comics via my imprint, Two Headed Press. Money is good, it makes many things possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut mostly this is an experiment to see what I can do with a platform like this and how I can give you exactly what it is you want to see. Some of the things I intend on giving back:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Full scripts I\u0027ve written with annotations.\u003cbr\u003e- Free comics/zines.\u003cbr\u003e- First looks at new books in the works.\u003cbr\u003e- Short stories.\u003cbr\u003e- Hi-res images from current design projects.\u003cbr\u003e- Hugs.\u003cbr\u003e- Phone calls with me. Prepare to be bored.\u003cbr\u003e- A sense of well-being.\u003cbr\u003e- Writing notes and process posts.\u003cbr\u003e- Rest-filled nights where you never have nightmares.\u003cbr\u003e- As to your Qs\u003cbr\u003e- Consultation on your scripts, etc.\u003cbr\u003e- You tell me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore and more I\u0027m interested in skipping around the middleman and just doing something because I want to do it, but that kinda stuff is usually long-term money that may never materialize. Having even just a smidgen of reader-driven funds to pursue my dumb ideas would go a long way to making even more dumb ideas possible."
