    "summary": "Hello everybody. I am Andrew Nenakhov, founder of Redsolution \u2014 company that created and maintained Xabber for so many years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all these years we\u0027ve been making Xabber in a totally free open-source way. No ads, no charges, no string attached. Seven years and more than 1 million downloads later,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xabber.android\"\u003eXabber\u003c/a\u003e is the most popular XMPP client for Android. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently we\u2019ve doubled our efforts and created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://web.xabber.com\"\u003eXabber for Web\u003c/a\u003e \u2014 a completely new web XMPP client, and it is insanely great. It is by far the best web XMPP client, and it\u2019s usability is second to none even among desktop clients. Try it now on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://web.xabber.com\"\u003eweb.xabber.com\u003c/a\u003e from your desktop browser:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.xabber.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.xabber.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.xabber.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.xabber.com/patreon/p_xabber_web.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, efforts such as these don\u2019t come cheap. Total costs of development and maintenance of Xabber exceed $150K. And in shrinking Russian economy we can no longer sustain those costs ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are now launching a Patreon campaign to help us fund further Xabber development. With enough resources, we\u2019ll be able to greatly improve existing Xabber versions and bring Xabber to many more platforms and provide a continuous chat experience everywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that  messaging should be built upon open standards and interoperability. If you share our dreams, join our Patreon campaign, and help us make these dreams happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOpen-source promise\u003c/h3\u003eWe\u2019ve always been strong supporters of open-source, using GNU/Linux, PostgreSQL, LibreOffice, GIMP, and many others. In a spirit of sharing we always felt the need to give back \u2014 so many of our software products were made open-source. Both versions of Xabber are licensed under GNU GPL license, and we promise that any work funded by community will also be free and open-source. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGoals\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$500\u003c/strong\u003e \u2014 our first goal is rather modest. It\u2019ll help us cover some costs of bug fixing and maintenance, but it would be hard to introduce any new features. Also, it would be a nice psychological milestone for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1000\u003c/strong\u003e \u2014 second one is half-way to go. One of our developers will be able to spend at least 50% of his time working on Xabber for Android. New features would be introduced from time to time, but at a reduced rate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$2000\u003c/strong\u003e \u2014 this is our first major milestone. At this rate, we\u2019ll be able to pay one developer to work on Xabber full time. With no side-projects to be distracted by, expect rapid pace of updates bringing new functionality every week or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$4000\u003c/strong\u003e \u2014 our second major milestone. We made a great stride by releasing a first version of Xabber for Web, even if we overstretched ourselves by doing it. Xabber for Web is great, but it still lacks many features like group chats, encryption, rich notifications, etc. Having enough funds for a dedicated web developer will allow us to add all of these and many more to web version too. We\u2019ve got to do a lot of catch-up work to do to make Xabber for Web match functionality of Android version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$6000\u003c/strong\u003e \u2014 our third and last big goal. iOS users over there suffer immensely on XMPP clients for that OS. We got to put an end to their suffering. With additional $2000 for an iOS developer we\u2019ll start working on Xabber for iOS. In a 6-9 months we\u2019ll be able to roll out an XMPP client for iOS that would not be abysmal to use. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat would happen if we manage to get more then $6000/month.. We have some ideas. Improve testing, work on translations more professionally, improve user support, start working on media features like audio and video calling, improving server features and so on. But we\u2019ll think of it later, maybe when we reach $4000/month goal."
