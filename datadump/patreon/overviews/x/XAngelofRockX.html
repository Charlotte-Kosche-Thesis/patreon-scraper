    "summary": "Hey everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Stefanie, and I\u0027m a \u003cstrong\u003eType 1 diabetic\u003c/strong\u003e, and have been for going on \u003cstrong\u003e5 years. I\u0027m here to Share my Story.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was first diagnosed at the age of \u003cstrong\u003e17\u003c/strong\u003e, while I was working a normal shift at my banquet hall. I felt faint, dizzy and had a lack of energy. I was almost unconscious. I was taken to the hospital immediately after fainting, and after a couple of days spent overnight in the hospital, I was told that I had unreasonably high sugars, and that I could potentially be diabetic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I was, and still am. I\u0027ve recently turned \u003cstrong\u003e21,\u003c/strong\u003e and finished school in Canada (where I live), and according to those situations, I am left without health insurance and I have to start paying for my insulin/pills. Again, unfortunately, my part-time job only pays minimum, and it\u0027s not enough for me to pay for bills, medicine and daily life, so I\u0027m barely able to live paycheque to paycheque.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking for some help to buy my insulin in bulk, as well as my pills, and my goal is \u003cstrong\u003e$300\u003c/strong\u003e to put towards that. That money would give me medicine until about March-April of 2016. Initially, I would love to have these funds as soon as I could, as I\u0027m on my last bunch of needles for the year, and need to restock ASAP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027ve been streaming on Twitch for almost 3 months now, Gears of War Ultimate Edition mostly, and I would also love to encourage anyone to come and see my streams, if they want something to watch when they\u0027re bored, and also, I feel like it would offer something for you, as donators, to be \u0027repaid\u0027 with, so to speak. It\u0027s a fun stream, and I\u0027ll always be doing it for the viewers. If you ever want to check it out, here\u0027s the link:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/xangelofrockx\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitch.tv/xangelofrockx\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was an urgent call, and I never, EVER, ask for donations, but it\u0027s come to the point where I don\u0027t want to risk getting even more sick than I already am. If I could raise just \u003cstrong\u003e$300\u003c/strong\u003e, I would be incredibly grateful, and you would be helping me to become healthy again. It\u0027s a pain in the ass to pay for medicine over here when there\u0027s no insurance, and it\u0027s a rough time for me at the moment. I\u0027d appreciate any sort of donation, because even small ones add up eventually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, if you\u0027re reading this, help a girl out. It\u0027s been \u003cstrong\u003e4.5\u003c/strong\u003e long years of this disease, and I just want to avoid any negative side effects that not taking my medicine would cause. I love life, and I want to be able to live it for as long as I can, enjoying every moment as it goes by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone, for taking the time to hear my cry for help, and any words or kind acts are extremely appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you, from my heart to yours.\u003c/strong\u003e"
