Oh, and glitter. Glitter is also my job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in the magical world where cosplay and burlesque meet, also known as nerdlesque. I create a TON of cosplays every year\u2014 at least 2 per month, on average\u2014and I do a lot of photoshoots, but I\u0027m perhaps best known as the Founder, Artistic Director, and all-around Head Bitch in Charge at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thesocietyofsin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Society of Sin Burlesque \u0026amp; Variety\u003c/a\u003e, a production company dedicated to creating the sexiest, nerdiest live shows imaginable. Our most popular events are our \"live-action fan fiction\" shows\u2014burlesque plays that parody our favorite TV shows, comic book series, movies, etc., and that have stripteases interwoven with the plot.

You\u0027re not paying for my lifestyle (though it is a glamorous one that involves a lot of sitting on my couch in Batman pajamas gluing rhinestones to things and marathoning Star Trek while high on e6000 fumes); you\u0027re paying for the materials, equipment, talent and labor I use to create kickass nerdlesque shows and giving me the ability to try out new ways to reach people with my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support allows me to create bigger, better, sparklier shows, more breathtaking costumes and extravagant props and set pieces, to help feed NOLA\u0027s bevy of hot, nerdy, amazingly talented, starving artists, and to spread the art of risqu\u00e9 entertainment around the world. It\u0027s a pretty dope thing to be a part of, I assure you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hNwnwA2.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can even already see some pretty awesome improvements in our shows since I\u0027ve started Patreon, like the fact that we can actually pay a videographer to capture all of our big shows on film now, this awesome Disney castle we had made for our \"Once Upon a Tease\" show and the badass throne we got to use for \"A Thong of Fire \u0026amp; Ice\" (also pictured: me dressed as Arya Stark doing some stripper acrobatics for the winner of the show\u0027s raffle). Patrons like you helped make that possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vOHSUXc.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows fans to support creative works with recurring monthly payments in exchange for exclusive content and rewards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon is run on a monthly basis, meaning that your pledge will be charged in the first couple days of every month, and you will receive rewards monthly. For example, if you sign up on April 18, you\u0027ll be charged around May 1 and start getting your rewards at the beginning of May. Different pledge levels receive different rewards (check out the different reward tiers at the right of the page to figure out which one is best for you).\u00a0If there\u0027s a reward that you don\u0027t see listed that you\u0027d like me to consider adding, don\u0027t be afraid to ask! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/c0axDOM.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTypically, I produce 1-3 big pop culture-themed shows every month (like \"One Tease To Rule Them All: A Lord of the Rings Burlesque Show\" or \"Harry Potter \u0026amp; the Bedchamber of Secrets: A Burlesque Play\"). For me, this means writing the show (if it\u0027s a play writing a script or writing jokes for it if I\u0027m hosting), finding the right cast and crew to perform in the show, run lights/sound, run door, stage manage, build a set, film it, etc., creating all of the promotional material and putting them out into the world irl and online, usually creating 1-2 new costumes per show for myself (and usually spending time helping other cast members with theirs), choreographing new routines, coordinating/managing rehearsals, taking behind-the-scenes pics and videos, working with the venue, dealing with ticketing, organizing photoshoots, performing in the show, making sure things are running smoothly the night of and everyone\u0027s having a great time, and eventually paying everyone who was a part of the show and thanking them for their work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also produce a weekly nerdlesque revue, \"Talk Nerdy To Me\" every Saturday at 7p at The Dragon\u0027s Den (435 Esplanade Ave., NOLA) and a monthly fetish-inspired show, \"Stripped Into Submission,\" at the Hi-Ho Lounge (2239 St. Claude Ave., NOLA), which aren\u0027t as high-maintenance as the big shows but are still a good amount of work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the stuff on this page will be focusing on the big shows, though, since that\u0027s what most of my time goes toward. You\u0027ll get to see a lot of my costume construction progress, help me choose new characters to cosplay/create nerdlesque acts for and what show themes to pursue, and be the first to know about stuff I\u0027m planning for The Society of Sin. However, even if you\u0027re not local to New Orleans and never make it out to see one of my live shows, I want to provide plenty of photos, videos, and content for you to interact with to keep you entertained.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough a lot of my content will stem from my live productions, I also do a lot of modelling and will share stuff from those shoots here that I may not share other places (or you\u0027ll at least be likely to see it first). I\u0027m also getting into vlogging and getting back into sketch comedy and will post things from that from time-to-time. I\u0027m dipping my toes in the water of photography, also. I started just playing with an Instax Mini and liked that so much that I bought a Holga, a Polaroid 600, and a DSLR that I use to photograph performers, models, and for self-portraits. You\u0027ll probably be seeing a lot of that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JOonap8.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do a lot of boudoir shoots, and obviously, since my shows involve the art of the striptease, a lot of my content could definitely be considered risqu\u00e9, but I try to keep it pretty tasteful. I don\u0027t really do full nudity and try to stay away from doing sex appeal just for the sake of sex appeal without some greater significance or tie-in to something I\u0027m passionate about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/9jy50K1.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting the naked, nerdy, sparkly arts! Your support means the world to me! We\u0027re going to make some damn cool things happen together!\u003cbr\u003eXOXO,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eXena\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
