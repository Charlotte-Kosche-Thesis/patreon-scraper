Each show we are creating is unique to what we know, what we do, and follows subjects our audience is interested to\u00a0hear more about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFantastic Journeys\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main attraction, for now, is the show \"\u003cem\u003eJerry and Kathy\u0027s Fantastic Journey\u003c/em\u003e\". This series covers 20 years of their life as they traveled around the\u00a0world, through the Amazon Jungle and Andes Mountains looking for forgotten places, lost cities, and forbidden knowledge. During this series, Kathy and Jerry tell their story together, sometimes with archived (never seen before) video, and always the photos that few outside their small circle of family\u00a0and friends have had access to. These stories are the adventure of their lives. Each episode is filled with details about good times and bad times. What they lost and what was found. You hear about their feelings and emotions, what they saw, and the amazing discoveries that were made! Nothing is left out or glossed over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Cafe at the End of the Universe (1 broadcast per month)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the second series planned, Jerry invites guests once a month to address subjects covering spirituality, science, health and wellness. You never know who might show up at The Caf\u00e9! Additionally, Jerry also offers a \"Private Open Lines\" broadcast each month for his Patreon supporters. This is a private broadcast for our supporters only. Call in, ask\u00a0questions and get advice from someone most people consider to be one of the worlds best energy healers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Jerry Wills Show (1 broadcast per month)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third series is a talk show where Jerry and Kathy conduct interviews with leading authors, paranormal investigators, UFO researchers, and well... Just about any subject our audience finds interesting. Our patrons will be provided a private line to call in the questions and comments. Patron calls will be answered first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLIVE Updates From The Road!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a few adventures planned which take up around the US and to other countries. During these trips, our supporters will be the ones to have first access to photos, trip logs, or details. Sure, we will post a few things as we travel, but our supporters get the really neat stuff. Like what? Well, for example, as our patron you will have access to our SPOT GPS Tracking map! You can follow every step on Google Earth, complete with pins on that map as we move from location to location! What else? Videos made at these locations created only for our patrons : )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe have a few ideas for other incentives.\u003c/em\u003e As a patron, you will be alerted what these are and how YOU can access them. As you know.. Kathy and I love to have a great time and are always thinking of how to give back to our supporters. You won\u0027t be disappointed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a patron, what will the funds be used for? Great question!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur patrons help us afford the costs of equipment, upgrades when needed, internet fees, and items required for our broadcasts. Plus, we want to broadcast during our time exploring! This requires costly equipment and satellite fees we cannot afford right now. We have always wanted to offer a LIVE broadcast from a lost city, atop a remote mountaintop, or deep in the jungle. Your patronage helps us reach this goal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s easy... Instead of charging per show or a set amount for a monthly membership we have decided to use Patreon. This way you can decide what level of support you can afford, and you will receive a perk at the level you have chosen! Take a look at the perk levels and find one that best suits your budget! \u003cem\u003eYou can always increase to the next level if you decide to!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know you have enjoyed our\u00a0past broadcasts and adventure videos at Xpeditions TV.
