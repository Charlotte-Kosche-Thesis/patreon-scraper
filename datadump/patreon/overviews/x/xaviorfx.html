As a poet, spoken word artist, \nsinger, songwriter, drummer, visual artist (VJ), model, artistic \nconceptualist, and DP he is rarely without a creative outlet. Although \nhe is passionate about all these things, his motives reside within the \npossibilities of change for the greater good. The actualized dream of \nsolution driven cooperation among diverse groups is the priceless work \nthat he is devoted to co-creating. Change is the art of the \nrevolutionist.
