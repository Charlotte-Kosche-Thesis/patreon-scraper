(and cosplay, but who cares about that!) i\u0027ve been writing for the past 16 years. and when i started, like everyone starting a hobby, i sucked eggs at it. it\u0027s been many years of reading various authors, various types of fiction and honing my skills with different personalities that i\u0027m here today (and the past... 10 years worth of todays) writing fanfiction and - drumroll please - my very own fantasy/sci-fi novel! yay! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei\u0027ll try and tl;dr a story of how i got here. here goes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewhen i was 11 years old (a long time ago...) my very first experience with the internet ever was looking up help with legend of zelda: majora\u0027s mask. this was before gamefaqs existed and \u0027just google it\u0027 wasn\u0027t a thing (i told you, i\u0027m old lol) so i found a website that was like akin to an angelfire website that offered a walkthrough for MM and OoT. it also offered a CHAT ROOM to ask people for help. well, i stopped into the chat one day and didn\u0027t leave for like. 3 years. in those three years i learned how to role play, and from that i learned how to write short stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewhich is cool in and of itself, but the coolest part is i met a guy - i\u0027ll never forget him - anthony cirilla, who would send me chapters of this story he was writing for proofreading and such. i own his first book now. the stuff he sent me to read when i was 12 and 13! it inspired me then, and it inspired me now to become more familiar with creative writing and master it. i\u0027m not quite there yet, but the more i write fanfics and original fiction the closer i get.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...okay that was a bad tl;dr but you\u0027re still here, so ha!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eapart from that sometimes i just need motivation to get through things, be it a surge or energy or the reassurance that people actually like my writing! (who doesn\u0027t need a boost every once in a while?) so i\u0027m hoping this little patreon might help with that, but please - you\u0027re under no obligation whatsoever. i mainly just want people to enjoy what i do!\u003cbr\u003e"
