The community that we have formed together on my YouTube channel is amazing and something I am proud to be part of each day!\u003cbr\u003eIt has been over a year since I started making YouTube content, and I have enjoyed every minute of it. I have come to a point in my life where I believe I can, and would like to try and make this my full-time job. I truly believe that is possible with a little bit of help from you guys, and I can see it being a huge win-win for both of us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003ePatronage\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eYour generous support goes 100% towards getting things to a point to do this full time and keeping it that way. I have an awesome schedule in mind for full-time content once we reach that point. I have many great things in mind, such as \u003cstrong\u003especialized Factorio/Game guides\u003c/strong\u003e, a \u003cstrong\u003ededicated website for the channel\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ereal life game-inspired model building\u003c/strong\u003e, and more! This is only possible because of the generosity of our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eThe Leap\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eStarting the end of this December, I will have a very big choice to make. Go job hunting (won\u0027t have my current one due to them shutting down), or take a bit of leap to make this my full time job. What are the results of these two paths?\u003cbr\u003eIf I have to go job-hunting and get another job locally than the content will probably dramatically decrease/change due to time constraints (my current job is extremely flexible which allows me to make content as I do now). Having the ability to do this as my full-time job will not only increase YouTube / Stream content, it will open up many more doors for other projects, some of which are mentioned in the above section.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eThank You\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eTruly, I can\u0027t express my thanks enough for any support you guys provide. This amazing community is the reason I can even have the possibility of purseuing this dream.\u003cbr\u003eYou all have made this last year one of the best in my life. I hope to have many more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
