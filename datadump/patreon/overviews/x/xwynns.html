    "summary": "Hi, my name is Xavier and I make gaming videos on Youtube. I don\u0027t just make gaming videos though, I make a \u003cem\u003eLOT\u003c/em\u003e of gaming videos and I make them with enthusiasm! You see, I love gaming and I always have. I love it so much that I\u0027ve volunteered literally thousands and thousands of hours of my life to making games better, most notably Long War and Civilization. I also love to share my enthusiasm for gaming, which I do via Youtube even though it takes a lot of time to produce so many videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to make even more gaming videos and make them all the time. Presumably you want to watch said videos and that\u0027s how you found your way to this site? So let\u0027s make a trade! I\u0027ll give you all of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHours of entertaining gaming videos nearly every single day!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEducational or informative videos, because I know lots of gaming things!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFond memories of characters who died too soon while trying to make a name for themselves!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEmergent narrative up the proverbial wazoo! My channel has bromances, fel plots, heroes and villains, intrigue and mystery, and more!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ll continue to help develop future games that maybe you\u0027ll waste lots of hours playing!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExposure to new words or new ways of saying old words! You\u0027ll be the envy of all your friends when you impress them with your new vocabulary!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEnglish Grammar lessons provided via public Youtube comments!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHeartbreak! Isn\u0027t it really awesome when your heart is NOT being broken? Yeah? You only know that because it was broken in the past though, so I promise to make sure you enjoy all the times I\u0027m not breaking your heart when I\u0027m not getting your favorite characters killed... by getting your favorite characters killed sometimes. BUT ONLY SOMETIMES*. *maybe\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFamily. I promise to care about all the virtual doofers you guys send me to include in games, like they were my own family*! How many Let\u0027s Players actually care about their characters? HRM?!? (*except the ones I don\u0027t like or who don\u0027t impress me or I grow bored of, just like my real family.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave you ever wondered how awesome it would be to sit around all day, every day, playing video games? Wonder no more as you can experience it first hand by living vicariously through me!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand much, much MORE, probably!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return I only ask for one thing from you! Think about that!! I\u0027m giving you at least 10 things, plus MORE things, probably, and all I want from you is one thing! That\u0027s a 10:1 ratio in your favor! Deal of a lifetime I say! Of course the one thing I want is your support here on Patreon so I can focus on making videos full time without either my videos suffering because of work or my work suffering because I\u0027m making videos. I want my work to be my videos and you can help me make that a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I do and want to see more, you can make that happen by pledging to one of the tiers on the side of the screen. There\u0027s even some token rewards and incentives in it for you! Assuming you count your virtual pawns being murdered before your very eyes as incentive...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all of that hasn\u0027t convinced you yet, here is a picture of me with one of my cats: 3dot (the prettiest one!) Surely no one can resist giving money to someone who posts a cat pic?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AVj53qM.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you pledged yet? LOOK HOW CUTE 3dot IS!! How could you still be resisting? Is that even possible? FINE, I\u0027ll give you one more but if you look then you have to pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/phPWtOZ.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/phPWtOZ\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3dot is the pretty one on the left (obviously), Nodot is the scraggle one on the right. I bet you can\u0027t guess why they are named that? I mean... super secrets and all! Now \u003cem\u003eplease\u003c/em\u003e go pledge so that I can get back to more dignified matters like playing videos games all day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to everyone for your amazing support!\u003cbr\u003e"
