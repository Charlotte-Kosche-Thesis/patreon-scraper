It\u0027s\n expected to be there, but its not that important.\" I disagree on both fronts. \nCaptivity is a game I want to make with huge focus on proper gameplay, \nstory and porn. If it sounds too ambitious, it is. If it sounds \nincredibly unnecessary when I could just simply make a game without porn or \njust porn without gameplay, read the opening sentence again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn\n Captivity, you take on the role of either a man or a woman who due to a\n mysterious incident, find yourself trapped inside the game world of an \nMMORPG named \"DragonSong.\" Shortly after stepping foot in an abandoned \nhouse, the male avatar that hosts your conscious, turns into a female \none. With no way to return to the real world or your male character, \nwhat will you do to survive in this new world you found yourself in? In \norder to survive in this world filled with many NPCs and players with \nvarying personalities, money is required. How far will you go to gain \nmore dominion? By doing honest jobs? Maybe by killing monsters and \nselling their loot? What about friendships and alliances? Find love? \nPerhaps some other form of \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e? But most importantly... How will\n you escape captivity? Captivity aims to deliver an experience you never\n thought a hentai game could.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGameplay \u0026amp; Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eEven\n though I\u0027m \"marketing\" Captivity as a \"hentai game,\" it\u0027s not purely \nabout the porn and the sex. Mechanics and features will be put in place \nto make it a \"proper\" game. Many of the gameplay mechanics is largely \ninspired by the Rune Factory and Harvest Moon series. As such, you will \nfind yourself spending most of your time in Estal City, running around \nand talking to people constantly. Politics will be involved (albeit \nnothing close to real life\u0027s), and you\u0027ll play a part in it. Exploration\n and combat is also a big part of the game. That being said, the meat of\n the game is focused in Estal City, so the exploration part of the game \nwill be developed slowly. The game will also have sim like features to \nfurther the point that you are indeed \"living\" in a foreign video game \nworld. Hunger and sleep will take the form of buffs and debuffs, and is \ndesigned to be as unobstrusive as possible. Hunger and sleep is easily \nsatisfied by simply visiting your house and interacting with people and \nobjects. Should you choose to not return to your house for whatever \nreason, there are other means of satisfying these needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eH-Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMany\n of the h-events is accessed by talking to certain people, quests and \nevents. There are many types or genres/tags/fetishes of h-events, and is\n designed to satisfy as many people as possible without breaking the \nlaw. That means you won\u0027t be finding loli and shota content. (Also no \nguro/gore or obscure fetishes like eyeball lickings) Your inhibition and\n lust \nlevel is the main factor of how you unlock said h-events. Both \ninhibition and lust caps out at 100 (max) and goes as low as 0 (min). \nThe lower your \ninhibition is, the more the depraved stuff you can do, while lust is \nyour\n secondary factor that governs whether you will be able to access many \nof these h-events. Inhibition is mostly a \"fixed\" meter (until choosing a\n certain dialogue option to change it), and lust will continuously \nincrease until you relieve yourself some form or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent state\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe\n game is currently in pre v0.1.0.

This means that many things right now in the game \nis subjected to change. So even if you\u0027re not throwing money at me, \nsimply playing the game and providing feedback is highly appreciated.
