    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXil Studios is teeny tiny studio in the middle of no-where upstate NY (as in no where near NYC).  Originally working with photos I have branched into video work and find doing weird things for strange people to be quite fun.  I am not nearly as polished as the other channels out there, I am self taught.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat?\u003cbr\u003eNew Stuff!:\u003cbr\u003eImages:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAfter failing to get actors for videos and few other issues I decided to change things around a bit.\u003cbr\u003eI have a ton images in archives, stuff I shot for projects I just did not use for whatever reason.\u003cbr\u003egigabytes of them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I am going to release them in sets of 20 to 30 images every week.\u00a0\u00a0 Shots for morphing, already against a green or white screen.\u00a0 Use them for your own projects!\u003cbr\u003eAs things progress I will hire and shoot models for the express purpose of them be manipulated by Patrons.\u003cbr\u003eAs it stands I have months with content to slowly release for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideos:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make videos, all sorts of weird videos.  Most of what my channel has posted currently is short \u201ctests\u201d.  I am done with testing!  The idea is create 1 or 2 shorts per month.  \u003cbr\u003eHow to Series:\u003cbr\u003eI am working on a series of videos on the How To of making special effect based videos for Clips, this has obvious use for the production of fetish clips.\u00a0 These will be released in support of my ebook.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eShorts:\u003cbr\u003eThese shorts will be all sorts of subjects, I have a notebooks and binders with over 200 ideas ready to go once I find the right actors.  These cover things like sci-fi, fantasy, horror, comedy and the surreal.  And of course mixtures of those ideas.  Short youtube series will also be posted, consider them pilots for larger works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuite simply\u2026. I pay people to work on these videos.  No one is working for free.  Actors, Actresses, makeup people, locations, and all sorts of help, they all get paid.  Not much mind you, just a little.  But everyone should get something.  That is where the money goes, right into the budget of shooting the shorts.  If we hit large enough levels then the money goes to a studio rent as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards are listed below.\u00a0\u00a0 I cannot edit the side bar as there are active patrons. \u003cbr\u003e$1\u00a0 Access to the BTS, behind the scenes, I will post what is upcoming and listen to suggestions for new topics, shorts and pose sets.\u00a0 I will also throw some images and videos in once in awhile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$3 Images:\u00a0 I will be releasing 20 to 30 images, raw images for you to play with.\u00a0\u00a0 Every week.\u00a0 (Starting 3/19)\u00a0\u00a0 This level gets you access to those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5 Video:\u00a0 At this level you get the videos about a week early, you also get alternate takes and non-OK for youtube stuff (that is... nudity and such).\u00a0\u00a0 There will also be effects break down posts for shorts and more details and examples for the how to series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo one should be putting in more than $5 a month!\u003cbr\u003e"
