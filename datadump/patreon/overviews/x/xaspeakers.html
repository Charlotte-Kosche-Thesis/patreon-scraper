We mainly host talks from Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon Family Groups as well as from Narcotics Anonymous, though we welcome any talk from a 12-step fellowship.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site was established in late 2001, and we have been operating continuously for over one and a half decades. To date we have more than 2,600 recordings in our database in various categories. In the last year alone we have been visited by over 200,000 different users, generating more than 6,000,000 hits; each month the site consumes at least 2 terabytes of traffic. We have served more than 12,000,000 downloads since the site was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are launching this Patreon page in order to help others to help us continue this valuable 12-Step work. With our growing user base we need more resources just to \u0027keep the lights on\u0027. We also hope to add new features that our users have requested time and again over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are working to modernize the site so that we can add the following upgrades:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePodcast support, to make it easier to use the site on a mobile phone\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeb-based upload, to streamline adding new recordings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpdated security, to guard against increasingly sophisticated hacking attempts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA very cool secret feature that we hope everybody will love and use (on\u0027t worry; you\u0027ll see it when we add it)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThese goals are within reach, but we need resources to achieve them. You can help. By becoming a patron, even if it is only for a dollar a month, you can help us finish the job. If everyone who visited our site in the last 30 days donated one dollar we would cover our most ambitious fundraising needs for the next four months.

Please read on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur history begins well over a decade ago...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLate 2001 - Launched. Ran in a shared environment, with no hosting fees. Ran what was then the latest version of a PHP script called paFileDB.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJanuary 2002 - Bought the domain name, \u003ca href=\"http://www.xa-speakers.org./\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.xa-speakers.org.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2002 - Site became too large to run in a shared environment, so we bought an old server and got free internet access, which lasted until the traffic got so heavy we couldn\u0027t stay there for free.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly 2003 - Began curating all submissions, listening to each talk before posting it to the page to ensure audio quality and usefulness to recovery.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 2004 - Added news feed, FAQ and contact buttons. Updated the paFileDB script to the latest version (released in 2002) and, given the vintage script, modernized the look and feel of the site as much as was possible.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJuly 2004 - Began accepting PayPal donations. Despite concerns about being perceived as a commercial entity, some income was required to cover hosting and other expenses.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 2006 - Due to consistent hardware failures with the older server we bought a new server using the PayPal donations\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSummer of 2006 - Started, but did not complete, work on a new version of the site. Considered what we needed, what open source projects we could use, and what functionality needed to be written from scratch. This was much more difficult than it is today, as web developers\u2019 idea of \u0027a site\u0027 was pretty much only what you get out of the box today with Joomla/WordPress. We paid a developer in the UK to create a new page, but couldn\u0027t use what they created.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSummer of 2007 - Bought new server hardware as we simply outgrew the old one. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLate 2009 - Found a web developer to write the new version of the site who asked all the right questions; he actually stepped on the brakes and refused to keep on adding features without getting the full picture of what we wanted. This we did and it is still ongoing. We did some very cool proof of concept features that we hope to make work in the web framework we\u0027re currently using for the new site. Sadly, our ace developer had less time to contribute to the project to to competing responsibilities. Further development halted, even as site planning continues.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2015 - Yet another server move. This time a bit more permanent. Restructured the back-end to prepare for distributed hosting of the MP3 files.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSummer of 2016 - \u00a0A legal entity was created for the site in Iceland and the name and rights to the site were transferred to it. The entity\u2019s charter requireds it to be both non-commercial and non-profit. Further, our web developer \u0027hardened\u0027 the vintage script so that it isn\u0027t prey to SQL hacks, which were starting to require daily interventions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFall of 2016 - Created a proof-of-concept of the site in Wordpress. The proof-of-concept does allow for web upload and \u2018tagging\u2019 of the recordings, so tags can be altered without downloading and re-uploading files.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is currently being done on a shoestring budget. Costs are currently around 125USD/month, excluding what we pay the developer to develop the site. We get a lot of traffic, but we\u2019ve never had any ads or outside links to cover the costs. PayPal funds have been used when possible; team members have used their own credit cards when not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve received a lot of email over the years asking for increased functionality. This hasn\u2019t been possible, because of the old script. But we would very much like to address some issues as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe software that powers the site hasn\u0027t been updated since 2002. Among other problems, the software:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003edoesn\u0027t support podcasting. Mobile phones just play the recording in the browser window\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edoesn\u0027t differentiate between streaming and actual downloads. When you click the download button on a computer, it plays the recording in the browser window rather than downloading it to disk. This was necessary to allow files to play on mobile devices\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edoesn\u0027t work properly with Firefox\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edoesn\u0027t allow for web-upload without also publishing the file, which prevents moderation\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edoesn\u0027t \u0027tag\u0027 the recording with the correct \u0027ID3 information\u0027 (the text you see when you play the recording in simply an MP3 player)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edoesn\u0027t support a tag cloud, only categories. This has led to a few Al-anon talks being placed in the AA category. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edoesn\u0027t allow for self-registration of accounts for uploading\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have also seen much criticism for not updating the site often enough. The reason is simple. The site\u0027s antiquated script makes all updates \u2013 deven small routine ones \u2013 very labor intensive. To better illustrate how complicated the current process is, here are the gory details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf someone wants to upload a recording from his local speaker-meeting to the site, the process is as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe uploader contacts us via the website\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThey get a boilerplate reply with the FTP server\u0027s address, assuming they typed their email address correctly\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThey must download a \"real FTP client\" like Cyberduck (they can\u2019t go through their web browser)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThey log into the FTP server and read the ABOUT_UPLOADING.TXT document\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThey prepare the MP3 files according to the instructions and log into the FTP server with a username and password they get by following the directions in the TXT document\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThey upload the recording and a text document with the factual information they prepared in step 5\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThey send an email with the name of the recording to the address specified in the ABOUT_UPLOADING.TXT document\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s a lot of work. Meanwhile, on our end:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe get an email about a new file having been uploaded\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe fileadmin downloads the file to his computer and opens it in iTunes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe fileadmin puts the factual information from the text file into the recording\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf information is missing (assuming the uploader has actually sent any information to begin with), the fileadmin contacts the uploader for the information\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThey wait for a reply; if no answer is forthcoming, the fileadmin then starts scouring the net for the information\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe fileadmin uploads the recording to the auditing area and sends a link to the recording to the team in 1-3 different bitrates (levels of quality)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe team members vote \u0027approved\u0027, \u0027rejected\u0027 or \u0027pass\u0027 and comment on the audio quality and whether the description fits the talk or not\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe fileadmin tallies the votes and either deletes the files or publishes it to the website, copying the contents of the MP3 files Comments field into the description field in the webserver\u0027s database \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there is something wrong with the the text describing the talk:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe fileadmin then downloads the files again\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eopens them in iTunes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emakes the changes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ere-uploads the files\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith 3000+ files to keep track of, this has been quite labor intensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all the more reason why we want to fully modernize the site from the ground up. With a new site architecture we will build in the following upgrades:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdding web-upload, web-audit and web-tagging of the recordings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdding support for podcasting. The majority of our visitors use a mobile phone; we really should give them the ability to listen to the recordings in a podcast format\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdding greater flexibility in the categorization of recordings (no more Al-anon talks in the AA category)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHaving intelligent management of multiple-bitrate files (the site\u2019s visitors shouldn\u2019t have to figure out what bitrate they want every time they download something)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHaving an intelligent web-based upload. FTP is neither user-friendly nor modern. It makes it more likely we have to delete files for being mislabeled or corrupted. We need to see who has submitted files in case we need to contact them for file informaiton, and we\u2019d like to provide status notifications to uploaders as files go through the approval process\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHaving the ability to purchase a CD of the talk directly from participating tapers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd much much more. We have more than 100 features, big and small planned!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be able to accomplish this we need your help. We may have gotten the art of keeping costs down to a fine art, but we need to pay the developers to finish the site."
