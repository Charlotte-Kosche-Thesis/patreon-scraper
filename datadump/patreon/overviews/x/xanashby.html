It goes as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eYoung Ophilia has lived alone since she was but a child, on the edge of a small town. With no one to care for her, she has had to heavily rely on her skills as an alchemist, the ability to use magic to create medicine, to make ends meet. But Ophilia isn\u0027t just an Alchemist, she\u0027s a Monk; born with strong innate magical abilities, she is highly feared by the townspeople.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen young Ophilia is finally old enough to claim her small trove of family heirlooms from the Village Council, she plans to leave, but only days before setting out, a dragon residing nearby is gravely injured. When Ophilia attempts to use her magic to heal the dying beast, their energies become connected, turning the fearsome creature into a human.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Separating the two will not be so easy. With every passing day, the Dragon\u0027s energy is absorbed by Ophilia, until the fateful day when the great creature falls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith little to go on, the two begin a journey through the country of Aridsvel, where their desire to find out the history of the dragons, will lead them to new friends, new monsters, and one nation repeating a tragic history.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already have a publishing company lined up, so these funds will directly go towards paying for that publishing company, all the advertising that I will be doing, and sustaining this career so I can write consistently for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you are aware of what I am currently working on, I\u0027m working on the first manuscript of the story, as well as several short stories to be released prior to the novel. With the release of these short stories come opportunities for you to be the first to read them!! But I\u0027ll need your help.\u003cbr\u003e"
