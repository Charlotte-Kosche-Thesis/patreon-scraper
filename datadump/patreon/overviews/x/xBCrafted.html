Now that I have been doing it for a while, I love it even more. I started making videos not expecting anything to really come of it. But, the more I did it, the more I realized there are people that actually enjoy watching what I enjoy doing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have met and talked with some truly amazing people during my time on Youtube.\u00a0 Being invited to be part of the \"HermitCraft\" Minecraft server group and \"Pooping Evolved\" ARK: Survival Evolved group. This is a wild and crazy ride, that I hope never ends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my favorite things about being a \"content creator\" on Youtube, is the interaction with the fans. And, I think the fans enjoy it too. As it stands right now, I make a conscious effort to reply to, and interact with, every single person that takes the time to comment on something I have done. I understand that as I get bigger I wont be able to reply to everyone.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could say things like: \"I am the best \u0026amp; funniest let\u0027s player ever!!\" or \"I am the greatest Youtuber of all time!\". But, if I am known for anything, its for being honest with my fans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo I think I am the greatest? No.\u003cbr\u003eDo I think I am funny? At times.\u003cbr\u003eDo I think I am entertaining? I strive to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I am not one to ramble on about myself to try and convince you that I \"deserve\" your support, I will let you decide that for yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(Any content i create is, and will always be, 100% free.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is not a \"Pay to see this video!\" thing.\u003c/strong\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
