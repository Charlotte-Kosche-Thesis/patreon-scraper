In this our tenth year, we want to expand with the resources to bring you more ideas, more dialogue. We\u0027d love to add video, simulcasting so listeners can participate in the show. We want to add the ability to add more shows per month (right now we are limited to 1 show because of bandwidth), and develop an app for Android and iOS that not only lets you listen to the show, but also has exclusive content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge to support the show, you are part of a special group of Brothers...Executive Producers. Our Executive Producers are brothers who want more light, who look forward not backward, who want to see the Craft engaging and relevant in the 21st century, and are willing to roll up their sleeves and build.\u00a0"

     "about": "Eric Diamond has been a Freemason since 1999 and is a Past Master his lodge, Oriental Lodge No.33 where he is currently going through the chairs. He is a 32\u00ba Scottish Rite Mason and has participated and directed several degrees in the Scottish Rite. He is a Past Presiding in the York Rite in both Chapter and Council and is a member of Lux ex Oriente Council No. 379 Allied Masonic Degrees. He is proud to be a Founding Fellow of the Masonic Society.\u003cbr\u003eWhile he finds Masonic history interesting (and has done primary historical research on his lodge), his real interest is in social research, exploring the issues and tools that will help revitalize Masonry in the 21st century. Masonry has something to give to society and it is needed now more than ever: not as a collection of pleasant social supper clubs but as a transformative influence on the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAbout the Show\u003c/h3\u003eThe purpose of X-Oriente is to help unite Masons who feel that Masonry should be more than just a nice meal with friends. It is a 20-40 minute Podcast that revolves around ideas that might be of interest to Freemasons, exploring the whys and wherefores of Masonry.\u003cbr\u003eEach show will explore an idea or topic. Sometimes the topics will extend from Masonic practice into civics, philosophy, social sciences, literature and art. X-Oriente also is a passionate advocate for critical thinking skills. We\u2019ll never stop asking why, and we\u2019ll always look for evidence to back up our assertions.\u003cbr\u003eFinally, X-Oriente is a community. We welcome constructive criticism and feedback both written and audio. If you would like to contribute to the show, do a segment or just weigh in, please contact us. Your communication is why I\u2019m doing this.\u003cbr\u003eFiat Vox!\u003cbr\u003e",
