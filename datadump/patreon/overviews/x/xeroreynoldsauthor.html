     "about": "Xero Reynolds wears many hats. Writer, Voice actor, Illustrator, Musician. He also wears many regular hats, but that might be simply an overindulgence of haberdashery. Xero was born in the 80\u2019s, and has survived every major fashion faux-pas that was born from those day-glow times unto the present day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe hopes to be a fully functioning adult when he grows up. However, given his current age, that hope appears to be a gamble of long odds. Until said time, he fully intends to obsess over every facet of geekdom that the world might provide, or that his wallet can endure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen not cranking out books, Xero writes articles to help other creatives out, churns out a myriad of other projects he hopes entertains you, and immerses himself in biking, fencing, and games of both the tabletop and console variety. Because, frankly, sleep is somewhat overrated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXero currently operates his scheme to entertain the world from Colorado, as aided and abetted by his saint of a wife Katy, and their mutual feline overlord, Cider. As he types this, the knowing eyes of her furry Highness are upon him, demanding that her serf pay her a tithe of petting and treats.\u003cbr\u003eXero dares not refuse her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, he wrote this in third person in a thinly-veiled attempt to make things sound far more legit than they actually are. Bless Mr. Minchin for the inspiration to do so.\u003cbr\u003e",
