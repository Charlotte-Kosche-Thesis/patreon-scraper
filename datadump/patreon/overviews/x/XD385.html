A few years ago, I evolved (pardon the pun) from Pokemon fanfics and into the Brony fandom with a fanfic for My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. It was here that my writing skills truly developed into a near professional style in the form of \u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/47607/the-lost-element\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Lost Element\u003c/a\u003e which, at this time of writing, is currently the fourth longest MLP fanfic on the internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Lost Element is, for lack of a better term, my baby. It is arguably the best story I have ever written and praise for it is quite high as I continue to entertain and please my readers. But after nearly ten years of writing, I felt it is time I try to actually get something out of my efforts as everyone has needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Financial needs is something everyone has, including me. I want to use Patreon to hopefully receive aid from my readers while continuing to entertain and enthrall them with my writings. Of course, whether I receive aid or not, I will not stop writing, but it would be appreciated if I received some support for my efforts. To all who pitch in, you have my thanks and I would be glad to compensate all who aid with some perks. I know I\u0027m not setting myself up as the most whimsical of authors, but I hope you can forgive me. ^_^;\u003cbr\u003e"
