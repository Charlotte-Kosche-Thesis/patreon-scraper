We tell the tale of a team trying to free the world from the grip of Advent once a week. Then, after the excitement of downing x-rays, we break down the decisions that were made, answer questions from listeners, discuss updates to the game, and highlight fun and interesting discussions from the XCOM subreddit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the podcast, I also stream XCOM 2: War of the Chosen on my twitch channel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/splicestream\"\u003etwitch.tv/splicestream\u003c/a\u003e. We are a family friendly stream that focuses on the enjoyable stress and angst a brutal game like XCOM creates. Live from the Infirmary starts at 5:30pm Mountain time every Monday through Thursday. Hope to see you there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon is only for the weekly podcast.
