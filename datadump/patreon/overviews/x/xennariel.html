By publishing it one chapter at a time every month for patrons, it\u2019s an incentive to push \nme to keep writing and to make sure what I produce is as polished and \ninteresting as I can make it. The version of the story I will be posting here is an edited first draft, meaning you\u0027re getting a first look at the series before its publication as a finished YA novel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a lot of fanfiction for the Fullmetal Alchemist and Raven Cycle fandoms.
