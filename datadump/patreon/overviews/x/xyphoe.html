I\u0027m an occasional freelance writer for \"Retro Gamer\" magazine. I produce special big videos, like the documentary I made - \u003cem\u003e\"The Amstrad CPC 464 - Celebrating 30 Years\"\u003c/em\u003e (see below).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZ-ZREEgMXo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve done other big videos like the above (and below), but I\u0027d like to do a lot more and cover other systems too - but with the Amstrad still at the heart of it all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXlIpZAwUUk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6Zc5S6HXws\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do make lots of \u003cstrong\u003elongplay\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ereview\u003c/strong\u003e videos of \u003cstrong\u003eAmstrad\u003c/strong\u003e games, for example -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JyHW3TooACw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zWv5_4MisE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I also \ndelve into other systems (especially arcade coin-ops).

Each of these videos takes up a huge amount of time. Let me explain... (1) First I practice the game over and over finding the best and most complete way to beat it, often trying to do so without \u0027losing a life\u0027 and making maps and notes as I go along; (2) once I\u0027ve done that I record the footage which can obviously take several attempts. Then (3) it\u0027s time to edit the video along with finding the relevant box art images and anything else cool, plus (4) research the history of the game including the programmers and any interesting stories I can find. I record my (5) voice over which is the review and commentary then finally (6) render the video and after check for any problems or defects, fix and render again. This whole process is many hours and days of work and dedication, and my current PC really isn\u0027t up to the job with it often crashing during the editing process and then taking many many hours to encode often with defects that then have to be corrected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started doing these videos because I was frustrated the Amstrad didn\u0027t get the love and coverage it deserved, and also because I loved these games and I firmly believed they deserved a wider audience. It\u0027s been a hugely exciting and rewarding fun hobby of mine, and I\u0027m so glad and thankful that so many of you have enjoyed these, with nearly 2 million views!! Sadly though, my time to do these is getting more and more limited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have noticed over the last few years that the quantity of the videos has gone down, however production values and quality has gone up. I do the best possible job on all my videos. However in the last 5 years I\u0027ve since become engaged, have two young boys, got my first mortgage and house, planning another baby and wedding, etc! It\u0027s all exciting and all go! However with my family and responsibilities, along with a full time job - that is why free time is short now, also unfortunately money too. I have to justify time spent away from the family, and also turning away extra paid work and jobs to make these videos. The pitiful earnings from adverts on YouTube hardly makes it any better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m not here to beg for money, or make you feel bad! I LOVE what I do, and I will always continue to make videos regardless. If you love what I do then continue to leave me comments and smash that like button! If you do want to contribute here that\u0027s totally fine :) If you want to help in other ways you can keep sharing and retweeting videos, etc! But if you can contribute a small monthly amount, help and support me here on Patreon, it would be greatly appreciated by both myself and my new family!! I can then look to upgrade the PC along with producing more of the videos that you like!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAl (Xyphoe)\u003cbr\u003exxx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
