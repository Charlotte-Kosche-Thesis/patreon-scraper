    "summary": "Since 2013, I have been publishing a curated\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.xerblade.com/p/detective-conan-important-episode-list.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elist of Detective Conan anime episodes\u003c/a\u003e a viewer might deem important. This isn\u0027t just a list of episode numbers, but brief, when possible spoiler-lite summaries of what might be important about those episodes to someone. This was to enable new fans who don\u0027t have the time or will to take on a more than 20 year old series with nearly 1000 episodes a more accessible entry point into the series. For years since then, I have kept it up to date regardless of what other responsibilities I had at the time, basically for free, since the peanuts I make from ads on the page doesn\u0027t even really cover the operation cost. When I finally reached a point where life forced me to back off for a bit and be late with an update, a commenter suggested something I had never considered: creating a way for people to give donations. So here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thanks I have received for my efforts have always been more than enough to keep me going, considering I never did it for any thanks in the first place. Heck, the specific person whom I originally started making the list in order to convince to get into the series still hasn\u0027t actually tried the series. However I\u0027m actually running the site on a deficit. I barely get anything from ads (just a few dollars per month, on a good month), definitely not enough to make up for what I pay out to keep thing running as they are. It\u0027s not like I really have any disposable income to speak of, but I set aside part of my budget to cover this because I enjoy it. However, if anyone wishes to become my patron, I would be immensely grateful. Thank you for your continued patronage, whether or not that patronage is monetary."
