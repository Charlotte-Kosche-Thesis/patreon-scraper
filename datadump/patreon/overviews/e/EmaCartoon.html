Co-written by Amanda Lindquist and myself, I\u0027ve begun the art process, and we\u0027re shooting for issue #1\u0027s release by Memorial Day Weekend 2015.

I\u0027ve never been the type to ask for money without giving something in return, so what I\u0027m offering in exchange is up-to-the minute art updates for both comics and any illustrations, illustration process photos, and for the $10+/month club, personalized laser engraved stuff (even if it\u0027s just one month at that bracket).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow Does It Work?\u003c/h3\u003e\nIf you choose to subscribe (thank you!), then you will get charged monthly at the beginning of the month until you choose to cancel. So if you go for the $1/month tier, and cancel it after the 12th month, it will charge you $1 per month until that $12 is up. If you pledge $20 for the top tier, and cancel it after the beginning of the next month, you will only get charged that initial $20. According to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatreon\u0027s FAQs\u003c/a\u003e, it could take up to 72 hours for payments to post. If you have any questions about the payment process, click the FAQ link or send me a message.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAgain, you have my heartfelt thank you for your support, whether it\u0027s just a quick share of the page or more. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
