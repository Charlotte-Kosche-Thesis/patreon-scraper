    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support! \u00a0If it weren\u0027t for people like you I couldn\u0027t be on my way to making this dream of painting an epic series of Dante\u0027s Inferno a reality!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello everyone, my name is Eric Armusik and I\u2019m a figurative painter from Hamburg, Pa. For the past year and a half, I\u2019ve embarked on a journey of epic proportions \u2013 a journey that has changed my life completely. When I was 20 years old, I was given a copy of Dante\u2019s Inferno as a gift. Since then, it had a profound effect on my work and subject matter. After I was commissioned in 2014 to paint a large rendition Of The Damned and The Final Judgment, I was inspired by the overwhelming response to my work and decided to revisit the Inferno. In a matter of days, I knew what I needed to do. I was compelled to give Dante\u2019s brilliant work a visual homage \u2013 a series of paintings that would bring the poem to life. What I didn\u2019t expect, was how this new project would bolster my career and create new and exciting opportunities. I was also surprised by the incredible response on social media and the excitement and enthusiasm people have for seeing this come to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u2019ve chosen to paint 40 panels at 4ft x 5ft with the intent of displaying them together in the most comprehensive and realistic depiction of the poem to date. The reason for the size is simple, I want these images to take on an almost life-sized presence to draw us in body and soul to the world Dante Alighieri created almost 700 years ago. Because this tremendous undertaking requires vast knowledge on the subject of the Divine Comedy to render accurately, I began immediately searching for the most well-known expert. I was thrilled when Professor Christopher Kleinhenz, a world-renowned Dante scholar agreed to assist me in the creation of this series. For the next few years, we will be working together in the pursuit to create the most accurate visual depiction of the poem. The completion of these paintings will then culminate in a traveling museum exhibition and a large, full-color painting book on the subject narrated by Professor Kleinhenz.The goal for the projects is set for 2021 \u2013 the 700th Anniversary of Dante\u2019s death.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to keep up with the demand for materials and time to paint this ambitious project and still support my family over the next three years, I am turning to Patreon to help me see this dream become a reality.I\u2019m nearing completion on the fifth panel in the series and I still have 35 more panels to paint.The time required to pull this project off is nearly insurmountable and I must paint 12 panels a year to stay on schedule. But if you know anything from my work ethic, I am not afraid of hard work or any crazy schedule to get things accomplished. For me, failure is not an option. What I need is your financial support so I can focus most of my time on this project without taking on a surplus of commission work to take care of my family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
