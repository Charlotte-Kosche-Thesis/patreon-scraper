    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eVOCAMERICA: The Western VOCALOID Concert Project\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eVOCALOID is a virtual vocal technology that allows Musicians and Music \nProducers from all around the world to create synthetic singing for \noriginal songs. Originally developed in 2004 by Yamaha, the software has\n taken Japan by storm and has quickly become a global phenomenon. In January of 2016, VOCALOID Producer and voice provider EmpathP began the task of arranging for the first ever live Western VOCALOID concert to take place in Hampton Virginia. After an extremely successful Kickstarter campaign, her dream of a live event was realized and the VOCAMERICA debut concert premiered before a captive audience of over 1,000 attendees. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, EmpathP\u0027s dream will not stop there. VOCAMERICA is now slated to become a continued educational and entertainment project. This will involve, but is not limited to, the expansion of live shows to include even more Western VOCALOIDS and Vocal synths, traveling educational lectures and workshops, and production of exclusive merchandise for these events. But, as with most independent companies, VOCAMERICA needs to help and support of sponsors to continue its production. This is the primary reason we have come to Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmpathy Studios\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEmpathy Studios is an independent music label started by EmpathP with the soul purpose of providing support and exposure to aspiring and popular Western VOCALOID Producers. Empathy Studios focuses on the manufacturing of physical CDs, Posters, T-shirts, and other merchandise, as well as assisting with online marketing and production. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently most of Empathy Studios marketing is going into furthering the production of the VOCAMERICA Concert Project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout EmpathP Herself\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAki Glancy (better known as EmpathP) is a musician, vocalist, and illustrator who specializes in creating original VOCALOID music and related media. They first fell in love with the VOCALOID software back in 2008 and began creating their own music in 2010. Since then they have been honored to be a part of many projects, including: beta testing/composing original demos for the VOCALOIDS \nHatsune Miku, KAITO, MEIKO, MAIKA, and YOHIOloid, as well as becoming the official designer and illustrator of the English Celtic VOCALOID AVANNA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPK-fV1o3Z4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSince then, they have branched out and now strive to travel all across the United States to various conventions to share the love of VOCALOID and VOCALOID culture. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until this point, VOCAMERICA\u2019s production has been entirely funded\n through EmpathP. \nHowever, \nthe continued need for funds to continue the production of this project\n has reached a point where it is no longer possible EmpathP to fund\n by herself without help.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this Patreon you will gain access to exclusive sneak peaks, previews, music, and merchandise which will otherwise not be shared with the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon account will be going to fund 3 major things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Production of VOCAMERICA concerts which include, but is not limited to: payments for VOCAMERICA staff, acquisition of newer components for the concerts such as better lighting and projection equipment, manufacturing of VOCAMERICA exclusive merchandise, ect.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTraveling expenses to out of state conventions and events (Hotels, gas, food, ect.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDaily living expenses for EmpathP when/if needed\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn\u00a0 Conclusion\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would like to thank each and every one of you who may be sending\u00a0 pledges, especially to those who began their support on kickstarter.
