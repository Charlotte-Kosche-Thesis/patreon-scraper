My name is Donna Caulder and I am the founder and owner of SEAS. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a career educator and art teacher, my objective is to invite you into my studio where I will be sharing with you my lifetime of experience and my passion for art in a variety of forms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my career and continuing through today, I have been able to share art activities with small groups and larger classes in live sessions. However, Patreon has opened up an entirely new opportunity for me to share my passion with audiences that can literally be anywhere in the world through the magic of internet-based video instruction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be making regular posts that offer you detailed instruction for creating your own mixed media, hand-built pottery, mosaics, culturally-related and a variety of other activities. Our videos will be like having your own professional art teacher come to your home or school and guide you step by step through an ever-changing variety of exciting projects.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf you love art and especially if you enjoy working with your hands or gathering together a small group of children or friends and getting your creative juices flowing than the Southern Earth Arts Studio is the place for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is though that we also love to travel and we want to create opportunities for like-minded people to share in our travel experiences and/or to gain the opportunity for discounted travel options for themselves. So, that is why we have tried to blend our passion for art with our love of travel and would love to have you join us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
