For the past 6 years I\u0027ve been producing highly detailed, well explained videos primarily related to electronics, but I also upload many other types of videos to my channel such as DIY Money Saving Tips, Product Reviews, Appliance Repair Videos, Misc Experiments, GY6 Scooter Videos, Automotive Repair Videos, Mechanical, and \"Free Energy\" Scam exposing videos. Over the years I\u0027ve helped MILLIONS of viewers with my videos, took the time to answer hundreds, if not thousands of questions, and saved my viewers untold amounts of money with my popular, easy to follow repair videos. I greatly enjoy sharing my vast amount of knowledge with others. Like many other channels, all my content is free to watch. Youtube is my only source of income(Full Time Job), and unfortunately the money I make from ads placed on my videos is not enough to fairly compensate me for all my hard work producing videos and helping others. In order for me to continue producing quality content on a regular basis, pay for audio/video equipment as well as supplies for my videos, I must also rely on donations from my viewers, otherwise my channel may become a \"Part Time\" job and viewers will rarely have questions answered. If I was making thousands of dollars per week like MANY Youtube channels do, then I would have no need to ask my viewers for donations. Smaller, extremely helpful Youtube channels like mine need your help. For the price of a cup of coffee once a month, you could help support my channel. Over the past 27 years I have become highly proficient in many different trades. Some to list are, electrical, electronics, plumbing, HVAC, welding, mechanical, carpentry, and MUCH more. I also greatly enjoy anything to do with the outdoors or water/water sports, biking, hiking, exploring, climbing, traveling, or just playing in the garage. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
