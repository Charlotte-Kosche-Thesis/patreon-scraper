A cyclist is not only one less car on the roads, but also a person who has a better chance to live better and longer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can I ever thank you enough?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBack in 2013 I was overweight, with high levels of\ncholesterol and hence not in the best of health. First came walking, then\ncycling. I used to cycle to Uni when I was young and really enjoyed it. To my\nsurprise, that enjoyment only grew when I rediscovered the bicycle.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2014 I rode from my home town of Bracknell in the UK to\nParis on a 3-day cycling trip.

I usually upload videos as private as I finish editing them, and set them public once the blog post and any other relevant videos are also complete. In most cases this can take a couple of weeks. I have changed this and now I set the videos as \"Unlisted\" in YouTube, so they don\u0027t show up in the channel, but can be accessed if you have the direct link to them, which I will provide to the members of the closed groups as part of your reward.\u003c/p\u003e",

A micro-adventure may be defined by a short trip (1 day or 2) to explore a new place, meet new people and experience new things. Due to the short time frame, these adventures are, generally speaking, close to home, which is, in my case the town of Bracknell in the county of Berkshire, England (The Queen\u0027s Castle - Windsor castle - is just 15 miles from me). Will try to go places or do cycling trips my patrons wish they could do themselves, but have not done yet, and will tell them about my experiences, in writing and video, so that if they go, they will know what to expect (what to do, what not to do, what to see, eat, etc).\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the content, you\u0027ll have my eternal gratitude and my support in case you want to try the micro-adventure for yourself one day.",
