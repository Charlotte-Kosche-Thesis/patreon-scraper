    "summary": "Hey friends! \u00a0We are so excited that you landed on our Patreon page! \u00a0We absolutely love what we do! \u00a0Whether it is writing music, playing house shows, playing with our kids or even the fun outings that we take while traveling this beautiful world in our RV full time, we consider ourselves very blessed. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we began our full time journey a year ago we had such high hopes that our music would make a way for us to share hope and freedom with the world through our songs. \u00a0Unfortunately, with the rise of free streaming sites, our music sales could not support our large family, no matter how much we cut out of our food budget, and the doors of churches were not exactly flying open in welcome as we had hoped...lol. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing that \u003cstrong\u003ehas\u003c/strong\u003e made a bit of a way for our music to make an impact is YouTube. \u00a0Originally we started our YouTube channel to keep friends and family back home up-to-date with our family\u0027s faith journey. \u00a0We had no idea that so many would find our family vlog and become such loyal supporters. \u00a0Truly we have come to realize, when we felt at one time forgotten, how loved we are and how many kind and wonderful folks are thinking of us and praying for us each and every day. \u00a0Your comments have meant the world to us. \u00a0Your gifts through fan funding (before it was removed by YouTube) and through our website donation button have blown us away! \u00a0You all have inspired us in such a great way and we want to continue this journey because we have so much to be thankful for and we have so much to share with the YouTube community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon enters our story. \u00a0Many (many many) of you have asked and pleaded for us to start up a Patreon account and originally we were going to wait until we had a specific music project to work on. \u00a0But recently we have come to realize that our life is a project right now. \u00a0In order for us to be more focused on what brings us joy (music and vlogging) we need to be less worried about the fact that churches aren\u0027t calling us back and that the freelance job market is super flooded at the moment. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing we have learned on this journey is that we have to trust that God won\u0027t let us down. \u00a0He has provided all the way and He will continue to provide for our family. \u00a0In December, when our finances had completely run dry and our retirement account was even wiped out we thought we were at the end of our rope. \u00a0But...we prayed and asked God for a miracle. \u00a0And He gave us a miracle in a video called $1,300,000 Luxury Living in an RV. \u00a0The video went viral and we had people coming to check out our family left and right. \u00a0That totally blew our minds and we still can\u0027t believe we have 8400+ subscribers now just a few short months later (before that we had 200). \u00a0Suddenly, instead of us cold-calling churches and getting nowhere, we were having churches and other people contacting \u003cstrong\u003eus\u003c/strong\u003e wanting to know if we would come be a part of their church service or do a house show or visit their home town. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have huge plans coming up with more music and music videos this year. \u00a0We are also in the process of re-branding our family vlog and splitting the Trent \u0026amp; Siobh\u00e1n music off as it\u0027s own channel as well as starting yet another new channel that will be linked to our channel as well (more on that in the near future).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, more than ever we need you. \u00a0We need your support as we take the extra time needed to put our all into the three channels and get them all up and running smoothly. \u00a0More finances will mean more focus time for more music, more family adventures and more opportunities for us to connect with people who need to hear the hope of the Gospel. \u00a0More finances will mean better gear, clearer audio, clearer video and overall better vlogs and music sharing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support continues to fuel that passion in us to speak the hope and life of Christ to people everywhere!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e-Trent \u0026amp; Siobh\u00e1n Walker (and all our boys)"

     "about": "We are the Walker family (AKA EveryDay Family Adventure)...Trent (dad), Siobhan (mom) and our brood of five creative, busy little boys. Yes, we have five little boys and to blow your mind even more, we live full time in our 40\u2019 vintage Foretravel motorhome with no slides. I will save you the hassle of getting your calculator out and do the math for you: that\u2019s 7 people in 320 sf of living space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut here\u2019s the awesome thing about it...we don\u2019t LIVE in the RV like we lived in a house. No, we left the house-living life to LIVE in the world...to experience and soak up every bit of life and love that we can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe live in the outdoors and around the campfire with friends who were strangers the day before and in the weekly visits to donut shops across the nation. We frequent museums and zoos and learning centers for school and, after being on the road for two years, have stood on more historic sites than we can count.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe write songs and share our music in homes and churches and campgrounds and tell the story of how we have learned to live without fear because our loving Heavenly Father has made us brave and gives us the boldness to pursue our dreams and fully use the gifts that He has given us to make the world a better place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe tell these stories in hopes of inspiring others to be everything God has made them to be also. To be unafraid and trust that God has perfectly created them for a purpose. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, before you think we are crazy or feel bad for us because we don\u2019t have much space to live in, realize that our home has never been bigger than it is right now. We are citizens of Heaven and the whole world is our backyard!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019d like to check out some of our music or follow our family adventures you can find all of that on our website, www. \u003ca href=\"http://TrentAndSiobhan.com\"\u003eTrentAndSiobhan.com\u003c/a\u003e, or on YouTube (a search for Trent \u0026amp; Siobhan or EveryDay Family Adventure will lead you there). \u003cbr\u003e\n\nPS...stay tuned because there is a whole new level of crazy to come this year!!!!\u003cbr\u003e",
