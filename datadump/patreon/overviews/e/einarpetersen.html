How many scifi series do you know that will be fully accessible and provide fan printable merchandise if you so desire. Yup you got it ! Reckoning your new favorite science fiction series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the project progresses if things go as expected we\u0027ll end up with everything needed for turning the whole series into a series of 3D cartoons as well, a fully accessible comicbook and fan printable merchandise - Some pretty exciting stuff if you ask me - I mean how cool is that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have not watched the awesome storyboard creation video above to see how the storyboard pages are created I certainly encourage you to use the 3 minutes it takes to get a feel for what is happening. The video depicts a scene from Operation Vermin and depicts scenes from the battlefield as a protagonist fights his way to a rescue ship and discussions in a ready room. If you are visually impaired I suggest you check the video anyway as it features some neat music setting the mood for the story - The laser engravings will come to complement the 3D models as production progresses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/215441426\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/215441426\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings are already well on the way storybooks for parts 1-6 are done, each is a like small semi self contained album, with the only difference that part 1 \u0026amp; 2 have been contracted into one album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3D models have been produced and are being produced and several are already released under CC license for people to print on their 3D printers and more are forthcoming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe work is being done in collaboration with people, artists, 3D modelers, programmers, from countries like the Faroe Islands, Denmark, England, Argentina, Germany, China, USA, Rumania, Bangladesh, Singapore, Mexico and I imagine many more will join.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe efforts being put into Reckoning are made by a truly international team just like the members of the protagonist organization TDF it is a truly multicultural. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can believe it we\u0027ve\n even been lucky enough to have gotten the thumbs up from a military \nadvisor (who remains anonymous at this time), for the realism with which\n battle has been described in several chapters. - Pretty Awesome !!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReckoning is a science fiction story of suspense, conspiracy, and heroism, sprinkled with high technology, alien species, grand combat and stealthy intrigue. Reckoning is a story seething with corruption and greed all in need to be circumnavigated by our band of brave protagonists of the Terran Defense Force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Military Industrial Complex, The Security Consortium and the NWO all play their part in this high paced scifi adventure. The setting is spanning the entire globe and then some.... shall we say to the outskirts of the known, as well as the unknown universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Reckoning project just seems to be getting better all the time, I absolutely love it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you as a Patron will be getting out of this, is first and foremost access to panels and HQ images from the comic as we proceed along, you will be seeing design shots and other material as it is produced and not just low-quality twitter pictures, or any other images on social media, or elsewhere, both now and during the production phase. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProduction of rudimentary 3D poses for panels is expected to begin soon hinging on using a motion-capture suit from the danish team Rokoko who ran the successful SALTO Kickstarter - Current status is that I am awaiting delivery of the suit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach chapter is written as an independent little story so the aim is you\u0027ll end up with a small collection of comic books from the Reckoning Universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe storyboards for the comics are as explained above nearly locked and 3D production is imminent, with a number of models already created. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever I though it fair that you get a glimpse of the storyboard production - So here is an example of a rough storyboard from chapter 5 - You can see a page from the chapter being drawn in the video above. I suggest if you are visually impaired you go to my website and read Chapter 5 Operation Vermin until such time that the laser engraved pages are available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://einarpetersen.com/images/reckoning_ill/chapter_5_storyboard_preliminary_25_percent_size_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe actual 3D version of the comic will according to plan enable you to online zip around and zoom around inside frames and not just passively look at pages. And Offline you will have the models and laser engraved pages in addition to a regular comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to preview a text draft from the open writing exercise then the first few chapters are available at \u003ca href=\"http://einarpetersen.com/reckoning.html\"\u003ehttp://einarpetersen.com/reckoning.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://einarpetersen.com/doku.php?id=reckoning\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease check\n out some of the awesome art and models in the posts and on \u003ca href=\"https://www.tinkercad.com/users/ebbn2H05qC2\"\u003ehttps://www.tinkercad.com/users/ebbn2H05qC2\u003c/a\u003e you can find here on Patreon and do get back to me with comments and suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to invite you to join the utterly awesome crew of Patrons already helping to make Reckoning a huge success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd since I know this is about your money - How about this? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo alleviate your fears of making a \"bad investment\" I am willing to offer you a full, no questions asked money back guarantee!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do not like what is happening here and you have been a Patron for 12 consecutive months you simply cancel your Patronage before the 13\u0027th billing cycle and ask me for a refund. Simple as that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you like what you have seen and read so far and that you would like to follow along with us on this amazing journey, as we expand upon the Reckoning universe and the great promise thereof.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even if you can\u0027t afford to pitch in financially - Please help to spread the word - A tweet or a post to any other social media are virtually free of charge so pitch in and make Reckoning the amazing success it desreves to be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEinar Petersen\u003c/div\u003e"
