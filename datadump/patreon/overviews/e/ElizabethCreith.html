I write\nfantasy, horror, humour, science fiction and poetry. I published my\nfirst piece of humour \u2013 A Loom With A Zoo \u2013 in 1990, and I\u0027ve\nnever looked back. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had four humour columns to date on subjects ranging from farm life to books, because you can make humour out of anything! My fourth one, Over the Ridge, is in print and\nstill going strong. Much of my poetry is also humorous verse. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of my fiction is flash \u2013 one thousand words\nor shorter \u2013 or short stories, but I\u0027m also working on a YA fantasy\ntrilogy and a YA science fiction novel. I occasionally\nwrite mysteries. I like to illustrate my work whenever I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy memoir, \u201cShepherd in Residence\u201d, won the\nLouise de Kiriline Lawrence award for Northern Ontario non-fiction in\n2014. I\u0027m particularly chuffed about this one because the inimitable\nMargaret Atwood was also on the shortlist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDue to my habits of sleeping indoors and eating\nregular meals, I\u0027m working at a job that consumes a lot of my writing\nand art time. I\u0027m hoping to replace a chunk of that income and free\nmyself to spend more time writing and illustrating fiction of all\nsorts \u2013 myths, fairy tales, fantasy, horror, science fiction and\nhumour \u2013 and putting it out there for you, my audience. Art is long\nand life is short, and it gets shorter every day. I just want to fill\nas much of my life as possible, and yours, too, with good stories.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting a new piece once or twice a month.\nSome will be print stories, and all of those will be unpublished\npieces. You, my patrons, get the first look. Some will be audio files\nof me reading a story, because who doesn\u0027t love to be read to? Again,\nyou get the first listen; I may occasionally read a story that has\nappeared somewhere in print, but most of them will be unpublished. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI also want to make mini-movies of some stories\nand poems. These may be slide shows of illustrations while I read\naloud, or possibly stop-action films or flip-books, pop-ups, whatever\nthe Muse dictates. I\u0027m aiming at three or four of these a year, bur\nthere might be more. These will be exclusive to you, my patrons. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m incredibly excited about getting to make this\nart and post it here, and I\u0027m grateful to every one of you at every\nlevel for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
