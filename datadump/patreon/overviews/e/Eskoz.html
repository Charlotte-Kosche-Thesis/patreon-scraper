Some of you may have seen my older videos around on \u003ca href=\"http://eskoz.deviantart.com/\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://eskoz.blogspot.com\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e and various giantess/vore/adult websites. There\u0027s not many of them, nor are they long, but hopefully they\u0027ve still been enjoyable.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been animating for a living for around 6 years or so. For some time now I\u0027ve wanted to try starting up something that I have a bit more control over, so I wouldn\u0027t be quite as dependent on receiving work from other studios, as it can be quite stressful if something new isn\u0027t lined up after a project ends, even if usually something does turn up. Patreon seemed like the obvious option to try out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s enough about me. The content you\u0027ll be finding here will be similar to my other more recent creations. The main theme is giantess/shrinking animations, revolving mostly around various forms of vore, insertions and other related sexy stuff. And while the content won\u0027t be 100% limited to those categories, everything will have a size fetish related aspect to them. There will also be VR scenes of some of the videos I post here. These will be experiences, with very limited interactive options, similar to the Ada pov vore VR scene(link). However, the priority will be new video content in the beginning at least, as I lack visibility, due to not being quite as active in the community as I would have liked recently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I bother pledging?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will allow me to use more of my time to create more content for you. Right now I need to allocate most of my time on animating for other studios, which is why I barely post a new video once a year. A steady income from patreon will also mean that I\u0027m willing to invest more on this. I\u0027ve already updated my main workstation, after the amazing response I\u0027ve gotten from all of you. I also bought a licence for Redshift, which has allowed me to really upgrade the look of my videos, without a major hit on my rendering times. Future upgrades include dedicated rendering PCs, which will cost a lot. So it will be a while before I can afford those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also love to hire some voice actors, since the variety the different sound banks and such can offer is limited. So a higher amount pledged, means more varied moans! In the future. Assuming people want it, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther than that there\u0027s the rewards: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinished clips \u0026amp; real-time(UE4) VR scenes will be released for free (for now at least). Free clips will be on a more standard frame rate though, and will be limited to 720p. Before anyone gets too sad about being excluded from higher resolutions, this is the resolution I\u0027ve been using for my content lately, as 1080p takes quite a bit of extra time to output. Unless I\u0027m recording from UE4 or something similar. I\u0027m mainly moving to higher resolutions \u0026amp; framerates, so I have something extra to offer patrons. Other than that, there\u0027s still some advantages for you to gain by pledging. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe picture tier will include access to still pictures. The preview tier adds access to preview videos straight from the Maya viewport. These won\u0027t have audio in them, and might not have textures either. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe essentials tier adds access to all WIP materials and Voting access. You can also think of this as a sort of early access, as videos can be pretty near to completion for a while, as I tweak audio \u0026amp; post processing. This tier also includes 1080p (or higher) 60 fps versions of all the latest videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of polls can I expect?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen relevant, you can expect to be able to vote on things like:\u003cbr\u003e-Alternate versions of videos, character swaps, different camera angles etc.\u003cbr\u003e-Work priority. Whether you want to see more videos, or more variety in characters/locations in future videos, more focus on VR, etc.\u003cbr\u003e-Likes/dislikes, to gauge your interests\u003cbr\u003e-Character/Gender choices, for who to use in a video \u003cbr\u003e-Design choices, what characters should look like/wear, location design etc.\u003cbr\u003e-Scenario options, when I have multiple possible ideas\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePolls like, work priority and likes/dislikes are a bit more vague, and won\u0027t have direct impact on the next creation, but they will obviously influence my decisions, on what kind of scenarios to come up with etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you take requests?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I don\u0027t take direct requests, I\u0027m open to suggestions, and if I see something I like, I\u0027ll probably use it in a scenario/character etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThings you will not see here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Scat (farting is pretty unlikely as well)\u003cbr\u003e-Graphic gore (tearing limbs, excessive blood, melting skin etc.)\u003cbr\u003e-Blatantly underage characters (this does not mean, that there can\u0027t be more petite characters as well)\u003cbr\u003e-Giant males (At the very least not in a main role or a solo scenario. I don\u0027t want to completely rule out couple or futa scenarios, if a lot of people want them. But even then, don\u0027t expect anything more than maybe something occasional)\u003cbr\u003e-Furry characters\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have to stress, that the video release amounts are estimates. Reality can vary a lot, depending on scenario complexity, technical issues, sickness and how much work I need to do on other things like characters, locations, VR etc.\u003cbr\u003e"
