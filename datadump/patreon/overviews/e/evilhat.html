Most will be self-contained, though as time goes on we might come back to earlier ones and do a \"second act\" adventure for the big hits. Our word-count target per adventure is about 10,000 words (30-40 pages in our 6x9 format seen in the Fate Core line). If things go really well and we can get up to speed we\u0027d like to release these at least one every other month, if not monthly, though we figure it\u0027ll take us some time to get started. When we publish them, we\u0027ll make them available Pay What You Want.

This idyllic landscape where glass and fiberplastics glint white and weave throughout waterfalls and thick old trees is the perfect locale for creating phenomenal musical experiences. Famous DJ Squads come to compete for the title of the Planet\u2019s Next DJ Superstars. To create their sounds and effects DJs wear Shells: cybernetically enhanced bodies that they can switch out and customize to create fully integrated multi-sensual experiences. Til Dawn is of course broadcast live for the most ultimate real drama possible. Competitors not only have to excel at increasingly difficult music challenges, but also juggle relationships, the public perception of their personas, and sabotage from other DJ Squads. Can players work with their DJ Squad to come out on top and win the prestigious planetary title, or will they be crushed by the drama?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eClockwinders\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (By \u003cstrong\u003eJahmal Brown\u003c/strong\u003e): Clockwinders repair and reset the geo-arcane mechanics on Cadvini, or they did ages ago. The role is ceremonial these days on the tidally locked, clock-work world of Cadvini. One side is bathed in perpetual sun-fire the other in darkness and storms. Scattered across a temperate, habitable zone are pockets of civilization. They say it wasn\u2019t always this way but for the arrogance of wizards. Perhaps, wizards are to blame still today. There are glaciers floating in from the dark side of the Frost sea destroying coastal towns.  The academy at the Dawn Palace that borders on the \u2018day side\u2019 is smoldering. The stone glyph walls are melting. It is up to the Clockwinders to discover what\u2019s amiss and set it right. They will travel across wondrous Cadvini to repair the nine clock-work cores...uh, once they re-discover where the cores are located and how to reset the clock-work devices, oh! and avoid the traps and hazards that protect the clock-work cores. Go Clockwinders!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll the Queen\u0027s Women \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e(by \u003cstrong\u003eFelipe Real\u003c/strong\u003e): Long before the Spanish Conquistadors invaded their country, and even before the northern Inka tried to subdue them, the Mapuche\u2014the \u201cPeople of the Land\u201d\u2014thrived. Since always they have lived in the Mapu, a \u201cLand\u201d of ever-green valleys, crossed over by numerous lakes and rivers, and enclosed in the East by a mighty mountain range. In the Mapu the natural and preternatural coexist, and that is why the leaders of the Mapuche people\u2014the longko\u2014need the protection of young warrior-women who are both wise in the ways of the world and strong enough to confront dangers beyond the human understanding. In The Way of the Pukona the players tell their own stories about these young warrior-women, the pukona, brave souls who are willing to lay down their lives for their longko and their communities. While doing so, the pukona have to fight not only against both visible and invisible threats, but also against the temptation and corruption that come from within, in the form of selfishness and violence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWeird World News\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (by \u003cstrong\u003eAndr\u00e9 la Roche\u003c/strong\u003e):  A groovy game based off your favorite cartoons from the 1970s.  Players control intrepid members of an Extreme News Team on the hunt for UFOs, ghosts, mothman, and other cryptids.  But not all is as it seems\u2014for every authentic cryptid uncovered, there\u0027s another half-dozen frauds: executors disguised as bigfoot trying to bilk the rightful heirs out of an inheritance; a restauranteur dressed in mummy bandages trying to stamp out competition; or a ruthless robber-baron masked as a vampire trying to extort the cheap sale of neighboring land.  Who knows what faces will be unveiled at the climax of each adventure?  And who knows when a real monster will be the actual culprit? Jinkies! Will include new rules for GM-less play options that allows for games of as few as two players.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMinistry\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e(by \u003cstrong\u003eJess Nevins\u003c/strong\u003e):\u00a0In 1945 the British government established the Ministry of Rocketry, and thanks to retro-engineered alien technology Great Britain has begun taking steps into space. Unfortunately, in the thirteen years since then a variety of aliens have either been discovered on Earth or landed here. These aren\u2019t the comical little green men of cheap science fiction stories; these aliens are diseases, mind-controllers, and shape-shifters, all intent, in their own ways, on seizing power and/or infecting as many humans as possible. Various alien outbreaks have killed tens of thousands of people around the world\u2013-at home in Liverpool and Norwich, even\u2013-while other aliens have tried to possess Josef Stalin, Jawaharlal Nehru, and (reportedly) Mao Zedong. You are field agents of the Ministry of Rocketry, assigned to London. Can you protect the country\u2013-the city\u2013-your homes\u2013-your families\u2013-your very selves\u2013-against the alien threat?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlmbrecht After Dark\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (by \u003cstrong\u003eCatherine Bult\u003c/strong\u003e): Mysterious, sharp-fingered Jacks haunt the eaves of the city of Almbrecht and threaten its citizens\u2019 dreams. No one knows where they come from. No one knows how to get rid of them. And the countryside is wracked by partisan violence that promises worse to come. Play as a thaumaturge, trying to find a way to protect citizens against the Jacks as trade slows to a crawl. Or as a young veteran who can\u2019t tell if their nightmares come from the Jacks or not. Or as a spy stranded in the city, with no one to trust. No one is safe when the sun goes down and you hear long fingers pattering at the glass of your windows. Nothing like the threat of madness on top of blistering summer heat and a long-simmering civil war to push a city to its breaking point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Crisp Line\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (by \u003cstrong\u003eColleen O\u0027Rourke\u003c/strong\u003e): In the not too distant future, changing your genes is like changing your name: tricky, but available for the right intentions, or the right price. What once began as a technology for medical necessities has expanded into the realms of artistic expression, personal vanity, and crime. For the moment, gene-modding is legal and dozens of companies market lines that allow the customer to take on aspects drawn from animals or the imagination. More popular packages have lead to pockets of genetic divergence that some are hesitantly classifying as new \u201craces.\u201d Meanwhile, the gene-mod movement continues to grow and diversify. Some regret their choices, some fight back against these \u201cgene-pervs,\u201d while others turn their eyes forward to what the meaning of \u201chumanity\u201d might become. Players play in a system that lets them expand the limits of their own genetic code while exploring themes of class, evolving subcultures, and identity. Shadowrun meets GATTACA. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNgen Mapu\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (by \u003cstrong\u003eFelipe Real\u003c/strong\u003e): In Ngen Mapu the players interpret seemingly all-mighty Preternatural Beings in charge of a portion of reality who must defend their chosen Idea from the ravages of Oblivion in a contemporary, urban Fantasy setting. This Fate World is inspired by the Nobilis RPG and real-life Mapuche mythology. The intended mode of play is for short campaigns with a focus on discovery and wonder, as well as the difficulties of defending those in our skeptic, disillusioned world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow\u0027d The First Year Go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGreat!
