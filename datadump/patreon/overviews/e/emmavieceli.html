    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi - I\u0027m Emma! You may know me from comics like Jem \u0026amp; the Holograms, Supergirl, Doctor Who, Alex Rider, Vampire Academy and more...\u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a comic creator by trade and I love my job, but - like many artists - I rarely get to work on my own stories. A while back I met up online with Swedish writer, \n\u003ca href=\"http://malinryden.wordpress.com/english-about-malin-ryden/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMalin Ryden\u003c/a\u003e, via the wonderful world of video game fandom, and we started writing a book together. At some point, I figured that this story would work in comic form, and provide a kind of slow-burn, real-world, YA, character-heavy, consequence-laden read that I have long felt under-represented on my comic shelves. So we decided to make it, and it became \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.breakscomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBREAKS.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.toothycat.net/~emsie/breaks/sjbanner2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re working independently, which is wonderful, and we wanted to offer the story as a \u003cstrong\u003efree-to-read\u003c/strong\u003e webcomic with no printed issues - we\u0027re \u003cstrong\u003estraight-to-trade\u003c/strong\u003e....but of course that also means we\u0027re working for free, with no prospect of making money. I take Malin\u0027s amazing script breakdown of our original co-written book version, and I edit it, tweak it, rough it, draw it, tone it, shade it, letter it and get it to the readers. It\u0027s no small amount of work and I\u0027d love to be able to take on less paid contracts so that I can give more time to BREAKS. And this is where PATREON comes in. Where YOU come in ^_^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.toothycat.net/~emsie/breaks/patreonbanner2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBREAKS has been running online for \u003cstrong\u003ethree years\u003c/strong\u003e now - how time flies. \u003ca href=\"http://soaringpenguinpress.com/product/breaks-vol-1\"\u003eArc one is in print through Soaring Penguin\u003c/a\u003e, a fab little independent publisher, and we\u0027re now approaching the half way mark online with arc two. We\u0027ve\n uploaded a page a week, every week, for over three years, and have seen \nsome amazing response from readers. My patreon backers have helped make this happen, but I\u0027m definitely not at the \u0027less contracts\u0027 stage just yet. My time has been largely unpaid because I love this comic. But...three years is a long time to work on something unpaid, and it would be lovely to be able to work on it faster - and that\u0027s where I look to you, dear reader!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eSo what is BREAKS?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone wears a mask.

And, in Cortland Hunt\u2019s case, what \nhe\u2019s hiding might just be more than Ian Tanner is prepared for.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBreaks is the story of two young adults coming to terms with who they were, who they are and who they\u2019ll become.\n\u003cbr\u003eKey terms: \u003cstrong\u003eLGBTQA, Drama, Romance, Mystery, Sport, YA, Crime, consequence.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.toothycat.net/~emsie/covergifreal800.gif\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.breakscomic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003eClick this link and read it for yourself - UPDATES every Monday\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(WIP/update blog link in the video)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDo please join us at the home of the webcomic, and we hope you like what you see enough to consider becoming a patron of the series and a supporter of my work.
