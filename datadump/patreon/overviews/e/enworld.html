We have a roster of columnists, including Russ \"Morrus\" Morrissey, Chris Helton (previously at \u003cem\u003eBleeding Cool\u003c/em\u003e), Darryl Mott Jr. (previously at \u003cem\u003eAin\u0027t It Cool News\u003c/em\u003e), Angus Abranson (industry veteran who co-founded Cubicle 7), Michael Tresca (formerly of \u003cem\u003eThe Examiner\u003c/em\u003e), and Sean Patrick Fannon (of Evil Beagle Games).

Over the last months, we have been growing our pool of freelance columnists, who now bring you articles every day of the week! We currently feature columns from dozens of regular and semi-regular\u00a0columnists on a wide variety of tabletop RPG\u00a0topics. \u00a0But we need funds to pay these columnists for their work. If you are a regular reader of EN World, please consider donating to this Patreon so that we can continue to feature articles from a wide and inclusive range of \u00a0freelancers.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe post RPG news, reviews, or articles every day, form the latest rumours and scoops to previews of upcoming games, and reviews of older classics.
