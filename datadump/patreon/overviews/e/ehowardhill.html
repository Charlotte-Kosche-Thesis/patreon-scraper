I\u0027m a self-publishing home-schooled author from the piney woods of Texas whose dream is to one day write multiple clean, fiercely original, meaningful, and witty children\u0027s books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I\u0027m on Patreon, by the way, is because I want to write meaningful\u00a0books and get them into the hands of kids and young adults. My biggest inhibitor right now is that I\u0027m a college student with limited funds and I can\u0027t buy many books. Every pledge helps me get a little closer to putting a bunch of books in hands. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you for everything, by the way!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere are my works\u00a0 so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYellow\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003ereleased March 2018, is a fun sci-fi/fantasy/adventure/mystery novel for kids ages 11/12+ about a girl named Shirley and her misadventures with her cousin Todd and her friends Elliott, Edgar, and Sylvia. It has as many positive themes as I could pack into it and eleven illustrations. Cool, huh?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGlass Eyes\u003c/strong\u003e, a cinematic spin-off of my main literary universe for young adults, was released to the masses on November 12, 2018. It\u0027s an engaging, thought-provoking sci-fi adventure that asks good questions. I didn\u0027t write it for any specific age group, but I did intend for it to be meaningful for whoever decides to pick it up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest project right now is a video game titled \u003cstrong\u003eStarlight Street\u003c/strong\u003e, which I intend to release for PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Atari VCS. It\u0027s an experiment in storytelling, and I\u0027m working on producing it to be as meaningful as anything else I\u0027ve worked on. Best of all, it\u0027ll be free! You can check out some more information about it on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/starlight-street-software/coming_soon\"\u003ehttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/starlight-stre...\u003c/a\u003e if you so wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor those who have stumbled across this page, thank you for reading this! I appreciate every single one of you. I hope you guys enjoy my future works, but even if you don\u0027t, I hope you have a great day!\u003c/strong\u003e"
