I create stories with dance and high-tech costumes and props.  I\u2019m a girl who uses computers, micro controllers and 3d printers to make beautiful fantastic creations that give people a sense of wonder and delight whenever I wear them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe world of DIY electronics is 96.5% men.  School-aged girls don\u2019t get interested in computers, or into making things with tools, because the role models are so few and far between.  When girls see my glowing mermaid tail, and learn that I made it myself, their eyes light up and I can see their whole world begin to expand.  It\u2019s a beautiful sight.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur modern world is built on technology.  We need to get the next generation of girls interested in making things; interested in a deep and heartfelt way.  My artwork is aimed right at those girls.  I want to open their eyes and give them the confidence and the tools to make whatever they can dream up.\u00a0Just a few dollars a month will help me make more and larger-scale art, and have time to dedicate to getting it out there where it can be seen and experienced by as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for watching!  I can\u2019t wait to see the world though the eyes of a whole generation of young, inspired makers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

I picked up design, sewing, and fabrication skills as I worked at turning my imaginings into reality. \u00a0I got into DIY electronics in order to realize my vision of an LED dance performance, and discovered another passion in that field. \u00a0Now I spend a few hours a week publishing electronics and costuming tutorials for Adafruit.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, I hope to be able to let go of some of my work at Fire Pixie and spend more time making art and costumes and full-length dance shows. \u00a0I plan to do this through library and school outreach and online videos and media, as well as fashion shows and gallery exhibits. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making stuff. \u00a0I love performing. \u00a0I want to be able to do that all the time. \u00a0Thank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e",
