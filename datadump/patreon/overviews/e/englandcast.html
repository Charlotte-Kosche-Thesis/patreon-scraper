     "about": "I was born in Amish Country Pennsylvania (I grew up in a town called Paradise, and went to church in a town called Intercourse, and tasted Auntie Anne\u0027s pretzels before she was famous!) and when I was in high school, I began a long and abiding love affair with early choral music, especially the choral music of the English Renaissance. \u00a0I was always a history geek - my first weekend job in high school was as a docent at the Rock Ford Foundation, the home of General Edward Hand, Adjutant to Washington - but the combination of the music and the history of the English Renaissance completely swept me away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter college I moved to Los Angeles for a year and started grad school at Cal State LA, but then I realized I had an opportunity to go to the UK on a BUNAC visa, and I jumped at it. \u00a0I worked at a headhunting firm off the Strand during the week, going to Evensong services at Westminster Abbey nearly every night, and becoming absorbed in the history around me. \u00a0I went for marathon walks around the City, sneaking into all the ancient Wren churches that dominated the old skyline and have such amazing lunchtime concerts. \u00a0I stayed in the UK for just about 2 years (getting a student visa after my BUNAC one expired) and then had a job working for a classical music streaming service (Classical.com) and opened their office in NYC. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife, and jobs, took me to Nashville (working for the Naxos classical label), and then eventually back to Los Angeles in 2005\u00a0where I was the Assistant Director of a library consortium, and do a great deal of work in ebooks (if you google my name with ebooks, you\u0027ll get lots of my professional information on that). \u00a0I\u0027m married to Jonathan, and after years of struggle and losses - about which I\u0027ve blogged and been very open - we had the amazing and miraculous Hannah Zen in August 2013. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015 we moved to Spain, where I spend my days podcasting, writing, and raising babygirl. I podcast about history for a number of reasons, but mostly because it builds empathy, and connects us to humanity in a deeper, more profound way. If we can understand, from a span of 500 years, why people did something - and really get it from their point of view - it\u0027s not so much more of a stretch to understanding people with whom we disagree today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s easier to practice with episodes from 500 years ago, because they don\u0027t have the same sort of charge that issues today do for us. They\u0027re not as immediate. But once we start working that muscle, being able to fully understand, and get in the world of someone with whom we have completely opposite viewpoints becomes a possibility. And if there\u0027s one thing the world could use right now, it\u0027s people seeing things from different perspectives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone for your support and listenership, and for being part of something that\u0027s way bigger than just dates. We are creating a more peaceful world, where people talk and try to understand each other, through understanding their shared histories and humanity.\u00a0",
