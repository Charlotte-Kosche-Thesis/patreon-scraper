    "summary": "\"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed be the renewing of your mind to prove what the will of God is, that which is good, acceptable, and perfect.\" Romans 12:2\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis verse has launched me into my future so that I may attain the life I have envisioned for myself. Through God\u0027s stedfast love ANYTHING is possible.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Right now I am teaming up with my friend Kenan and his project called GermiNation. The purpose of GermiNation is to help direct people to their purpose and give them a retreat from common day to day life in order to grow and/or heal in any aspect of life; spiritually, mentally, physically, etc. Whatever your goals may be, GermiNation is here to support and provide. Kenan has about 20 acres in Sevierville, TN. This is where we are building the home base for the project. It is a very peaceful and beautiful piece of land. I have dedicated a good portion of my time to help his vision for the land break ground and take on increased formation. We are making great headway. There are many aspects to this retreat center, some of which include self-sustainability, organic farming, bible studies,\u00a0yoga and meditation, praise and worship, alternative energy, and more. There is much room for growth and new innovative ideas as we fine tune and progress the details. There is very much work to be done.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I personally came here to get a change of pace, and utilize my time as I focus on my goals and purpose. Getting in tune with God and nature out here has been so great, it\u0027s really kind of hard to put it into words. I have placed myself into a disciplined and consistent routine of prayer, reading, meditation, 4 hours of farm work (everyday with a sabbath), drum practice, guitar practice, writing, Spanish study, physical activity, various research and study, preparation and strategizing, of course cooking and cleaning, and more (there are not enough hours in the day).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 GermiNation is a very positive project with the intention of touching people\u0027s lives and encouraging new world systems designed to make our planet prosperous for us and for future generations. We\u0027re are making steps everyday to see this plan come into fruition. With this page I am asking for your financial support so that I may keep my time and energy focused on this venture of serving God, others, and improving my own life.
