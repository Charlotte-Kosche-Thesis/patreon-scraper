My fiction is primarily about transformation and growth, my poetry is about politics and memory, and all of it in one way or another is informed by being a transgender person growing up and living in Scotland\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI perform in the spoken word scene in Glasgow and Edinburgh and I publish my stories in local literary zines.\u00a0As you will appreciate, this doesn\u0027t pay the bills very readily. With this Patreon I aim with your support, first: to pay the bills so that I can keep on producing poems and fiction and, second: develop my writing and performance by going to workshops and by\u00a0returning to university in September to study creative writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePlan for the next year...\u003c/h2\u003eI plan to produce readings of my published stories and poems, and over the longer term produce chapbooks to support my fiction, poetry and studies. Of course I will be writing new stories and poems, which I will be performing in open mics and polishing until I feel they are ready for my patrons. In return for your support I will produce monthly readings of my published work and new poems and produce ebook collections and printed books of the work that I read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFor the future...\u003c/h2\u003eOver the next year I will be working to produce a one-hour show around my poetry and politics. Your support will help me achieve this and when it happens, you will have reserved seats, and recognition as sponsors of the production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\u00a0I also write screenplays, including the award-winning short film High Heels Aren\u0027t Compulsory. With the support of patrons I aim to write more films and to put together productions. Look for videos in the future of films in the works and readings from screenplays in production as we go on."
