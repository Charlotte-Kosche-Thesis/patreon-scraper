Sometimes I make prints and other fun things. You may know me by my adopt a robot series of paintings - I\u0027ve recently topped 700 original paintings in this series alone and am starting to think about my second book for it. Maybe you\u0027ve seen my space colonies, other-worldly beings, or any number of shows, events, or projects I\u0027ve done. If you don\u0027t know of me and have somehow stumbled upon my page, thank you for checking it out. I hope you\u0027ll consider being a patron. Every dollar I receive will go toward expanding my reach, expanding my work, and hopefully bringing happiness to you and all those who see and connect with what I do. If you\u0027re unable to contribute at this time, I hope you\u0027ll still join me on my journey and follow my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo all my current patrons, thank you for the support, encouragement, kind words, awesome messages, and all the love. You keep me pushing forward. You keep me focused on my vision. You keep me doing what I\u0027m here to do.
