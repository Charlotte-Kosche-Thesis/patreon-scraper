My \u0027world\u0027 is continually being manifested from my own experiences, trauma, loss/grief, obsessional imagery and hallucinations and is continually being refined through CONSTANT practice. My goal in my mixed media pieces is to engage my audience through nostalgic children\u0027s book-esque themes while still expressing subtle hints to my own apprehensiveness of the external world. \u003cbr\u003eI am beginning a new project because I want to create a balance between my Escapism pieces and confronting and coping with reality. That being said, I am about to begin a webcomic series centered around growing up amidst the most detrimental and significant drug epidemic in American history. Through this I will share significant lessons I\u0027ve learned through my own first hand experience with substance abuse, the innumerable drug-fueled events I\u0027ve witnessed, and the hundreds and hundreds of stories I\u0027ve heard over time, in addition to discontentments with Big Pharma in attempt to create critical conversation and thinking, through dark humor.\u003cbr\u003eMy art is for everyone who finds it visually appealing but particularly: socially isolated children, children and adolescents who have lost friends, anyone who has struggled with addiction in the past, and anyone currently battling it.\u003cbr\u003eMy primary goal, above all is to encourage my peers to discover their preferred creative outlet to keep their minds at ease and occupied, particularly any adolescents who struggle with the chronic restlessness and perpetual dissatisfaction with the current moment, that comes with being the host of an addictive personality."
