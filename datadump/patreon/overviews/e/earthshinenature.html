nonprofit, organization that passionately works to promote wildlife and nature awareness and conservation, and renewable energy and Electric Vehicle (EV) education and adoption locally and regionally with unique outreach programming and worldwide via the internet.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy first goal with ENP is to work to inspire you, and everyone I meet - to better understand, respect, and care for all our shared wildlife, wild places and our shared environment and the important roles they all play in a healthy earth and for healthy humans today and for future generations.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy second goal with ENP is to work to educate you on better ways we can work individually and together to leave a smaller\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_footprint\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eecological footprint\u003c/a\u003e and have a smaller, more thoughtful, science-supported impact on the precious earth and the wildlife, wild places, and ecosystems that mesh together to give us all with the grand gift of life.\u00a0 There are many great ways to do this but I feel that one of the easiest ways we can have an impact is through the adoption of - small or large scale - energy efficiency,\u00a0 renewable energy technologies, and electric transportation choices to power and to move our lives today, tomorrow and far into the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs director of ENP I work very hard to make inspiration grow and to sow the seeds of change for my students, campers, visitors, and for my patrons.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI do this for my students and visitors through my unique mix of science supported wildlife conservation classes and projects at the ENP/Trails Science and Nature Center Classroom. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI do it for my outreach programming participants through hands-on outreach programming at camps, schools, birthday parties, businesses, fairs, and special events in the Western NC, Upstate SC, Northeast Georgia, and east Tennessee areas. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI do it for my worldwide audience of Patrons\u00a0via the internet

Both Trails Carolina and Trails Momentum students work with naturalist \"Science\" Steve as they call him, to care for these animals during scheduled class times.

He spent his early years chasing snakes, lizards, salamanders and more all over the mountains, valleys, swamps, and beaches of the southeastern USA. During his college years, Steve studied wildlife and fisheries management, recreation management, and zooarchaeology and when not in the lab, he could be found in the fields and forests leading others in pursuit of wild animals, wild places, and fun with a purpose. \t\u003cbr\u003e\tSteve\u2019s passions are wildlife awareness and conservation, public nature education, renewable energy, electric vehicles, and photography. \t\u003cbr\u003e\tIn his early years he was greatly inspired to follow his dream of working with wildlife, first by his parents Catherine and Clayton O\u2019Neil, who gave him a love for wildlife, science, and nature. Later, Steve was influenced by Marlin Perkins and Jim of Wild Kingdom, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, Sir David Attenborough, Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, Grizzly Adams, Marty Stouffer\u2019s Wild America, Harry Butler, Aldo Leopold, Joe Duckett, Charlie Green, Steve Irwin \u201cThe Crocodile Hunter,\u201d \u201cSurvivorman\u201d Les Stroud, John Rucker, Captain Paul Watson of The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Andrea Marshall, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Leilani Munter, Bob Harris, Carol Ruckdeschel and Elon Musk. \t\u003cbr\u003e\tSteve has worked in several interesting seasonal naturalist, educator, and ranger positions at many well known private, State and National parks, private inns, camps, schools and farms, some of which include: Earthshine Discovery Center, The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Hammocks Beach State Park, Chimney Rock State Park, Falling Creek Camp for Boys, Camp Illahee, Flat Rock Nature Center, and The Inn on Little Saint Simons Island. His job titles have included seasonal park ranger, backcountry trail ranger, interpretive naturalist, camp counselor, nuisance black bear, wild boar, and rattlesnake trapper (no snakes or bears were ever harmed) and aircraft mechanics assistant. Steve now works as naturalist at Trails Carolina/Trails Momentum near DuPont Forest, NC. \t\u003cbr\u003e\tSteve has conducted thousands of educational nature and wildlife presentations to countless numbers of children and adults over the last 25 years. He has led student and camper groups and expeditions in forests, rivers, lakes, mountains, caves, swamps and dunes in search of all things and all places wild and wonderful. \t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cimg src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/15083725_1491248695.2922_funddescription.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eWildlife Rescue \u0026amp; Rehabilitation: \u003c/strong\u003eSteve is a volunteer wildlife rehabilitator specializing in reptiles and Opossums and he frequently gets his Trails students directly involved with caring for injured and displaced wildlife which are often released back into their native habitats after recovery. \u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eVolunteer Work:\u003c/strong\u003e Steve also puts in hundreds of hours each year keeping track of several Eastern box turtles, Timber rattlesnakes, and Rat snakes via radio tags in the forests at Trails Carolina and formerly at the Earthshine Discovery Center. \u003cbr\u003e\tAfter work and on weekends Steve also puts in many volunteer hours with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission\u2019s Wildlife Diversity program monitoring reptiles, amphibians and bats. \t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eNon Profit: \u003c/strong\u003eIn 2010 Steve formed Earthshine Nature Programs, a very small, grass-roots, 501c3 nonprofit, donation funded and volunteer operated organization that works to promote wildlife conservation and renewable energy and Electric Vehicle (EV\u2019s) education through unique citizen science-based wildlife conservation projects and hands-on outreach programming at camps, schools, birthday parties and special events in the WNC area. Steve\u2019s primary goals with his wildlife outreach programming are to inspire people to better understand, respect, and care for all of our native wildlife and wild places and the roles they play in a healthy earth and healthy humans. \u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eElectric Vehicles and Renewable Energy: \u003c/strong\u003eSteve has been daily driving a 2012 Nissan Leaf all-electric car since mid-2013. He believes that EV\u2019s (especially when charged and powered by renewable energy sources) are the future of automotive transportation because they are economical, more environmentally friendly, easier to maintain, fun to drive, energy secure, and simply better in every way than their fossil fuel burning counterparts. Through ENP, Steve offers an outreach education program that focuses on owning and driving EV\u2019s for anyone in the western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina areas. In 2013 Steve co-founded WNC\u2019s first electric vehicle car club\u2014the Blue Ridge EV Club\u2014as the go-to place for EV owners and prospectors to use as a resource for everything EV. Steve has been an avid supporter of renewable energy \u2013 especially solar \u2013 since first learning about it in the 6th grade. Over the years Steve has used and demonstrated to his students small-scale solar to power devices systems to power a small RV but recently he and his students finished construction of a large-scale solar power station to power his science classroom and nonprofit office. Steve practices what he preaches to the best of his ability in the hopes that in leading by example he will empower and inspire everyday people to create good and positive change their lives and in doing so \u2013 \u003cbr\u003e\t\tchange the world. \t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eMusic: \u003c/strong\u003eSteve also plays the Australian didgeridoo and offers concerts and didgeridoo crafting workshops for all ages.\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eSocial Media: \u003c/strong\u003eSteve is active in online social media and believes it to be a great educational resource when managed correctly.
