    "summary": "One woman, one drum, many stories. I\u0027m telling my story of this wonderful, terrible, pivotal age that we live in. As a latter-day Bard, I am finding the connections between all of us, the things that bring us together and make us remember that we\u0027re one human race, sharing this beautiful planet with the rest of life. I write songs that I hope will stand the test of time, that can be sung by anyone, that catch in your ear but grow in meaning as they become familiar. Right now, I busk and blog, but am working toward an album and a book. I\u00a0will soon be\u00a0offering exclusive downloads, as I get more material recorded, and with support I can move from a laptop and a microphone to studio time. \u003cbr\u003eSamples of my work can be heard here: \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bartstationbard\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/bartstationbard\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I began this journey, I only had a mind to go to the lands of my ancestors, to complete the circle they began when they came to the United States. I am an experienced busker and managed to earn enough money to make the first trip. I am also a member of the Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids, and ended up at two Druid Camps where I found my voice, and my task. I am blogging about the means of connection I have found in Wales, England, and Scotland, and how it has deepened my work in California, where I have lived my whole life. If you choose to support me, you will have a front row seat on that journey as I find a way to spend an entire year in the biome of my ancestors, and to find deeper ways to connect to the people and the land. From the stone circles of Albion to the redwood forests of California, from the heart of the city to the heart of the forest, I am finding ways to listen and to connect that can enrich your life and show you how to create a deeper relationship with the land you live in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m doing all of this work on practically no money, I have had--and will continue to have--some pretty interesting adventures. For instance, the night I traveled from Dublin to Holyhead I spent the night on the train station floor, then traveled to London to discover that the hostel I\u0027d booked--the cheapest in town--was really the last step before the street for emigre kids. I\u0027d been up for about twenty hours at that point, badly need a shower and some sleep, and the girls in the room with me spoke nothing but French, and wanted nothing to do with me. I managed to befriend another girl who was also a bit of an outcast, and the adventure went on from there. On a deeper note, after that night I went to an experiential Druid Camp where I ended up becoming part of a very interesting experiment in applied potions making. I had to find a way to do the work in California, where not all of the ingredients needed were possible to source, and to return the following year to finish the brew. Think of what interesting predicaments I could get into--and learn from--if I were able to spend an entire year in that biome, sleeping rough, busking, and writing about it? \u003cbr\u003eMy blog can be found here: \u003ca href=\"https://bartstationbard.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://bartstationbard.wordpress.com/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
