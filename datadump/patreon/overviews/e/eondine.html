    "summary": "\"There are a number of old stories hidden in the canopies of forests and under ancient hills for safe-keeping. Most of these tales were not passed down by word of human tongue, and those that do remain have been diluted after each generation and almost entirely forgotten. But the Earth does not forget. Just like the mother who birthed you will remember the day you were born even after she is transformed or reunited with your kin in the next world of wind and shadow, these memories will remain engraved on the Earth, from which all stories are rooted and grow. They can be found, written in the gnarled branches and roots of old oak trees. They are scrawled on stones and leaves in the symbols of the forest folk. They are the Earth\u2019s stories, and if you listen, she will tell them to you.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n- eOndine\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://carbonmade-media.accelerator.net/36991044;1000x668.jpeg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHello! \n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am eOndine, a freelance illustrator currently living in the Hudson Valley, New York. I illustrate earth stories that grow out of the ground and waves, but can sometimes be obscured by modern life.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJoining Patreon will allow me to share my thoughts, inspiration, work behind the scenes, and finished stories with a tight-knit community of nature, myth, and art lovers. Not only will patrons get to see the end results of my work, but also my processes, messes, and growth on my path as an artist (it will all be here)!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the price ranging from of a cup of tea to a new book per month, you can get exclusive access to Patron-only posts, coloring pages, original illustrations, and stories. The idea behind my work is to open our eyes to the magic in the natural world that already exists through folktales, fairytales, and myth, and for everyone seeing my art to feel cozy, inspired, and enchanted.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs this page and my work develop, I endeavor to add many more rewards and find new creative ways to share this world of myth and nature with you! Joining me on this path through enchanted forests and paint-stained fingers means that I can have the time to treat you while continuing to do what I love, and I can\u0027t thank you enough!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLooking forward to getting to know you and making magic together!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMuch love,\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\neOndine\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://carbonmade-media.accelerator.net/36990658;796x1000.png\"\u003e"
