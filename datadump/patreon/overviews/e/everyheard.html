I would rather give my talents away for FREE, but I gotta pay some bills! (Student loans, health insurance, transportation, and yes- some credit cards). I have been doing this work for several years now, and I prefer to remain unaffiliated with any religious organization who might encourage me to do mission work. My only divine mission is to bring people together through song, inspire them to express their thoughts and emotions through art and sound, empower them to co-envision a world of harmony!"
