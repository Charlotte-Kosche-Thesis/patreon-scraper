Cinema has been around in one form or another for about a century and a quarter and with hundreds of movies coming out every year, the backlog alone would be insane.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut gosh-darnit if I\u0027m not gonna try and get close.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m lucky enough to live in one of the increasingly rare cities that still has a video rental store.  They\u0027re not a sponsor, so I\u0027m reluctant to say their name, but I will say that they cater toward renting videos to families.  I was there a few weeks ago with my wife, trying to figure out what we were going to watch that night.  We passed by aisles and aisles full of movies that I will never watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr at least not without a podcast audience listening to me talk about it after.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo an idea was born.  I am going to watch every movie in the entire store.\u003cbr\u003e"
