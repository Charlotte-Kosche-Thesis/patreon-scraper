    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHELLO AND WELCOME\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey there,\u003cbr\u003ewelcome to my little patreon and let me first start by saying thank you for stopping by. Most if not all of you know me as the artist Brayburnman. I draw mainly cartoons and such with the main focus of bondage and its been that way for a long time and will continue to be like that for much longer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the question comes to why are we here? Well the short answer is that school, right now I currently go to school full time, balance a job, and keep the family together at home so I am stretched pretty thin and already accumulating a pretty hefty debt that uncle SAM will soon be wanting to collect. And honestly I would just like this to be able to help with the small things such as gas, or my adobe cc subscription.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE DA ACCOUNT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the most part the DA account will be perfectly fine and really unchanged, but first and foremost I\u0027m not using this to lock art away behind a Pay wall. Anything that I finish up will show up both here, DA and on other sites based upon the sexual content. The only thing that will be absent from the DA account is the fact that I will no longer upload sketches, that is instead reserved for here exclusively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE REWARDS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the most part the rewards for pledging is\u00a0really just a way to select and vote upon all the sketches that I have done to see what piece gets made first. The second part is a way to handle . Regularly my commissions. Now a commission from me will be about 39 dollars, which is high at least for my skill level, but the reasoning behind this is simply put that I currently make 13 dollars an hour, and a regular commission is comprised of 3 parts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe sketch\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLineart\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eColoring and shading\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAnd each step will roughly take an hour per step. I know that some people can afford that but I know that some people can\u0027t due to special reasons.\u00a0So to remedy this I would like to start a raffle that will happen bi-weekly where I do a full colored comm for a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOME RULES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul style=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlease don\u0027t go posting or leaking the sketches everywhere, I have no way to stop you but still just be cool.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDon\u0027t go making extra accounts so that you can enter yourself multiple times for the raffle.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe commission will be a single character that is completely colored and all. If you should choose you can add on more money to add some extra bells and whistles but the reward is a standard commission.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf I contact you about winning the raffle, please try to get back to me ASAP otherwise I will have to give the prize to another person with 4 days being the max time to claim your prize.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to my knowledge that should be it. \u00a0I would like to try and maybe do a little more but we can work on that later on. \u00a0Once more, thank you for stopping by and checking it out."
