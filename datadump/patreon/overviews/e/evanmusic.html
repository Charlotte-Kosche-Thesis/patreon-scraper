Lawrence\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy measure of a good song is one that comes from another Source, (other than a clever thinker) and brings some kind of healing to myself or other people, whether through laughing, tears or surprising insight. Over the years, some people have told me that songs I felt I\u0027d \"caught\" from that Source -- have helped them to heal in some way or another. This makes me want to work to bring more songs like that into the world (although is it really up to me?...see the quote below for more notes on my process).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, after much prodding, I have made this page in order to discover how much others around me think it a good use of my time to attempt to court the muse for more such songs. I also just want to generally make recordings of these songs available for listening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(To find songs, go to \"Posts\" and give a listen.)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo first of all, I hope you enjoy the songs here.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eIf you choose to go further and become a patron, you are telling me through your monetary spending that you believe I should put more of my energy to creating music.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making music. For supporting me in it here, whether by giving or simply by listening\u003cstrong\u003e, thank you so so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith big love and gratitude,\u003cbr\u003eEvan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. - Here\u0027s a quote from the poet, William Stafford, which has been most influential on me as a writer and best describes my process:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"A writer is not so much someone who has something to say as he is someone who has found a process that will bring about new things he would not have thought of if he had not started to say them. That is, he does not draw on a reservoir; instead, he engages in an activity that brings to him a whole succession of unforeseen stories, poems, essays, plays, laws, philosophies, religions, or\u0026#8211;but wait!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in school, from the first when I began to try to write things, I felt this richness. One thing would lead to another; the world would give and give. Now, after twenty years or so of trying, I live by that certain richness, an idea hard to pin, difficult to say, and perhaps offensive to some. For there are strange implications in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne implication is the importance of just plain receptivity. When I write, I like to have an interval before me when I am not likely to be interrupted. For me, this means usually the early morning, before others are awake. I get pen and paper, take a glance out of the window (often it is dark out there), and wait. It is like fishing. But I do not wait very long, for there is always a nibble\u0026#8211;and this is where receptivity comes in. To get started I will accept anything that occurs to me. Something always occurs, of course, to any of us. We can\u0026#8217;t keep from thinking. Maybe I have to settle for an immediate impression: it\u0026#8217;s cold, or hot, or dark, or bright, or in between! Or well, the possibilities are endless. If I put down something, that thing will help the next thing come, and I\u0026#8217;m off. If I let the process go on, things will occur to me that were not at all in my mind when I started. These things, odd or trivial as they may be, are somehow connected. And if I let them string out, surprising things will happen.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
