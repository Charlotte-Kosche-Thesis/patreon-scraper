The goals we have are based on going pro on Adobe Creative Cloud ($49/mo without stock photos, $79/mo with stock images), going pro on DropBox ($9.99/mo), and paying for long range satellite internet so that we can stay current on our posts (cost varies by usage but basing it on our mobile data usage just for email, social media, and posting photos it would be approximately $120-$135/mo). \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eRight now we are limited by our current inexpensive cameras and free software. Plus getting good WiFi reception on the boat is spotty most of the time. So we appreciate every person who signs up to help us bring the best quality videos and photos to the world. Even sharing this profile is a big help.\u00a0Thank you so much for your interest in our journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://emunaendeavor.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEmunaEndeavor.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHome the long way \u0027round\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://emunaendeavor.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://emunaendeavor.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/ship-wheel-logo_home-the-long-way-round.jpg?w=195\u0026amp;h=241\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
