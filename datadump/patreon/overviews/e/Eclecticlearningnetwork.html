More families are questioning the blatant and silent challenges that exist within the educational system: teaching to the test; school-to-prison pipeline; underfunding; overcrowding; bullying; biased curriculum; institutional racism; and lack of teachers of color. As a product of the public school system, I initially had difficulty pushing the envelope of my conditioning in order to explore learning methods outside the brick-and-mortar walls. After a less than savory discriminatory experience at a local public school, the silence in response to my concerns became deafening. Our family\u2019s official homeschool journey then began, and it continues to be one of the most liberating experiences of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a creator of Patreon has been a decision I have been mulling over for the past year and a half.
