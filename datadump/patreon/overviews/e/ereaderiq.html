Our goal is to help you make easier, faster \nand smarter purchase decisions for your kindle. We strive to help you spend less time shopping and more time reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrior to June 2016, eReaderIQ was able to support itself by earning income from the Amazon Associates affiliate program. What this meant is, each time a user purchased a Kindle book using a link from my site, Amazon gave me a small commission. Those commissions were enough to support the site as well as my family for about 5 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of June 10th, Amazon has disabled my affiliate account due to violations to their Terms of Service. Apparently, I was not allowed to display historic ebook prices, nor was I allowed to send tagged (affiliated) links via email. I was aware of the email rule, but, based on conversations I\u0027d had with employees within the Amazon Associates program through the years, I felt like they were willing to overlook that violation. They were not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout the ability to track historic prices, eReaderIQ would have no purpose, so I can\u0027t simply fix the violation and reapply for the program. I am in need of a new way to monetize my site. With the popularity eReaderIQ has gained in the past few years, I feel that Patreon is a good place to start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You!\u003cbr\u003e"
