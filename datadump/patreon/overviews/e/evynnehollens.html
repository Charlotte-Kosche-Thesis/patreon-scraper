Since the Internet has made it possible to connect with people all over the world, we are all able to communicate with so many more people.

This is the power of music and art and I wanted to be a part of this movement! Also, the community online has been so welcoming \u0026amp; supportive of my husband\u0027s work, it seemed natural that I follow a little in his footsteps, while also directing my own path.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we talked about me becoming involved in Patreon, I wanted to wait until I felt I had earned it.

Anything I receive through Patreon will go toward my production expenses, and nothing else. I will be checking in daily with my activity feed to hear your suggestions and thoughts so you can be part of my creative process if you do decide to become a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eIf you would rather support me by purchasing my music, you\u00a0can do so here:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.loudr.fm/artist/peter-hollens/SrEXq\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.loudr.fm/artist/evynne-hollens/uFwCA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t have the means to buy a song, or be a patron, I thank you for simply listening\u00a0to my music!
