    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI love being a film critic!\u003c/strong\u003e It combines my three passions: movies, writing, and telling people what they did wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the movie-reviewing biz has changed dramatically since I started, back in the last century. Most newspapers (to the extent that they exist at all) don\u0027t have full-time critics anymore. There\u0027s no shortage of websites that run movie reviews, but there \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e a shortage of websites that will pay people to write them, and a surplus of people vying for those slots. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve arrived at this new strategy: \u003cstrong\u003ewriting movie reviews for free at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ericdsnider.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEricDSnider.com\u003c/a\u003e and asking readers to become patrons.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s simple: \u003cstrong\u003epledge $1 a month\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0You can pledge more (thanks!), but a dollar is plenty. Patreon charges your PayPal account or credit card on the 1st of each month. If it\u0027s a buck, you probably won\u0027t even notice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DOES YOUR PLEDGE GET YOU?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eReviews of new movies\u003c/strong\u003e, usually on opening weekend. It\u0027s impossible to review (or even watch) \u003cem\u003eevery\u003c/em\u003e movie that comes out, but I try to hit all the wide releases and a smattering of interesting smaller films. Everything new that I see gets at least a couple hundred words.\u00a0Reviews are written using only the finest, freshest words in the English language. All punctuation marks are locally sourced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- The EDS-ASAP service.\u003c/strong\u003e Within an hour of seeing a new movie, I\u0027ll email participating patrons with a brief instant reaction to it. Because sometimes you can\u0027t wait for the full review; sometimes you need to know \u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eAccess to the vast\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ericdsnider.com/movie-review-index/\"\u003eEric D. Snider archives\u003c/a\u003e, containing more than 3,700 movie reviews. Did you know there even were that many movies? There are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The peaceful assurance that comes from knowing that I am out there watching movies, often so you don\u0027t have to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! I hope you find my reviews as useful, entertaining, and worthy of $1 a month as I intend them to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEric D. Snider\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. Some of my reviews are republished (\"syndicated,\" if you will) elsewhere, including at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://crookedmarquee.com/\"\u003eCrooked Marquee\u003c/a\u003e, where I\u0027m the editor. Those outlets pay a few dollars per review, but not enough (not even close) to constitute a double dip or to replace Patreon. Reviews are paid for by you, the patrons, and are always available in their entirety at EricDSnider.com.\u003cbr\u003e"
