The name \"Enla\" literally means \"in Her,\" and it came to me in a dream \nabout ten years ago. Today, this word shows us where healing and wisdom \ncan be found. In you, and in our Mother Earth. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs an experienced life coach and wise woman, my clients\u0027 many successes come from building a solid internal foundation.

I look forward to being part of your support network. With your monthly contribution of $10 or more, you\u0027ll gain access to all of this:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDiscover new ways to manage your priorities, your time, and your personal energy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003cli\u003eGain confidence in your ability to navigate challenges and choose well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAccess tools and skills for life-changing emotional healing and personal growth.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFeel a whole lot less crazy by joining a community where you are treated with respect, and \"woman\u0027s intuition\" is a professional tool worth developing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eReach for goals you never thought possible before because they mattered too much.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTake a deep breath because this is one intense list of benefits you\u0027re about to unlock!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy plan is to make the tools, skills and stories that clients have found most useful in their own healing/growth process more accessible for everyone.

Did you catch it? Were you intimidated? Entertained by my 15-pound-black-cat-named-Vader demanding his share of my chair? I find that life coaching is a lot less scary if I can give simple real-world examples, and mix a little humor in with the deep stuff. Plus, every time I get too serious or too full of myself, the Universe (or Vader) reminds me that I\u0027m cool, but I\u0027m not THAT cool. (Wait until you see the outtake videos!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s what we just talked about in the video:\u003c/strong\u003e Don\u0027t let fear of failure stop you from sharing your own personal awesome with the world. And while we\u0027re at it, GO AHEAD AND START NOW. If I\u0027d waited to make this video or launch this channel until everything was perfect-- we\u0027d all still be waiting. Life isn\u0027t perfect, and that\u0027s okay. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn fact, when things don\u0027t go as planned (like when I got that news from my doctors), I remind myself that the universe is making space in my life for unexpected miracles. For serendipity and maybe even for great outcomes that I never imagined I could have. So what are your goals? What do you want your life to be? And how can I help?\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e**ENLA Sanctuary Life Coaches and Staff are not licensed counselors, psychiatrists, doctors, social workers, lawyers or financial advisors.
