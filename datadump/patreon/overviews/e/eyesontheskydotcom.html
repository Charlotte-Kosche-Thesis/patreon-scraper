    "summary": "I make astronomy videos that help viewers understand telescopes, and find things to see in the night sky. Light pollution blocks some of those objects (like galaxies). So astronomy and light pollution are intimately connected. But most people don\u0027t realize that light pollution may negatively affect them, via poor sleep and harm to health. Too much and the wrong kinds of light at night hurts sleep, and are also linked to breast cancer, prostate cancer, and other health issues. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\u00a0I make videos on how to find/observe:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - I\u0027d include Pluto, but it\u0027s REALLY faint!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInteresting features to see on the Moon, even with very small telescopes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNebulae, Star Clusters and Double stars\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGalaxies (these are hard to see so there\u0027s not many videos on them)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\tI do this for objects visible\u00a0even through light pollution, while talking about ways to reduce the problem. Because it\u0027s not just about stars (you\u0027ll see what can be seen). It\u0027s also about YOUR sleep (and how to make it better). So you win in more ways than one - you get to learn about what you can find and see, and hopefully understand what you can do to create better light at night conditions that help sleep - and also help the stars too as a nice side benefit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution helps me continue to make that connection and educate people about both.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m a Communications / Theater major with a passion for astronomy. When I decided in 2008 to work on reducing light pollution by creating Eyes on the Sky, that journey took me to the understanding that humans need light during the day, but dark at night. Our artificially-lit environment at night is harming our sleep, and increasingly is tied to breast cancer, prostate cancer, and perhaps other health issues like depression and anxiety. I educate about the fantastic sights people can see up in the night sky naked eye, with binoculars or a small telescope even from light polluted cities, and work to get people involved in the fight to create good sleep conditions for everyone. And I try to always do that in fun and entertaining ways.\u00a0",
