Saunders, because it\nsounds more author-ish) and you, dear reader, are most welcome to my\nPatreon page. Here, I release weekly chapters of my latest novels, currently a\nhigh fantasy series inspired by sword and sorcery epics of decades past, as\nwell as many of the games that have spoken to me through the years. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I\u2019ve come to learn, it can be\ndifficult for new authors, artists, and creators of all kinds to make a name\nfor themselves, and Patreon is one of the ways the world of the internet age is attempting to\ncompensate for this ever-climbing barricade. Much like\nother crowd-funding sites, Patreon allows people who are interested in a cause\nor work to contribute directly to the individuals behind it, while snagging\nmulti-tiered rewards along the way. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFollowing the completion of each novel\u0027s run on Patreon, and a short, early-access window for my patrons, each novel will still be released on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/S.J.-Saunders/e/B00FK4C9MI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22S.%20J.%20Saunders%22\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBarnes \u0026amp; Noble\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=S.J.%20Saunders\u0026amp;fcsearchfield=Author\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKobo\u003c/a\u003e, and the like.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA torrent of thanks to\nthose who\u0027ve supported me thus far, and, to all newcomers who\u0027ve even taken the\ntime to peruse my work, thank you for showing even a glimmer of interest. Should you choose to support me, whatever\nthe method, I hope that my words will bring you joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n~Seth\u003cbr\u003e\nsjsaunders.com\u003cbr\u003e"
