    "summary": "Hey thanks for dropping by! I\u0027m Erin Sith, a conservative free speech and 2nd amendment activist, speaker, writer, and livestreamer from the Bay Area; you may have seen my content from many of last year\u0027s west coast rallies/protests/riots, as well as my frequent appearances on Fox New B-roll footage(LOL!) I\u0027m also transgender, which offers me a unique perspective as a conservative trans person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFriends, I\u0027m going to be honest with you: these are dangerous times in which we\u0027re living, and I feel that documenting the increasing assault on free speech and even safety of activists, or just normal people, is important. The west coast has made it increasingly dangerous professionally, socially, and physically to be conservative. I\u0027ve been traveling all across the west to capture all this on livestreams, but as the number of events increases, so does the cost and expense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support me on Patreon, I can continue to cover more events on the west coast, and nationally as well. You can see my work here\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/eesmith4/videos\u00a0and my speech at the Conservative Women for America event in Las Vegas here:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/eesmith4/posts/10103531820649966\u00a0to get an idea of what you will be supporting. Additionally, as a trans woman, I have met and collaborated with many cross-political efforts, like Pink Pistols/Operation Blazing Sword, and I\u0027m able to reach a different audience than most conservative speakers can. I\u0027ve met countless other transwomen who feel silenced but support Conservative/MAGA/2nd Amendment causes, and have encouraged me to continue to speak out for them. By supporting me, you support the largely silent conservative trans community, and help make it safer for not just trans people, but any conservatives to have open dialogue anywhere in the country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me on patreon not only helps me make it to more events, but increases my profile and enables me to get more interviews, and help get the word out and create more opportunities for 2nd amendment supporters, conservatives, or just free speech advocates to get their message out. Supporting me supports the larger community, and helps enable future efforts to actually change things in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering supporting me, as every view, supporter, and dollar helps strengthen our common vision and creates more opportunities to share and create the world we want to live in."
