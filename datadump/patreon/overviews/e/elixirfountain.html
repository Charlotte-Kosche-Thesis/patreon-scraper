To date we have had guests like Jos\u00e9 Valim, Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, Rob Conery, and many more. But the Elixir Fountain didn\u2019t start as a Podcast; we have actually been reporting the news to the community since November 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in November 2013 the Elixir Fountain started as a weekly newsletter to promote language announcements, blog posts, projects and even community favorites like Elixir Sips. But like the language itself it had to evolve. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the summer of 2015, it was time for the Elixir Fountain to break new ground and the next step was a podcast. Since its inception, we have released 46 episodes and have over 100k listens from all over the world. In addition to the podcast listeners we reach over 4500 followers on twitter everyday. We are continually looking to improve on the quality and content we provide to the Elixir Community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does this mean for you? This is your opportunity to contribute to the success of the Elixir Fountain by giving just a little each month. Your contributions will help cover the costs of running the show and remove the need for sponsored ads. In addition, money collected that exceeds costs will help support other Elixir Community events. Together we can grow the Elixir Community from the ground up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
