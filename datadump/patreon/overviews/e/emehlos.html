It takes a tremendous amount of my time and resources to continue making, and as a new mom those things are in short supply.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eA little reader support keeps me going; enough would allow me much more time to work on the comic and even more projects that\u0027d doubtless be \u003cem\u003erelevant to your interests\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eNot to mention I\u0027m going to \u003cem\u003egive you things\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll supporters get access to the Patron-only content stream, which includes \nprocess walkthroughs, commentary on pages of the comic, special \noffers and more. Where possible, I intend to give persistent patrons a little more than promised in the pledge tiers listed (Patreon currently only allows for listing one-time premiums, and doesn\u0027t have any provision for cumulative donations).\u00a0 I\u0027d also like to routinely send out new wallpapers, downloads, etc., to folks who continue to support the comic.
