    "summary": "In 2011, Eclectic Full Contact Theatre was formed with the express purpose of producing live theatre that defied labels. Don\u0027t put us in a box, don\u0027t stuff us in a niche. We will do theatre of any style, any subject. And we\u0027ll bring the audience along for the ride--showing the nitty gritty of what goes into producing a decidedly analog entertainment medium in a digital age. Oh, and unlike way too many theatres in this town, we\u0027ll pay everybody too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s 2017 now, and while we\u0027ve been successful in accomplishing our goals, as we all know, money and the arts are too often ships that pass in the night. And then hit an iceberg. And sink. Like this metaphor. But we remain committed to being a company that refuses to go into a box. And so we turn to Patreon. Eclectic Full Contact will do what no theatre company in Chicago has done--create a complete online branch of content to help support its live theatre productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are we offering? For your monthly pledge, you can get access--before anyone else anywhere--to trailers for our shows, rehearsal videos, photos, comedy and novelty videos produced ONLY for Patreon, exclusive access to a theatre podcast where we discuss not only Eclectic, but the state of Chicago theatre, as well as the unique interview series by our company mascot, Yakko, the dog. There is a plethora of other amazing content, including the chance to have a say in what shows we produce in the coming season!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what do we get out of it? Well, aside from getting to make some really awesome content and entertain a bunch of people who may never have stepped foot inside a theatre, your pledge goes toward paying rent on the theatre space we use, and helping us keep on paying all our artists, even in the face of reduced funding for the arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please make a pledge and become a Patron. Analog. Digital. Working together. It\u0027s beyond labels. It\u0027s so outside the box it doesn\u0027t even know what a box is. Be a part of it. Be Eclectic. Make Full Contact."

     "about": "Eclectic Full Contact Theatre was founded in 2011 by a group of six seasoned theatre professionals (well some of us are pretty salty) who wanted to present work that was diverse in subject, style, and presentation (Eclectic, y\u2019see?) but also offer the theatre-going public the chance to connect with theatre in a way never offered before--by allowing them access to the entire rehearsal and production process. (Full Contact--see what we did there?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, we invite the public to watch and provide feedback and opinions at the first script read-thru, the final dress/tech rehearsal, and at weekly audience talkbacks during the run of the show. We also offer glimpses into exactly what it takes to put a show together through YouTube videos, Facebook posts, and blogs during the rehearsal process itself, all to give the audience a greater understanding of what theatre is and what it takes to produce the entertainment you see onstage. We believe this will forge a greater connection between audience and actor and help the audience feel more a part of the show itself. Theatregoers are the most loyal, passionate and dedicated of all audiences. They deserve more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo find out more about the work we do, and the shows we\u2019re presenting, go to www.eclectic-theatre.com\u003cbr\u003e",
