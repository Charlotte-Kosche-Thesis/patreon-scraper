    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Emily Elbert. I\u0027m an independent singer, guitarist, and songwriter. For the last decade, I\u0027ve been sharing my music through recording and playing shows all over the world. I\u0027m so grateful to be able to make a living through work that I care about so deeply, in a way that\u0027s aligned with my values. If you\u0027ve bought CDs, come to concerts, or shared my music with your friends over the years, thank you so much for helping make that possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started this Patreon page because I dream of being able to share more of the music that\u0027s in my heart. In lieu of a big record label footing the bill, I\u0027m approaching this from the ground up, drawing from the well of\u00a0community and collaboration. I\u0027m committed to giving my best work and highest integrity to the creation and release of my music. If you\u0027d like to support this effort, I\u0027d be so excited to have you on board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery person subscribed to my Patreon will get access to demos, unreleased music, and some cover songs that won\u0027t be released anywhere else. I\u0027ll also mail out some handwritten postcards and CDs to contributors. Every month, I\u0027ll release one new cover video of a song I love - and as this campaign grows, my goal is to share new original music each month or two. I won\u0027t exceed two paid releases a month.\u00a0Having access to my Patreon means you can stream the videos before anyone else, download the music I send, or even have a hand in choosing which songs I play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support this work, please consider pledging at a level that feels right to you. You can contribute per release, and set a monthly limit if you\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for listening, and for being a part of this unfolding process.\u00a0It\u0027s a blessing to be able to share in the music-making journey with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove!\u003cbr\u003eEmily\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2waqTXjflWQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"

     "about": "Emily Elbert weaves together a soul-folk blend of introspection and celebration. With a global, D.I.Y. spirit, she has carried her music around the world, playing over a thousand independent shows from Peru to Palestine. Anchored by intricate guitar work and jazz-steeped vocals, Emily\u2019s songs offer progressive perspective while paying tribute to the timeless. She has independently released four albums, and will release a new single, \"True Power\", in October 2017.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to her work as a solo artist, Emily has contributed her voice and guitar to projects ranging from local L.A. bands to Grammy-winning international acts.  Recently, she spent a year touring as a member of Esperanza Spalding\u2019s experimental music and theater project, \u201cEmily\u2019s D+Evolution\u201d. The group recorded an album to wide critical acclaim, and played shows ranging from the Late Show with Stephen Colbert to the Sydney Opera House.  She also lent her vocals to Dweezil Zappa\u2019s latest record, \"Via Zammata\", co-wrote Bruno Major\u0027s viral hit \"Easily\", and coming up, will join the band of Phish\u2019s Mike Gordon.\u003cbr\u003eSolo, Emily has had the honor of opening for acts including Leon Russell, Victor Wooten, G. Love \u0026amp; Special Sauce, and Richie Havens. Her music has garnered praise from publications like the Washington Post, Utne Reader, and Glamour Magazine, and won awards in the U.S. and U.K.. Through authentic song sharing, she strives for a deepening sense of human and spiritual connection that is accessible to all.\u003cbr\u003e",
