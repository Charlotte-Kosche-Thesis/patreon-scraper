    "summary": "For\nas long as I can remember, I\u2019ve had an affinity for art.\u00a0 Though it was nothing\nmore than something I was more enthusiastic about than not at all in my young school\nyears, it blossomed into a hobby in my early teens, and a love shortly\nthereafter.\u00a0 Unfortunately, a troubled home life led to an abandonment of the\ndreams I\u2019d looked out at with such starry eyes.\u00a0 The more discouragement I was\ndealt, the more I found in myself when I looked at the works of others.\u00a0\nEventually, I convinced myself that my dreams would forever be out of my reach.\u00a0\nFor the next several years, I went through the motions of trying to live a \u201cnormal\u201d\nlife. I dragged myself out of bed each day to go to a minimum wage job I hated,\nall the while being looked down upon by my employers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCome\nthe late months of 2012, I began to question my place in the world.\u00a0 \u201cWhat are\nyou doing here?\u201d a coworker asked me, seeing the sketchbook I\u2019d been drawing in\nduring my lunch break.\u00a0 Why was I there?\u00a0 Why had I determined that I would never\nbe good enough to be a professional artist?\u00a0 Surely it\u2019s not too late.\u00a0 Even if\nit takes me decades, surely I can still be able to stand alongside the\nprofessionals one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\nChristmas, I asked for a tablet; an inexpensive Bamboo.\u00a0 I practiced. I watched\nspeedpaints on YouTube until my eyes burned.\u00a0 I replicated the brush strokes of\nthe videos, desperately trying to understand how they achieved the effects that\nthey did.\u00a0 I practiced.\u00a0 I improved.\u00a0 Four years later, my skill has grown\nexponentially, and, at the behest of many of my closest friends, I began to\nseek to make a career of my skill. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough\ncommissions and this Patreon, I soon hope to be able to say that I never again\nneed to allow my dreams to die or my skills to gather dust while I spend my\ntime and energy making someone else rich.\u00a0 I have many passions and many skills\nthat I wish to improve, but drawing and painting are and always have been my\nlifeblood, even when I did not realize it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf\nyou would like to contribute to my dreams by being a patron, even if it is only $1 per month, it would mean the\nworld to me.\u00a0 As my Patreon grows, I will be reinvesting into myself by\nupgrading my hardware and software, and adding new perks and bonuses to the\ncurrent reward tiers at no extra cost, as well as new features and tiers coming\nwhen I have the ability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf\nyou have read this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u00a0 I look forward\nto all the great things that will come from this endeavor."
