I wouldn\u0027t be here if not for you! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love taking pictures (it\u0027s not just a hobby, it\u0027s a passion), especially of objects, I feel like they capture a sort of beauty that, while it surrounds us constantly, we seem to just pass by it unbeknownst.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main income right now is from ad revenue, especially from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://freerangestock.com/view_photog.php?photogid=2419\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFreerange Stock portfolio\u003c/a\u003e. On it you can find all kinds of cool pictures I take that, although still copyrighted, they are free AND royalty free, meaning you can use those pictures for free in academic, professional, non-profit, marketing ads, articles... Well you get the idea:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You can do nearly anything with the images, commercial or not.\" - \u003ca href=\"https://freerangestock.com/licensing.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFreerange\u0027s Stock License\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe idea behind Freerange Stock and Stock Vault is that both the website and the photographers get ad revenue, however, even with a few tens of thousands of views every month, adblockers take away about 93% of the ads. So basically, for every 100 people who view my pictures, only 7 actually see ads, which is really bad for me and other photographers who rely on those ads for revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill, I decided to make my photography a more active part in my life and I am hoping Patreon will help me with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you can find all kinds of cool stuff about the pictures I take, why I take them, participate in polls, access to non-compressed high-resolution versions of the pictures, and even participate in raffles where you can win a custom picture request! At the same time, you help a small independent photographer keep doing what he loves; creating free open photography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://freerangestock.com/view_photog.php?photogid=2419\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFreerange Stock Portfolio\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.stockvault.net/user/photos/174568/?s=v\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStock Vault Portfolio\u003c/a\u003e, I also have a \u003ca href=\"http://eddgypics.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlogspot\u003c/a\u003e and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://eddgypics.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e where you can keep up to date with my adventures, or simply enjoy some cool pics ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!
