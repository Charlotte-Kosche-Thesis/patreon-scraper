    "summary": "Thanks for checking this out. For the past 20 or so years, I have been making a life (and some semblance of a living) out of making art. I\u0027ve always been interested in interrogating the infrastructures of the art and performance worlds, and finding new ways of making ambitious work that is still accessible and accountable to my peers, rather than art-world authorities.\u003cbr\u003eIn the coming year, I am hoping to take some big creative risks and would love any help in making that happen!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAbout me/my work-\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am a Michigan-raised, Philadelphia-based printmaker, shadow\npuppeteer, paper-cut artist, etc., who has been lauded by the New York Times\nfor my \"spell-binding cut-paper animations.\" My work oscillates\nbetween the poles of apocalyptic anxieties and utopian yearnings, with an\nemphasis on empathy, transcendence and obsessive detail. I frequently work\ncollaboratively with musicians, theater performers, other artists and activist\ncampaigns. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a founding member of the international Justseeds Artists\u0027\nCooperative, a decentralized network of 30 artists committed to social,\nenvironmental, and political engagement. With members working from the U.S.,\nCanada, and Mexico, Justseeds operates both as a unified collaboration of\nsimilarly minded printmakers and as a loose collection of creative individuals\nwith unique viewpoints and working methods. We produce collective portfolios,\ncontribute graphics to grassroots struggles for justice, work collaboratively\nboth in- and outside the co-op, build large sculptural installations in\ngalleries, and wheatpaste on the streets\u2014all while offering each other daily\nsupport as allies and friends.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBoth as a member of Justseeds and as an individual, I have\nshown my print work across the US and Europe, including Biennales in Ljubljana,\nAthens, Quebec City and Pittsburgh, and group exhibits at the Queens Museum,\nthe Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, ABC No Rio, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,\nConcordia, PNCA and the University of Arizona. I have also had five solo\nexhibits. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n In addition to\nexhibiting print and paper-cut work, I have also explored the creation of\ninstallations in a variety of forms. For Justseeds\u2019 2009 exhibit \u003cem\u003eWhich Side Are You On?\u003c/em\u003e, which explored\nthemes of borders and segregation, I hand-cut a 30-foot paper fence that\nstretched across the entrance to the installation, forcing viewers to enter\nthrough a hole torn in the barrier. In \u003cem\u003eAn Other World, \u003c/em\u003e2014, I\ncreated an interactive immersive installation at Machines With Magnets\ngallery/studio in Pawtucket, RI. Inspired by medieval visions of the afterlife,\nscience-fiction landscapes and more modern/personal struggles with scarcity and\ndepression, this show combined intricate paper-cut scrolls, hanging banners and\nprojections. Viewers were encouraged to \u201cactivate\u201d these visions by moving the\nscrolls across overhead projectors and inserting their own shadows into the vistas\ncreated. Additional live performances with musical accompaniment were performed\nat the opening and closing events.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn a similarly interactive spirit was 2016\u2019s solo exhibit \u003cem\u003eThe Worlds Reverse- \u003c/em\u003ein which three\nscrolling panoramas that illuminated historic ballads were manipulated by\nviewers turning cranks, and tape recorded soundtracks by singer Shaina Kapeluck\nand multi-instrumentalist Julius Masri. Also included were series of thematically-related\nillustrated broadsides featuring texts solicited from contemporary authors-\nincluding poets Emily Abendroth and Tessa Landreau-Grasmuck, playwrights Erik\nEhn and Carlos Sirah, and fiction writer Alex Smith. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGrowing alongside and out of this practice as a visual\nartist, I have developed a unique style of performance that seeks to synthesize\nmy interests in text, movement, music and theater while centering a unique\nvisual sensibility. My approach to performance is rooted in the radical\nsocially engaged practice of puppetry defined and influenced by Bread and\nPuppet theater company. I apprenticed there in 2002, which has had a lasting\nimpact on my work in both form and content. In recent years, my shadow puppetry\npractice has increasingly relied on the use of overhead projectors, and been\ninterwoven with experimental music, improvisatory dance, and poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA few performances feel particularly relevant to the work I\nwish to create in coming years. The first of these is \u003cem\u003eBoundless: A Collaborative\nWork of Epic Theater, \u003c/em\u003ewhich\nwas staged in March 2014at\nthe Summer St. Theater in Providence, RI. I initiated, produced,\ndesigned sets and projections for and co-directed (with Sarah Lowry of the\nMissoula Oblongata theater troupe) this ambitious production with a cast of\nover 40 performers. Boundless combined projections, dance, puppetry,\ntheater and music -on the theme of dissolving borderlines (between people,\nnations, life and death, etc.).  Five different theater companies and artists\nfrom across the country were given short poetic prompts and asked to create\nscenes, to which Sarah and I then provided direction, designed projections, and\ncreated transitions before and after. The whole was then scored by a six-piece\nbrass band comprised of members of the What Cheer? Brigade.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003ePrisoner\u2019s Song \u003c/em\u003eis a performance created by\ncomposer Gelsey Bell and visual artist Erik Ruin, with director Rick Burkhardt,\n about the prison experience. Using shadow puppets and projections\nalongside a variety of musical idioms, the piece draws on historic ballads,\npoetry, audio interviews with people who have spent time in prison, and other\nprimary sources to create a fragmentary encounter with the states of mind and\nheart prison engenders.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003ePrisoner\u2019s Song\u003c/em\u003e premiered\nin October 2015, at Roulette Intermedia in Brooklyn, with an earlier workshop\nperformance at Everett Stage in Providence, Rhode ISland. Future performances\nare forthcoming. According to a review in the New York Times, it\u2019s \u201cuncomfortably\npowerful\u2026.  On long scrolls of paper, Mr.\nRuin created intricate cutouts with people, buildings and fences blending into\nabstract latticework patterns. When he gently pulled these over the projector\nthe images on the screen moved with hallucinatory fluidity.\u201d  In 2017, we will be creating an audio-visual\ninstallation based on one of its scenes in a disused cell at the Eastern State\nPenitentiary historic site in Philadelphia. We will also be staging a series of\nperformances and talks related to the show in Detroit, sponsored by a Knight\nArts Challenge grant.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy most recent theatrical work was \u003cem\u003eAntigone\u003c/em\u003e, an\nexperimental staging of the classic play, inspired by Anne Carson\u2019s\ntranslation \u003cem\u003eAntigonick. \u003c/em\u003eOurinterpretation\nincorporated haunting live music, projections, paintings, improvised movement\nand highly stylized performances.Antigone starred a cast of eight\nperformers with a diversity of backgrounds. I designed projections and\npaintings (cantestoria) and co-directed, in collaboration with Dan Rogers. Performances\nwere staged November 18-20 at Panorama art/theater space in Philadelphia.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn keeping with its anti-tyrannical theme, proceeds from \u003cem\u003eAntigone\u003c/em\u003e were donated to the Youth Art \u0026amp; Self-Empowerment\nProject (YASP), raising more than $1400. Through its work in the Philadelphia\njails, YASP provides space for incarcerated young people to express themselves\ncreatively and to develop as leaders both within and beyond the prison walls.\nYoung people who have been through the adult court system are at the forefront\nof YASP, leading the movement to keep teenagers out of adult prisons and to\ncreate new possibilities for youth around the city. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn my work as both a performer and a curator/presenter of\nevents, I have deliberately and consistently focused on staging work within\ncontexts not typically associated with the \u201cfine art\u201d world of proper\ntheatrical venues- DIY warehouse venues, community art centers, music venues,\nprivate homes, etc. As a result of this and similar efforts, I have typically\nattracted an audience that is far younger and more diverse than typical theater\naudiences, including many who previously found the form inaccessible. I have\nalso performed and/or designed pieces in a variety of more traditional\ncontexts, such as the Detroit Institute of Arts, St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse in NYC,\nthe Institute of Contemporary Arts in Philadelphia, and the Fitzgerald Theater\nin St. Paul, Minnesota.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have also created publications in a variety of contexts.\nFrom the years 2000-2006 I edited the heavily illustrated zine \u003cem\u003eTrouble In Mind, \u003c/em\u003ewhich addressed the\nintersections of politics, art and everyday life. Growing out of that work, I co-edited\nthe collection \u003cem\u003eRealizing the Impossible:\nArt Against Authority \u003c/em\u003e(with Josh MacPhee, 2007), a collections of essays on\nanarchism and art throughout history. I am also the co-author of the book \u003cem\u003ePaths Toward Utopia: Graphic Explorations of\nEveryday Anarchism\u003c/em\u003e (w/ Cindy Milstein, PM Press, 2012) consisting of ten\ncollaborative picture-essays that weave Cindy Milstein\u2019s poetic words within my\nintricate yet bold paper-cut and scratch-board images, Paths toward Utopia\nsuggests some of the here-and-now practices that prefigure, however\nimperfectly, the self-organization that would be commonplace in an egalitarian\nsociety. In 2013, I also executed a wall-drawing installation based on one of\nthe chapters in this book at the Kunstraum Lakeside in Klagenfurt, Austria.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBridging my public art and publication practices, in 2011 I\nwas commissioned by the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program to design \u003cem\u003eNeighbor\nBallads\u003c/em\u003e, a series of 8 broadside publications with individually decorated\nnewspaper boxes, depicting neighborhood figures from immigrant communities\nboth historic and contemporary, and featuring poems by Frank Sherlock. This was\nmounted as part of the Mural Arts project \u003cem\u003eJourneys South.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy work has been\nrecognized with two project grants from the Rhode Island State Council of the\nArts, a Puffin Foundation grant, nominations for the Art Matters and United\nStates Artists fellowships, and residencies at AS220, 40\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;th\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; st AIR\nand the Blue Mountain Center.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
