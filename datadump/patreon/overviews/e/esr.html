We\u0027re mostly volunteers, because there is no way to wrap a business model around the most essential services.\u00a0 We do what we do for love, and because software is our art - and because, in the Internet-dependent 21st century, we know civilization would be lost without us just as surely as if the roads and sewers and power grid stopped working.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to notice us, because we\u0027re not the people who write the programs you can easily see. Ours is the software behind the software - the programs and service libraries that paint pixels on your display, move bits along the wires, allow hardware to talk to other hardware.\u00a0 (For those of you more technically inclined, I\u0027m talking about systems code rather than applications.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I\u0027m a techie, I\u0027m in a situation similar to a fine artist because the market has not figured out how to value and reward the work I feel called to do.\u00a0 Unlike most artists, it wouldn\u0027t be difficult for me to get a well-paid job - but then I\u0027d have to work on what an employer wants, rather than what the world actually needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge to me so I can keep delivering what the world actually needs.\u003cbr\u003e"
