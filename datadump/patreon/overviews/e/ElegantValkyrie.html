I\u0027m Valkyrie, and I am a Boston-area cosplayer and model who has been making costumes and doing sexy photoshoots for over 10 years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy modeling career began as soon as I was legally old enough to remove my clothes in front of a camera. I initially began through SuicideGirls, but was quickly harassed by a few idiots and left the site after complaints to their staff resolved nothing. I joined ModelMayhem.com under a stage name and began networking and doing a few gigs here and there, branching out and experimenting with different styles and new photographers. It was a fun hobby for me, but I didn\u0027t see it as something that would get me very far in life otherwise (boy am I turning out to be wrong!). When I met my husband, he and the military became my focus, so I retreated from the modeling scene for a few years, but after I began getting back into cosplay, modeling naturally followed. I wanted to have good quality photos of each costume I made, and soon the photographers I was working with for cosplay shots and at photo booths were wanting to work with me on boudoir projects - so I got right back on the horse and here we are today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2008, I have slowly grown in both crafting skills and local comic con attendance, going that year to Anime Boston in a homemade Chii (Chobits) costume made of things I mostly already had in my closet. In following years I managed to buy a few pre-made costumes as well as put together a few \"thrifted casual\" cosplays, but I was always looking to do more. Seeing others at cons in fabulous armor and flowing gowns and colorful wigs captivated me. Buying a costume on eBay somehow felt like cheating, and it wasn\u0027t as enjoyable as having the pride of making something myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img924/6353/194eUw.jpg\" style=\"width: 431px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMercy from Overwatch at PAX East 2017\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mother taught me to sew from about the age of 10, and she had always made dresses for me when I was a little girl. I loved going to the fabric store with her to pick out patterns and fabrics and trims, mixing and matching each new outfit. The possibilities of what you could create from raw materials enthralled me! My classmates in preschool were always jealous ;) I also had the advantage of some historical reenactment gear that my parents owned, having been a big part of American Revolutionary War reenactment regiments for many years. Having these skills and knowledge helped propel my sister and I to the forefront of the local Hetalia fandom in 2011, and we were in fact featured on the home page for Anime Boston one year - photographed by the staff in our Revolutionary England and America costumes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollowing Hetalia, after I met my future husband, my interests shifted from anime to video games, and I immediately latched on to games such as the Assassin\u0027s Creed series, Bioshock, Portal, and Battlefield. I went to a few more conventions when my husband and I were stationed down in Texas, participating in my first ever costume contests while dressed in an Assassin\u0027s Creed fashion I had made myself:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/921/VM4kui.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAssassin\u0027s Creed, original design - Boston Comic Con 2015\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know what it is about the costume contests that I like so much, but I believe it has something to do with wanting my hard work to be seen and appreciated, and a lot less to do with actually winning the contest or any prizes. I\u0027m still 110% flattered when folks at cons ask for my picture, and I absolutely love meeting new people who are also as completely obsessed with cosplay as I am. I have met so many amazing people of all varying backgrounds with so many different skills. People who draw, and sew, and make armor, and do resin casting, leather work, and smithing, and we are always ready to share our secrets and advice with each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving such a network of supportive friends and family, I was finally prepared to begin offering costume commissions. Right now this is done very rarely - mostly through word of mouth, friends of friends, and a few close people I have met at cons - but my goals are shifting from the high-stress of building costumes for others to focusing instead on my followers and friends who support my artistic advances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/924/XqGpbo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePadme Amidala, Star Wars - Boston Comic Con 2015\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, we come to Patreon, the newest adventure in my life! I feel absolutely blessed to be a part of the New England cosplay community, and it consumes so much of my heart and mind that I cannot see myself doing without going to cons and making new cosplays every year. I think this Patreon presence will help me to fulfill my dreams of becoming a local cosplay icon, and in turn I plan to reinvest your attention spent on me into other projects to support other local artists and cosplay friends of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will not be expecting very much as I get started, even just a passerby to my page is welcomed and thanked! But monetary contributions will help me make new costumes and photos faster, out of better materials, and go to more cons and events in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease let me know what you would like to see from me as I begin this new thing! I would be happy to do things like streaming, tutorials on costuming/sewing/painting/etc, drawing/art requests, costume requests, ...pretty much anything! Thank you for stopping by! I hope you\u0027ll stick around for future posts! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/921/OJ9bs3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eArtyom and Pavel, Metro 2033 - PAX East 2016\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
