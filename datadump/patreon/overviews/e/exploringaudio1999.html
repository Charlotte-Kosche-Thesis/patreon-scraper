    "summary": "Hi, my name is Nick Maynard. I\u0027m a musician from Rochester, NY, and this is my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet\u0027s start off with a little about myself. In 2010, I helped found Rochester Chip, a monthly chiptune showcase in Rochester, NY, and for the next three years, I set up 37 events, including two festivals, and worked with over 130 bands and performers. I\u0027ve also played in dozens of bands, in a lot of different styles, but my main interest has always been making electronic music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0KxLvte.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently started a youtube channel, called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/exploringaudio1999\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEXPLORING AUDIO\u003c/a\u003e, where I make videos about electronic music and music technology. I\u0027ll be posting live performance videos, interviews, tutorials, and gear reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo how does Patreon figure in to this? Basically, Patreon is a way for people to support the projects I work on and it\u0027s also a great way for me to give something extra to the people who support them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy becoming my patron, you\u0027re agreeing to donate a small amount of money, usually just a dollar, for every video I make. I\u0027ll typically be posting these videos about twice a month but you can also set a maximum monthly donation, so you never get charged more than you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon also enables me to offer rewards for different levels of donation. These rewards will include things like download codes for songs and albums featured in the videos, LSDJ and Famitracker files for any of the chiptune songs, Ableton Live instruments and project files, additional videos and extended cuts of videos I\u0027ve already posted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere\u0027s a quick look at some of the videos I\u0027m working on right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRochester Chip Fest 2013, an hour long documentary of the festival, featuring interviews and performances by Danimal Cannon, Trey Frey, Cheap Dinosaurs, Chipocrite, An0va, and more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA full series of LSDJ educational videos that cover everything from starting up the program for the first time to complete breakdowns of popular songs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAbsolutely TONS of different videos on guitar pedals. Vintage pedals, weird pedals, pedals with midi, building pedals.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEducational walkthroughs of some lesser known pieces of gear. For example, the Boss RPS-10, the Roland Sound Canvas, and the Yamaha QY70.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf any of this is of interest to you, please consider donating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e( photo by emi spicer!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.falsebit.com/s5-electronic-events/c4-latest-events/rit-chip-returns3/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.falsebit.com/s5-electronic-events/c4-latest-events/rit-chip-returns3/\u003c/a\u003e )\u003cbr\u003e"
