Been doing it for most of my life.\u00a0I am interested in all aspects of worldbuilding (autocorrect hates that word, but I\u2019m sticking with it). Mythologies, cosmogonies, histories, culture, cartography (one of my favourite subjects), taxonomy, linguistics (one of my least favourite subjects)\u2026 all these and so many more fields and sciences all play a role in the creation of a world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePeople can see my \u003ca href=\"http://www.vorropohaiah.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, which can give a decent idea of the type of things I post (I\u2019ll probably repost and update some things from the blog here, for completeness sake).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8tQnKqPCq2I/VkmC6PL4TZI/AAAAAAAAQZ0/UEIzf0ZJ-D0/s1600/venthir%2Bchar%2Bmathi%2B-%2Bweb.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eObjectives\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWhat I plan to achieve with this page is flesh out the world of Elyden with fiction, history, worldbuilding, cartography etc. Patrons will add the incentive and monetary means to help accomplish those goals. But first, a bit more information on that\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been working on the World of Elyden for over 10-years now. She was born from the rejects of other stillborn campaign settings, though has since evolved into a monolithic beast that\u2019s growing at a rate that\u2019s far too quick for me to keep up with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe culmination of this writing will be the Encyclopaedia Elyden, a 5-volume tome that I shamelessly refer to as my magnum opus (at least I will be able to once it\u0027s ready...). It is the sum total of my adult life spent detailing Elyden. Places, Notable people, organisations, races, religions, gods, maps, flora, fauna, myths, etc. I plan to one day edit it all into a presentable series of volumes that I can publish. I\u0027m well on my way towards doing this - the first volume alone (akin to the Encyclopaedia Britannica of old) clocks in at close to 500,000 words, with well over 2,000 individual entries - though there\u0027s a way to go yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T-lCR8N6x-o/VjeOYgMpHaI/AAAAAAAAQWE/GymzAMiiQhI/s1600/Agynur%2Bof%2BNekoda.jpg\" style=\"width: 476px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThanks to the internet, I have access to all sorts of free tools, not least of which is Wikipedia (don\u2019t knock it, it\u2019s an amazing tool), much of my research finds me having to purchase expensive textbooks or print out notes \u2013 the money I\u2019ll get from this will help with such endeavours, as well as help finance other projects related to the world (such as novels; the printing and hand-binding of the Encyclopaedia Elyden, once it\u2019s finally ready; or my handmade world globe, which I keep on putting off due to finances).  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is your chance to get involved with my world. I will attempt to put out 1 \u2013 3 updates per month, at least one of which will be either a serialised story and/or a map. The rest of the updates will be worldbuilding posts, other maps or whatever else I think of. I do not charge by post as the frequency may vary, so I charge once per month. No more no less.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LLbqZ4eY0Uw/VU4O0RZDGvI/AAAAAAAAQJk/927x6qsGeWs/s1600/title%2Bpage.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

Though other than that, I\u0027ve \nbeen interested in maps for most of my adult life and probably spend \nmore time than I should on maps than I do on actually writing the World \nof Elyden. One aspect of cartography that I\u0027m fascinated by is the \ncreation of globes. A true art-form and one that\u0027s a lot more difficult \nin practice than theory, one of my goals for the world of Elyden is the \ncreation of a globe depicting the world.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is something that\n very few fantasy worlds have ever seen (likely to do with the fact that\n most authors don\u0027t consider the curvature of a globe when making their \nvery 2-dimentional maps) and which might help make Elyden seem a bit \nmore unique and real and less fantastical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few ideas for\n making the globe, most likely of which is using a real globe, sprayed \nwhite and hand-painted directly onto the globe. I\u0027ve researched printing\n out gores and gluing them to the globe itself, though figured that\u0027s \nlikely beyond my skill-range (apparently there\u0027s a secret trick to \nmaking the gores actually curve around the globe rather than scrunch, \nand few globe-makers are willing to part with the secret), though it\u0027s \nsomething I\u0027d love to try out at some time.\u003cbr\u003e",
