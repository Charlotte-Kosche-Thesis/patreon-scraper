Unbridled opinions, deflating myths, tips and tricks, encouragement, fan requests \u2013 all are part of this 5-year-old series. And now we\u0027re going to get a little more serious. This year I plan to purchase every student bass clarinet available (at least for a couple weeks!) so everyone can hear the differences before they make this big decision. Also on the docket this year: Bass Clarinet mouthpieces. All of them. Tried and discussed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it can only happen with your support! So please be awesome, and pledge!"

And an educator. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\u00a0I am pretty outspoken about the current state of Music Education in the world. Let\u0027s look at how Music is taught these days. It\u0027s not too different than how it was taught 75 years ago. \u003cstrong\u003e75\u00a0years ago!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we think of music schools as \u201ctrade schools\u201d (like where you would go to learn to be an auto mechanic or repair a refrigerator), we are teaching our students the equivalent of learning to repair a car from 1940. Is that a carburetor? No? Well, I only know how to work on carburetors, not fuel-injection systems. And what\u2019s a Hybrid?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy whole point of view is to make music current. Teaching fundamental concepts doesn\u0027t have to feel like a drag. It doesn\u0027t have to be so damn serious. We aren\u0027t curing cancer here; we\u0027re making the world a better place for those individuals who enjoy creating their own music, from their own bodies, from \u003cstrong\u003enothing\u003c/strong\u003e. Those young (and old!) bodies are living in the world TODAY.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI simply want to teach in that same, modern, fractured, distracted, technology-driven world.\u003cbr\u003e",
