    "summary": "I\u0027ve been told by a neurologist, casually over dinner, that I have a \"very strange brain.\" I have synaesthesia, ASMR, restless leg syndrome and sensory processing disorder. All of this makes me a fairly bad sleeper, and a highly creative individual. In fact, I\u0027m writing down 300 ideas in 300 days over at my blog, \u003ca href=\"http://www.IdeaFactory.Co.\"\u003ewww.IdeaFactory.Co.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, as I was falling asleep to ASMR videos, it occurred to me that there should be a book to put adults to sleep. Blue light is bad for sleep, and books already make us a little bit sleepy. I have a lot of ideas for things that should exist in this world. But for once in my life, I felt like I was the best person to execute this idea. So I began writing a novel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first in a line of \u201csleep books,\u201d this is the novel to grab when you can\u2019t sleep - but it\u2019s anything but boring. We follow our protagonist named Very, a twenty-something girl with undiagnosed sensory processing disorder, through her journey to better sleep via an experimental sleep class led by a quirky neurologist. Weaving in and out of a variety of dreamscapes with her fellow sleep classmates, who all suffer from insomnia because of their own sensitivities - the anxious, the empaths, the obsessive personalities, the attention deficit disordered - Very ultimately must face her own insomniac tendencies by diving into her own very revealing subconscious. Her unconscious odyssey takes her through the warm plains of relaxing sensory treats one moment, and through the depths of phantasmagorical adventures the next. The different dreamscapes she visits dredge up her childhood memories from a family road trip through Europe, explore her psyche and stimulate all of her senses - even ones she\u2019s unaware of - in unexpected ways; and they exemplify an exquisite appreciation for the ridiculous, a fluency in the nonsensical, and above all else, a belief that whimsy is an underappreciated therapy for the soul. Affirming, hilarious and comforting, this is a psychedelic meditation on the languages we speak that no one ever talks about. It contains high doses of synesthesia, ASMR, sensory integration, psychological therapies for anxiety, and other shiny tricks to calm a busy mind. Not compromising story for its calming intentions, this novel was written for anyone looking to escape.\u003cbr\u003e"
