By day, I\u0027m a warehouse worker working part-time as a novelist, but by night I am an artist striving to push past the limits of my abilities. I\u0027ve always had a great love for creating art, mostly in the form of pen-on-paper sketches of demonic creatures and abstract environments, and my work can be purchased on various products by way of RedBubble, but I figured it\u0027s about time I sit down and give those who really want to see the end results of my labor as well as the process a chance to support me while getting an inside scoop to my work. I started out working simply traditionally, drawing on paper with a pen, but gradually made the transition to digital art, using Sketchbook Pro. I hope that you will decide to support me by investing in my artwork and writing.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m new to this, so please bare with me while I figure out the best way to share my work on here, and feel free to share suggestions on how I can do things better or what you\u0027d like to see more of!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://evanderlfragoso.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/6/7/106736999/patreon-preview-1_orig.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://evanderlfragoso.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/6/7/106736999/2017-06-28-14-58-47_orig.jpg\" style=\"width: 305px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m just starting out, and have a full-time job that doesn\u0027t exactly give me the time to work on my art, I\u0027m starting off with just a two-tier system. Supporting me with $2 a month will grant you access to my art process, which includes jpgs of original sketches, a few progress pics, and final project images. You will also receive screenshots from my current writing projects. $5 a month will grant you access to the original sketches of my main projects, more progress pics, as well as alternative versions of my final pieces. Contributing $5 will also unlock extra doodles that I\u0027ll make along the way, and the ability to help decide what doodles/sketches will be at the top of my to-create list. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks for joining me in my adventure towards the future. \u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s grow together my fiendies, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEvander L.
