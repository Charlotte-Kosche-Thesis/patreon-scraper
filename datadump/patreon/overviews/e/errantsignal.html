    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Chris.  I make game criticism videos, and yes, that\u0027s even more pretentious than it sounds.  And I\u0027m here to kick off a Patreon campaign!  But before we get into the details I think it\u0027s sort of necessary to explain why I\u0027m doing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour first response is probably, \"why not just rely on ads like every other YouTuber!?\" Well, ads are a bad idea for two key reasons.  First, YouTube\u0027s monetization policy has grown increasingly unreliable for someone doing criticism, as ContentID checks can torpedo my ability to make any money on a video at all.  That\u0027s not to mention the delays likely to be introduced in getting videos out with their new mandatory review system for monetization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, ads don\u0027t really care about anything other than the number of eyeballs you can generate.  This means YouTube is great for strong personalities that put out daily vlogs; they function almost like a morning radio show host you can listen to at any time and make a part of your daily routine.  The sort of criticism I do means I can only put out pieces once or twice a month.  So where I\u0027m getting twenty to fifty thousand views a month, someone with my subscriber base doing daily vlogs would get that much a \u003cem\u003eday\u003c/em\u003e.  If vlog videos were put out every weekday (~20 a month) that would mean I\u2019m earning somewhere between five and ten percent of what a vlogger would earn.  These sorts of videos just aren\u0027t profitable on an ad based system unless you\u0027re crazy popular and can offset the lack of videos with a massive view count.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also not really a show that can be shopped around.  Even if they \u003cem\u003ewould\u003c/em\u003e have me - and I\u0027m under no delusions of grandeur that they would, I\u2019m just sayin\u2019 - it\u0027s pretty clear at this point that the sweet spot for videos on places like The Escapist or GameTrailers is weekly six to nine minute episodes, not monthly episodes that can go as long as twenty minutes.  And there\u0027s nothing wrong with those shorter episodes! But it\u0027s not the show I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, Patreon!  First, though, these crowdfunding things are tricky and I don\u2019t want to be the Veronica Mars or Zach Braff of video game criticism fundraising.  There are plenty of game critics literally making their living off of Patreon right now, and if you\u2019re interested in supporting someone who could really use the money \u003cem\u003eplease\u003c/em\u003e consider subscribing to them.  I\u2019d love to make more any money from this venture (and I\u2019d even love to make it my full time job some day!) but I\u2019d love writers I respect to be warm and well fed more than that.  That said, if you\u2019re a fan of the show and are interested in seeing it survive or even grow, any little bit would be sincerely appreciated.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will help fund production.  Monthly subscriptions to Photoshop and Premiere pretty much cancel most of my current YouTube earnings out, so any other expense (web hosting, game purchases for reference footage or review, video capture devices, newer computers to handle editing of HD video, not to mention the immense amount of time invested in making these things) is largely out of pocket.  Errant Signal has been fun to make, but it\u2019s also cost me a lot of money.  Production value increases don\u2019t just come from hard work!\u00a0 Whatever\u2019s left over at the end of the month will be saved in an attempt to jump-start doing this full-time in the future.  Whether that\u2019s feasible or not, I can\u2019t say!  We\u2019ll have to see what the response to this campaign is like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, the gritty details: I\u0027m running this campaign on a monthly basis.\u00a0 Which works well since that\u0027s about how often I release videos anyways, but know that it also supports whatever writing I can squeeze in in addition to my videos.\u00a0 You\u0027re making it \u003cstrong\u003eall\u003c/strong\u003e possible!\u00a0 I\u0027m working on figuring out patron-only content, but it\u0027s tricky.\u00a0 Between a day job and making videos I don\u0027t have time to do a whole additional piece of content just for subscribers, and I\u0027d prefer that all of the writing and videos I do to be publicly available.\u00a0 Still, I\u0027d love to do something as a thank-you to anyone who subscribes.\u00a0 If anyone has any ideas, please let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, regardless of whether you subscribe I\u0027d like to offer a thank you just for taking the time to read this long, meandering plea.\u00a0 Now, back to writing about games!\u003cbr\u003e"
