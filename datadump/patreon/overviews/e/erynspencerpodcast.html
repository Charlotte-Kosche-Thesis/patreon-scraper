    "summary": "Thanks for visiting the ESP - Eryn Spencer Podcast\u0027s Patreon site! It\u0027s thanks to dedicated fans and philanthropists like yourselves (amongst the other great Philanthropists like David and Hal Emmerich) that we\u0027re able to continue to produce quality content to the best of our abilities. For those of you who are genuinely curious and know nothing about ESP ... \"put your controller on the floor!\" ... just kidding; the Eryn Spencer Podcast is an LGBTQIA friendly #nerdcast, broadcast in partnership and coordination with Fall River Community Media. The station and studio itself is uniquely based inside of Fall River\u0027s own Bristol Community College and includes both full time and part time staff, students, alumni and members of the local community. I myself am a transgender (MTF) alumni with an AA in Comm and a BA in History (eye-roll; I know, I know ... that\u0027s why I\u0027m here) whose desire, dream and passion is to bring a visible, LGBTQIA+ voice to nerddom, geekdom and fandom everywhere. Our show at its magma-core is a guest-centered, bi-weekly podcast that covers a wide range of topics. Whether it\u0027s casually PUG\u0027ing in social \u0026amp; political commentary or \"hack \u0026amp; slash-ing\" our way through video games, anime, manga, comics, conventions, Japanese culture and travel, we have all the things that will boost your intellect by +11 and give you +5 defense against mainstream bro-culture. Blade dancers, ninjas and assassins are welcome, so long as you bring mega-potion cookies and intellectual discussion that tingles the inner fangirl (or boy) in all of us! As always - thanks again to all of you beautiful, ultima wielding, buster sword toting unicorns - without you, none of this would be possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Eryn T\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hey ya\u0027ll! (my favorite gender neutral form of general address) - Welcome to our Patreon page! If it wasn\u0027t obvious already, my name is Eryn Spencer. I\u0027m a proud, transgender woman in her 30\u0027s finally realizing her dreams of creating a #nerdcast and LGBTQIA friendly video \u0026amp; audio content project for the sheer love of fandom and geek culture. I love to cosplay, thoroughly enjoy D\u0026amp;D (among other tabletops!), collect vintage CCG\u0027s, indulge in shameless anime binge-watching, and of course - iGAME! (PS4 \u0026amp; Nintendo Switch, NO X-BOX BRO CULTURE ALLOWED HERE!) ... just kidding everyone is welcome, but X-Box ... oh, X-Box, what are we going to do with you? Anyway, my goal is to create, as mentioned above, a specific niche for LGBTQIA+ individuals to connect on a deeper level to fandom, geekdom and nerdom on all levels! Please like and subscribe to the YouTube content if you appreciate what we\u0027re doing, love the content, or just want to help us out! As a great Captain once said in the face of Cats while attempting to survive make their time among all bases belonging: \"For great justice!\" Wait, what? *insert appropriate sound effect*\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all your support! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e- Eryn\u003cbr\u003e",
