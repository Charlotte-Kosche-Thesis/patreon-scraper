I have been training dogs since before graduating high school on a volunteer or low cost basis to help low income dog owners solve their dog problems, and for various rescues as well. I have been training on a professional basis for a company for about three years outside of my volunteer and low cost work, doing everything from training service dogs to competing in dog sports to solving the problems clients give me with creativity, passion, and empathy. I also help run the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://actuallyservicedogs.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eActually Service Dogs\u003c/a\u003e infoblog on tumblr, for those who have questions relating to the laws and ethics on handling a service dog in the US, Canada, Japan, and Germany.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am regularly asked to find a way to share my methods with new service dog handlers and those who wish to train their service dogs themselves, so that they can have a dog that is very well trained to assist them with their disabilities while also being a non-nuisance in public. This patreon was created as a way to share these methods and talk at length about what goes into training a successful service dog, the challenges one might face along the way, red flags to watch for, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone for joining me on this venture, and I wish you the best of luck with your dogs!"
