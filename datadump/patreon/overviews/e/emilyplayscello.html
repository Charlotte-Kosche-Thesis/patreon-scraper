    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2018 Update: After nearly 2 years of weekly videos, I\u0027m looking to expand my channel.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eBetween the support of my audience and my patrons, I\u0027ve been able to provide an incredibly versatile set of content\u2014live performances with mini-lectures, concert footage, lessons on historical string playing, vlogs on career skills, guest musicians, and livestreamed concerts. This year I want to start opening my platform to other musicians in the early music and classical music community. I want to continue to commit myself to the filming and production of these videos so the channel can become a go-to resource for early music. As the quality of my videos continues to rise, I\u0027m looking for additional support to ensure I can commit the necessary time, research, and practice for each video. Last year I started offering audio from select videos on iTunes and Spotify, and $5+ patrons will get these downloads for free.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi! I\u0027m Emily and I play cello.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\tI specialize in baroque music, music written between 1600 and 1750. As a young classical musician, I wanted to share my own playing and turn others on to the music I perform. My goal was not only to connect with other people who love this music, but also reach even more people than those who might attend a classical concert. I love baroque music, and I want it to reach a wide audience!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/emilyplayscello\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube channel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is where I post my cello playing, talk about the history behind the pieces I play, and give lessons on playing baroque music. I\u0027ve even livestreamed a rehearsal or concert direct to YouTube. I started my channel in 2006, and now I\u0027ve started doing it with serious commitment and consistency, usually posting a new video every other week. I love bringing this rich, evocative, and often under-appreciated repertoire to a worldwide audience! It\u0027s my hope that this music becomes as recognized as later symphonic works, and that the most unassuming of viewers feel an emotional connection with music they would have never expected.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a full-time freelance musician.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m a performing baroque cellist and cello teacher in the Boston area. I specialize in a historically-informed approach to early classical music. After grad school, to fill the time between concerts and lessons, I self-produced two unaccompanied cello albums, \u003ca href=\"http://emilyplayscello.bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBASS SOUNDS\u003c/a\u003e, which focus on cello repertoire from the 17th and 18th centuries. I also collaborated on an alternative project, \u003ca href=\"http://oldstyle.bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOldStyle\u003c/a\u003e, where I remixed baroque pieces into electronic dance music with the goal of further expanding the reach of this music. I formed the group \u003ca href=\"http://www.emergencequartet.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEmergence Quartet\u003c/a\u003e to explore the earliest pieces written for the string quartet, performed on period instruments. Throughout these endeavors I was filming and documenting for my YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have an active teaching career both in person and online. Beyond just performance videos, I also film video lessons and lectures for those looking to learn more about baroque music and historical performance practice. Education for students and emerging professionals is an integral part of continuing this music through generations.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003eEvery video requires planning and hours of practice time. I own my equipment and record and edit myself. I love being able to share this music and engage with my audience directly, so it\u0027s my goal to make this a viable source of work for me. That\u0027s where you come in! Your support helps me produce better quality videos more often, and helps this music reach a global audience. By funding these videos, you help me continue to offer all of these resources and performances for free.\u003cbr\u003e"
