    "summary": "Please excuse my naivete with Patreon. I\u0027m still exploring. I\u0027m astounded that you\u0027re interested enough to find me! Thank you! With your help, I can overcome the extremely real hurdles that make doing what I do really really hard. I have so many ideas to create \u0026amp; share but I\u0027m worrying every day about the small stuff, like having food in the kitchen \u0026amp; fuel in the car. Or how I don\u0027t have enough piano students to keep the roof over my head because many years of annual winter illness has killed my earning capacity. I just need. Help! A leg up. A hand. To keep going, ease the burdens \u0026amp; just concentrate on sharing what seems to come to me out of nowhere. \u003cbr\u003eThose ideas I dream up, or that just pop into my head when I have a student in front of me! The things that other teachers, students or parents wonderingly ask where I came up with that idea?! I don\u0027t know! It just came to me! I think it helps that I seem to be hardwired to be constantly looking for possibilities in this world. It often helps to start with nothing. Anything you gain after nothing is world shattering I think. When I\u0027m not here anymore I\u0027d like others to be simply sharing the fun, the loving kindness \u0026amp; the joy of music \u0026amp; communion. To be thinking outside the square \u0026amp; helping others to see that beauty outside the square. That\u0027s it. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "In a nut shell, I\u0027m a piano teacher but I\u0027m so much more than that. I have a lifetime of Girl Guiding behind me; 20 years working as a nurse; Counselling qualifications, skills \u0026amp; experience; more than half of my life volunteering - serving others - in a variety of ways. My personal ethos is to \u0027Do Good\u0027. Be honest, keep trying no matter what, have fun, make it meaningful, be kind \u0026amp; care for others, share the kindness. \u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t talked about music yet. I can\u0027t live without music. My piano is my best friend. I think I\u0027ve worked out that I\u0027m in this world to share music with fun \u0026amp; kindness. I\u0027m eclectic. I don\u0027t like to fit in a box. I like to utilise a wide range of resources \u0026amp; ideas to create balance. I also like to create. I create ways to engage personally with my students. I advertise that I teach from ages 4 - 104 years old. I love it all. \u003cbr\u003eMy music life is constantly morphing. While continuing to study \u0026amp; better myself, it seems as if I\u0027m also on a journey to create formal resources based on the way I teach. So I make Snakes \u0026amp; Ladders games to teach concepts, including scales. I have other game ideas too. I\u0027m also gradually recording my ideas \u0026amp; practices into a shareable format. My ideas evolve as I solve individual teaching problems with my students ie I create a personal service for my clients. Somehow I seem to have also started along the pathway to create my own exploratory \u0026amp; play-based method of teaching piano to preschoolers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy greatest challenge right now is money. I don\u0027t have any. It\u0027s that simple. Without my family right now I wouldn\u0027t be eating. I worry about how to have fuel in my car \u0026amp; pay the bills. I\u0027m turning 50 this year so I also want a holiday - a celebration. I want to do it positively after having so many years of illness that has eaten away at my teaching numbers. I can\u0027t have my own children. That wasn\u0027t my choice. People say that my children are my students. They\u0027re partially right. Without my students I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d live. However my students are no replacement for nurturing something of my flesh. It hurts. Can you hear the depression? \u003cbr\u003eWhen I lost my childbearing organs I said that I wanted a grand piano as compensation. I\u0027ve lost hope that that could ever be a possibility because my health always kills my earning capacity every winter. I\u0027m just surviving day by day so I\u0027m desperate to make it all meaningful for myself \u0026amp; others around me.\u003cbr\u003eI also need positive, supportive people around me. That\u0027s partially why I\u0027m intrigued enough to join this. I would so love to be part of a positive, sharing community of creative people who are constantly looking for possibilities in life!\u003cbr\u003e",
