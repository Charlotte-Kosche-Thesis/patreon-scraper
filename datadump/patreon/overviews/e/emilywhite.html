    "summary": "At Jack Sprat Press, we are inspired by the independent music movement that dared to go against the mainstream and produce something the larger companies refused to touch. Our mission is to emulate that rebellious attitude to give readers something a little different, and artists a place to explore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that a work shouldn\u2019t just be enjoyable, it should be art. Push the boundaries of your talent. Dare to break the rules. Write the story everyone told you no one would read. And draw in ways that defy the mainstream. And recognize, as Jackson Pollock did, that the canvas does not need to be on the easel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we are a new company, our ambitions must remain small. Though we wish to provide many artists and writers a place to showcase their work, we are forced to keep accepted submissions to a maximum of three flash fiction and three 4-page comics, with a limited reimbursement. Our goal is to one day pay six cents a word for flash fiction and $60 per comic, making our company (and any published artists) eligible for inclusion into SFWA and other prestigious groups. With help from patrons, this goal could become a reality.\u003cbr\u003e"

She began her career as a published author, offered her freelance editing services to traditionally and self-published authors, and finally made the plunge to start her own company. Always looking for work that is simultaneously odd, quirky, and brilliant, she\u2019s dreaming of submissions that look outside the box, and would drop everything for a space opera in verse. Or a graphic novel using photographs. Or cut paper art.",
