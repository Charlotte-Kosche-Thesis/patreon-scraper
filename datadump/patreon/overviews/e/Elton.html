    "summary": "Watching modern movies and TV often feels like little more than a nostalgia trip. So many of the stories that we tell are remakes, reboots and re tellings of the same stories. And while occasionally stepping back to enjoy something that we liked before is enjoyable it shouldn\u2019t be the entirety of storytelling. And while nothing in entirely original the stories that matter aren\u2019t those that play it safe they are the stories that look at things in a new way. They let us meet new people, see new worlds and understand things from a different perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where I come in. I\u2019m as big a fan as anyone of all of the greats. I watch Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, X-men, Firefly, The Flash and laugh and cry with everyone else. But when I sit down to write I\u2019m not trying to make those experiences again. I\u2019m trying to find a way to take what was great about those and create something new. I want to introduce you to new characters, show you places you haven\u2019t been before and at the best I hope to make make you laugh or cry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem of course is that while we\u2019d all like the time most of us are very limited on our free time. The idea of reading a novel, even one that we know we would love is at best daunting. But if you have time to watch an episode of TV you have time for a short story and I the freedom to try new things and explore far more ideas than I ever could writing novels and I hope you\u2019re willing to help. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am a freelance writer, pizza delivery driver and general nerd. I write fantasy and science fiction novels as well as the occasional comic book with my friends. I have been writing stories since I learned to write and when I got out of high school and considered what I wanted to do I decided that while I liked coding I loved writing. So I gave up on the safe path and began to focus on art. Twenty years later I still love writing and it\u0027s still a daily decision between doing what I want and getting paid. Even my freelance writing, while better, is a compromise. I can get paid for the one skill I am confident I am good at, but after writing articles for someone else for half the day it\u0027s hard to get excited about working on my novel. I still dream of the chance to tell stories to people and earn enough that I don\u0027t have to spend my days doing things that are far less important to pay my bills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
