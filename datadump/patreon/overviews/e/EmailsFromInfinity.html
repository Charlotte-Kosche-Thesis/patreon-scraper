    "summary": "Mike Correll here with my book \"Emails from Infinity\" (written between 2008 and 2010), which received a good deal of attention when I read and broadcasted it on Periscope one year ago. Since the original broadcast I\u0027ve had numerous requests for a podcast production of Emails from Infinity, which I have recently embarked upon! Podcasts, as I have discovered, are incredibly time consuming and expensive to produce. Therefore I am reaching out to my family, friends, fans and colleagues to help support this endeavor! Check out my \"Goals\" in the sidebar to see how much is necessary to fully produce the Emails from Infinity as a podcast. Also, check out the rewards to see how you can assist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may know my work from the recently released documentary \u0027Chet Zar: I Like to Paint Monsters\u0027, but for those of you who are unfamiliar, or those who simple want a refresher, check out the extended trailer:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/129912173\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/129912173\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd now, a short synopsis of my book \u003cem\u003eEmails from Infinity\u003c/em\u003e...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone has had a dream sometime in their life which was so potent and vivid that they were unable to tell the difference between the dream and reality. So too has everyone experienced something while waking which was so fantastic that they cannot explain how it occurred. A fine line exists between these two states, those of waking and dreaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Podcast explores my own personal fine line: the invisible gap between waking and dreaming, between possible and impossible, between life and death. I recount experiences which have been crucial to the shaping of my perception and in turn my philosophy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is another element which you will find interwoven between these snapshots of my past: emails. During my travels I made the acquaintance of a guy struggling through a difficult time in his life. He relied on negative, self-fulfilling prophecies and was addicted to snorting pharmaceuticals. I knew I could help him with some of his problems, and so I began a discourse with him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began thereafter a campaign of email communications\u2015sometimes shocking, periodically humorous, but always poignant\u2015in an effort to stimulate his personal journey towards new found freedom.\u00a0Voyeuristic or not, here\u2019s your chance to sneak a peek into a stranger\u2019s emails and glimpse at the annals of infinity!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
