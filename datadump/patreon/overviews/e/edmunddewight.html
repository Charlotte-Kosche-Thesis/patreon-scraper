    "summary": "I\u0027m a writer of weird and macabre fiction. I love giving people chills or leaving them unsettled by what they\u0027ve read.\u003cbr\u003eI will provide you with quality short fiction as well as access to novellas, novels and other works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining me on this journey you receive quality short fiction delivered to you every week. \u003cbr\u003eWhere my free followers on my blog and Facebook only get monthly fiction, for the minimum pledge of $1 you get WEEKLY fiction.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be one of the first to know about upcoming books and can even have the opportunity to participate in the creation of a story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of it this way: you spend $5 a day on coffee from a corner caf\u00e9, it wakes you up and gives you a moment of pleasure as it caresses your tongue. I\u0027m asking you to consider $1 a MONTH and for that you will get a cool new story that will take at least as long to read as it takes to drink that coffee AND you\u0027ll get that story EVERY WEEK. Think about it, for the low, low price of $12 spread over the entire year you get fiction every week PLUS occasional bonus entertainment - that\u0027s a pretty good return on investment for what would have only been 2 coffees plus tax.\u003cbr\u003eSo consider taking that coffee money for 2 days and becoming a patron. If you REALLY want cool things maybe save up coffee money from a couple days and consider one of the higher patronage levels for even more cool stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027ll use the money for\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI intend to use the money raised here to help in the support of my domain and website where I post flash fiction and showcase my published works.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrankly, a little extra money will help offset my bills and allow me to spend more time writing and less time worrying about making ends meet... it\u0027s a win-win I get more time, you get more things to read - you get all the things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be able to purchase/license higher quality images for covers and incidental work to make it look better and appear even more professional. I\u0027m currently spending hundreds of dollars a year on images. Higher quality images and commissioned original work could run into thousands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I reach a certain level of patronage, I\u00a0will use funds raised to edit and publish quality anthologies of weird fiction annually. This will allow great new writers be paid for their work and gain exposure beyond their own efforts. Your patronage will fund a publishing company for upcoming writers to get discovered. You get to be an investor in a publishing company!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage I intend to be able to spend more time writing and providing entertainment to you and eventually reach a point where I can\u00a0focus all my time and energies on giving you amazing fiction experiences beyond weekly flash fiction and an annual novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome aboard - strap yourself in; the ride\u0027s gonna be scary.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
