    "summary": "Hi, my name is Jennifer and I am a writer and activist. Here\u0027s why I\u0027ve started this Patreon account...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE SITUATION:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started a blog called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ecowarriorprincess.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEco Warrior Princess\u003c/a\u003e back in 2010 exploring topics that I feel\u00a0\u003cem\u003ematter\u003c/em\u003e: ethical fashion, sustainability, social justice, environmental issues, climate change, ethics in business, green living, conscious consumerism and clean food. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the last couple of years, the demand for free content has increased, as more people have become concerned with the the state of our world and seek information and ideas that will empower them to make positive changes in their own lives/communities which will help change the course of our future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order for Eco Warrior Princess to deliver and serve readers, it will rebrand from a blog to a conscious media business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY DILEMMA:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the \u0027conscious\u0027 movement has grown, so too has Eco Warrior Princess. I\u0027ve predominantly kept it ad-free but now I have no other option but to \u0027monetise\u0027 it in a way that can sustain the activities that goes into producing a massive sustainability platform. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had to hire a team of people just to support the growth of Eco Warrior Princess and continue offering readers information that will help them \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ebe the change.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been paying everyone out of my own pocket because I believe in \u003cem\u003efair trade \u003c/em\u003eand that people should be\u00a0paid for the value they provide. But now it\u0027s becoming unsustainable. I\u0027m overworked, I\u0027m stressed, and I\u0027m exhausted trying to do all of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s why I need your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT I\u0027LL\u00a0BE USING THE MONEY FOR:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo maintain the running costs of the website, the automation tools that help us promote our work and helping me to cover the team\u0027s wages so I don\u0027t have to rely on advertising and sponsorship and can keep the website content and information freely available which is essential if we want to help transform the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you will essentially be supporting an\u00a0editor, an admin/editorial assistant, contract writers and interns. It would be lovely if I could draw a wage too, but that\u0027s not my primary goal on Patreon. It\u0027s to keep giving readers articles and pieces that are alternative to the mainstream crap that bombards our feeds; crap that only serves to keep big fat publishing cats in cushy jobs and advertisers and investors happy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, your support means keeping the team in meaningful employment as they all love working here and being a part of a business driven by \u003cem\u003ereal purpose\u003c/em\u003e. Well that\u0027s what I think anyway. Best to ask them yourself LOL!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE BIG ASK:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\u00a0you value Eco Warrior Princess and the content we produce, please make a pledge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit you can give helps to sustain the work we do. If you think it\u0027s important work and don\u0027t want us to go down the route of being another mainstream media brand that\u0027s only ever concerned with producing click bait, sponsored ad posts each and every article, affiliate links galore, or extremely irrelevant ads, we need your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd on a personal note, every little bit you give reduces the financial burden on me. I don\u0027t care about making millions - a childless engaged woman who leaves a digital job in the city for the green minimalist life and rarely wears make-up is not interested in the trappings of the \u0027aspirational\u0027 lifestyle (although I would like to make a wage one of these days!). And I don\u0027t care to play these numbers games that so many others in the publishing and blogging world care about. Your\u00a0pledge means we can keep the content as ad-free as possible and make it available to everyone, as well as maintaining editorial independence while continuing to challenge our high-carbon consumer lifestyles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you think the world is better with a resource like our media brand, please donate. I\u0027m too proud to grovel, so consider this Patreon page the extent I will go to ask for help. And it\u0027s been difficult even creating this page and just asking for support. Fear is a fucked up thing right?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, seven years Eco Warrior Princess has been a labour of love. Seven years I\u0027ve been advocating for positive change. Seven years I\u0027ve given it everything I\u0027ve got. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m asking \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e to give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you do decide to give, I will be endlessly grateful! And I might just give you a big fat kiss on the cheek if we ever meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eJen xx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.s. A massive thank you to Nicole R. who sent me an email after reading my Transparency Report post. She was the one who suggested I use Patreon in the first place. I don\u0027t know how to repay you for sharing this fantastic idea and not sure why I hadn\u0027t seriously considered it before, but if we ever meet in this lifetime, I\u0027m shouting you a drink and giving you a massive hug because I wouldn\u0027t have launched this page if it weren\u0027t for you. You are an angel xx\u003cbr\u003e"
