    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks so much for visiting my page\u003c/strong\u003e and taking the time to read. Mostly, thanks to my fans and patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started working for a newspaper 27 years ago, there were about 180 full-time editorial cartoonists in the country. Now there are fewer than 25. \u003cstrong\u003eIf newspapers are the future of editorial cartooning, we are doomed.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI managed to defy the odds for a long time, but the odds finally caught up with me last summer, when the Houston Chronicle eliminated my position. These days, not even a Pulitzer could ensure my job security.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u2019s a pretty sad when there\u2019s not a single newspaper in Texas, the second most populous state in the Union, that has a staff editorial cartoonist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen was the last time you saw a cartoon on social media? Did you stop to read it? You probably did.  \u003cstrong\u003eThe reason a cartoon is effective is that it engages very quickly\u003c/strong\u003e - it\u2019s a five-second investment in your time.\u00a0But that\u2019s the rub. \u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes a cartoon so effective on social media, also makes it nearly impossible to monetize. They get copied and pasted all over the web\u003c/strong\u003e. If it really strikes a chord, it will spread like wildfire. \u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s a great thing, if you care about getting your message out.\u003c/strong\u003e But it\u2019s not a good thing if you\u2019re in the publishing business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne cartoon I drew during the 2016 election was posted by a handful of political advocacy pages. It received well over 500,000 shares, and those were just one ones I was able to track. Imagine how many people saw that cartoon. If 50-100 people saw each person\u0027s facebook share (a conservative estimate), that\u0027s 25-50 million views of that single cartoon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u2019s the central dilemma for cartoonists today - we are probably more widely read than ever, thanks to social media. And yet, social media is killing us.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to my point; maybe it\u2019s time for me to get out of the publishing business (OK, that decision\u2019s already been made for me), and get into the messaging business. What if I can build an army of small subscribers and supporters, along with perhaps a handful of larger donors, that get it?\u00a0 A lot of people have told me they would support my work directly, so I\u0027ve set up this Patreon page. \u003cstrong\u003eWithout it, I will be out of the cartooning business by the end of the year.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully, I can raise enough to get back to cartooning, full-time (4 to 5 cartoons a week), instead of three cartoons a week. \u003cstrong\u003eAt this point in our history, we need political cartooning more than ever.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
