Aside from the channel, I\u0027m also acting as the vocalist for BatAAr - a metal band featured on the Tekken 7 soundtrack. I\u0027m also a full-time student studying Japanese at university.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating videos and music for many years, but it\u0027s only over the past two years that I\u0027ve truly realized what passion I have for YouTube. Since early 2016, I\u0027ve done almost weekly music projects on my channel, including video game acapellas, full-on rock covers - and most recently musical remixes of YouTubers! Music aside, I also enjoy games, Japanese pop culture and that kind of stuff - and enjoy doing videos on those things as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why am I launching a Patreon - and why now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for asking, hypothetical person!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no secret that these things take time. A lot of it, in fact! Juggling uploading several videos a week with running an international rock band AND studying full-time is no easy feat, which is why I\u0027ve decided to (hopefully!) put a part of my destiny in \u003cstrong\u003eyour\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0hands!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY DREAM\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLet\u0027s be real; I \u003cstrong\u003elove \u003c/strong\u003ewhat I\u0027m doing! And I would love to be able to do even more of it. By having a Patreon, I will hopefully be able to create even more stuff than today, with an even higher production quality than today! I want to create more music, more acapellas, more remixes - but also try out new stuff! For example, I really want to get more into gaming! Doing let\u0027s plays, reviews and streams! Right now that\u0027s not something I have very much time for in my daily schedule, but with your help we just might be able to change that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong-term, my dream would be to be able to this \u003cstrong\u003etotally full-time\u003c/strong\u003e, a commitment that would require way more financial investment than I\u0027m able to put in right now, sadly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s the plan!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eStarting out, there will be \u003cstrong\u003etwo\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0patron tiers.

Should you pledge a minimum of 20$, however, you will also have the option of getting your name in the credits of all my upcoming videos (that includes an end card).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver time, more stretch goals and patron tiers might be added.
