    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eABOUT ME:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eHaving been an athlete myself, I developed a passion for sports and fitness and for living a healthy lifestyle very early on in my life. After receiving treatment by a Physical Therapist for a sports injury as a teenager, I became fascinated with their know-how about the human body and their ability to help people. Based on this I decided to become a Physical Therapist myself, with a focus on sports rehabilitation and the work with athletes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my professional career I have been able to gain very diverse experience in working as a Physical Therapist as well as Personal Trainer.\u003cbr\u003eEarly In my career I worked in Germany in a larger sports rehabilitation clinic where I had the chance to mostly work with athletes who were recovering from sports related injuries.\u003cbr\u003eOn weekends I traveled with professional sport teams to competitions as their Physical Therapist.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to that I taught posture awareness classes for a German health insurance provider to prevent long term back injuries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWHAT BROUGHT US TO PATREON:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWith more than 20 years of working experience as a Physical therapist and Personal trainer in Europe, Asia and the US I help my clients not only to achieve their personal fitness goal but improve and sustain their overall health and quality of life. In Southern California I train from 5 to 8 Clients a day. What I do is very fulfilling, but I felt as if I needed to reach more people all around the world. YouTube ended up being the platform that enabled us to do that in an efficient and personal way. \u00a0I\u0027m able to train hundreds of people at a time every week. The most gratifying feeling is when someone from a different part of the world comments on a video and says how happy they are with their gains! \u00a0We plan, format, shoot and edit workout videos every week to bring you guys an amazing fitness platform to follow which takes away from my personal training client base which is my primary source of income. When we discovered Patreon, we thought this is genius. It allows us to start compensating the team of people that produces the videos which helps us continue to serve you, and gives you a chance to support free fitness! \u00a0So if you enjoy what we\u0027re doing, feel free to join the movement. \u00a0No amount is too small. Either way we will continue to deliver great workouts for you guys and provide a great place to tune into for all of your health and fitness needs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eWe will do things like release workout videos early, provide live streams, and Q\u0026amp;A sessions to Patrons first but beyond that we would like our Fitness Friends to tell us what they would like as rewards for supporting free fitness. \u00a0Since YouTube is a video platform there are certain things we obviously can\u0027t do. \u00a0For example, post detailed meal plans. \u00a0So if that interest you, let us know, or if there is something we\u0027re not thinking about let us know, and we will build our reward program with YOUR ideas!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
