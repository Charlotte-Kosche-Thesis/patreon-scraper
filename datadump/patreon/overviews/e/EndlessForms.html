    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eHi, thanks for checking out my Patreon page! I have been doing science writing for years as a hobby, and at the encouragement of some influential friends, I\u0027ve decided to start trying to support myself more through my writing. I recently moved my science blog, \u0027Endless Forms,\u0027 to my own domain, and am excited about expanding its scope and reach in the near future!\u003cbr\u003ePlease take time to read the information below about me, my work, and my small menagerie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate your time,\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnne-Marie\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \u0027Endless Forms\u0027 about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Endless Forms\u0027 is a blog about science and natural history. Typically, I take new advances and discoveries and try to explain how scientists managed to make those conclusions, and why the news matters for the world. There will also be posts about specific areas of interest relating to ecology, evolution, and animals, even if they\u0027re not headlining at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is writing this blog?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a scientist by training, and have always had a passion for writing about science for the public. I have a Bachelor of Science in Zoology, Master of Science in Biology, and am in the late stages of completing a Doctorate in Ecology. I have done fieldwork in Kenya, Ecuador, Belize, Mexico, and the southeastern and southwestern U.S.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to many years of science blogging, I have done some freelancing in the past, including pieces in \u003cem\u003eScientific American \u003c/em\u003eand on websites such as \u0027The Conversation\u0027 and Ecology.com. You can see a list of links to my work at my website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.annemariehodge.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.annemariehodge.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nHow often do you create posts?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim for about 3 full-length posts (around 1000 words, with illustrations and cited references) per month. I plan to start adding in more frequent, shorter posts with links to interesting science news, videos, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat do you do with the money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGraduate school is a time of barren finances and considerable stress over money. Your contributions will be a tremendous help on that front, and will allow me to justify spending more time on \u0027Endless Forms\u0027 (I would spend most of my time on it if possible, but also have a day job). \u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I hope to launch into science writing full-time once my education is completely (hopefully SOON), and your contributions will contribute to that transition.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nThrough what other channels does \u0027Endless Forms\u0027 earn money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now, zero. You\u0027re it, friends. What you see on this Patreon page is all that the blog is bringing in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you like nature and animals, do you have any pets?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhy yes, I do. My dog, Sierra, is my constant sidekick and oversees the writing of every blog post. I also have a pleasantly pudgy rabbit, Latte, that I bought at a meat market during a field session in Kenya (long but true story). Finally, there is Xena, a hedgehog, who is actually a good snuggler when she\u0027s in the right mood. Your contributions will help put food in this trio\u0027s bowls every day. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI appreciate your time in checking out my Patreon page and blog; your interest and support make a huge difference.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
