    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction and Why\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, after a few of my readers said I should try this, I decided to create a Patreon account. I love writing and have basically become obsessed with it from a young age. It\u0027s helped me through tough times and has given me extreme joy to not only write for myself \u00a0but to bring entertainment for others as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for over ten years, mostly fanfiction, though I have started several original projects -with one almost on its way to finish. I love fanfiction and not ashamed to admit to writing it. With it, the practice has improved my writing skills and creativity through the years since I started, and opened me up to professional and original writing. It has also connected me to wonderful people -supportive readers, people with similar interests, and fellow fans of fandoms I adore and want to support and explore the worlds of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now, as a substitute teacher\u0027s aide with summer break coming, I\u0027m at a time where I really need to ask for support financially. I\u0027ve been writing fanfiction for a little over a decade for free, without asking much but feedback from readers, but it would be nice to ask if anyone\u0027s willing to fund me to keep on writing without me having to work hard on stories/chapters on nothing but determination and loyal support from my readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also really want to start my professional writing career, so any help I can get is really appreciated. My hope is to publish an original novel of mine by summer, or at least summer\u0027s end, and I would love it if everyone else could offer a little help in that regard, so that I can get that done (while also working on the free fanfiction for everyone else) without worrying about money issues. I\u0027m also hoping to get back into college, and funds are tight, especially with my current job being on hold until the next school year starts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, I would be extremely grateful and overjoyed for any pledges anyone can give to me, in support of myself and my writing. Thank you very much! I hope to continue to share what I love with everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho I Am\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn the fanfiction circuit, I go by Felicity Dream and/or Eri Quin. I reply to readers and sign off as \u0027Eri\u0027 though. I extremely enjoyed reading, until it got me into writing, which has become my true love in life. I enjoy writing for myself and for what it means to others, who have come to enjoy what I\u0027ve written and gotten heavily invested in my works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love that what I write can affect readers extensively, because it means my writing has managed to really touch them and evoke something in them beyond a superficial reading. It\u0027s my goal and task to continue writing in this way, so that I can continue to have others enjoy my writing to this extent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write for many fandoms. I try not to limit myself in writing either, so I try to test and challenge to write everything I can: from homosexuality to romance to depression, etc. There is very little I will refuse to attempt to write out, though gratuitous rape and violence with no plot are more than probably a no for me (ergo something like \u0027ero-guro\u0027).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor places I post on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/262184/Felicity-Dream\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFanfiction.net (Felicity Dream)\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0(Frequently Updated; fanfiction, edited works)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/eri_quin/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArchive of Our Own (eri_quin)\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0(Semi-Regular; more mature, unedited versions of stories)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.wattpad.com/user/eri_quin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWattpad (eri_quin)\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0(Semi-Regular; mature and tame versions of stories)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://felicitydream.wix.com/felicitydreamfanfics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePersonal Website\u003c/a\u003e -This is a streamlined site, where all of the fanfiction (maybe some original fiction) I\u0027ve written, published on other sites or simply any story on my flashdrive that has had at least some sort of significant work done for it, will be posted and can be easily read.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6604088/TheRegionsLegends\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Regions Legends\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0(My FFNET Collaboration account on a Pokemon project)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI will also post, as appreciation of your support, snippets of my original works, notes, extend my thought processes and brewing ideas, etc."
