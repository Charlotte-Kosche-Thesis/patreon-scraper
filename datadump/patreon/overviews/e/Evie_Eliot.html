The film will then be the jumping off point for a series of paintings and photographs that explore the subject matter more fully than we could hope to in film alone.\u003cbr\u003eThe end result will be short pieces of cinema that live inside of an exploded visual universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy you should become my Patron\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the work I\u2019m currently producing, and would like to see more, being paid to do it certainly speeds up my process.
