    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome, lovelies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Emma, and I like to \u003cstrong\u003ewrite things\u003c/strong\u003e. I mostly write prose in a range of genres, as well as blog posts and the odd Hubpages article or review. Occasionally I\u0027ll even write poetry. I have a special fondness for \u003cstrong\u003especulative fiction\u003c/strong\u003e, and sometimes joke that I mostly write fanfiction of my own characters. I\u0027m bi and polyamorous, and I love writing about found families, queer characters and all sort of relationships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Emma-Lindhagen/e/B010HUH7JO/\"\u003etwo novellas currently available on Kindle and as paperbacks\u003c/a\u003e, and a\u003ca href=\"http://www.emmalindhagen.com/\"\u003e website\u003c/a\u003e where I blog about various aspects of fiction writing. I also have a recently started YouTube channel where I talk about all the things I love, and on Twitch you can catch me conlanging, writing flash fiction and playing old casual games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a perpetual student, occasional administrator, sporadic teacher temp and linguist in training, and I regularly nerd out over pop culture franchises and etymologies alike. I like crafting, tea and the color purple. Also owls and teddies. And chocolate. Basically I like a lot of things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis Patreon is one part of my ongoing ambition have administration be something \"I\u0027m just doing \"until this writing thing takes off\".\u003c/strong\u003e A lofty ambition, but the way I see it any bit of income, no matter how small, that comes from my writing instead of from my day job is more time I can reasonably spend on my creative career. I believe for most indie creatives it is good to have eggs in multiple baskets, and I would love for Patreon to be one of those baskets for me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to see my Patreon grow into \u003cstrong\u003ea warm, active, friendly community\u003c/strong\u003e, populated by people who for whatever reason want me to write \u003cem\u003emoar stuhff\u003c/em\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeally I\u0027d like to have a range of different features and rewards for patrons, but I\u0027d like those things to be shaped by and for the community as it grows so I\u0027m starting with quite a simple system:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, I will post \u003cstrong\u003ea special short story for all my patrons to read\u003c/strong\u003e. Some of these stories will be complete \u003cstrong\u003estand-alone pieces\u003c/strong\u003e, but a lot of them are likely to be \u003cstrong\u003erelated to one of my published works or WIPs\u003c/strong\u003e, like \"off-screen\" scenes or even stories that are unrelated to the main storyline but take place in the same world. I look forward to sharing some of those little ideas that didn\u0027t quite fit into the larger narrative with you. The Monthly Shorts will be Patreon-exclusive for \u003cem\u003eat least\u003c/em\u003e 6 months after publication. After that, I might end up self-publishing them in short story collections that Patreons will get special offers on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, patrons will get \u003cstrong\u003epreviews and behind-the-scenes content\u003c/strong\u003e of my projects, be able to provide prompts for my weekly flash fiction post and interact with me and my creative life in various ways. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound good? I hope it does! Go ahead and sign up and get access to the Patron-only content today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
