I am a super busy software developer with a dream for a software studio, that finally became reality some 4 months ago. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been commercially developing database driven web applications for a little over a decade now, designing software supporting retail operations, accounting, compliance, energy management and hardware solutions worldwide. It\u0027s been a blast and it\u0027s what I still do every day but my fine art background and a persuasive inner geek requires me to release my creativity elsewhere.  \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEver since childhood I found fantasy and science fiction fascinating and by the age of 12 I was completely lost for the world in RPGs of all shapes and sizes and I would have started sketching out one of my own. Ethernal - the world described by the mobile game we\u0027re making, has naturally evolved over hundreds of session me and my friends and their friends thereafter have played out in tabletop rpg adventures. Over years we have described to each other the world of the game in such detail, that writing it down now is too much of a task for a mortal being. The solution was obvious. I have designed a game engine that would allow a back end control of all in game assets, which I could then populate with great help from my friends and family.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a complete tech junkie, I am very keen to learn new things. I believe however that the best way to learn anything is by brutal practice. This has led me to start my first AngularJS project which later became the groundwork for the user interface of \n\t\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEthernalis\u003c/a\u003e Mobile Game App.  \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, 4 months into the project I already have a working dungeon crawler, with an RPG event system that slightly reminds you of old MUD like text based games, spiced up with original artwork and lots of content. It all looks very promising and hence the appetite to push it to the next level. I\u0027m ready to try.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m joining Patreon, hoping that additional funding will help me to realise ambitious plan of delivering a web based massively multiplayer roguelike rpg game engine and cross platform clients for Android \u0026amp; iOS. So far I have funded the project myself, but with your support I could push it way further.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
