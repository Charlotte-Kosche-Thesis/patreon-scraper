The main focus of my work is to increase the depth and breadth of work of queer feminist content, and I hope to one day create a series that is bigger than Star Trek. (You know, NBD.) In the work I create and have creative control over, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI always strive to have people of diverse ethnicities and diverse body types on screen. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cstrong\u003ework\u003c/strong\u003e is best described as \"\u003cem\u003eblending genres and pushing boundaries\u003c/em\u003e.\" I often - but not always - end up working in the horror genre, and often use sarcasm and satire to nudge my ideas along.

This was me with a FlipHD camera and very little post-production, as a semi-sketch caricature of myself.

When work is rushed or done on the cheap, it often suffers in quality and doesn\u0027t get released on time. I\u0027m not interested in creating or putting out work that \nisn\u0027t of high enough quality that I can be proud of, and I don\u0027t want to make my audience wait for years between my projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strongly believe in being able to pay my cast and crew a living wage, and that is only possible when I have sufficient funds coming in. I do my best to get grants, find investors, run crowdfunding campaigns, seek sponsors, negotiate film deals, and find other ways to get money... but film, television, and webseries that feature diverse bodies and diverse voices (especially media helmed by queer women) is still drastically underfunded and undervalued by the people holding the purse strings at networks and funding bodies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also believe in constant learning and constant improvement, which is why I am always seeking to hone my craft as a performer and filmmaker. Taking the time to continue to train and practice is important to me, both within a classroom setting and on my own time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I wear so many hats on my own projects in order to be able to pull film projects off on a small budget. I am often the writer, director, producer, craft services, editor, set decorator, props finder, toilet unclogger when accidents happen on set - and boy, do they happen! - and many other things. It\u0027s a bit Sisyphean at the best of times, and it\u0027s very exhausting. Most of my own projects are often shelved or delayed - even at the development stage - because I need to take paying work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe freelance work I do for paying clients currently takes up a good chunk of my time. With this Patreon, I can hustle a little bit less and create projects on my production slate more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) \"What\u0027s with the cats?\u003c/strong\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003eWell, my production company is called \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLaughing Cat Productions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. Our logo is based on one of my furbabies, Yuki, who sadly passed away several years ago. \u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, I\u0027m a proud cat mama of two of my own kitties, and I also foster and rehabilitate cats through a rescue group. So with our live or live-ish video content, there\u0027s a good chance you will see a cat wander through the frame at some point. I definitely have outtakes of cats meowing and scratching at closed doors. You get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) \"Who\u0027s \u0027we\u0027?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe royal we I sometimes refer to are the other folks who help me out with Laughing Cat work, on-screen and off. Mostly, it\u0027s my partner Greg who has been an amazing help with all things audio, as well as my rotating cast and crew depending on the specific project at hand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Why did you star the \u0027fiesty redhead\u0027 comment up above?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOooh, you\u0027ve got a good eye! I starred it because even though I am generally gingery and soulless, I often dye my hair other funky colors. Or sometimes boring ones, like gothy black. My actual superpower is that I can match any hair color to my skin tone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4) What else have you done?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNow that, my friend, is a loaded question. If you want to see my practically complete film resume, I suggest you check out my \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3191505/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIMDB listing\u003c/a\u003e. As of now, my time is split pretty evenly between acting and being behind the camera in some capacity. Unfortunately, a lot of the more recent work (including stuff that is higher quality) isn\u0027t yet available online. If you have a lot of hours to waste on the internet, you can check out a bunch of stuff I\u0027ve acted in over the years, via my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL406F3E2B2900C533\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube acting playlist\u003c/a\u003e, or you are welcome to scroll through my \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EmilySchooley/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e where I post updates about acting projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5) You say you\u0027re a feminist. What kind of feminist are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnother great question! My feminism includes all female, female \nidentifying, and afab folks. It includes trans women. It includes women \nof color. It includes sex workers. it includes disabled folks. It \nincludes people struggling with mental illness. It includes women of all\n body sizes and types, with a focus on body positivity. It includes neurodiverse folks. And, \nsurprisingly or not, it includes trying to undo everything toxic \nmasculinity has created in our contemporary culture. I believe in \ncreating a more healthy society for and with men and amab folks. \u003cem\u003eI\u0027m more of a social justice evil queen than a warrior, really, but I\u0027m a gal who can do both if I need to.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote:\n I will be the first to admit that I am still unlearning harmful ideas \nand behaviours, so please do feel free to call me in if I do or say something \nthat is harmful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that covers everything, but If you have a burning question you\u0027d like answered, fire away and I will add it to the FAQ!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, as of the time of writing all this (March 2018) I am brand new to the platform. I may update perks and goals as I go, depending on my evolving needs and what my audience wants to see.\u003cbr\u003e"
