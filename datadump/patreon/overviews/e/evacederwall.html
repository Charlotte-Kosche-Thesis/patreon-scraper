Woop!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am so happy that you are on my Patreonpage:)\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you enjoy it and stay around.\u003cbr\u003eTogether it is so much more fun! I get to learn from you guys just as I hope I can inspire you to be creative and relate to life in perhaps an even more fun and also deeper way through art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCURIOUS but only have a minute to spare right now?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1. I love making art for/ with people\u003cbr\u003e2. You can be part of my dedicated artfamily\u003cbr\u003e3. Join me now!\u003cbr\u003e4.Thank you\u0026lt;3\u0026lt;3\u0026lt;3\u0026lt;3\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS. The longer version follows here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion in life is to create art that make people love, laugh, think and ACT more.\u003cbr\u003eI often work with these questions: respect, diversity, equality and sustainability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is giving HOPE, clarity, strength and beauty to so many people.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe need it in our lives in one way or the other: if its coming from a pair of headphones, ones favourite comedian, a mural on a wall, an animated film or a sculpture in a gallery - it doesn\u2019t matter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll around us there is creativity that make us CONNECT with our feelings, dreams and desires. It helps us through challenging times or gives us happy memories, teaches us about life and death and everything in between.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you have the opportunity to STEP UP and get involved with the arts so it can keep being political, funny, provoking and to continue to reflect on our society and the world around us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe way I personally relate to the world may look a bit different to the person working in an office from 9-5 but I guarantee we have some basic needs and desires in common. Us humans often do;)\u003cbr\u003e\nI see images, words and colours as a language, a way of communicating with the world and trying to understand it, and  it feels as natural as breathing for me to create art. Its a first love, a passion and an everlasting marriage!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nArt is in my veins. I spend a LOT of love and time on it to learn, evolve and deliver it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a facilitator for me to have a truly exciting and ongoing relationship with you artlovers out there who want to understand the process and the expression of my art, showing commitment from your end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome projects cost a lot of money to execute: time for research, connecting with people, planning and organizing the project, travels, materials, marketing, wages for people working with you and actual time to execute the idea of course (!) - some \u2018only\u2019 costs time but that means you need to have money to SPEND that time..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am the creator, and I create for the participants as well as for myself. People who take the time to experience the work, learn something from it, get a sense of something new from it and feel they want to explore more within themselves as a result.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA hundred people experience the same piece of art in a hundred different ways.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe spectator/ participant owns the art piece, not the artist. This is why your input is invaluable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOWN YOUR art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen you get into Patreon you get access to my work:\u003cbr\u003efrom initial ideas, experiments: trial and error and victory, to the end results:\u003cbr\u003ephotographs, events with live art, paintings, animations, mixed media, collage, drawings, texts, 3D-objects, sustainable products and more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe results may end up exhibited in a galley, or in someones home, outside, popping up at a company or on the web, all depending on the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a Patreon you enable me to keep my independence and share it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU again for connecting with me and my art, it makes all the difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best to you\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you soon, lots of love from\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEva\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
