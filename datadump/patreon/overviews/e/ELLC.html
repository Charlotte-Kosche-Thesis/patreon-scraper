Includes profanity, explicit sexual content and gore, but the focus is more or less on the humor. I write it as a hobby, more as an outlet for my creative side than a means of making money. I have no intention of quitting my job to start writing full-time. Therefore, I really don\u0027t need your support, but I appreciate it nonetheless since it will let me commission more awesome art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I\u0027m a bit twisted. Just so we\u0027re clear on that. I\u0027m an evil bastard that enjoys toying with the fragile expectations of his readers and then shattering them. Especially the ones who seem to have some sort of expectations and keep asking themselves questions. Will the main character ever find love? Is world domination on the horizon?\u00a0Are the Gods actually sentient frogs with fancy hats? Why do men have nipples?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho knows?
