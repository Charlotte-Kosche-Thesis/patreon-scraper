    "summary": "First, many thanks to my patrons new \u0026amp; old! I look forward to producing many episodes of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ericgarza.info/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Worldview Apart\u003c/a\u003e with your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this podcast in May of 2017 to help myself and my listeners\u00a0chart a productive and compassionate path forwards in a world rife with ideological impasse and cognitive dissonance. Most episodes include conversations with guests, but I do release solo episodes on occasion too. I cover a wide range of topical areas, including nature and environment, economics and finance, and social justice issues as well. New episodes are released every Wednesday morning, with bonus episodes occasionally released later each week when my schedule allows. You can listen to episodes on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ericgarza.info/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e, and on most podcatchers (Apple/iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Play, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI offer a couple rewards to folks generous enough to support me through Patreon.\u00a0One of them is a series of premium posts on my practice of Inner Tracking, which I allude to in some of my podcast episodes. I release these near the beginning of each month, once patrons\u0027 contributions from the previous month have all cleared. I also offer premium episodes accessible as mp3 files, like my regular podcast episodes. These episodes (usually 15-30 minutes in length but sometimes longer) can be downloaded from the Patreon website for listening on your computer, or you can paste the Private Audio RSS Link available on this page (you will see it pop up once you become a patron) into your podcast app so you can download and listen to premium content like you would any episode. I also welcome questions from my patrons and will periodically record Q\u0026amp;A episodes if I accumulate enough of them. Finally, I am happy to field suggestions for new guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you might imagine, a lot goes into producing a podcast. From\nmedia hosting to recording equipment, everything costs money. Many podcasts sell advertising to cover their production\ncosts. This not only detracts from folks\u0027 listening\nexperiences, but it also influences how we perceive ourselves and our place in the world, often in negative ways. I want to avoid adding to my listeners burden of commercial advertising, and with that goal in mind\u00a0I\u00a0invite you support me here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a simple platform that allows you to create an account and sign on as a patron to support A Worldview Apart. Once your account is up and running, you pledge to donate $1 or more for each podcast episode I release. You can also cap your monthly contribution at any level that feels good to you, if you wish. As an example, if you wanted to pitch in $5 per month, a marginal sum for most people, you could pledge $1 for each episode I release and cap your monthly contribution at $5. Patreon would record your $1 donation for each of the first 5 episodes I release in a given month, and after that 5th episode you have reached your cap so no further donations would be recorded. At the end of the month Patreon would charge your card or your PayPal account for your $5 contribution, and the cycle would start again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can even sign on as a Patron for just $1 per month, by pledging $1 per episode and setting your cap at $1. This is a wonderful way to show your support and gain access to the rewards I offer while keeping your spending down, if money is tight. Regardless how much you contribute, know that I am grateful for all of the support I get! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
