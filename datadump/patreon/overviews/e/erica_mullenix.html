Readers and supporters who may not be courted by corporate America, but still very much want to feel represented in some way. Find my personal blog at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://freefringes.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efreefringes.me\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I write about: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cli\u003eintegrating special needs kids and adults into neurotypical environments. I\u0027ve gone from the parent of a special needs infant to the parent of a special needs kid to, now, the parent of a special needs young adult. Are my choices and decisions the same as those of a parent of a neurotypical kid? Do I just leave condoms on the nightstand, walk away and hope for the best? How long can I put off teaching her how to drive when she still cannot tie her shoes?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eblack people--they\u0027re just like us. But, with centuries of systemic oppression designed to push them into a permanent underclass, so maybe re-think those white lady dreadlocks as a symbol of solidarity unless you\u0027re willing to put in the hard work of providing relief from current practices and beliefs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003enavigating the world as an introvert. As a writer and storyteller, I am learning to present my world from the inside out rather than expect others to accept me from the outside. Sharing stories and failures and triumphs instead of presenting an \"all is well\" facade certainly helps those who are struggling more quietly, yet just as fiercely, as I am.\u003c/li\u003e"
