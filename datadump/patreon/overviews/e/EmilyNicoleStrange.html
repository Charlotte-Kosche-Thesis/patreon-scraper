I would not be where I am today without the love and support of all my friends, family, and fans.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeck my fans are more like friends! I still create crafts with Broke College Crafters who have added some new creators and become Moon Cat Crafts. On the side I model in the Triad Area of North Carolina and have been published in several magazines for my collaborations, as well as poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere I want to post my photography projects with you. I will sell prints, sell exclusive accessories, and show you publication projects ahead of time! Patreon money is going towards gas money and make up for my shoots. One day I would love to use it towards outfits as well. Each shoot now I travel at least two hours one way. Shoots have helped so much with my depression and boost my self esteem. I cannot stress how much I think everyone should try to be in front of the camera at least once in their lives :)\u003cbr\u003e"
