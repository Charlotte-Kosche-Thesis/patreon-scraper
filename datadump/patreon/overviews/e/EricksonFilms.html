At this stage in my YouTube journey, I\u0027m not making much money from the site itself, so it can be hard for me to justify the large amount of hours I pour into my work. By supporting the channel here, you\u0027re helping to push the channel forward and for the quality to increase. \u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, other funds from this campaign will go towards \u003cstrong\u003eincreasing the production value of these videos\u003c/strong\u003e, helping me to purchase new audio/video equipment like new lights, lenses, microphones, cameras, etc; as well as more products to review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything\u003c/strong\u003e helps to help make this channel better and provides me motivation to continue.
