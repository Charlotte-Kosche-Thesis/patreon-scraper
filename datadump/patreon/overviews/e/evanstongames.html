    "summary": "Thanks to our fantastic community,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.evanstongames.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEvanston Games and Cafe\u003c/a\u003e has thrived! We opened in January of 2017, and the growth we\u0027ve experienced has constantly reaffirmed our dedication to providing an inclusive space where all are welcome to comfortably gather, game, and enjoy some great food. In pursuit of that goal, we\u0027ve expanded the demo library, added additional seating, and regularly rent out space for a variety of larger events. The amazing\u00a0James Beard Award-winning Chef Sarah Stegner of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.prairiegrasscafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePrairie Grass Cafe\u003c/a\u003e continues to supply the stunningly delicious soups, sandwiches, salads, and baked goods on our menu. On top of all of that, we have two wonderful employees - this is no longer a one-man show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou are the ones who make so much of this possible. Keeping a brick-and-mortar shop above water in Evanston is tough\u00a0- let alone a board game shop - but you\u0027ve helped to make it happen.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fc2f1e_245c8811be3541308e97f4599ba1c0ac~mv2_d_4160_3120_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_900,h_675,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/fc2f1e_245c8811be3541308e97f4599ba1c0ac~mv2_d_4160_3120_s_4_2.webp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s no denying that EGC has been growing, but with our business model, income tends to go toward expanding our inventory, providing employees with additional hours, and general upkeep and maintenance of the store. We\u0027re eager to make some much-needed expansions and improvements, and continued community support will be enormously helpful in making that a reality. With the help of the incredible \"patronage\" we\u0027ve \u003cstrong\u003ereached our first goal\u003c/strong\u003e of adding\u00a0electrical outlets to the cafe bar to facilitate those long hours of homework, coding, and more. \u003cstrong\u003eNext up\u003c/strong\u003e, we\u0027d like to up our cafe output with another panini press. Future goals include improved air conditioning and other accommodations in our back room and additional updates to the kitchen, such as increased fridge space for grab-and-go cold sandwiches and salads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon instead of a one-time fundraiser or cash infusion?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the stated goals are at the top of the list right now, so much more will be possible with a\u00a0sustained bump to the store\u0027s monthly income. Most importantly, it\u0027s a core value of the EGC team to provide competitive wages to employees. We\u0027re beating the Evanston minimum wage right now, but would like to increase that to at least $15/hour sooner rather than later. Long-term, we\u0027d like to have access to larger event spaces in downtown Evanston. Someday Eli should actually pay himself a reasonable salary. The possibilities are endless, and we\u0027ll be listening to community requests throughout our (hopefully) continued growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, EGC will continue to prioritize inclusivity and a welcoming atmosphere for guests of diverse ideas, beliefs, worldviews, and experiences. As our code of conduct states, we strive to provide a space that is family-friendly and comfortable for people of all races, ethnicities, nationalities, religions, gender identities and expressions, sexual orientations, ages, appearances, and abilities. Thank you for always helping us work toward that goal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fc2f1e_25a8e248b7bc40a1b51a456338e83bab~mv2_d_2506_3407_s_4_2.jpg/v1/crop/x_0,y_0,w_2505,h_3407/fill/w_900,h_1224,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/fc2f1e_25a8e248b7bc40a1b51a456338e83bab~mv2_d_2506_3407_s_4_2.webp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
