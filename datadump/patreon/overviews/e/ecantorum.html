    "summary": "\"HIZZONER\" is a rock opera written to appeal to us ordinary folk, hence \"a people\u0027s opera\" or \u0027musical\u0027, if you prefer). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has three acts, three\u00a0scenes in each, as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cem\u003eACT 1: Scene 1 \u00a0The Birth;\u00a0Scene 2 \u00a0The Teaching; Scene 3 \u00a0The Call\u003cbr\u003eAct 2: Scene 1 \u00a0The Baptism; Scene 2 \u00a0The Confirmation; Scene 3 \u00a0The Betrayal\u003cbr\u003eAct 3: Scene 1 \u00a0The Ascension; Scene 2 \u00a0The Power; Scene 3 \u00a0The Glory\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eThe story\u00a0spans the life of a metro-city politician. For example, in Act 1, Scene 1, the Chorus introduces the main\u00a0character (Hizzoner, destined to eventually rule the City), who is trying to recall the day of his birth. His Mother and Father express their fears and hopes for their new-born child. Key characters (the controlling political Ward Boss (Jack) and corrupt business-man, Mr. Saggs, who will both play an important role in his future, are introduced for the first time. \u00a0Successes come naturally to Hizzoner. However, the irresistable pull of financial and political corruption lead inevitably to serious betrayals of the City\u0027s reigning Boss, his long-time playmate Mary (a wife-to-be) and ultimately his best Friend. The curtain opens on the Chorus and Hizzoner with the following lines:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChorus\u003c/strong\u003e:\n\n\t\t\t\tRemember, remember, start at the beginning\u003cbr\u003eBegin-Begin-Begin\nBegin-Begin-Begin\nBegin-Begin-Begin\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHizzoner\u003c/strong\u003e: What should I remember?\u003cbr\u003e\nAm I on the right tack?\u003cbr\u003e\nI am sure I was born a million years back\n\u003cbr\u003eBut how can I remember\u00a0right out of the womb?\u003cbr\u003e\nPerhaps its all phony, what was written on my tomb by some public relations flack! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eThe music and lyrics are finished. Basic orchestration is now being written but will take several more months to complete. Orchestrated scene scores (Acts 1, 2 and part of 3) can be heard at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/conscious1/tracks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHizzoner: a people\u0027s opera in three Acts, nine Scenes\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe orchestrated music will hopefully help to build support (financial as well as interest in the music community) and lay some groundwork for attracting a larger audience among music lovers generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKey tasks ahead, for which your kind financial support will be used, include:\u003cbr\u003e1. Enlisting talented singers;\u003cbr\u003e2. Preparation of a demonstration recording of the opera;\u003cbr\u003e3. Preparation of a video for use in building viewership, funding support and a presentation package;\u003cbr\u003e4. Preparation of a professional presentation package for potential investors;\u003cbr\u003e5. Refinement of opera and preparations for theatrical performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, the ultimate objective is to see the work produced on the stage, as well as in the form of an video production and/or in anime form? Weird idea? I\u0027m open to creative suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My musical interest first became manifest one bright Sunday morn, when - being merely 2 or 3 years old - I was listening to the Hartz Mountain organ-music program while being otherwise occupied with rolling onions across Grandma\u0027s kitchen. Highly annoyed with the then-famous Hartz Canaries inability to sing in tune with the music, I am said to have shouted out that the \"damn canaries can\u0027t sing\". As it turned out, neither could I - very well at least - although in a few short years, Ken Dombe, a famous ball-park organist in Cleveland, \u0027taught\u0027 me to play piano (I was watching and listening, but to Ken\u0027s and other teacher\u0027s\u0027 frustration, I couldn\u0027t really read music for years thereafter.) My high-school choir teacher had me elected president, no doubt to give me a useful role in that otherwise talented body of singers, and even attempted most kindly to arrange for me to get a music college scholarship. Dad, however, persuaded me that a musical career was not likely to be significantly remunerative over the long run, so while attending Northwestern University, my musical nature was fairly suppressed except for a wholly abortive attempt to understand music theory at NU\u0027s school of music. Much more fun (drinking and girl-wise) was had playing in the fraternity-based rock-band. Awful as we were, it turned out that Ann Margaret desperately needed a band to accompany her tear-the-house-down performance at the University\u0027s annual freshman music program for the entire student body. \"Mangoes and Papayus\" never sounded better; interesting twerks (or whatever) still arise whenever I hear that song. Getting serious about music it turned out came out of learning to write it down during that era of Presley, the Beatles, Brubeck and all-that-jazz. The origins of my people\u0027s opera, Hizzoner, hearken back to my hacking away on a rented electronic/recording organ in our small child filled home beside Johnson\u0027s Slough, a tiny body of water south of Hinsdale, Illinois. In the many years that have passed since then, I earned law and management degrees (U. of Illinois, MIT), played big-corporate lawyer and small town lawyer, raised a bit of money for several charities (Rotary Foundation, Alzheimers, etc.) and am now pleasantly retired back to an over-the-garage piano cum recording studio. To quote Kurt Vonnegut: \"So it goes.\"\u00a0",
