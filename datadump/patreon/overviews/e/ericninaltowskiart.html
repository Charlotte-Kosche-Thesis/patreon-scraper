This page is for \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFans\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e who want an inside look at my art, and be a part of the action! (That is, the creating process!) For \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAspiring Artists\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0who want a little more insight into drawing and creating, but also those who want to take their Comic Art to the next level, gaining tips and techniques 10 years in the making! Lastly, what I\u0027m most excited for, this page is for those who want to be a part of helping me not only\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Make Great Comics, but Making Comics Great Again!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Not that ALL comics are horrible, don\u0027t get me wrong, there are a few I still enjoy, but if you long for the day of 80\u0027s- 90\u0027s comics, the days of Image, the glory days of the X-Men, when things were simpler, when comics had a life to them that has long since dried up and disappeared into the abyss... If you long to read those type of comics again, then JOIN ME as I create comics like that!! Bring back the awesome that was once comics, what made you fall in love with them in the first place! Comics that will inspire you again, and inspire a new generation the way they once inspired you!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working on my own projects in the beginning phases for years, constantly having to put them off and juggle them beside other people\u0027s work. With your help that can be a distant memory!! This journey won\u0027t happen overnight, it will be done with care one comic at a time, created with pride, done right! Then eventually as we grow, an entire Comic Company will bloom. Yes, that is the end goal. You will see it grow and you can even be included in the creative process as we discuss in the patron-only feed. I will share development and ideas with you and you can give me your feedback. I\u0027ll even let you decide which comics I should do first... what are you most excited about seeing come to life? Then... eventually... have your name in the credits!! It will be a team effort, but with your support, no matter how much, it will get done!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SUPPORT ME??\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a Fire in my belly, and something to prove! I\u0027ve been turned down by the Big Two, and yet countless people tell me, \"Why aren\u0027t you drawing comics, your art is amazing!\" I want to create comics, and let\u0027s be honest, the comics industry needs some new material! So let me bring you my ideas and creations! Below are a few brief creator owned ideas and stories I\u0027ve been working on for a while.... and you tell me if you think they are something you want to see brought to life! These will become the comics that I mentioned... and start the groundwork for a future comic company...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ericninaltowskiart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WARGUN_Promo_finished_72.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a comic that I got the idea for way back in High School, while much has changed the idea has stayed the same... have our hero trained and put to the test in worlds that harbor Ninja\u0027s, Monsters, robots, you name it! While I don\u0027t want to give too much away, let\u0027s just say our hero, Warren, is flung into a world and plot that he has yet to learn he is even a part of. How would you respond if you were shoved into a world and told to survive!? What weapons would you choose? What allies would you make? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDEVELOPMENT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo where do I stand in the process of creating Wargun? I have the story all broken down and laid out and I have the first 10-11 pages sketched out and ready to go. I just need to finalize the script, but the plot is all finished!\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s some more art of Wargun...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ericninaltowskiart.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WG_IFC_art-e1368122855910.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ericninaltowskiart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WARGUN_Promo_Cover_New_72.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ericninaltowskiart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WARGUN-logo_Final_300.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e______________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEXT UP....

I still enjoy reading it and want to bring it to life in a Graphic Novel form, telling the tale from start to finish. I\u0027ve been working on it a lot lately actually, really hammering the story out and fleshing out who BEOWULF really is as a man. He almost comes across as a superman type character, larger than life, battling sea monsters and all kinds of ungodly creatures, but what makes him \ntick, what does his character tell us about true strength? Manliness? \u003cbr\u003eSure movies have been made of the tale, but to me none of them capture the true essence and power of the classic story. Too much is left out or just plain altered. I want to stay true to the original, use alliteration, use rhyme like the classics used to, but just bring it to life with the full force of the comics medium. Make it awesome! Oh, and did I mention I want to do it in a Frank Miller, Jim Lee- Deathblow style? How sweet would that be?!\u003cbr\u003eBeowulf vs. Grendel... like you\u0027ve never seen it before!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePROGRESS... I have the breakdown of the book all done, I\u0027ve started laying out the first few pages and really refining the script, right now I\u0027ve been working on this the most vehemently.
