    "summary": "Hi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Alistair Young. I write stuff. When I\u0027m not writing stuff, I\u0027m talking about writing stuff. If I\u0027m not doing that, I\u0027m thinking about writing stuff. In short, I\u0027m a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you don\u0027t want to know about me. You want to know about what I write, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write speculative fiction, which - were you to try and squeeze a genre label onto it - you \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0call firm-to-hard transsophontist space opera. Or you might not. I don\u0027t judge. Or catalog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn format, most of it is short fiction (of a few hundred to few thousand words in length) or metafiction, with occasional excerpts of longer works. There\u0027s quite a bit available on the web already,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://eldraeverse.com/category/writing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eif you\u0027d care to take a look\u003c/a\u003e, or you could always just\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Vignettes-Star-Empire-Associated-Worlds/dp/148026220X/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebuy the book\u003c/a\u003e..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Setting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn another universe, in a galaxy strangely similar to our own, there\u2019s a bubble of space a couple of thousand light-years across \u2013 somewhat distorted by bumping into the edges of the galactic disk to acme and nadir \u2013 filled with millions of stars, bound together by an ever-expanding spiderweb of manufactured wormholes, and bright with the EM babble of civilized life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the \u003cem\u003eAssociated Worlds\u003c/em\u003e, sprawling myriad species, polities, philosophies, corporations, clades, and cultures.  From the hypercivilized Powers at their heart \u2013 the Empire of the Star, self-proclaimed jewel of the galaxy; the Photonic Network, by, for, and of digital intelligences; the Voniensa Republic, standing up for the natural sophont in a galaxy leaving them behind; and more \u2013 to the brawling colonies of the Periphery and Beyond, trillions of lives are lived, each with its own story to be told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are some of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get whatever I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, okay. What I \u003cem\u003emean \u003c/em\u003eby that is that I\u0027m chary of making too many promises about volume or scheduling, the exigencies of non-writer-work being what they are, and my output fluctuates accordingly. But whenever I do set pen to paper, finger to keyboard, etc., you\u0027ll get it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Story\", for these purposes, means a piece of short fiction (usually a couple of hundred to a couple of thousand words in length), or a piece of a longer work of equivalent length, or the in-setting work extracts I call metafiction, set in the Worlds. I do publish other things quite routinely, such as my trope-a-day worldbuilding series, author\u0027s notes, and other such things, which you will also have access to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Give Me Money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, three reasons, principally:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, because I write for the love of it, and work for a living. If you give me money for my writing, I can work on other things less and write more. (And then people will give me even more money! And I will write even more! It\u0027s a virtuous circle! It\u0027s the circle of life! \u003cem\u003eViva capitalism!\u003c/em\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, because while I may not write the absolutely hardest SF ever, I do strive to write SF that is at least firm. Which means research, and research costs, alas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThirdly, because my dogs will starve, otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arkane-webmisc/dogs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmittedly, some faster than others.\u003cbr\u003e"
