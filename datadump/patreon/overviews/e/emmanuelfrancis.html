    "summary": "Hey!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI know, I know. The folks at Patreon showed me all the data that said, this was likely to hold your attention if it was a video. I saw the data and decided to rebel. If you\u0027re still reading, we\u0027re much alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Emmanuel-Francis and I would like to invite you on an adventure, one full of history, or in this, our story, that we\u0027ll learn, together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write about issues facing Nigeria in particular and Africa in general. I believe in dousing my writing in a good dose of historical analysis. It is my belief that doing so leads to a write-up equal parts: balanced, interesting and most importantly informative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, my writing depends on having access to sources of information, of which the best--books and time--- aren\u0027t free, not even, I\u0027m told, in Freetown. \u003cem\u003eThat was a letdown\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you, so once and future Patron come in. By sending me your dough, we achieve the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp improve my knowledge, making me incredibly well informed in my chosen areas of study. I\u0027m sure we agree that this is a worthy goal, for us, as I learn, you do too.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIncrease the quality of my writing, which due to being a source of knowledge and entertainment to you is a win-win.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp me defray some of my student expenses.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe above are short-term goals. In the long-term I hope to write a book or books, drawing on the materials I had acquired thanks to your kind support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically, short-term we gain. Long-term the world does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eSo why not stick to Quora?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Emmanuel-Francis-Nwaolisa-Ogomegbunam\"\u003ehttps://www.quora.com/profile/Emmanuel-Francis-Nwa...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love Quora, and I view it as a fundamental part of my academic journey. This, however, is different. I intend at some point in the future to write my own books, so this serves as market research; are people willing to pay my words? If they are, then what sort of work would they want? Perhaps a collection of essays, a historical book, or something else, what? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso as Adam Smith said, \"The propensity to truck, barter and exchange one thing for another is common to all men\". This is me embracing my Homo Economus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you skipped to the end, here\u0027s the summary: If you help transform me into Scrooge McDuck, I\u0027ll spin Gold for you, like the girl from Rumpelstiltskin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so very much for reading, and hopefully, adopting my work. I will do my utmost to make my content as enjoyable to you, as the sound of the drop of your coin in my piggy-bank is to me. Best Wishes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmmanuel-Francis"
