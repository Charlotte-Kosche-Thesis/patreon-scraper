I\u2019m Eric (that\u2019s me up in the corner). I\u2019m the lead author and community originator for \u003cstrong\u003eInception Publishing\u003c/strong\u003e. We are\u00a0devoted to providing you with a fundamentally novel approach to life through practical books and courses about \u003cstrong\u003eCoherence Verification* \u003c/strong\u003e(I\u0027ll define this term below), and the application of comprehensive truthfulness. If that doesn\u2019t sound like anything you\u0027ve heard of before, you are not alone. Give me a few moments to explain and make clear how all of this matters to you, and then how this relates to our\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e effort. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhat you might not be aware of\u2026\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s quite clear now, based upon advanced physics models and our research here at \u003cstrong\u003eInception Publishing\u003c/strong\u003e, that the Universe is made up of two essential forces, energy and information. Everything else, including you, is \u2018built\u2019 with these forces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of the combinations of energy and information become very stable, and formative, in that they create a basis for other patterns and forces. You experience these stable patterns every day, like in the forms of gravity and electricity. We often refer to these patterns as the \u003cstrong\u003elaws of Nature\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eInterestingly, there are some other patterns that have only just been discovered and clarified, and knowing these patterns allows people to have much more enjoyable and fulfilling lives. Here at \u003cstrong\u003eInception Publishing\u003c/strong\u003e, we refer to these patterns collectively as, the \u003cstrong\u003eTruth\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eYou are like a super computer!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour body and brain is always sorting out what is working for you and what isn\u2019t, kind of like the ultimate super computer. Your super computer is also determining what information \u201cmatches\u201d the accurate information in the Universe, again, what we call the \u003cstrong\u003eTruth\u003c/strong\u003e. This matching happens every time you assemble some information together to make a thought. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen a thought is assembled, an energetic probability field (almost like a mathematical question) is set up, and gets resolved right away. When your thoughts are factual or truthful, \u003cstrong\u003eyour body and mind works well\u003c/strong\u003e. When your thoughts aren\u2019t very truthful, your mind and body suffers. This effect \u2018in the body\u2019 can be externally seen. \u003cem\u003eIn essence, the human body can be used to \u2018see\u2019 this natural phenomenon happening by completing a simple muscle strength test.\u003c/em\u003e When there is truthful thought, there is a strong musculoskeletal response. Without truthful, or at least factual thought, your mind and body weaken temporarily.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eYou are a human Truth detector!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could walk up to you right now, have you hold up your arm, ask you to tell me your name, and then push down on your outstretched arm while you resisted. If you gave me your correct name, then your muscles would easily resist me pushing down on your arm. If you gave me a name different than your own, your arm would go almost totally weak when I pushed down on it, even if only gently. Your body is effectively \u201ctelling\u201d me whether you have told the truth about your name, or not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Here\u0027s the \u003cstrong\u003eCoherence Verification\u003c/strong\u003e thing I mentioned above.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny information, can be determined to be true, or not true, by you. All that needs to be done is perform a simple and accurate muscle test, or what I like to call a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCoherence Verification\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, in just a couple seconds. You can learn to have access to the basic accuracy of nearly any story or event, no matter where it occurred, or when. If that isn\u2019t a surprising talent, I don\u2019t know what is. Take just a few seconds to contemplate what you could do with that kind of capability!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause any reasonably healthy person can learn to use \u003cstrong\u003eCoherence Verification\u003c/strong\u003e for the discovery of facts and the Truth, \u003cstrong\u003ethere\u2019s almost no limit to what you can do with it!
