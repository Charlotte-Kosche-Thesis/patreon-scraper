    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eTo our Eagles Brothers and Sisters,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are producing a podcast for fans of the Philadelphia Eagles. We have been doing this since 2007, essentially the early days of podcasting. In these years we have produced more than 200 episodes, heard from Eagles fans from all over the world, and even met some of you. That experience alone has shown us how amazing all of you are. We now have people in our lives that we consider friends, because of what we put together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is our show and Why do we do it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is simple... because we are Eagles fans, and love the entire fan base of passionate and intelligent people out there. We have met Eagles fans from all over the world who share the same passion. Each year we hear from new people, and they continue to inspire and motivate us to keep doing the show. Our show is not from a sports analyst point of view, as there are plenty like that out there. We do this show as fans. We live through the elation and disappointment as any do, and offer a place to share in the celebration. It is also a sort of therapy in the frustrating times. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAwesome, what now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has never been free to produce our shows, but it is a project of brotherly love. Over the past few years, listeners and fans of the show have asked how THEY can help out. We are humbled that our listeners want to be a part.\u003cbr\u003eAudio file hosting, recording hardware, software, and site hosting all cost us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry though, our show will forever be free for everyone to download, that is a promise!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur patrons\u0027 support will be used to offset the costs of what goes into producing this show. If you appreciate EaglesFanCast, you have a few bucks to spare, and want to help us out, please consider becoming a valued sponsor. We can\u0027t thank you enough for it (and we\u0027ll give you a shout out on the show).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, Fly Eagles Fly."
