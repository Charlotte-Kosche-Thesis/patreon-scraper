Adding Patreon into the mix allows me to start moving closer to this dream, and money from Patreon helps me be able to afford gear upgrades that I otherwise would be unable to afford on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to this, Patreon is also a great way to help me be a bit more financially stable so that I can focus on consistently creating content, and improving my content on the way. I\u0027m currently a college student, so at times I struggle to find time to create and improve my content as it is: getting a conventional job to help support my channel would only increase this struggle, and make it harder to continue to make content for my viewers and to follow my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon also allows me an outlet to connect even more with those who want to support my work beyond liking, commenting, and subscribing! My viewers make what I do possible, and through Patreon I\u0027m able to make more of a connection with my \"superfans,\" and show that I appreciate them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow does this thing work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eIn a nutshell, Patreon allows you to choose how much you want to pledge per video of mine, and based on the amount you choose to pledge, you\u0027ll gain access to certain rewards. It is important to note that while I sometimes make piano covers and other short arrangements in addition to my jazz covers to keep up with weekly videos, \u003cstrong\u003eif you choose to pledge you will only be charged for my jazz covers.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledging is 100% optional, and \u003cu\u003emy content on YouTube will remain free\u003c/u\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003ehowever if you are able to pledge I would strongly encourage you to do so! Your pledges will help me to continuously improve the quality of my YouTube videos, and will help me move closer to achieving my dream. Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e"
