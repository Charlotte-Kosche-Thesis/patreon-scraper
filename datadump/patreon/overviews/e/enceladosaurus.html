This Patreon gives you an opportunity to access more frequent and better content. This includes multimedia products like videos, podcasts, and recorded interviews. It also means that I\u0027ll be able to offer help and support in your outreach, STEM, or accessibility efforts. Finally, my work is largely through curated threads on Twitter, which raise awareness for disability issues, highlight the work of other disabled scientists, and educate the public on issues related to accessibility. Your support provides more opportunities for me to expand this work to other mediums including live-streams, hackathons, full-length articles, and tools for educators to create more accessible classrooms.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs part of my work with accessibility, I review media (video games, movies, TV shows) and offer an accessibility-focused perspective. Generally, I produce this content when a pitch is successfully accepted by an editor. Your support will mean you get access to my work without having to wait on the tedious publishing process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eIf you\u0027d like to take a look at my past writing, interviews with press, outreach efforts, and speaking events, check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://enceladosaur.us/engagement/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e. This should give you a good idea of the kinds of projects I am hoping to fund with your contributions. Because I am committed to underserved communities, I provide my outreach programs, school presentations, and teacher assistance for free. Your contributions help me keep these critical resources available to the people that need them most!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I also have a puppy named Hubble, and I\u0027ve made some silly additions to the rewards for supporting me that include participating in his various adventures and antics.
