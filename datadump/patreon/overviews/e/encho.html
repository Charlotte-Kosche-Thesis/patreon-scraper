    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Encho Chagas and I am trying to make a living by creating games. Not only creating games, but also researching and experiencing different approaches to it, and this Patreon will help me keep going on. I believe I need to tell you what we are doing here before asking you to buy something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe it is easier done than said.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou probably know the annual game design competition Game Chef. I am the first brazilian to win it with the game PULSE, World Champion of Game Chef 2013. Yeah, I am from Brazil and here we\u0027re on our best moment in game creativity and discussion. We already do a lot as a game design community, but I want to take it another step forward. I want to break our country boundaries, show the world what we\u0027ve been doing here.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you pay for?\u003c/strong\u003e (What\u0027s inside?)\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u0027The Analog XP\u0027 is an online magazine with content about brazilian independent publishing and design discussion, with interviews, reviews and articles about what\u0027s being created. My goal is to create an opening to our games outside our country.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to publish a FULL GAME on each Analog XP issue, but that really took a LOT of work. Patreon is a really amazing tool and I\u0027m experimenting it to its fullest. It\u0027s not only to fund independent game design, but also to raise a profound discussion on WHY we create games. Perhaps you already know how hard it is to fund something like an online magazine, create quality content and keeping it alive so you\u0027ll be able to understand the effort put in it. Maybe you also want to share what you have to say and I really want to hear it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what can we give you that you don\u0027t already have?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m from Brazil and I was raised playing a LOT of games like RPGs, boardgames, cards and video-games. Not only for the fun part but I always wanted to create something out of it, share some of my ideas of how each experience could be even better. I have this thing for creating experiences... art. Yeah, I do believe gaming is a form of art. A complex one that deserves more attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe already have forums, social media groups, newsletters, youtube hangouts... we already discuss on how to make games, but we rarely gather this knowledge. Here in Brazil things are getting crazy, but people don\u0027t know what we\u0027re doing. But even here it\u0027s almost impossible for a newcomer to keep track with what we\u0027re discussing. Even among experienced creators, we don\u0027t usually share all of our experiences. Well, now I\u0027m sharing mine and I\u0027ll try to give you a way to share yours giving visibility to it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy The Analog XP?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHey, people love to get xp. That\u0027s the only way we used to raise our character\u0027s level. I am sharing my work with you but what I really want is to share knowledge. Everyone has something to learn and to teach. I\u0027ll try to make that happen and give anyone anywhere a chance to learn and to do it. It\u0027s not just about creating and playing games. It\u0027s about life experience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t even know if this will really work, but that\u0027s what we do: We try. We experiment. We XP.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/101405890404155075880\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoogle+\u003c/a\u003e"
