    "summary": "My name is Emma, and I live in the Brecon Beacons and Black Mountains of Wales, from where I\ndraw much of my inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a qualified tutor and artist, I love to teach as well as create, and I run many workshops and courses. I have also had experience of curating exhibitions and arts and crafts events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim, with this project, is to continue running my creative, therapeutic \u0026amp; educational workshops, but expand their reach and their benefits, by taking them to those who are \u0027hard to reach\u0027 and/or have few opportunities or additional needs...\u003cbr\u003eA community project - to give opportunities to those who slip through the net -  to encourage sustainable use of resources -... to ensure traditional skills are not forgotten - and to have FUN! \u003cbr\u003eIn addition, we will be working towards an exhibition and presentation of the art and crafts created by the participants. This exhibition will not only showcase their creativity, but work towards developing their confidence, their skills and their sense of achievement.\u003cbr\u003eBy donating here, you can help launch this project, travel with us on our adventure, and help sustain it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project would benefit many children and adults that are traditionally \u0027hard to reach\u0027 or engage with. I have seen first hand the wonderful transformation that takes place during the informal workshops. Participants gain confidence, amaze themselves with what they CAN do, and everyone learns whilst having fun. One woman from MIND told me how soothing she found the sessions. A child whose teachers described him as \u0027wild\u0027 sat and worked on his design for 4 hours, enthralled and absorbed. \u003cbr\u003e As well as my experience as an artist, I am also a qualified tutor, and have worked with all ages and abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a member of the following: Heritage Crafts Association; International Feltmakers Association; Campaign\nfor Wool; The Big Skill, and the Brecon Women\u0027s Festival. \u003cbr\u003e\nI run regular workshops throughout Powys, Monmouthshire and Herefordshire, as well as further afield.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHow did my art classes begin?\u003cbr\u003eWhen I became a single parent, I left some of the creative parts of my life behind and focused on working hard for a local charity and college - but not long afterwards I was diagnosed with cancer, and during my treatments I rediscovered my artistic roots, and was introduced to the wonderful processes of felt-making.\u003cbr\u003eMy heart and soul are poured into my daughters\u0027 lives and my art, both of which provide me with a clear vision for the future - teaching and facilitating others\u0027 own healing and creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can you help?\u003cbr\u003eYour support would enable me to support the \u0027Workshop Wagon\u0027... the mobile workshops travelling around to the groups identified as those who would benefit from the sessions.\u003cbr\u003eYou can also visit my website to see examples of my work and some of the workshops - \u003ca href=\"http://www.ffolkyffelt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.ffolkyffelt.com\u003c/a\u003e - Thank You for your support!\u003cbr\u003e*NB: If you wish to make a one-time payment, you can set up a pledge, then cancel it after your first payment :-) The Patreon team have advised that is the best way to do things.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Love and Blessings to you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
