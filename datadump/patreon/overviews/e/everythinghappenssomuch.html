I\u0027ve written and edited for a hefty handful of newspapers, but my real passion is writing fiction (and the occasional limerick).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in Albany, New York with my all-supporting husband, two wildly-energetic Labradors and a grumpy, old cat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been toying with the idea of writing a book for awhile, but now it\u0027s time for that dream to come to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bQbgd46.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy debut novel titled \"Everything Happens So Much\" follows\u00a0a couple of 20-somethings and the pitfalls of falling in like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes people are no good for each other. Sometimes it works out anyway, at least for awhile. Other times, friendships unwittingly blossom into something more -- even if all the forces of nature are against it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you want to join protagonist Bea (a spunky reporter with a real talent for laughing at herself) and her confusing\u00a0adventures involving first date kisses, binge drinking, making and maintaining friendships, moving back home and open mic nights, consider becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E2hldTK.jpg\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a creator \u2014 me or anyone you find interesting and good at what they do \u2014 writes something that makes you feel something, or if you think their work is worthwhile and makes your life better, gifting them the equivalent of a cup of coffee/pint of vegan ice cream/half a burrito each month really, truly makes a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is also one of the most direct ways I can receive feedback from readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a special thank you to those who join me (and Bea) on this journey, I\u0027d like to offer you access to some exclusive content (including drafts of each chapter!) released just for you on Patreon,\u00a0as well as discussions about the making of the book and the creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so many ideas for this book constantly zooming through my head and tons of drafts and notes cluttering my computer. I can\u0027t wait to make something real and tangible and exciting. Let\u0027s do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
