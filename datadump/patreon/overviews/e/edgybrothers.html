And even though Dave ended up in Austin and I moved to Los Angeles, we continued collaborating, using whatever online technology was available.\u00a0And after running a few succesful Kickstarter campaigns designing playing cards, t-shirts, and other merchandise, we\u0027ve zeroed in on our original passion: creating animated content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat Do We Do?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, we\u0027ve created Edgy Brothers Presents - animated comedy with a little edge. Luckily,\u00a0technology has caught up with our imaginations, and what Dave and I can achieve with sound recording and animation now is far beyond our early days. But it\u0027s still an exhaustive process and we need support to make our ideas happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Creators have launched digital content on sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, they mainly focus on pilots or series of episodes. We, on the other hand, make snackable content: short clips of one to two minutes that you can share with friends. And though Youtube is great for building an audience and monetizing, their content standards and ad rates limit what we can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eEnter Patreon - and You\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut where there\u0027s a will - and good wifi reception - there\u0027s a way! With your simple donation you can help us produce our ideas without worrying about restrictions. And the more you donate, the more we can share with you in the form of extras like pdf\u0027s of scripts, rough footage of the production process, and more. And if all you can spare is a meager $1 (a downpayment on a latte) it\u0027s still an enormous help in sending what\u0027s in our addled brains out into the ether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith enough support, we hope to produce two brand new episodes each month in addition to the bonus content. We also want to produce animation and voice acting tutorials to share what we\u0027ve learned in our collective forty-plus years of industry experience. If whatever we can pass along helps other Creators just starting out, we\u0027ll be happy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, we want Edgy Brothers Presents to be a repository for entertaining, animated content. Or at least something that distracts you from doing real work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
