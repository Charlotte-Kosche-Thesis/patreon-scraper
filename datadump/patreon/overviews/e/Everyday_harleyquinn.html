    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my patreon friends!!!! Thanks so much\nfor taking the time to stop by! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Madisson, but you probably know me better as\neveryday_harleyquinn! I am a cosplayer, prop maker and all-around creator! Here\non patreon I will be sharing behind the scenes stuff from my cosplay creations, as well as other fun content I think you all would enjoy seeing!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI would be honored if you would become one of my patrons\nand join me along my cosplay journey! *Spoiler Alert* it\u2019s going to be a weird\nride! But who am I kidding if you follow me on Instagram you already know what\na weirdo I am!!!! lolz lolz lolz\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will we be working towards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCOSPLAY MY FRIENDS! ALL THE COSPLAYS! Well, okay, maybe not all of them but a lot of them!!!! I have a list a mile long of cosplays I would like to do but I can\u2019t get to them without your help! Because you care enough about me and my cosplay to subscribe to my patreon, I feel as though you have more invested in me than the rest of my following. Because of that, I trust you more! I want to go to you guys for your thoughts and opinions on cons, cosplays and everything else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of cons\u2026. We will also be working towards more cons, which means I get to meet more of you!!!! I\u2019m in Ohio which isn\u2019t exactly con capital of the world, but I would love to be able to travel further and eventually make it out to some west coast cons, as well as other large cons throughout the country!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you expect from me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore of me!!!! hahaha Can you handle even more me?! I mean this is pretty much every sense of the word! All upper tiers will get access to my feed which will have behind the scenes pics, WIP shots, and first looks at my new cosplays! I also plan to do polls for you guys to help me decide what I should cosplay as next! Higher tiers will have access to boudoir pics and selfies (no nudes sorry boutcha) that are exclusive only to you through this patreon! \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI also want to know more about those of you who care enough to support me! I tried to think of some fun interactive things you all might like as rewards! I of course want you to let me know your Instagram info so I can give you a follow back and check out more about you! Some tiers will get access to chats where we can talk about cosplay, tv shows, nerd culture, or anything else (appropriate) that you want! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all of this sounds like something you could get into I would love to have you! I look forward to all the things we will be able to accomplish together!!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImportant Note! I am currently only charging my patrons every other month (based on my charging cycle not when you sign up)! This gives me extra time to make sure all fansigns, photo shoots, and rewards are up to a standard that I am proud to send out! If my Patreon account says it is paused don\u0027t worry I am still active! It just means it is a month when patrons aren\u0027t charged :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
