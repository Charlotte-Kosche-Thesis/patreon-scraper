    "summary": "Hello! :::)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Bobby. I\u0027ve been making experimental electronic music for the past 15 years.\u00a0 I\u0027ve put out something like 20 albums and EPs under the name Erothyme since 2009. I\u0027ve toured across the US and just slightly beyond (Canada and Panama) for the past 7 years. I make many styles of music, from gentle and serene cinematic downtempo all the way to twisted, heavy, fast glitch music, and all kinds of things in between. I often work solo, and I also collaborate with a number of other artists.\u00a0I\u0027ve spent most of my life focusing on this path and I haven\u0027t looked back - it\u0027s definitely what I am good at, what I love to do, and probably my best shot at positively impacting this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomehow in the process of focusing my whole life on making the best music I possibly can, I must have missed a memo or two on the subject of making a living doing it, because even though I am working hard on more projects than I can count all the time, I still have been struggling to make ends meet. I often wonder if this will get in the way of my chances of reaching my full potential as an artist and as a source of inspiration for those who enjoy my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMuch like many other artists, I\u0027m here on Patreon in the hopes that, with a little bit of regular support, I\u0027ll be able to focus more of my energy on continuing to make my highest possible offering to the music world, and less on simply trying to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every act of support, I am grateful, and committed to showing my gratitude through the work that I pour my heart into every day!\u003cbr\u003e"
