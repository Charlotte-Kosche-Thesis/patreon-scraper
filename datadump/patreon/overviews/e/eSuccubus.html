The first project would be a collection of randomized audio clips plugged into a click/text interface game where people make choices on what kind of session they want, what they like, etc. and it will spit out a randomized playlist with decision points. Simple to make, expansible, modular, and if I save the engine that serves the mp3s I can use it to make a whole line of games by just plugging in new text/decisions/mp3s. I\u0027ll focus on developing that and publishing some demos once I hit this level. It won\u0027t be too fancy graphically, but you don\u0027t need that if your eyes are closed and you are listening. After that, I\u0027ll launch into the creation of tools for couples and dominants.",
