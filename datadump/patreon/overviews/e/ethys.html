    "summary": "Friends and Comrades!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2015 I began pouring every hour I could spare into creating videos predominantly exploring the rich lore of Final Fantasy XIV and quickly developed a passion for this project unlike that which has seized me for any other endeavor. I threw myself into it in the hopes of making it a viable full-time livelihood and for a time things progressed quite well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince recent changes in YouTube\u0027s policies and algorithms however many channels have experienced a consistent mass-demonetization of content, leading many of us to the unfortunate conclusion that we simply cannot afford to take the time away from our paid work to keep producing the content that we love to provide to our viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have spent several months focusing my efforts towards my work on Twitch that fortunately \u003cem\u003ecan \u003c/em\u003ehelp pay the bills and hoping that YouTube will resolve what has become a crippling problem for so many channels internally, but after consideration and consultation I have decided to place confidence in my wonderful viewers that have been so pining for a return to consistent YouTube content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubsequently I have calculated that if we can reach a consistent $500/month here on Patreon, I will be able to take sufficient time away from other work to regularly produce a quality FFXIV lore video on YouTube every week. The keyword here is \u003cem\u003equality\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0- this will allow me to work without rushing and without compromise.\u00a0I know that this is the kind of schedule that many subscribers would like to see us return to and I believe that giving you the power to make it happen is the best way for us to move forward!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery Patron that makes a contribution of at least $5/month will be credited in every video and once the goal is reached we can start implementing regular rewards for premium Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all to everyone already contributing from the bottom of my heart and I hope that together we can keep the channel healthy for many years ahead!"
