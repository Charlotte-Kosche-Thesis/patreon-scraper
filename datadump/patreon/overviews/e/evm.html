As a side note, my grandmother on my father\u0027s side happens to be part Indonesian. I didn\u0027t think much of this until my girlfriend said \u0027you have to mention this because it makes you sound exotic\u0027, to which I responded 1): I\u0027m not sure how much that matters, and 2), if it makes me exotic, I know plenty of people more exotic than I am.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what was cool about my childhood and teenage years was going to school in a setting with 50+ nationalities in the classroom...that was unique in a sense. That and traveling to new cities and countries on sports teams and with my music ensemble for festivals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my most important memories was when I was 14, only a few months after 9/11, I\u0027m at a birthday party in one of these party rooms at a movie theater...Osama Bin Laden comes on the television, and some of the friends of the person who invited me laughed and cheered. They \u003cem\u003echeered\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still think about that often. The power of ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to ask myself, \u0027What ideas have me?\u0027 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best way to live, I think, is to encounter opposition to one\u0027s held idea, and allow the opposition to chip away or change one\u0027s model. At minimum I can come away with a sharpened and more sophisticated version of the model. My dad taught me this, and we have better and better conversations and debates as I accrue more knowledge, life experience, and dare I say, \u003cstrong\u003ewisdom\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing young, mostly, I think, having been activated by being read \u003cem\u003eto\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0by Mom and Dad and by doing my own reading, then wanting to emulate the science fiction and fantasy stories I was reading by writing my own stories. Tolkien, Le Guin, Asimov, Heinlein. You get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a liberal arts education where I studied behavioral economics, political science, Chinese, and creative writing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked 4.5 years in inventory management and then software project management at Target. (I also placed 9th out of 75 in the 2014 USA Memory Championship in Speed Cards and designed a card game app for the iPhone.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, on my 27th birthday, 9/11/2014, I struck out on my own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started by writing two novels back to back. The first was about millennials making their way as intrapreneurs in a corporate setting. The second is the science fiction novel I just had critiqued by Max Gladstone (\u003cem\u003eCraft Sequence\u003c/em\u003e) and Beth Meacham (editor of \u003cem\u003eEnder\u0027s Game\u003c/em\u003e). That was a few months back, and I\u0027m closing in on going to agents with the novel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter putting the first novel aside, I wrote a lot of freelance articles on various marketplaces online, ranging from the future of soccer to the future of work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn early 2016 I wrote an article for the friend of who would become my main client as of now. Our relationship began by me writing a 20-page essay comparing his book at the time and his competitor\u0027s work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, he brought me on as writer, I\u0027ve edited the second edition of that very same book, and I\u0027m the editor in chief for his main consumer site and the lead writer for the client side of his business. He also runs a gamified education community, and I run that, too. There\u0027s some great people in that community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome things in the hopper lately include my contributions to Bound and possibilities as a writer for a business-book-to-fable writing gig.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also wrote a double-book review about Russia for a magazine in New York.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoyed writing that essay so much that I wrote a few more. Then Medium featured one of my essays\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@decision_/all-of-life-is-a-wager-768f04b94c1f\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon being a super forecaster\u003c/a\u003e, and I decided it would be fun and useful to others to write more and share the output of my reading and writing adventures with you. Reports from the field!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThing is, I consider myself a professional reader and a writer. This isn\u0027t supposed to sound fancy. You are a professional whatever-it-is-you-do, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you don\u0027t have the time to go all-in on digesting ideas, playing with them, challenging them, clashing models against the edges of the universe\u0027s laws and seeing what comes out in the writing process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s what I\u0027m offering you, right here.
