We are here to help you discover the highest version of yourself and the greatest health possible by providing you a \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eproven road map and support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to cut through the confusion and discover the life of glowing vitality you\u0027ve known is possible and always desired. Your time is NOW!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of 5 years I have reached over 2 million people through YouTube and have privately helped literary hundreds of people to achieve the same results, which are predictable and replicable; healthy clear skin once and for all. \u00a0Despite the countless testimonials, case studies, and success stories I am constantly amazed and in awe of how powerfully effective this approach is. \u00a0I am humbled every time a client or longtime subscriber tells me that because of this content they no longer have to be embarrassed to go out in public because of their skin but they\u0027re now actually confident in their body, or that they can exercise without dealing with relentlessly painful itching, or that in healing their digestive troubles not only did their skin clear up but they feel better than they have in years. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is that I have also been equally and immensely blessed by this community and the incredible medium of YouTube that has made it all possible. \u00a0It is an honor to be entrusted with guiding someone that is in need through their recovery and it\u0027s not something I take lightly. \u00a0Up to this point, my channel, all my videos and social media content have been both fully self-generated and \u003cem\u003efree\u003c/em\u003e because this message is needed by so many people and I\u0027m so passionate about sharing it. \u00a0I have sustained this by myself, flying solo for quite a long stretch and although it has been extremely rewarding, the time has come that I must ask for \u003cem\u003eYour help\u003c/em\u003e! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY IS HELP NEEDED?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom its humble beginnings, the days of 40-Day Activation and Holistic Health Activation have been a wonderfully fruitful and nourishing time period as well as labor of love for me. \u00a0Just as the growth of the YouTube channel and the ever-expanding community has become quite evident, I acknowledge that I too have grown as I have continued deeper into my own healing. \u00a0This has brought me to a place of immense gratitude for what is and what has come to pass, as well as brought on a new wave of visions and opportunities for the future expansion of this content. \u00a0This includes the creation of \u0027Eat-Move-Cleanse\u0027, my new collaborative venture with Garrett Kiger, a close friend of mine who also has an incredible transformation story, so that this work can continue to evolve to new heights and reach more and more people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this fresh new growth spurt and as the Holistic Health Activation era comes to a natural close, the exciting new beginnings of Eat-Move-Cleanse have started to unfold. \u00a0As it clearly expresses in the name, very little has changed about the components or processes of this teaching and lifestyle that many of you are now familiar with. \u00a0Nature\u0027s laws haven\u0027t changed so all of that of course remains the same! \u00a0However, in effort to continue spreading this help to as many people as possible, we have started work on several new projects, that reflect both my personal growth as well as that of the YouTube channel and community at large. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where \u003cem\u003eYour help \u003c/em\u003ecomes in and is greatly needed. \u00a0New projects undoubtedly means new expenses. \u00a0When you become a Patron you are contributing toward helping other people that are suffering from unnecessary skin and health conditions in the same way you once did or perhaps still are. \u00a0By joining us on Patreon\u00a0you\u0027re furthering the growth and spread of this message and building this community by personally supporting me and my new team, which enables us to continue creating killer content and amazing new offerings. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE YOUR MONEY GOES AND OUR GOALS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically, your patron dollars will go directly toward expenses associated with several new projects including an awesome new website that will house online video courses to help you take your game to the next level! \u00a0These will provide you to have the depth and detail of training that\u0027s equal to working with me privately, only at a more affordable cost and slightly different format. \u00a0In addition to the new website, the time and resources going into the training videos themselves is another way that your support as a patron is greatly needed and tremendously appreciated. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother new venture that we are extremely pumped about is the offering of more in-person events. Knowing first-hand from my own days of recovery how beneficial workshops, seminars, and community-building retreats are, and after the many client requests over the years, it\u0027s clear that it\u0027s time to make these intensive experiences a foundational part of Eat-Move-Cleanse. \u00a0We are stoked to announce that the first official retreat will be going down later this summer in Boulder, CO! \u00a0This retreat is for anyone that is ready and \u003cem\u003ecommitted \u003c/em\u003eto take their recovery, health, fitness, and self-discovery to the next level. \u00a0We will be teaching hands-on and up close and personal the nuanced details and how to\u0027s of this lifestyle as well as providing the group coaching and guidance necessary to help you be successful and achieve results faster. \u00a0You\u0027ll be eating amazing food, learning more about cleansing, doing yoga, going on lots of outdoor adventures, and most importantly hanging out with and learning alongside like-minded people in one of the most beautiful places in the world. \u00a0Plus there will be a ton of time for Q and A. \u00a0Although these retreats will be a tremendously rejuvenating experience they will also call you out of your comfort zone where true transformation and health breakthroughs are made possible. \u00a0 Your monthly support on Patreon will not only help these retreats happen but allow them to happen multiple times throughout the year so that you have numerous chances to make it to one or many of these events. \u00a0They will undoubtedly be amazing and transformative experiences. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions and support to us as Patrons will enable us to create even more valuable, more entertaining, and higher quality content as we show you how to make this lifestyle work for you and as we travel to some amazing places in the coming months and years. \u00a0We plan to interview and collaborate with some of the greatest thought leaders and experts in the fields of health, detoxification, terrain modification, lifestyle design, and motivation. \u00a0On our travels we will take you along as we document our journey and experiences as we ourselves learn from these great minds and personalities from the health, vitalistic, and vegan space on YouTube. \u00a0These series will undoubtedly contain golden nuggets of information and wisdom to help you break free from suffering with your skin. \u00a0We\u0027ll explore more advanced topics, therapies, and deeper teachings to dive deeper into not only the realms of \u003cstrong\u003eskin recovery \u003c/strong\u003ebut also\u003cstrong\u003e self-mastery and health freedom\u003c/strong\u003e, which are at the core of WHY we all want to \u0027achieve\u0027 health, wellbeing, and vibrant longevity in the first place!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, our vision of creating a thriving permaculture farm and sustainable living community is well underway. \u00a0Your pledges will support us in bringing this vision into reality. \u00a0We hope you\u0027ll stand with us in support of this mission and plan to come experience it with us by coming to one of our cleansing retreats or weekend intensives. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOUR AWESOME REWARDS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an Eat-Move-Cleanse patron will give you higher interaction priority as we release new content.
