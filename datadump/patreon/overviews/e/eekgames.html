    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHouse Party\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHouse Party, in its concept and sense of humor, is a throwback to the adventure style games of the 80s and 90s like Leisure Suit Larry and Monkey Island, but it is rendered in a beautiful full-3D first-person context.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou start the game walking in the door of a House Party already in progress, and your goal is to try to play out to a variety of endings by completing various puzzles and smooth-talking. The game is unique in the sense that your actions dictate the gameplay and story direction heavily. Making certain choices in the game can either cut off or open up more options. You are faced with moral choices that yield different outcomes that drive the way the story unfolds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the game, you\u0027ll experience the usual debauchery found at these types of parties in the form of foul language, party games, nudity, fighting, sex, and more, and believe me, it doesn\u0027t pull any punches! Each character has their own personality, story and quests for the player. You can enjoy this alongside full immersive 3D gameplay, gorgeous models, and a very sarcastic and dry sense of humor. The AI is very robust, and the characters respond to a large number of stimuli and player choices. There are multiple story-paths and different outcomes based on your decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories are customizable, and Eek! Games offers tools on their website to craft your own story including full dialogues, interactions, and logic dictating how the player\u0027s night goes and import it into your game. Users are already creating and sharing stories on the game\u0027s forum, and we are excited to see what the player community creates next!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is still in beta, and there are still some placeholder graphics in place in the demo video you see. We are wanting to offer free early access. The game in its current state has plenty of game play available and comes with full immersive stories with the option to download new stories from the forum. As the game goes further into development, more official stories and forked story-lines will be worked on, and more content will be added to the game in the sense of what is available for the characters to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find more information about the game here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://games.eekllc.com/\"\u003ehttp://games.eekllc.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some screen shots of actual game play:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://games.eekllc.com/Images/madison.png\" style=\"width: 853px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://games.eekllc.com/Images/booze.png\" style=\"width: 853px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://games.eekllc.com/Images/promoscreens/BeerPong.png\" style=\"width: 854px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://games.eekllc.com/Images/promoscreens/Brittney.png\" style=\"width: 853px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://games.eekllc.com/Images/promoscreens/Fight.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://games.eekllc.com/Images/promoscreens/Ashley.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCustom Story Creator\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also just released a Custom Story Creator for House Party that you can use to create and share your own custom stories for the game. \u00a0You can check it out here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://games.eekllc.com/index.php/house-party-custom-story-submission-instructions/\"\u003ehttp://games.eekllc.com/index.php/house-party-custom-story-submission-instructions/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem Requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWindows 7+\u003cbr\u003eGraphics card: DX9 (shader model 3.0) capabilities; generally everything made since 2005 should work.\u003cbr\u003eCPU: SSE2 instruction set support."
