Your monthly donation will create a massive ripple effect by affording us more time to dedicate to empowering sustainable leaders. We appreciate every dollar, every smile, and every word of encouragement. We have learned to live with very little over the years and that makes life SO sweet. Thank you for allowing us to continue our service work to provide aspiring leaders the tools, empowerment and education they need to create MASSIVE change in the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are dedicated to uplifting, empowering and supporting fellow changemakers in making a big impact in the world while living a balanced and holistic lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough our our service-oriented travels to experience many cultures and beyond-sustainable land projects we had the honor of learning from respected teachers, business owners, healers, artists, mentors and revolutionaries from all over the world. We have experienced a profound re-patterning that occurred when we separated ourselves from mainstream society for an extended period of time, all while falling in love. Not the romeo and juliet kind, the raw and messy way where we mirrored each other\u2019s shadows and tested each other\u2019s wits and level of commitment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than five years later, we have built two companies,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.numundo.org\"\u003eNuMundo\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.earthjourneys.org\"\u003eEarth Journeys\u003c/a\u003e while supporting the development of several eco-communities including Emerald Village, PioPio, East End Eden and Laughing Oaks Village. We\u2019ll be honest, this would not have been possible without a level of privilege but also without a level of sacrifice of comfort. Emerging from being financially deficient and burnt out, we have finally found a balance. Seeking centeredness in literally all aspects of life, the modern changemaker must be highly adaptable in the unique times that we are living in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlthough we continue to live a low-income, high positive-impact lifestyle, we don\u0027t let that stop us from creating valuable educational experiences and content for changemakers.
