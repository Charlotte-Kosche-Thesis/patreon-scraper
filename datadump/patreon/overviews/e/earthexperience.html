    "summary": "Hi, it\u0027s Jan. Recently I found myself joining together two of my greatest passions. \u003cstrong\u003eSound \u003c/strong\u003eand\u003cstrong\u003e outdoor exploration\u003c/strong\u003e. It is a way through which I feel I can give something back to the world. In \u003cstrong\u003eNovember 2017\u003c/strong\u003e I did my first long journey collecting sounds \u003cstrong\u003etraveling 4 months\u003c/strong\u003e through \u003cstrong\u003eAsia\u003c/strong\u003e\n with audio recording equipment, camera and camping gear all in my backpack.\n Dedicating all the time, energy and money for that cause. \u003cstrong\u003eThe mission was \u003c/strong\u003e(and still is) to visit remote corners of jungles, national parks and rural areas \u003cstrong\u003erecording dissapering\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ewildlife \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003etribes\u003c/strong\u003e still surviving there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudio/video \u003c/strong\u003erecordings will be published here, on Youtube and eventually I want to make an \u003cstrong\u003eaudio CD photobook\u003c/strong\u003e compilation(s). I also intend to write and report about the environmental destruction caused by human\n as well as other interesting discoveries that I will come across. \nCurrently, this ambitious yet challenging journey is starting in \u003cstrong\u003eVietnam\u003c/strong\u003e and continuing to the rest of \u003cstrong\u003eSouth East Asia\u003c/strong\u003e. Eventually, I would like to \u003cstrong\u003ereach Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea\u003c/strong\u003e but that depends on the available funds. Until this point all is \u003cstrong\u003enon-profit\u003c/strong\u003e and all gear, travel costs are \u003cstrong\u003eself-supported\u003c/strong\u003e with a vision to explore wildest corners of our planet and \u003cstrong\u003epresent it in audio \u003c/strong\u003e(binaural, stereo sound),\u003cstrong\u003e photography \u003c/strong\u003eand\u003cstrong\u003e film recordings \u003c/strong\u003efor sharing awareness of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003epreservation \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eof the natural world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, I will also help as a \u003cstrong\u003evolunteer\u003c/strong\u003e with wildlife rescue and eco projects. That will provide with a good base(s) to \u003cstrong\u003eexplore surrounding wilderness\u003c/strong\u003e, learn about the area and work on recordings.\u003cstrong\u003e You\u003c/strong\u003e the supporter \u003cstrong\u003ewill have a big impact\u003c/strong\u003e on many aspects of this journey such as suggesting which areas to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY GIVE SUPPORT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.

I could describe myself as an explorer, truth seeker,\n adrenaline freak, but also down to earth person... Curiosity and \ncreativity have always lead me doing many different things in life and \nwhile searching, learning deeper meanings of it, everything has upgraded\n and transformed into something else. I was always tending to be \nambitious with many interests always keen to improve or learn something \nnew. I have Love and interest for nature, all living beings, outdoor \nactivities, permaculture, alternative medicine, science, music, natural \nbuilding, recycling, craftsmanship or just about everything that is \nexciting, with good cause or can contribute to a better world. Apart from this, living towards an ecological, alternative ways of life,\n eco, raw and healthy food. Wanting to help animals, people and \nenvironment is one of my top guiding inspiration, so its other similar \nhelpful actions.\u003cbr\u003e",
