    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eCreating Music To Promote Holistic Therapies\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nElliphen\nis the vision of Joanne and Mark, two people passionate about\nspreading the awareness and practicing of Holistic Therapies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoanne\nis a qualified practitioner for Therapeutic Body Massage, Deep Tissue\nMassage,  Indian Head Massage, Acupressure, Ear Candling, Natural\nFace Lift Massage, Face Hands and Feet Massage as well as being a\nReiki Master.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMark is\na musician with many years of playing a multitude of instruments both\nlive on stage and in the studio.  Marks recent works have been\nwritten specifically for use during Therapeutic Treatments.  It was\nthe benefits of receiving treatments which became the inspiration for\nthe music to take the ambient route.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\nare many centres, overwhelmingly charitable organisations staffed\nmainly by volunteers, who do fantastic work with vulnerable adults. \nMany therapists, including Joanne, volunteer from time to time giving\nappropriate therapies to some of these centres clients.  However, the\nvery nature of volunteering means therapists come and go, after all\neveryone has to make a living.  This results in a loss of continuity\nand often worse, the centres are left with no therapist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\nintention of The Elliphen Project is to raise money through music\nsales and patronage.  This money will help to support Joanne and Mark\nbe in a position to offer therapies to interested organisations free\nof charge.  For the centres this will mean they have access to a\ntherapist on a regular and continual basis with The Elliphen Project\ncovering the payment for the therapists time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf\ncourse none of this is possible without Elliphen supporters. You can\nbecome a patron from as little as $1 a month and receive free music\nas a thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\nGuy Fawkes mask?  The mask is to demonstrate the duality that exists\nnot just within those involved with Elliphen but in all of us.  We\nall want the World to be full of love but at the same time we battle\nsimply to exist.  Some of us deal better with the battle than others\nand it is with the casualties that we work.  Your patronage helps us\nto help those who need a little bit of assistance before returning to\nthe battlefield and we thank you, they thank you, from the bottom of\nour hearts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe\nMusic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMusic\nis everywhere.  Everyone loves music of at least one genre and often\nmore than just one.  Mankind has music for everything.  We have music\nfor when we\u0027re happy, music for when we\u0027re sad, music for special\noccasions, music for rituals, music for going to war and then there\nis the music of peace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\nmay not be able to initiate World Peace yet but we can find inner\npeace, at least for ourselves from time to time.  The aim with the\nmusic is to help everyone who listens to relax, to chill out, perhaps\nto meditate, to have played whilst receiving a therapy or maybe used\nas soothing background music at home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will receive access to one free song every month, which will only be available for that month.\u00a0 At the end of the year those 12 songs will be complimented by the addition of 6 others, a total of 18 songs, which will make up a new full album.\u00a0 This full album will be available to buy or for tier 2 and 3 patrons it will be available as a free download.\u00a0 A second album will be released in the middle of the year and will be available to buy or for tier 3 patrons it will also be available as a free download.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor\nsome Elliphen is all about the music, for others it is all about the\ntherapies.  In truth it is all about both. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe\nTherapies\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\nis our belief that everyone should have the choice of whether or not\nto enjoy the benefits of any alternative therapy which may have a\npositive effect on their lives, regardless of income.  Unfortunately\nat the moment this is not the case.  Modern medicine, which does have\nits place, on the whole dismisses the benefits of alternative\ntherapies despite thousands upon thousands of positive responses\nreported from recipients and practitioners.  The vast majority of\nmainstream medical practitioners, choose instead to continue\nprescribing ever more expensive pharmaceutical drugs.  For someone\nwith little money to spare, the informed choice of an alternative\ntreatment is taken away.  We want to give the choice back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\nhave a goal to create a stream of money by music sales, patronage and\nother means to enable the therapists involved in this project to\noffer therapies free of charge to some of the most, temporarily,\nvulnerable people.  Supporting Elliphen by patronage or by simply\npaying for the music, supports the therapists and musicians who in\nturn support those who need it most.  By being one of our patrons you\nare undoubtably directly helping to offer a valuable service to those\npeople who otherwise could not afford to consider the choice. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow\nit works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere\nare many, mostly charitable, organisations which work with people who\nare for one reason or another experiencing a difficult period in\ntheir lives.  These organisations rely solely on donations, grants\nand so on for their continued financing and therefore have to be\nextremely careful with what little money they do have.  The majority\nof their funds are being spent on basic running costs which means\nthey have to rely heavily on volunteers to do the actual work.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\nvast majority of these organisations are very open to including\nalternative holistic therapies as something positive they can offer\ntheir clients, due to the real results they have witnessed from\nvolunteer therapists sessions.  Volunteers however, so very much\nappreciated as they are, come and go.  After all they need to make a\nliving too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElliphen\nis proposing to offer therapists and their services to these\norganisations at no charge.  We hope to do this using money raised\nfrom music sales and especially you, our patrons, who are supporting\nnot only the musicians but also helping to pay the therapists for their time. \nThis means that therapists can offer their services on a regular\nbasis, maintaining the important continuity with the clients they are\nworking with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\nonly work with qualified, certified, insured therapists thereby\nensuring the quality of the service from the initial client\nconsultation right through to the actual treatments themselves.  We\nare based in Glasgow, Scotland and this is the geographical area\nwhich we currently work within.  However the vision is there to take\nthis blueprint Worldwide and we are actively seeking qualified\ntherapists elsewhere with a view to financing their voluntary work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\ntreatments on offer will be dependant on the experience of the\ntherapist offering their services.  Some therapists may have a\nmultitude of therapies to offer, others may be just starting out with\none or two.  If it is determined that a specific therapy would be of\nbenefit to a particular client then we will ensure an appropriate\ntherapist is made available.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProgress\nReport\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs\na patron we know you are pledging your hard earned money to us and in\nreturn we want to share with you the results of our work.  Sharing\nthe music is our tangible way of saying thank you and it is something\nwhich you can see happening for yourself.  The amount of music and\nthe frequency you receive it at is dependant on the reward level you\nchoose.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo\nlog the progress of the therapies we use our Therapy Record.  A\nresponsible representative of each organisation whose clients have\nreceived a therapy shall on completion of each treatment sign our\nTherapy Record and at the end of each month, sign the completed\nTherapy Record.  This shows the organisations name and contact\ndetails, the date and time of each therapy and what therapy was\nperformed.  This Therapy Record along with any feedback received from\nthe clients themselves will then be shared monthly on Patreon where\nyou will be able to see how your contribution is helping.\u003cbr\u003e"
