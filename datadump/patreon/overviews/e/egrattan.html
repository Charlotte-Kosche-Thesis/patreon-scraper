    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is \u003ca href=\"http://elizabethgrattan.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eElizabeth Grattan\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027ve been writing since first learning the letters of the alphabet. My first book titled \"The Frog With No Tongue\" \u003cem\u003e(yes, really\u003c/em\u003e) was written in the second grade and earned me my first trip to The Young Author\u0027s Conference and some accolades from across the country.\u003cem\u003e (I had to wear fancy stuff and everything).\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a big believer that \u003cstrong\u003eorganic viral beats click bait ledes every single time\u003c/strong\u003e. I draw from experience, education and a desire to drive difference in the status quo. \u003cem\u003e(No such thing as \"both sides\" people).\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the last twenty five years, \u003ca href=\"http://radioelizabeth.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy day job\u003c/a\u003e has focused on broadcast content/delivery for radio, while also writing prose and essays for print publications and web. \u003cem\u003e(#1 w/ target demo! Woo Hoo!\u003c/em\u003e) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started a Patreon to archive some select older pieces and create new compelling content with \u003cstrong\u003especific community based goals to help others\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cem\u003e(There\u0027s a whole evolutionary reason for this, but I digress...)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work focuses heavily on social justice and my own learning curves as a white woman raising a child (\u003cem\u003ea bit later in life\u003c/em\u003e) - in a world that has never been equal. I strive to cover humanity through an intersectional lens, sometimes with great compassion and other times with little patience - or tolerance. Sometimes I tend to give zero f***s and rant and rage. Expect profanity on occasion. \u003cem\u003e(Who am I kidding, I swear a lot, because it\u0027s language, duh!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also sometimes get more intimate in prose with personal glimpses into the journey shared by myself and my little man, Levi. \u003cem\u003e(He\u0027s, like, the best human ever. Ever.) \u003c/em\u003eI can\u0027t say I\u0027ll cover parenting or family or these tiny humans the way you have seen before. \u003cem\u003e(That\u0027s good)\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have been influenced, impacted or inspired by my writings, I ask and thank you for your membership now.\u003cem\u003e (Humbled)\u003c/em\u003e. And if you haven\u0027t yet gotten to know me, select archives of previously published content are available at just a $1 Reward Level so you can read the pieces other people liked and some even decided should go viral. \u003cem\u003e(Honestly, WTF, how did THAT EVEN happen!!!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have set goals at this time based around the concept of a community. I want to continue writing and have some basic needs I have to personally meet, but what good is lip service? There has to be something more than just getting paid. I believe that is to give what we can away. \u003cem\u003e(Look at those goals, I\u0027m serious).\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI call it \u003cstrong\u003eWords On A Page For Tangible Change.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support of the Arts! And thank you for your trust in my content! \u003cem\u003e(You are amazing for that, seriously!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs they say \"Keep Writing\". That\u0027s exactly what I intend to do! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e:) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElizabeth\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(but you can call me e if you want to)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
