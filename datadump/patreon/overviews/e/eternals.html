I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eEiliya\u003c/strong\u003e, the captain  and mastermind of this little ship. I love thinking up stories and game systems and the rest of my crew - a bunch of merry folk who all excel in their own respective fields - help bring these ideas into reality. You can find more about them at bottom of the page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe focus of Eternals Dev. is currently on 3 projects (\u003cem\u003eI plan to add graphic images representing each project, I just need to figure out how to do that\u003c/em\u003e):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHellscape ~ Scelus Empire, the Realm of Acedia\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a story-driven RPG with turn-based combat in which you take the role as Taranoir, dark prince and the last hope of the fallen kingdom of Hellscape to regain its glory. Your mission is to find a way to free the ancient goddess Tharia, sealed away by the Celestials. Gather followers, gain power, burn kingdoms, conquer cities, break and enslave your enemies, breed armies. What had once fallen can be regained.

Charles spends a year living in Japan, trying to balance life, economy and studies.

We\u0027ve decided to go to Patreon in an attempt to garnish followers and maybe get some financial support for our creations. We plan to mostly make erotic games, but we\u0027ve got a few other surprise projects as well. For now, our main focus will lay on Hellscape ~ Scelus Empire and Just Another Mission, the two erotic games that are closest to completion.",
