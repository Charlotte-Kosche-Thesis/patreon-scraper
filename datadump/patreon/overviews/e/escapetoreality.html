I never imagined this message of love and grace would draw people back from suicide, deliver people from mental illness, or open barren wombs. It never occurred to me that pastors would use my words for sermons or that strangers would translate them into foreign languages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a burning desire to take this thing to the next level. Want to join me? This is where Patreon comes in. Patreon provides an opportunity for us to become partners in the gospel. By signing up to make a monthly contribution, you become a stakeholder in this exciting venture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the generosity of supporters I have already been able to develop new content and distribute it all around the world. I\u2019m passionate about this message and I want as many people to hear it as possible. Perhaps you do to.

If I could outsource that stuff, I\u2019d write more and you\u2019d get more good stuff to read. I\u2019ve got a series on the parables and some kid\u2019s books I\u2019d love to finish.
