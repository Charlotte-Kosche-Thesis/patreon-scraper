Since all previous goals are reached, we now can pay our staff and volunteers, keep this show free and remain a paying gig. Also, we can start paying the growing station bills (things get expensive when you become \"somebody\") and re-occurring subscriptions like our Skype number, server space for all recorded content, and much more! Thanks for making our hobby more like a fun once a week job, that we enjoy and wreck our brains planning all week long!\u003cbr\u003e",
