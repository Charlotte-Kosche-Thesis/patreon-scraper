I\u0027m a deeply devoted geek, as well, for so many things. I believe in representation for all kinds of people, and that everyone deserves to see something of themselves in fictional worlds as well as the worlds around them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is All This?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is my Patreon page. This website is a source of crowd-funding, sort of like Kickstarter. People pledge money to support independent creators in their efforts. Sometimes, this means pledging monthly to help a creator through one big project; for me, it means pledging a little at a time to support individual creations and ongoing endeavors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou pledge whatever amount you feel comfortable with, or according to the reward tiers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen I post new content, you pay that pledge to access it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou may set a monthly limit\u003c/strong\u003e so that even if I go buck-wild posting content, you won\u0027t go over your budget.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my life, I\u0027ve had one consistent dream, through so many other things in flux: To write. My purpose for writing has evolved as I\u0027ve grown up. When I was young I wrote to my own needs and my own amusements only. As I grew, I began to write for an audience, and to an audience, letting the demand create the supply. I progressed and my writing abilities progressed, and now I write for the same reasons I live: For myself, and to show others a picture of a different world, possibly a better one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContent\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe content you\u0027ll see on this Patreon will consist of largely written-word materials. Let\u0027s look at some examples!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProse.\u003c/strong\u003e Writing, chapter-by-chapter publishing of projects or all-at-once release of short stories, will be what you can majorly expect.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResources. \u003c/strong\u003eI love tabletop RPGs and written roleplaying forms, and also hope be releasing some resources for games like Dungeons and Dragons, Fiasco, and writing-based roleplaying.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodcasts. \u003c/strong\u003eSometimes, I\u0027ll release an audio track discussing issues in writing, RPGs, in the creation of fiction as a whole, from perspective of a writer and consumer of these things.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith support from patrons, some of the stress will be relieved of daily living, and elevate the writing I want to do. I hope you choose to support myself, or other small creators like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
