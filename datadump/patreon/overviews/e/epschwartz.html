This is my online community of fantastic supporters who like/love/believe in me and my music and show it by slipping me a few bucks every month... and they are rewarded for doing so.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s like an ongoing Kickstarter/Indie GoGo. Basically you are subscribing to me.\u00a0 By patronizing me and my music, you are helping me make more. For your coin, I will be giving you monthly perks no other fans get.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIS THIS BEGGING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know, this is a tough question. For people who don\u0027t value art and music because it\u0027s seemingly everywhere,\u00a0 (our gas station pumps blast the latest hits for goodness sake) this can probably seem like begging. It\u0027s not. Your silver crosses my palm and provide you with a service. I entertain you. The same goes for street performers. They are using their talent to earn money. They aren\u0027t asking for a hand out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to make music and put it out there for the world regardless. This is simply a way for people to show their support financially.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI basically make money from music in\n three ways: \u003cbr\u003e1) paid performances/cover charge (if applicable) \u003cbr\u003e 2) sale \nof merch - online or at shows\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3) Tips. That\u0027s right, good old \nfashioned tips... with a little bucket and everything. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what this Patreon page is like more than anything -\n it\u0027s like tipping me. If you like what I do, think it\u0027s worth it and think that I will consistently release things you like - float me a few bucks every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have chosen to do this as a monthly charge to Patreon rather than a charge per song or video (which I could have done). Some months I might do 15 videos rather than one a week (which is my average). This way, for you, it would be a consistent charge even if the spirit moves me A LOT during the month. \u00a0Check out the rewards for the different patron levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I only charge for albums and occasional online shows (which \nare $2). Everything else I give away free. Videos, live clips, lots of \nextra music online, audio from online shows - tons of stuff. So, your patronage and tips are appreciated. Truly."
