    "summary": "Hey there. It\u0027s me, so me is Enes and Enes is pretty much a writer.I can\u0027t tell you when I started writing because I don\u2019t remember a time I didn\u2019t. Even before knowing how to write I simply wrote stories in my mind and not on letter. My very first book is \"Abandoned\" which you can find on Amazon or you can become part of my Patrons and get it for free. You decide on that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I guess I should tell something about me. Well except being a writer, I\u0027m also a video producer/editor and a youtuber as well. I became a youtuber in the first place since I\u0027m a stutterer, and that is something stutterers normally tend to shy away from so I saw it as a way to break some boundaries. By hoping that I would inspire some stutterer like myself that stuttering isn\u0027t really the end of the world, and in the same time hoping that I would make some fluent speaker that doesn\u0027t have a clue about stuttering see us stutterers as plain normal people although no one is really normal you know. If you want to check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJQPWayBX11g3E3Gi4jKyPQ\"\u003ethe Stuttering Master\u003c/a\u003e just click on it.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSo for now the strategy is like this; A poem a day and one short story per week. They will be free verse, generally free of anything, I will write as I feel writing on that particular day. There will be blogs of different natures time after time, I can\u0027t really say how often exactly since I don\u0027t know myself either. But expect literally almost everything from me when it comes to writing, every form, every genre, you name it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course as time goes on and we get to know each other, I might see something that would suit me and you better, so nothing is absolute as Albert Einstein has said. I\u0027ll continually be looking to improve as much and as best I know the content I provide and the way in which I provide it. Your feedback will come quite handy to me on this one so please don\u0027t hesitate to offer me any suggestions you might have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the rewards, honestly I don\u0027t have a clue which approach is the best. I will start how I see best fit. Hopefully it will be acceptable for you guys. For now since it is the beginning I will stay away from physical goodies considering I\u0027m new to the whole thing, but after a couple months they will be included most probably. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges would help me to focus in writing only without caring if I have enough money to make it for the next month or not, also if we reach certain goals would make it possible for me to start video series and make things more interesting where I could share even more with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return you get every single letter of what I write. Actually you\u0027ll get to have an impact on what I write and how I write it. I\u0027m looking forward to having your feedback, because...well nobody is perfect. Just the idea of writing a short story or a poem and getting thoughts by different individuals on it is simply amazing because it makes me grow as a writer and see where I can improve more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is all I have for now. I want to solemnly swear that\u00a0I will give it my all and I will write from my heart before I end this intro. Hopefully you patrons will like my humble words, and enjoy the magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

It would also enable me to deliver two weekly writing related videos to you \u00a0and other videos in the behalf of the Stuttering Master which would be very helpful for the stuttering community. So you would be helping me out in two things at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
