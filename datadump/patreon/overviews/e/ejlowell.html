    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eKeeping the nonsense to a minimum:\u003c/h2\u003e\nI write stuff. Novels, mostly. Blog posts, when I remember. Scripts for video cutscenes and the occasional D\u0026amp;D or Pathfinder campaign, when I get to run them. Character backstory, when I don\u2019t.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also draw stuff sometimes. Mainly my own book covers and commissions for other people. Art is something I\u2019ve been doing since I was old enough to pick up a crayon, so I\u2019m not as proud of it as I am of my writing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne might say I\u2019m multi-talented. I don\u2019t really believe in \u201ctalent,\u201d though. I believe in practice. Had I not practiced drawing for the last 20 or so years I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. In fact, I could probably stand to practice \n\u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e, even now. Writing is something I do every day; art isn\u2019t, even though it should be. You can only put skill points into so many things, right?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m also a firm believer that we all need fantasy to be able to face reality. That\u2019s why I\u2019m an artist, and a storyteller. I know that the old myths and legends were so favored for a reason. They cast long shadows to this day for a reason. That reason is survival, not physically, but emotionally. I hold no delusions that I\u2019ll be the next Homer or Tolkien. I just want to write stuff and make pretty things so that I \u2013 and maybe others \u2013 can have a break from everything else in life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eI write the change I wish to see in the world.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCheesy? Maybe. I\u2019ll workshop it. But if you like the idea of supporting someone who\u0027s trying to make cool stuff with characters that actually have character, you know where to find me. If the commitment of a once-per-month thing scares you (let\u0027s be real, commitment scares a lot of people, no shame) but you still want to support me, you can find my novels\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://talesofejlowell.wordpress.com/the-five-realms/novels/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere!\u003c/a\u003e The \"main\" trilogy is out in paperback. I\u0027d say it\u0027s a pretty good story for something that started out as an unfinished D\u0026amp;D campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSee you when I see you. Have a good one!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- EJ\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\np.s. Yes, this was mostly copy-pasted from my website\u0027s About page. I\u0027ve got one book to write, one book to edit, several videos to voice, and at least one illustration to finish. Ain\u0027t \u003cem\u003enobody\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0got time for fancy-pants Patreon blurbs!\u003cbr\u003e"
