    "summary": "Hi Everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  First of all I\u0027d like to thank you for taking the\u00a0time to read my Patreon page.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You\u0027re awesome! Next, I\u0027m sure you\u0027re asking yourself what is Esther 414 Ministries and who are YOU?! \u00a0Great questions! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere did Esther 414 Ministries come From?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Esther is a book\u00a0in the Old Testament of\u00a0the Bible.\u00a0 In short, it is\u00a0a rags to riches story, but a story that is intertwined with God\u0027s providence and sovereignty. Everyone loves to hear about the underdog who overcame their circumstances and went on to achieve great success.\u00a0Well, that\u0027s the Book of Esther in a nutshell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Esther was a young and beautiful\u00a0Jewish\u00a0woman who was\u00a0insignificant, unknown, and\u00a0unmarried.\u00a0 She\u00a0became a\u00a0part of a large group of women\u00a0that was taken to the palace of\u00a0the king of Persia.\u00a0\u00a0From this group of women the king would choose his next queen. Esther was chosen and,\u00a0as queen,\u00a0God used her to rescue the Jewish people from being annihilated. The most famous verse in the Book of Esther\u00a0is found in\u00a0chapter 4 and\u00a0verse 14 (4:14). \u00a0In this verse we find the oft-quoted phrase..\".for such a time as this...\".\u00a0Though this six-word phrase is only a small part of the entire verse,\u00a0its impact\u00a0has inspired many people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://youtu.be/MqJovD-6ZIg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is the origin of Esther 414.\u00a0 The reason I\u00a0chose\u00a0this verse\u00a0is because everyone has \"such a time as this\" throughout their lives whether they are small moments or\u00a0pinnacle ones.\u00a0\u00a0(I did a video on this concept called, \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/ipcv9xbg1L0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFor Such A Time as This\u003c/a\u003e. ) God has something for all of us, and there are those\u00a0moments in our lives that God has ordained for us to shine greatly and\u00a0where He will use us in a way that we could never have imagined! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   Esther 414 Ministries is a YouTube channel filled with inspirational and encouraging Devotionals. The ministry God has placed on my heart is one of encouragement and lifting others up, teaching them God\u0027s Word while helping them to aspire to what God has called them to in their lives!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My husband, Matt, and I have been doing YouTube videos since 2012 when we first felt the Lord asking us to do these Devotionals. Here is a link to a \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/MqJovD-6ZIg\"\u003eone minute intro video\u003c/a\u003e about my channel on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eSo who am I?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I am Tracey and my husband is Matt.\u00a0 We do daily devotions on YouTube.\u00a0  Matt\u0027s devotional channel, \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/ManCaveMinistries007\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eManCave Ministries007\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e, is\u00a0geared specifically towards men, and mine is for women. The majority of our topics, however,\u00a0are\u00a0applicable to\u00a0both men and women. It is\u00a0just our approach that is different.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e      This generation is looking for the real deal, the genuine article. They want to know that what\u00a0is proclaimed will\u00a0really work in\u00a0their lives. \u00a0I\u0027m here to tell you that it does work when you sell out to God!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid we always want to do devotionals? No!\u00a0 So how did we get to this point?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e Well, here\u0027s the rest of the story!\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Back in 2002 my husband and I looked at each other and said, \"There has to be more to life than this!\"\u00a0 We decided that big houses, fancy cars, and the accumulation of a bunch of stuff was meaningless and ended up leaving us feeling very empty. The more we had, the worse we felt. We felt empty, when we should have felt happy! \u00a0What was missing in our lives? We were achieving the American Dream. We had it all, or at least a LOT of it! Yet we just felt purposeless and unfulfilled.  \u003cbr\u003e   What we were looking for was God, but where could He be found?  What was God doing in our lives?\u00a0\u00a0I\u0027ll tell you what He was doing, He was making us miserable. God was bringing us to the end of ourselves! \u003cbr\u003e    So what did we do? \u00a0It was more like what did GOD do?\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eGod pried our fingers loose of all our worldly possessions, moved us across country with three very small children and led us to a small Bible college in the middle of rural America\u00a0that believed God\u0027s Word \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e God\u0027s Word!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the years at Bible college and seminary we felt God\u0027s call upon our lives to full time ministry.  God had first called us unto Himself, and now he was calling us to serve! But how?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how:\u00a0\u00a0We turned the whole thing over to God and said, \"Use us anyway you want!\" We said like Isaiah, \"Here am I, send me,\" and He did! \u00a0He took us up on the offer! That was quite scary!\u003cbr\u003e   We served, worked, cleaned, cooked, did landscaping, taught, and counseled at too many churches to mention! What a headache! We were so burned out! How could that be if we were \"working for Jesus!\" ?  \u003cbr\u003e     The problem was that we were not resting in Christ. We were \"doing\", not \"being\". We were too busy trying to do as much as possible but not letting God do it through us! So where did that leave us?\u00a0 Crash and burn, baby! \u00a0D.O.A.!\u003cbr\u003eMatt loved to preach God\u0027s Word and I loved to teach His Word, but it was the other 95% of ministry within the church that almost killed us! We cried out to God, \"Please, Lord, please help us.\"\u00a0 And He did! \u003cbr\u003e God once again had us forsake all, and moved us back across country to the same town that we had left 12 years earlier--to the day! (God\u0027s Sovereignty)\u00a0 God sent us back to where we began--Full circle.\u003cbr\u003e    Our Goal now is to teach God\u0027s truth full time on YouTube and to reach people for Christ no matter where they are in their lives! Some hate church, some are mad at God, some are hurting because of the loss of a loved one, some have lost everything, and others just need an encouraging word! \u00a0Wherever a person is in their journey with God, that is where we meet them! \u003cbr\u003e     God has placed the desire upon our hearts to teach those things to others that He has taught to us. We want to encourage, motivate and build others up. We want people to see God for who He really is-- loving, kind, strong and mighty, and that nothing is too difficult for Him!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eSo, what we will do with the support\u00a0money?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people, when they hear the word \"missionary\" think of someone who raises money to go over seas and tell others about Jesus. They will ask others to invest in the Kingdom of God by supporting their family while they are in another country.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhat Matt and I do is also considered missionary work but on a global scale through the internet.\u00a0 We are able to not only impact one country at a time, but multiple countries at one time! \u00a0God has given us this enormous ministry to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ to countries we could not normally enter because of what we are proclaiming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough YouTube pays a\u00a0small amount\u00a0through Adsense, it is not\u00a0enough to sustain our family. We want to eventually\u00a0be able to\u00a0take AdSense off of our videos and go ad free because of generous donors like you who want to\u00a0invest in God\u0027s work through\u00a0this ministry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will use the money given through Patreon to not only meet our needs and satisfy our responsibilities, but also to upgrade our\u00a0equipment, i.e., camera, cords, microphones, computer, etc.\u00a0 These upgrades will allow us to deliver the best quality videos possible for God\u0027s Glory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe ask that you would pray for our small ministry and that God would use it greatly to impact the lives of others. Thank you so very\u00a0much for your support! \u00a0We appreciate it more than you can imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "In Matthew 14:22-33 we read of a story where Jesus is walking on water. \u00a0However, that\u0027s not the whole story! When Jesus was walking across the Sea of Galilee, there was such a strong wind that the disciples who were trying to row to the other side, were having great difficulty accomplishing this task. \u00a0So imagine the miracle, first of all, of Jesus being able to walk and make progress against this huge gale! \u00a0\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next big miracle was when the disciples saw Him, and Peter cried out to Jesus. \u00a0Peter asked Jesus to call him to Himself--on the water-- if it truly was Jesus. \u00a0So what happened? \u00a0Jesus called to Peter and Peter did something extreme. \u00a0\u00a0He threw his legs over the side of the boat and walked on water!! \u00a0Can you imagine the faith he had to have in God and Jesus at that moment?! That is the type of faith it takes to walk on water!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou, my friends, are \"Water Walkers\" because of the depth of faith it took to ask God to use you in His Kingdom any way He chooses.

You are going to do great and mighty things for God at this Level!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the Bible there have been men of extraordinary stature and character, who have set themselves apart with one distinctive trait: \u00a0Faith. \u00a0I call these individuals \"Front Line Warriors\" because most of the battle is being waged against these who have extraordinary faith. \u00a0These are individuals that Satan\u0027s fiercest attacks are levied against, but to no avail. Their faith and trust isn\u0027t in themselves, but in \u00a0Christ, the Greatest Warrior of all! Christ has won, so we fight the Good Fight from an elevated position of victory! \u00a0We call those things that be not,... as though they were. That\u0027s the power of Faith that is exercised in God.

To do this would\n require an updating of our current equipment, i.e. cameras,  \nmicrophones, and IT equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs God continues to bless, our \nlong-term goal would be of an evangelistic nature.\u00a0\u00a0Matt and I would \nmake ourselves available to travel  and film \"as we go\" whether it be in\n a church or a cow field!\u00a0 We hope that you will also \"go into all the \nworld\" with us through our ManCave and Esther 414 Ministries videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease pray and ask the Lord\u00a0if you are to have a part in seeing these goals come to pass.",
