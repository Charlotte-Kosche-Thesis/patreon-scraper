I like Jesus, writing, coffee, bad jokes, and old video games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years I have been blogging, podcasting, launching websites... generally Creating Content and stirring up harmless online mischief. My central hub of activity is on Twitter,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/EricVBailey\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@EricVBailey\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am writing at least one post per month on three sites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://FaithFamilyFun.Life\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFaith Family Fun\u003c/a\u003e -- My personal blog where I discuss my faith in Jesus Christ and my wonderful family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://neuraldispatch.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNeural Dispatch\u003c/a\u003e -- I host my fiction here.

If support increases, what I can do increases. For one example, I\u0027d love to more regularly pay people for artwork and commissioned features, something I\u0027ve done a little of in the past and would like to do more of in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving said that, I would like to draw attention to the $40/month tier, at which point you can hire me as a monthly columnist for your own site. I\u0027d be happy to discuss the possibility (and share my portfolio) in private with anyone interested. Let\u0027s talk!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me but cannot make a monthly commitment, one-time contributions can go to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ko-fi.com/NintendoLegend\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Ko-Fi page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a scatterbrained creative mind constantly putting stuff into the universe that wasn\u0027t there before while being intentional about being lighthearted, positive, and encouraging. I truly appreciate any support I receive toward these endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
