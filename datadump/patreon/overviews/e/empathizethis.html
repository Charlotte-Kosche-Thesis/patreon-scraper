Imagine a scenario where\nwe have a story pointing out problems with the way poor people, or women, or\nblack people are portrayed in the media. What if there\u2019s an ad that does\nexactly that at the top of our website? That would be horrible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOr how about a story about\nPTSD at the movies (we have a story like this), with a movie ad for something\nextremely violent?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are too many possibilities\nof ads going wrong on our site. This is the reason why we had to make the\ndecision to never incorporate ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo instead, we\u2019re coming\nto our readers directly for help.

Fortunately we all have day jobs, but obviously this isn\u2019t sustainable in the long term. There will come a time when\nwe can no longer afford to keep the website up and running. Your patronage will\nensure that we can keep sharing stories that matter - and at the very least, keep old stories available to read for others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eMilestone Goals\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOnce we reach the minimum\namount to keep the website running, we\u2019ll be able to do neat things such as publish comics in color, an ebook edition, and more frequent updates!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eHow often will I be charged?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe update the site every\nother Monday, and you\u2019ll be charged at the end of the month. You can set a cap\non how much you\u2019re willing to spend, so you won\u2019t go over your set amount no\nmatter what.
