    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eUm...why are you doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created Expat Sandwich podcast because I\u0027m fascinated by\nthe inner transformation that takes place when one leaves their native country. I\nthink it\u0027s the only way we\u0027re able see ourselves and our country\nobjectively. I love that. And I never grow tired\nof hearing those stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m equally intrigued to know what\nforeigners think of the United States upon arrival. What they loved, challenges of daily life, disappointments and surprises. This is a new segment called Culture Shock Flashback that I\u0027m developing and really needs your support to get it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short -- I\u0027m obsessed with cultural collisions\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Expat\nSandwich? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nExpat Sandwich is a (mostly) bi-weekly podcast featuring an eclectic mix\nof American expats who share stories of the best, weirdest and worst\nexperiences of living abroad. Each\nepisode creates a portrait of an American sandwiched between their US homeland and their new residence abroad. \u003ca href=\"http://www.expatsandwich.com\"\u003ewww.expatsandwich.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nExpat Sandwich is created and produced in a makeshift\nrecording studio in my walk-in closet (I\u0027m not kidding!) in my one bedroom apartment. It\u0027s a completely\nindependent production, which takes hundreds of hours a month to research,\nedit, and produce, as well as time spent marketing the show. This\npodcast is a labor of love and I\u0027m kind of freaked out at how quickly the expenses have added up. Crowdfunding through Patreon will offset this through the first goal. You can adjust your donation at any time or cancel whenever you want. NOTE: Several folks have asked to make a one-time donation. Patreon\u0027s platform encourages on-going support, however, they suggest you join, input your donation amount and then cancel after your card has been charged. I can also manually do this on my end through PayPal--email me at expatsandwich@gmail.com and I\u0027ll send a paypal.me link. It all goes to the same place so whatever works best for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop 3 reasons why you should contribute\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. BRAGGING RIGHTS Contribute now so you can say \"I supported them when they didn\u0027t amount to more than a hill of beans!\" (uniquely American idiom)\u003cbr\u003e2. SHOW OFF YOUR COOL SWAG People LOVE our artwork, even folks from the NY Times love it! (they said so on their FB podcast group page--see? insider knowledge already!) Be the first to get in on the Expat Sandwich swag, not sure how long it will last!\u003cbr\u003e3. YOU\u0027LL GET EARLY ACCESS That\u0027s right. You\u0027ll get to hear episodes BEFORE anyone else. You\u0027ll also have access to posts, special episodes, behind the scenes and lots of interesting stuff that doesn\u0027t make it to the final cut because it didn\u0027t quite fit for whatever reason. Join a community of like-minded fans and expats for discussions and post-episode banter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy don\u0027t you get advertising like everybody else? \u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s\n getting tougher to be found on iTunes because the larger networks are squeezing out the new indies. It takes a while to grow an audience when you \nare just starting out so crowdfunding is crucial in the early stages. \nBut with the help of staunch supporters, I know we can get there!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThanks to You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am super grateful for every single listener we have. If you\nwant to help us continue to exist and grow, please consider making a contribution each month to achieve sustainable growth. I have some big plans for the future and would love for you to be a part of it!\u003cbr\u003e"
