I\u0027m always writing and recording new songs, along with various covers that suit my style. I\u0027ve heard comparisons to 80s icons Bryan Adams and Richard Marx, and modern rock staples Lifehouse and Daughtry.\u00a0 I guess my vocals have that raspy sound.\u00a0 As a piano guy, I\u0027m very influenced by Billy Joel and Elton John.\u00a0 Well, I\u0027ll let you be the judge...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThough you can find my music for FREE on various sites like Facebook, Soundcloud, YouTube, etc,\n\u003cstrong\u003e Patreon is where you can support my work with a small contribution, kind of like a tip.\u003c/strong\u003e When you sign up to become my \"Patron,\" you can elect to donate $1, or more if you choose, for each new song I create. It may be a new original, my own version of another artist\u0027s song, a live performance from my apartment, or perhaps something else I haven\u0027t thought of just yet. \u00a0I generally post 1 or 2 songs each month, and you\u0027ll gain \u003cstrong\u003efull access to my \"Patron-only feed,\"\u003c/strong\u003e with exclusive content just for you, and a place where we can chat!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDON\u0027T WORRY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can limit what you spend per month. So... if you don\u0027t want to spend more than $1 or $3 or $5 or a million dollars\n\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eeach month (now that would be generous), simply indicate the monthly limit when you sign up. \u003cstrong\u003eYou can also cancel at any time\u003c/strong\u003e and still enjoy my songs, wherever you might find them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFINAL THOUGHTS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d love to be writing songs all day, everyday, and sharing them with you. Any artist or musician will tell you that their dream is to earn a living doing what they love. Perhaps this site can help me to achieve that. Mostly, I just hope that you\u0027ll continue to enjoy the music that I make for a long time to come, and your support is appreciated in any capacity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
