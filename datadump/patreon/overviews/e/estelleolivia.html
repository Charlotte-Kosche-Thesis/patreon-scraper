    "summary": "I am a creator and a storyteller of all sorts. I\u0027ve never been able to limit myself to one medium. I write journals, make comedic videos, illustrated stories, short films, fine art, articles, and more. I\u0027ve been drawing since I could hold a crayon and hamming it up for the camera since VHS. I\u0027m on Patreon to share as much as possible of my art, imagination, and weird times. I\u0027d like to give you a peak inside my brain. Your support will allow me to create more and higher quality content. It will give me the freedom to experiment, it will mean I can work when inspiration strikes at 2 in the morning (why is that always the way?).\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you, my audience, to support my work directly and have it delivered to you immediately. You are literally a patron of the arts!\u00a0Whether you follow or support me I hope you\u0027ll stay in touch. One of the great parts of Patreon is that it gives me a platform to share and communicate with the people who love my work. So please comment or message me any time. I\u0027d love to hear your feedback, reactions, suggestions, and what you want to see more of!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to make this a monthly Patreon account because I realized I would never be able to decide what is big enough to count as a \"Thing.\" This way I can share everything that I make with you, whether it\u0027s a 5 minute charcoal sketch or a video that took days to write, plan, shoot, and edit. As with many other creatives I work in fits and starts. Sometimes I will post multiple times a day, sometimes once a week. If you look back through the feed you will get an idea of how much I\u0027m creating overall.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother good way to keep up with my work is to follow me on any other platforms you use:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/esteoliart/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/esteoliart/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Estelle_Olivia\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/Estelle_Olivia\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://esteoli.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://esteoli.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
