    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo my friends I\u0027m Elle, but my work is signed EKMCronin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor almost a decade I have been grappling with ideas about sustainability, justice, and how the average person can deal with big issues affecting our entire planet in everyday life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI studied theology as an undergraduate and found myself drawn to issues of politics, oppression, and expression. A little later down the line I decided to take on my Masters (distance learning in Bible \u0026amp; the Contemporary World with a 6m/o in tow, graduating two years later with a new 12-day-old on my arm) and again looked into issues including animal welfare, medical ethics, mental health, sustainable living, husbandry, stewardship, and what that really means on a day to day basis. I came to the conclusion again and again that so much of our mental and emotional health rely on the political and environmental health of the planet. No man (or woman) is an island.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I have discovered that more often than not the subjects I love (theology, art, and environmental ethics) are often the parts of life that feel overwhelming, part of an elite bubble, or just simply not for them. The common thread for me is justice: the ability to express yourself, stand up for beliefs, protect people and planet alike, and live peacefully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften, too much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ekmcronin.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e over 5 years ago, as well as producing artwork, illustration, and publicity for charities and theatrical productions, editing amateur writers work, and designing a variety of textile and architectural projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life has taken me into a mixture of areas but recently my life and research has tried to provide positive examples of how we can make little changes that make a big difference. This may include gardening for the beginner, vegetarian/vegan/low-waste cooking, mental health experience with encouragement and advice, non-profit shout-outs to businesses and options that I believe offer good, simple alternatives to the usual bad habits we as a society have got used to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to just keep fighting off the negatives of the world with positives. That starts with my own life but if I can provide inspiration, advice, reviews, or just the research others have no time to do, then great! As I work towards my goals I hope to be a guide to others. I believe these aims are important, that sharing knowledge freely is a wonderful thing, but in order to reach my goals (make a greater impact and help more people) I need support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI honestly believe we can save the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a big fan of community collaboration. The best projects happen when people come together. Through this website you would be collaborating with me, helping support my research, writing, and work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis website lets you be a backer of this idea, supporting me for each new piece of writing I produce. You can give from just a dollar per piece to as much as you like, even setting a monthly budget (so if I have a month that\u0027s super productive you still give the same amount) Every month those of you who support me will get to be involved; you could ask questions, pose challenges you are facing, and join the conversation to find solutions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAcademia, the arts, and environmental projects have always found getting support difficult because those who work in these areas rarely do it for their own benefit. If I wanted to be a millionaire I should have chosen a different path, but I love and believe in this one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you to help, if you want to be part of something, I would love you to consider being a patron. Those of you who feel like you can help out will get a perk or two: first view and access to my work and the ability to tailor it, challenge it, and become part of it. This is not a new way of creating or funding creatives, but in this day and age it\u0027s fairly radical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe radical. Help me save the world.\u003cbr\u003e"
