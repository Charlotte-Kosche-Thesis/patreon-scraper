    "summary": "My name is Elle Beau, and I am an anti-MLM blogger. \u00a0For those not in the know, MLM stands for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emulti-level marketing\u003c/a\u003e, also known as network marketing or direct selling. \u00a0I prefer to call them trussed-up pyramid schemes personally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was once a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youniqueproducts.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYounique\u003c/a\u003e presenter, to my shame. \u00a0However, every cloud has a silver lining - from my time \"on the inside\", I was able to see the lies, deceit and general corruption that surrounds these companies. \u00a0I was able to see the \"fake it til you make it\" mentality in its full throes, and the tactics used to exploit the vulnerable. \u00a0Of course, not everyone\u0027s experience of MLMs is the same, but after a time of serious contemplation over what happened, I decided enough was enough - it was time to reveal the fuckery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ellebeaublog.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e where I decided to document the step-by-step process of how I got wrapped up in these companies. \u00a0The blog took off, so I started a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ElleBeauBlog\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ElleBeauBlog\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e page to keep in touch with my followers. \u00a0I became an unofficial agony aunt, where former MLMers messaged me wanting to share their experiences, and talk over what\u0027s happened. \u00a0That\u0027s when I became to realise just what an important issue this is. \u00a0They target the low-income, the stay-at-home-mums, the students, the lonely - its all so wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the blog progressed, I realised just how much small details I have missed out (for the purpose of driving my story forwards) - I want to therefore turn my story into a novella. Paperback would be nice, but I doubt there is a publisher who\u0027d want to work with such a tetchy subject. \u00a0If that\u0027s the case, then ebook is my alternative aim. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTowards the end of 2017, I collectively formed a blogger coalition with fellow anti-MLMers\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.botwatch.blog/\"\u003eBot Watch\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/RedCorvette9\"\u003eRed Corvette\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/MLMshyster\"\u003eEmma the Naked Typist\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://crownless-princesses.writeas.com/\"\u003eCrownless Princesses\u003c/a\u003e. Check out our global resource page, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mlmtruth.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnti-MLM Coalition\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will still continue to work on our own blogs (me with all things \u003ca href=\"https://ellebeaublog.com/Poonique\"\u003e#Poonique\u003c/a\u003e), but you will also see me contribute to our new resource website too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a chronic illness (\u003ca href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;cd=1\u0026amp;cad=rja\u0026amp;uact=8\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_yMHzotDYAhXIAMAKHbA_CQ8QFghLMAA\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meassociation.org.uk%2Fabout%2Fwhat-is-mecfs%2F\u0026amp;usg=AOvVaw32QSF-PYCdOepW5cNQHSxF\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMyalgic Encephalopathy\u003c/a\u003e or \u201cME\u201d) that makes sitting down to write very difficult, but writing is what I love, and I want to be able to continue to write my story in novel format, and continue doing guest posts and anti-MLM articles with my blog. \u00a0Let\u0027s hope I can continue to fight the good fight!\u003cbr\u003e"
