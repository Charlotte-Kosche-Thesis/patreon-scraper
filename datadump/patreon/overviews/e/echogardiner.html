It\u0027s what I\u0027m willing to be uncomfortable for, what I\u0027m willing to work my hands to the bone for.  It\u0027s my legacy and purpose.\u00a0You would be funding a life-long yearning and ambition to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on using any funds raised towards overhead costs for executing conceptual work, for equipment and to help produce a solo exhibit. \u00a0The majority of my work will no longer be posted publicly. A monthly $1 pledge gives you exclusive access to my conceptual photography sets while\u00a0allowing me to create more original content. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my portfolio: echosvisuals.ca\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
