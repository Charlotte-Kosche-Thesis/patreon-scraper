But the cost of 3D printer plastic, electronic components and other materials costs money. So I\u0027m looking for a group of sponsors to help me to keep creating my videos for everyone to learn and enjoy from.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do I want?\u003cbr\u003eA dollar committed from you or your company for each video I release. And for this you will get your name listed at the end of my videos. The videos will list all supporters, be it a company or individual, at the end as \"This Episode was brought to you by\" and then the list of sponsors. This can be a name, a company name or nothing at all if you want to be anonymous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use lots of products in my videos and if you want me to feature your product we can work that out as well but you first have to be a regular supporter of my channel. That way I know you are committed to helping me get the helpful tips out to viewers and not just promoting your product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please, pledge an amount you feel but as a minimum I\u0027m only asking for $1/month and show you believe in helping others get started and learn more about electronics and 3D printing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd most of all, I Thank You for your support."
