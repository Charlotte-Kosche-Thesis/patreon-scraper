    "summary": "Hi Everyone! This is Dalia and Sam, we\u2019re a writer and\nillustrator team that makes Emu Sher Et, a weekly action-packed\nAncient-Egyptian-mythology-driven superhero webcomic, with cats. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur Dream\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve always believed in magic \u2013 the kind that happens\nbetween people, the kind that happens every time a kid reads a story for the\nfirst time. Whether it\u2019s beautiful artwork or captivating tales, we want to\nbring you stories that will take you to other worlds where the characters can\nbecome your lifelong friends. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want the stories we write to be about you. This will be a\nnew kind of storytelling wherein your suggestions and requests directly\ninfluence the events of the story. The story will be about what you like; we\u2019ll\njust be the conduit. Because we believe that what makes all great stories, be\nit mythology or even a good joke, is the fact that they are reflections of the\npeople hearing them. Everyone gets to have their say, and everyone gets to see what they want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn order to make this vision a reality we need you! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, What is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowd funding platform where readers can\nsupport their writers and artists in their work. It\u2019s just like KickStarter, except\nthat Patreon is ongoing. You would be our producers! It\u2019s similar to paying a\nsubscription fee, except you get to choose the price and the perks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd even if you can\u2019t afford it, remember that Emu Sher Et\nwill always be free to read online. You are still helping; your feedback and\nsupport mean the world to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have set up our Patreon based on monthly cycle. You can\nselect how much you\u2019d like to contribute or \u201cPledge\u201d per month. You can choose to contribute $1, $3 or $6 a month, or more \u2013 You get to decide the amount that best suits\nyour budget. You can also set a monthly maximum so that you\u0027re always within your budget. For your contributions, you will receive unique\nrewards that aren\u2019t available anywhere else! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou will receive your rewards once your payment is processed\nat the beginning of the month, following your sign up. So if you sign up\nmid-March, you will receive your first reward after the payment is processed at\nthe beginning of April. You will still receive all the rewards you paid for in\nMarch, so you don\u2019t have to worry about not getting rewards. If you have any\nquestions, please contact us or refer to Patreon\u2019s FAQ here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003ehttp://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep reading to find out more about our work and the\nrewards that await you \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroducing: Emu Sher Et\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cA down-on-his-luck detective is at his wit\u2019s end trying to\nsolve a missing children\u2019s case before it\u2019s too late, when he gets the call\nthat\u2019ll change his life\u2026\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAn action-packed story about a kid, ancient mythology, international intrigue, and cats! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u2026Oh and the detective, who is very very confoosed\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-mrs1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12670168_10156531844275241_3285435762464679843_n.jpg?oh=dcb3461239e0bd3d8ffe62884cce9d3f\u0026amp;oe=57F53CF3\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Work Process\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have worked on several stories.
