    "summary": "HELLO YOU LOVELY PROTO-PATREONS!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not entirely sure how all this is going to turn out but I\u0027m asking if you can help me out a little here.\u003cbr\u003eFor 10 years I was the frontman, singer and songwriter in dodgy UK gothic band the \u003ca href=\"http://www.screamingbansheeaircrew.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eScreaming Banshee Aircrew\u003c/a\u003e. This was followed by several years at the wheel of the tumultuous London-based post-punk four-piece, \u003ca href=\"http://www.partlyfaithful.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePartly Faithful\u003c/a\u003e. At present, I\u0027m between bands and recording the 2nd EP for my own audio/video project, \u003ca href=\"http://www.forgottenbetween.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eForgotten Between\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve also got a few collaborations on the go. After a year plagued by health issues, I\u0027m finally in a position to put together a new band... so let\u0027s get this wagon in gear!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Why should I give you my hard-earned cash?\", I hear you ask....\u003cbr\u003eWell... in the past, I\u0027ve written and recorded in 6 full albums, 3 EPs and over 96 original songs (soon to be 101!). I\u0027ve also been responsible for over 22 music videos and various promotional and blog content over the years. I\u0027d like to share my art and nonsense with you... I\u0027d like to know that the things I\u0027m working on will actually get seen and heard by people who express a genuine interest. \u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, platforms such as Facebook have developed rather fiendish methods of filtering out content before it ever gets to you... so I\u0027ve decided to give Patreon a try.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to use the \u0027Per Creation\u0027 subscription method, but never fear... Patreon allows you to set your own levels of payment and you can also set a monthly cap on the amount paid so I won\u0027t be breaking your bank. Most of the content I post here will be free and I\u0027ll be providing extra, more candid content for my Patreon subscribers (still free!). This should include works in progress, song ideas, question and answers, exclusive pre-releases, behind the scenes exclusives and band/song retrospectives, disaster cookery and video blogs. Paid content will be strictly limited to final quality art, music and videos... so it\u0027s likely to be few and far between.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re interested in my dodgy ART and you want to get involved in what I do... then please sign up to Patronize me :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s see what we can do!\u003cbr\u003e"
