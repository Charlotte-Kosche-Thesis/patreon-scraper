Many of the ambitious women that you will hear from on this show run their own businesses, are creative professionals or have unique stories to share about pursuing their passions while raising their child or children. These stories give an interesting perspective on life as a Mom and are sure to fuel you with inspiration for making the most of your own life. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs Moms, we are the driving force of our family; often masters of multi-tasking. We are made up of many moving parts that create momentum in our lives. Ignoring a single moving part can stall progress toward meeting our goals. In order for us to strive to be better than yesterday, it\u2019s vital that we identify what \n\u003cem\u003efuels\u003c/em\u003e us: our passions and purpose. It\u2019s important that we\u003cem\u003e re-fuel\u003c/em\u003e through self-care, exercise, healthy food, goals setting and by surrounding ourselves with women who are equally as driven. I want to inspire women to explore the road less traveled, to create a new perspective on life, while still focusing on what matters most.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal for this show is to support my listeners in three ways, by enabling them to:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eIdentify what fuels their Engine (passions / purpose)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eFocus on Engine Maintenance (self care / wellness)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eand Realize what keeps them driven?
