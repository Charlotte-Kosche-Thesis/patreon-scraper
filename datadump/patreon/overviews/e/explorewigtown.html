    "summary": "The Wigtown Festival Company is based in Scotland\u0027s National Book Town - a town of 900 people and 14 book-related businesses right by the sea. Sounds ideal, doesn\u0027t it? Well, it is! And we want you to come and experience all that Wigtown has to offer...without ever leaving your couch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow? Good question! The Wigtown Festival Company runs events year round, attracting world famous authors to this remote and beautiful part of Scotland. Like books? Like literature? Like mind blowing beautiful scenery? We thought so. We will give you inside access to not only all literary events, but send along videos and stories from the town, bookshops and give you a slice of what it\u0027s like to live in Scotland\u0027s National Book Town, with all of us. From farming tips to short bread recipes to a hike in the hills and how to find the most delicious brambles, you will be sent a video a month, a newsletter and some surprises now and then from either our artist and writer friends or the bookshops themselves. Learn about the history of Wigtown, meet some of the locals and become part of this wonderful community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn turn your contribution will help the Wigtown Festival Company HUGELY. Being a rural community we rely on grants for all the work we do and help the tourist economy and educational outreach - now with Patreon we will have a predictable income to expand our programmes. This means collaborating more with local artists and businesses, this means more events and more literacy outreach. More of all the good things."
