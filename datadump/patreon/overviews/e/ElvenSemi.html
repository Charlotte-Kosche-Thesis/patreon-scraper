I produced over 250,000 words in six months. As of the time of writing, the story has over 500,000 words and is in fact longer than the Lord of the Rings trilogy... and that\u0027s just the one story! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work other jobs, and Patreon and fan support helps let me have enough spare time to actually write, rather than spending all of my spare time asleep, studying, or working other jobs. Without your support, I would never have been able to come this far! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy choosing to pledge in monthly support, you\u0027ll keep me working, and also fed and caffienated, which are powerful motivators. You\u0027ll also gain access to behind-the-scenes materials and sneak peeks on what I\u0027m working on every week or so, as well as much more! \u003cbr\u003e"
