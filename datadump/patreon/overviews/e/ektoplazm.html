Founded in 2001 by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/Basilisk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDJ Basilisk\u003c/a\u003e, Ektoplazm specializes in high-quality\u00a0Creative Commons-licensed content from netlabels and independent artists, all released in MP3 and lossless CD-quality FLAC and WAV formats. Since the project began more\u00a0than 18 million releases, 150 million tracks, and 4 petabytes have been downloaded by music lovers all around the world. At peak capacity the site serves up a new release almost every day of the year, but not without an extraordinary investment of time, money, and effort. None of this would be possible without the generous ongoing support of music fans like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and in case you haven\u0027t heard of Ektoplazm,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/Basilisk/dj-basilisk-the-colours-of-ektoplazm/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u0027s five hours of music from the site\u003c/a\u003e to set the mood :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO IS THIS GUY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suppose I should introduce myself! I am generally known by my DJ name,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/basilisk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBasilisk\u003c/a\u003e, but you can also call me Alexander. I have been single-handedly operating Ektoplazm for much of it\u0027s decade-long history as a free music distribution portal. To catch up on the story so far I highly recommend reading\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ektoplazm.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe beginner\u0027s guide to Ektoplazm\u003c/a\u003e to understand my motivation in devoting so much time and energy to this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short version: about a decade ago I decided to apply a lot of what I had learned from reading about free culture and digital music distribution to the global psytrance culture. I wanted to offer labels and artists a viable alternative to the traditional music industry with its shrinking profits and limits on creative expression. The concept caught on by 2010 and since then I\u0027ve hardly been able to keep up with demand. I handle anything and everything that needs to be done behind the scenes: processing applications, preparing release packages, writing and editing promo text, translation, rights management, promotion, design, development, mixing, compiling, server administration, customer support, and much more. This doesn\u0027t leave me time for other work; Ektoplazm is actually my full-time job!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCURRENT CHALLENGES\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEktoplazm serves up an incredible amount of free music but hosting isn\u0027t cheap. I pay around $500 every month just to keep the site online\u2014and this expense is pretty much unavoidable. Many people come to me with suggestions to reduce this expense but I am committed to maintaining existing levels of service and there simply isn\u0027t anything less costly that doesn\u0027t involve risks I am unwilling to take with this project. That includes cloud hosting, CDNs,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ektoplazm.com/blog/bittorrent-is-not-the-solution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBitTorrent\u003c/a\u003e, ending support for WAV packages, and so on. Ektoplazm is too important to cut corners to save $100 a month\u2014and with a fanbase in the millions it shouldn\u0027t be necessary. (To clarify, I pay for unmetered dedicated servers, not bandwidth!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also my time to consider. I don\u0027t have any expectation that I should be compensated for my hard work on Ektoplazm (though that would be nice) but I have to pay rent and eat, among other things. I have undertaken some unusual steps to reduce my cost-of-living while working on this project but the unvarnished truth is that my work on Ektoplazm has been funded with mounting personal debt. I don\u0027t like talking about this openly because I do not want it to seem like I am trying to make anyone feel guilty for not donating\u2014that would be completely contrary to the spirit of the project\u2014but it should be said. I trust that my years of service and unwavering commitment to Ektoplazm have demonstrated that I\u0027m not in this for the money. I am genuinely passionate about seeing this project through to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also ran a crowdfunding campaign in 2012 that was surprisingly successful but have not yet delivered on a new version of the site for reasons that have been outlined on the Ektoplazm blog. Some early mistakes and my inability to find the right developer to work with left me with few options apart from admitting defeat\u2014so I decided to learn the necessary skills to complete the project myself, which has naturally taken a lot longer than initially expected. My day-to-day work on the project entails stocking the existing site with new releases as well as working hard on code and design behind the scenes. So here I am, still working hard to keep the free music flowing while developing Ektoplazm 2.0!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW YOU CAN HELP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMake a monthly commitment to support what I do here on Patreon! Your contribution will help keep the free music flowing and the redevelopment effort fully funded. Only through community support can this project reach its potential!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEktoplazm has inspired an incredible outpouring of love and appreciation over the last decade. I am deeply thankful that this project has inspired so many and hope to continue working toward a better future for independent and underground music for years to come!\u003cbr\u003e"
