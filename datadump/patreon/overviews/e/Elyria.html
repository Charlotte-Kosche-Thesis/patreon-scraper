    "summary": "I write poems for people who need healing, support, and understanding. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove, grief, relationship troubles, those little moments of beauty that we so easily miss when we aren\u0027t watching for them, connection, purpose -- my poems are deeply honest, gentle, and full of insight. I write poems for myself, too. I\u0027ve needed a lot of poetry, these last few years. I\u0027ve had a lot to deal with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first book of poems grew out of grief over my mom\u0027s death, and the love and healing I found after she was gone. I call it\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003esinging my mother down\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book is divided into three sections; grief, love, and renewal. And ultimately, that\u0027s what the poems all aim at: renewal. I bear witness to the amazing resilience and capacity for renewal that we all have. I don\u0027t shy away from grief and loss; fully experiencing that pain, and living through it, is a necessary part of the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublishing a book is easier than it used to be, but it still takes a lot of time and energy to do well. It takes even more time \u0026amp; energy to get the word out about it. And from the feedback I\u0027ve gotten, the poems I\u0027ve written are exactly what people who have lost loved ones need to hear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in, friends. With your support, before the end of 2016, I\u0027ll publish \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003esinging my mother down\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ll get it into the hands of people who have lost loved ones, who have seen relationships end, who have run headlong into the worst life has to offer. I want nothing more than to get this book of poems into the hands of the people who need it most.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn years to come, I\u0027ll keep right on writing poems. About once a year I\u0027ll make books of them, and share them with you. The only time you\u0027ll be charged is when I publish a new book and send it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor too long, the poetry of healing has been hard to find. Help me change that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003elove,\u003cbr\u003eElyria\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - if you aren\u0027t able to support my work with a pledge right now, I\u0027d still love to share some of my poems with you!
