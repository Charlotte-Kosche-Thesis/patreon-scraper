    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eLet me start this with, I am not forcing anyone to support this Patreon nor are we begging you to support this Patreon. We are simply creating this Patreon to allow our audience the ability to gain certain perks for showing support for our family and channel.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis story that I am about to share is a very personal story of my life after cancer and how it led me to YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started doing YouTube a long long time ago in a galaxy far away\u2026 hold on, wrong story\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the beginning of 2010. I had just been diagnosed with with testicular cancer. About 6 months before all of this, I had a vasectomy since we considered our family complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn January 13th, 2010 I went under the knife to have the cancer removed from my body.\u00a0This moment in my life changed me forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the weeks following this cancer treatment, I sunk further and further into depression. I had thoughts about what Amy would do without me and if I was going to be around to see my boys grow up into men. Depression is real and is not a simple switch that one can simply turn off or on. If you know anyone that is suffering from depression please help them and from my perspective the best thing someone can do is to stay positive and be very understanding. Amy was my angel during this time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began watching a lot of YouTube at all hours of the day and night since my body was not allowing me to sleep. The insomnia, in a way was my entry point into the world of YouTube. I searched for family videos, animal videos and any other videos that would make me smile or laugh. I needed to find anything that would help me change my frame of mind and get me out of my depression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ran across two YouTubers that I now consider friends, Shay Butler (AKA ShayCarl and father of the Shaytards) and Charles Trippy (CTFxC). These two men helped me conquer my depression. I became a viewer that eagerly awaited their next upload and felt a kind of connection with both of them over the internet. They were such good role models for any person to follow. I was enamored with how Shay interacted with his family and did everything in his power to put his life in a positive situation. Charles had such a captivating personality and understood the power of the internet. Their positivity simply flowed from every video they uploaded. The key to both of these men in my eyes was the ability to turn every situation into a positive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI took this to heart and realized my importance to my wife and my boys. I knew that my life was important in creating a family tree and building a family that strives for success. As I said before in this story, we were basically in a new environment with no support system in place. My extended family was three hours away and dealing with their own issues, Amy\u2019s extended family has never been close and all of our friends were four hours away.\u003cbr\u003eMy job as the head of my household was basically to \u2018MAN UP\u201d, which I did!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI told Amy that once I was out of the woods so to speak, I was going to start a YouTube channel to show our children, our extended family and friends, and all of the world that \u201cNo matter the hurdles life puts in front of us, we as humans can always find happiness within ourselves\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo on July 1st, 2010, I uploaded my first vlog to our channel and we began to film everyday for an entire year (we are currently in year six of consecutive daily vlogs). I always thought that this would just be an outlet to store our memories we created and to share our happy moments with our friends and family. As the months turned into years and the years turned into everyday habits, we grew into \u201cDaily Vloggers\u201d. My daily commitment to vlogging just turned into a way of life and it felt like just another activity that I did everyday as a human being. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI watched as Shay and Charles became mega stars in the YouTube universe. I learned that a career could be made from Youtube and that the sky is the limit for any individual with the drive to be a positive influence on others. My goal of 365 days morphed into a goal of someday becoming a Full Time YouTuber and making a career out of YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time and as I like to always tell myself\u2026 \u201cAs I sit here breathing air into my lungs, I need to be thankful and happy that I am here for my family! I am truly blessed\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u2013 Erik\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOW, the reason for setting up our Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to have better content and continue spreading HAPPINESS, which means better cameras, travelling more, meeting my YouTube family and creating a community of followers who truly believe in our family becoming a successful YouTube family! I plan on using the funds to help us attend conventions such as VidCon, Playlist Live, VloggerFair and others. Being daily family vloggers takes a toll on equipment as well, so this Patreon will help us keep our equipment up to standards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read all of this and hopefully deciding to become part of our success! We truly are blessed for all of the experiences life has presented us; good and bad, it all has led us to where we are today! \u003cbr\u003e"
