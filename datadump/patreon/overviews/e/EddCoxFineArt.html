     "about": "I was born January of 1948 in Bremerton, Washington. My father a sailor \nand my mother living with my grandmother in Port Orchard. I grew up in \nSouth Tacoma with a woods and lake linked by a broad field long before \nthe freeway. I began my career at the age of seven, having drawn and \npainted from an early age. In eighth grade I had my first art \ninstruction with the great artist and teacher Richard Rhea. We studied \nall the media from drawing to painting and ceramics. I could feel a \ntalent and desire and was encouraged.\u003cbr\u003eI started oil painting when I\n was fourteen. I also was adept at drafting. I took drafting classes in \nhigh school along with every art class available. I landed a job with \nGordon and Cross, Electrical Engineering in 1965. I was seventeen, \ndrafting up blueprints, working after school, weekends and summers. \nAfter more than two years in the office, I decided not to be an \narchitect and devoted myself to fine arts, emphasizing Painting. I \ngained altitude at community colleges and a year at Western Washington \nState College where I had my first college level painting course.\u003cbr\u003eIn\n the summer of 1969 I was drafted as an Army illustrator and spent a \nyear in Baltimore Maryland. I was twenty three and for the first time \nexperienced world class Art in New York, Washington DC, Boston and \nBaltimore. The following year I was stationed in Saigon Vietnam. An \nexotic year of living off base at the foot of a dead end street in an \napartment with a rooftop patio.\u003cbr\u003eI returned to the northwest and to\n college and found a graduate student at the University of Puget Sound \nto teach me wheel throwing. I immersed myself in ceramics, sculpture and\n printmaking for a year. Thus I began throwing and teaching wheel \nceramics, firing kilns and was introduced to raku, bronze casting, \nfoundry work and embossed serigraphs. Here again with Richard Rhea and \nalso study with Frank Dipolito in Printmaking. I was accepted to the \nFine Arts program at the University of Washington in 1973 and completed \nmy degree in 1977 with a major in painting and minor in ceramics.\u003cbr\u003eAfter\n graduation I spent the later part of the year on a freighter in the \nAleutian Islands. Returning from the Aleutians, I acquired my fist \nindependent studio to begin a dedicated evolution towards practicing my \nskills.\u003cbr\u003eI spent substantial time devoted to refining skills in \npainting, sculpture, printmaking and ceramics. I learned computer skills\n in the early years of digital development and was hired by the software\n creation company Onadime, as an artist developer in music \nvisualization. This position took me to Manhattan and San Francisco each\n year for five years.\u003cbr\u003eI have taught extensively in public school \nand museum Art programs guiding students in video animation, painting, \ndrawing and ceramics.\u003cbr\u003eInitially my core style of work was based on\n realism, working outdoors, from the model and from photographs. This \nstyle continues but I have also developed a style that draws from my \nimagination. I use simplified imagery that many have called \nInca-Picasso. My creativity has emphasized experimentation and use of \ndiverse and unique media. I have shown in many solo and group shows, \nprincipally in the west coast and have exhibited in several museums and \nhave won multiple awards, grants and residencies. Many public and \nprivate collections have acquired outstanding examples of my artwork.\u003cbr\u003eI work from a studio in the famous OK Hotel in historic Pioneer Square on the waterfront in Seattle.",
