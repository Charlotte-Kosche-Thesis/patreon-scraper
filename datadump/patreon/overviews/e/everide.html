They may be tips or tricks videos, unsponsored reviews, trail/adventure guides, product advice, motorcycle research, or (my favorite) inspirational short films that convey my passion for adventure and motorcycling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support ALL KINDS of videos, including motovlogs, simple wrenching, and short product reviews, there\u0027s a better way!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Patreon is great, but their fees are pretty high. If you\u0027d like to contribute monthly and support a variety of videos with less fees, check out https://www.everideadv.com/contribute for more info.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatronage starts at just $1 per short film, and\u00a0I only plan to produce one to three short films per month. \u003c/strong\u003eFor the mathematically challenged (like myself)\u00a0that\u0027s just $1-3 per month.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIn any case, you can cap the amount of short films you fund per month so you\u0027ll never go over budget. Take care of yourself, your family, and your motorcycle before giving money to some dude on the internet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, because it allows me to easily give back to the gentleducers with some awesome perks!\u003c/strong\u003e (Check them out to the right!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond, my audience wanted me to!\u003c/strong\u003e (Including the most important gentletuber, my wife!) In surveys, over 90% of you guys wanted a balance between fan-funded and sponsored content, and you were in favor of fan funding 16 to 1!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd third\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027ve struggled with this decision for a long time. Before fan funding, to support my family, I\u0027ve been making a lot of review videos, affiliate product videos, and sponsor videos. These are great and they get a lot of views, but\u00a0I\u0027d love to get back to making creative short films again and really unleash my editing/storytelling skills. Unfortunately, when I do spend the time to create short films based on \u003cem\u003ea passion for adventure motorcycling \u003c/em\u003eand not keywords/content,\u00a0I lose time and money because they are more art than business. They are created for the sake of inspiration and enjoyment, not for sales. They\u0027re beautiful (to some), but not profitable. It\u0027s a bummer, but to keep creating content I have to make videos that put food on the table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Patreon is the place to support the creation of \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0cinematic short films, protovlogs, and unsponsored content. Nothing else.\u003c/strong\u003e With your contributions, I can ease up on the \"sales\" video content and create more awesome cinematic videos and short films based on a genuine passion for adventure motorcycling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo thank you! And I mean it when I say it, MUCH LOVE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTyler\u003cbr\u003e"
