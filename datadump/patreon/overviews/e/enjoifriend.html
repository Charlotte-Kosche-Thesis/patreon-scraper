The Pokemon community has been extremely encouraging to me\u00a0since I began working with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC35KRaWGA7hQ5De40GG_7Fw?view_as=subscriber\"\u003eDerium\u0027s Competitive Pokemon\u003c/a\u003e in July. I am blessed for having the opportunity to create competitive Pokemon content for all of you, and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my dream to make a career out of sharing the Pokemon Trading Card game with the world. When I started playing the Pokemon TCG six years ago, I looked to the internet for guidance in learning the skills necessary to play. There were very few options available to me at the time, but I remember reading articles and imagining writing them myself one day. After winning my first Regional Championship in 2015, that dream became a reality when PokeBeach hired me as one of their very first Premium Content writers. Since then, I have continued to grow as a player, and fortunately, so has my content production. Thanks to Derium\u0027s, I now have the ability to share my love of the game with thousands of people every day!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it is right now, however, my time is divided between work, school and Pokemon. Everything that Derium\u0027s Competitive Pokemon is has essentially been created in what little free time I have in the week between my day job and graduate school. That being said, I am nearing a crossroads in my life. When graduate school is over, I am going to have to choose whether to further pursue education or Pokemon, and that result depends entirely on your support! I have so many ideas of things I would like to produce for all of you. It would be my dream to invest 40-60 hours a week into creating the best Pokemon TCG content available anywhere on the internet! And you all can help me do just that by joining me in this effort through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created this page so that you all can play a direct role in helping Derium\u0027s Competitive Pokemon grow into the best competitive Pokemon TCG Channel that has ever existed. Will you join me in this epic adventure?\u003cbr\u003e"
