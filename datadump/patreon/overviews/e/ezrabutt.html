    "summary": "Hullo all, my name is Ezra Butt (not a pseudonym) and I\u0027ve been making comics since 2010. In the past five years, I\u0027ve been able to make hundreds of pages of comics. For the most part, I\u0027ve been running my strip Crawdads Welcome, which is an eclectic hodge-podge of whatever material makes me laugh.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/1c3e4b3c36aba04361dd14518492dfd7/tumblr_o1wn36KVbS1r707vso1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work has been heavily influenced by naturalists, and I let this style war merrily with my often vulgar sense of humor. I also like to do narrative work. I love to create and reinterpret until I feel like I\u0027ve synthesized something new, drawing inspiration from nature and mythology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow are three pages from recent narrative works: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePiglet \u003c/em\u003eis a 120 \u00a0page graphic novel I finished at the end of 2014. It has the trappings of an adventure story, but deals with much darker themes. It is a work that tries to understand the isolation felt by an inhuman character living in a world dominated by humankind. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://36.media.tumblr.com/aa790a8d4258a22f9b273492bcf3cb5b/tumblr_o1yl32vB4G1urhzs2o1_r1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Egg of Fear-\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is a 28 page short story I made in early 2015. It follows an enslaved elephant who escapes into the forest one night. As with \u003cem\u003ePiglet\u003c/em\u003e, I wanted to make a story about animals being animals. This story is about a female elephant struggling to retain her sense of autonomy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://36.media.tumblr.com/a4100812922413a2c196d873116a344e/tumblr_o1yek9dkk91urhzs2o1_r1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSvyatogor- \u003c/em\u003eis\u00a0a graphic novella I am currently working on. I am adapting (and heavily embellishing) one of the original Russian\u003cem\u003e\u00a0Bylina \u003c/em\u003e(a form of epic poem) about\u00a0the legendary knight Ilya Muromets. I am excited to be drawing the comic in pencil, which for me is a new medium. \u003cem\u003eSvyatogor \u003c/em\u003ehas been a great way for me to celebrate the beauty of Christianity while the characters\u00a0articulate my reasons for apostasy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/feefba07726da72a71a2bd36afbe0124/tumblr_o1ypmv0Luk1urhzs2o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, with the restraints of working a day job, freelance illustration, and teaching comics, it can be difficult to find time to spend on projects I want to bring to you, the avid devourer of comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for fabulous individuals like yourself to fund the arts by directly supporting creators whose work you enjoy. I see this website as a way to help ensure that the flow of new comics, humorous or serious, is speedy and steady. With your generosity, I will be able to print future books in handsome volumes and be able to attend conventions across the United States, Canada, and beyond.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for support!\u003cbr\u003e"
