    "summary": "Hello and welcome! I\u0027m Erin and this is my Patreon page. I\u0027ve never done anything like this, so I\u0027m just gonna dive right in and tell you what you want to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI have a BA in English with a focus in Creative Writing. I have been writing all my life and self-publishing for the last three years. I did what many authors do when they first begin and gravitated toward romance. It\u0027s an approachable genre and there\u0027s a lot of money to be made (thank you 50 Shades!). I write romance under the name Adele Huxley. Feel free to look my work up! Romance was never a great love of mine. It\u0027s fun to write, don\u0027t get me wrong, but I don\u0027t \u003cem\u003elive and breathe\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0it. My mind is far too dark and twisted, I think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhich is why I\u0027m now writing speculative fiction. It\u0027s a big umbrella term that covers science fiction, fantasy, post-apocalyptic, dystopian, horror, and a bunch of other subgenres. What I\u0027m really interested in is near-future fiction. I love living in a world that is similar to our own, but just... off, a little bit, enough to make you feel off-centered. Think\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlack Mirror\u003c/a\u003e meets Stephen King.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, the first novel I ever read was Stephen King\u0027s \u003cem\u003eCarrie. \u003c/em\u003eWhen my mom worked at a video store, I used her employee perks to watch every single horror and sci-fi flick they had in stock. I\u0027m naturally drawn to dark, twisted, clever stuff that sticks in your brain for weeks.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I need?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEssentially Money = Time.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI\u0027ll be honest. I write because I love to, but I also need to pay bills and feed my cats. I hear they have no problems eating human flesh if they get hungry enough, but I\u0027d rather not personally find out. One of the most common problems creatives have is undervaluing their work. It\u0027s common to see full novels, even full trilogies selling for $0.99 (of which the author earns $0.33). They aren\u0027t just undervaluing their work... they\u0027re undervaluing their time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSelling books is also highly variable. Sales spike up and down meaning my monthly income is almost impossible to predict.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe relationship between author and reader is pretty simple: I write and sell, you buy and read.\u003c/em\u003e This Patreon is for those readers who want to take our relationship to another level. In exchange, I\u0027ll share all the extra stuff that happens around writing that hopefully you\u0027re interested in!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are only so many hours in the day. I\u0027m a creative, yes, but I\u0027m also a small business owner. Your continued financial support means I can focus more on the fun stuff!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome things I\u0027ll do!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eCreate side stories for minor characters you demand more from\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDesign choose-your-own-adventure stories that allow you to explore different parts of my stories\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCollaborate with you on ideas, covers, titles, character names\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePublish rough chapters as I write them, meaning you get to read it before anyone else\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShare my process and help any aspiring authors out there\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e all these cool ideas, but there are only so many hours in the day.

You get more. More content, more communication with me, more cool projects. You\u0027ll get first looks at my rough drafts and even collaborate with characters and stories!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried to create a variety of reward tiers to match every budget. With every dollar and word of encouragement, I\u0027m humbled and eternally thankful. I can only hope I\u0027m worthy of it! \u0026lt;3\u003c/div\u003e"
