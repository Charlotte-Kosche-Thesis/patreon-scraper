Primarily working with plasticine, i\u0027m exploring my ability to world build in macro and micro while referencing natural structures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m working towards setting up a digital exhibition space with several kinds of interactive art works based on my physical body of work. I want to create an immersive digital environment for you to explore, hopefully with frequent updates.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first step in this project is to create a digital zine of my sketchbooks while I am fleshing out my ideas and learning the requisite skills. The January \u002718 issue of PlasticScene Zine will be a PDF.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m lucky enough to be in a situation where I can stay at home with my two small children, however our family budget cannot cover my arts practice. While I have managed to have occasional market stalls, the simple truth is a lot of my biggest supporters and fans are international. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps me buy more materials and make you more beautiful, creepy things to look at. Anyone who sponsors me for $1 a month or more will have access to a quarterly digital zine of my sketchbook including detail pics, glitches and inspirational images.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see my most recent works go to my \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/effiedee\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003exx\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
