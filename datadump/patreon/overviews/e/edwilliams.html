    "summary": "ECHO CHAMBER is an interview series stemming from my sound installation ECHO ORGAN, which centers on grief \nand its relation to musical experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m documenting the \nexperiences of other musicians to develop the question of music\u2019s power to recall memories and incite deep \nemotions. I will release a discussion held with new artists and musicians every two weeks as podcast episodes - they\u0027ll be about 1 to 2 hours long, featuring extracts of music as well as aphoristic fragments from text written by my dad, for whose death my grieving became the driving force of this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve put a lot of time and resources into making these interviews happen, and hope to be able to sustain this exercise in self-knowledge and talking about what I love with other artists. If you think you\u0027re able to support me in order to keep up a high standard of research and interviews, please do so and become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease get in touch for more info or if you feel this is related to \nyour own artistic practice and/or if you\u2019d be interested in taking part in one\n of the next interviews."
