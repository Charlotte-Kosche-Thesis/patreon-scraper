I wrote the interactive comic book-inspired novel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.choiceofgames.com/user-contributed/community-college-hero/#utm_medium=web\u0026amp;utm_source=ourgames\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCommunity College Hero: Trial by Fire\u003c/a\u003e, published by Hosted Games in 2015. The sequel, Community College Hero 2: Knowledge is Power, is set for publication in the first half of 2018.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always enjoyed writing fiction, but I told myself that it was not a realistic professional path. And it\u0027s a tough path, there\u0027s no doubt about that! I took the leap in 2013 and spent two years, and probably about 1,000 hours, working on \u003cem\u003eTrial by Fire\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0during evenings and weekends, while working my day job and devoting much of my time to my wife and two daughters. The sometimes slow progress was frustrating, but I reached the finish line! And then in 2015, I took the leap again to write the sequel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eCommunity College Hero\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003e(CCH) \u003c/em\u003eseries, set in a community college for low-level heroes in Speck, Nebraska,\u00a0is my love letter to all things comic book and superhero. The story is interactive, allowing readers to create their own characters and make decisions that affect events in the story. I may not be entirely neutral about this, but if you dig funny, twisty stories with lots of character development, you might want to give it a try! It\u0027s just $3.99 on most platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is available for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/community-college-hero-trial-by-fire/id1039524882?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple devices\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hostedgames.communitycollegehero1\u0026amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAndroid\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Community-College-Hero-Trial-Fire/dp/B018I35HTE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon App Store\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/423120/Community_College_Hero_Trial_by_Fire/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI was humbled by the strong reader reaction to \u003cem\u003eTrial by Fire\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOver 25,000 copies have been sold, which was totally unexpected! I\u0027ve received hundreds of emails and messages from readers who have become fans, and who want to support my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I can only crank out interactive novels so fast, especially with a demanding job and family responsibilities. Parts 1 and 2 of the \u003cem\u003eCommunity College Hero\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0series each took about 2 years to finish, and I fully expect Part 3 to take about the same time, or perhaps even a bit longer, because it will be the longest of the three, and I\u0027ll provide many different endings for readers as I say goodbye to my babies!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I have so many side projects regarding CCH and other story ideas, and there\u0027s so much bonus and supplemental content I\u0027d like to share with readers. I\u0027ve also learned a lot about the craft of writing in general, and writing interactive fiction specifically, and I\u0027d love to share what I\u0027ve learned and possibly help kick-start others\u0027 writing careers. It\u0027s all about giving back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I started this Patreon page as a way to provide my most devoted and energetic fans with \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0supplemental content that won\u0027t be available elsewhere. I also plan to provide patrons with early access to content that will be posted on my website or on social media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can I offer you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, you\u0027re really the ones to answer that question! I\u0027m open-minded about what I can provide to my patrons. Really, the sky is the limit! I want you to truly enjoy this page, and I want you to feel like you\u0027re getting real value out of it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess the caveat is that I still need to focus the lion\u0027s share of my creative time working on CCH3 and a whacky sci-fi interactive novel I\u0027ve been working on while CCH2 awaits publication, but still I have a LOT of content in my head that\u0027s just waiting to be created and shared with folks like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheck out the Rewards and Goals!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m new at this, and I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll make a few mistakes! To start, I am offering rewards that I think folks will enjoy, but they are definitely subject to change, based on feedback from my patrons! I am a BIG believer in communicating with readers and providing the type of content that they desire.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegarding goals, I would absolutely love to be able to keep the web comic strip, \"Community College Hijinks,\" going for the foreseeable future, with free access on the website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fictionbyericmoser.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efictionbyericmoser.com\u003c/a\u003e (Strips #001- #003 can be viewed there now), but I do need to pay the artist, Gloves Belanger, a fair wage, so there are hard costs involved. I would also love to work with Gloves to create Patreon-exclusive \u0027episodes\u0027 of the strip for you to enjoy here, while keeping two-per-month free on the website. And I\u0027d really love to be able to set aside a few weeks to write a new CCH-themed short story! I have so many ideas!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if this something you\u0027re interested in, join up and say hello! And if you have a certain reward you\u0027d like to see offered in the future, don\u0027t hesitate to let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a Specktacular day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEric\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
