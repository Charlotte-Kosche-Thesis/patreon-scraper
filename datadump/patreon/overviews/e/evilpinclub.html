The Evil Pin Club is a subscription mystery box where you get a new evil pin matched with some short horror fiction every month.  Everyone likes surprises, and the pins you\u2019ll receive will be a secret until you get yours in the mail! Check out these samples of the pins I\u2019ve made in the past:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rickkitagawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pastpins.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides getting an awesome limited-edition enamel pins every month, you\u2019ll also be doing good, as 13% of your membership fees are donated to a charity from our list of supported charities.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u2019ll join me on this grand experiment.  I believe that horror fans are some of the coolest, most compassionate, and rad people out there, and I hope you\u2019ll subscribe (click over on the right hand side!) and become part of the best evil pin empire the world has ever seen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS- Special rewards will be given to the first 50 Cultist-level patrons!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, you still want to know more? Please read on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rickkitagawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/howdoesitwork.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will charge your card on the 1st of the month.  It\u2019ll take a few days for the payment to process and get over to me, and the pins should ship out on the 20th from my lair in San Francisco, CA.  You won\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get until they arrive, but that\u2019s the fun of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ll also get access to the short horror fiction story of the month, archived in the Patron-only posts.  This terrifying tale of the macabre will also relate to the actual pin.  Creepy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpon subscribing, you\u2019ll get a link where you can choose which one of the following non-profits you\u2019d like your 13% to go to: Charity:Water; Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN); Adopt-a-Classroom; or the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rickkitagawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/whycharity.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve always felt a bit different from most people.  Growing up I had a speech impediment and was picked on since I couldn\u2019t even pronounce my own name right. I liked books more than sports, wore hand-me-downs, and always ended up relating more to the misunderstood monsters in films than the \u201cheroes.\u201d I mean, the Creature was just chilling in his Black Lagoon, and some random dudes come in and kill him?  How is that fair?  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in a world where \u201cGood\u201d is mainstream and takes advantage of things that are different or out of the norm, maybe \u201cEvil\u201d is what is needed to change the world for the better. I figure by harnessing the awesomeness of monsters, dark magic, eldritch artifacts, and other cool evil stuff, maybe I can create a community of like-minded horror fans who can get behind sustainable manufacturing, environmentalism, and nudging the world in a positive direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rickkitagawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sustainablepins.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy pins (like ALL other enamel pins...even if they tell you differently) are made in China.  While I\u2019d like to support local manufacturing, it simply isn\u2019t possible. So I spent almost two months researching and talking with over 20 pin manufacturers, and I found one who not only has an ethical code of conduct for worker treatment but also has environmental regulations\u00a0 that live up to European Union standards. I\u2019d safely say these are the most ethical pins possibly made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rickkitagawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fanfavorite.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of being an ethical independent artist is (for better or worse) staying away from other people\u2019s creations.  I know, I know, facehuggers and Hellboy are all awesome, and I\u2019m a huge fan myself, but the only pins I\u2019ll be making from existing franchises is if I either can get a legit license or it\u2019s already in the public domain (ie. Cthulhu and the Lovecraft mythos, which I guarantee I\u2019ll make some pins of). If the Evil Pin Club grows, I will potentially snag licenses of your favorite franchises, but for now, expect to see a lot of stuff from mythology, demonology, or items that would be found in a witch\u2019s hovel.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rickkitagawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/stillhere.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you decide to join us on this exciting journey that not only gets more independent, creepy art out into the world, but actively helps out great causes.  Thanks again and I\u2019ll see you in the member\u2019s site!"
