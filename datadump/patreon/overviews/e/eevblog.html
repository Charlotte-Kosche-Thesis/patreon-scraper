    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Dave Jones from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.eevblog.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEEVblog\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating Electronics Engineering Youtube videos since April 2009, and have been doing this full time since 2011. I was the first full time video blogger in the engineering space and have produced over 1000 videos. I started it and continue to do it because I like it, it\u0027s fun, and I love sharing information and producing content people enjoy watching.\u003cbr\u003eThe fact I have managed to make a living from it is just mind-blowingly awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, this is my full time job, and I have no other income sources, so I am totally reliant upon generous donations, both direct website and Youtube adsense advertising, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KY1-tzNWBA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emechandise\u003c/a\u003e and product sales etc.\u003cbr\u003eI also founded and co-host the world biggest engineering podcast radio show, called \u003ca href=\"http://www.theamphour.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Amp Hour\u003c/a\u003e (that one doesn\u0027t generate \u003cem\u003eany \u003c/em\u003erevenue!)\u003cbr\u003eI also run one of the world\u0027s biggest electronics \u003ca href=\"http://www.eevblog.com/forum\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecommunity forums\u003c/a\u003e, and that takes significant server demands and backup space etc, not to mention time.\u003cbr\u003eMy internet connections and server costs alone approach $1000/month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe EEVblog is also the first and only engineering channel to employ a full time engineer (David2) to help out and also produce content. Yes, he\u0027s being paid a real professional engineering wage to do this, and this is the EEVblog\u0027s biggest expense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the EEVBlog content is free, and producing it all and handling the forums and email and comments etc consumes all of my time. I get 85,000+ views every day on average, and try top read every youtube and blog comment and email, and respond where possible. So I have to make a living from just the sources the blog provides, and generous donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. I already accept both one-off and recurring donations via PayPal \u003ca href=\"http://www.eevblog.com/donations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. But I know that many people don\u0027t like PayPal and/or they want a better and easier way to donate to their favourite content producers and interact with them. This is what Patreon can provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT THIS IS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt\u0027s another avenue to provide a monthly donation because you like the content I\u0027m producing and you want to support me in continuing to produce this content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt\u0027s a way for you to ask me stuff and get my ear, without being drowned out by the countless thousands of other messages and comments I get weekly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will occasionally do live shows just for my Patrons\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT THIS ISN\u0027T\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is not access to any special content, offers, or anything else (something might pop up occasionally, but consider it a bonus, see below)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is not a right to dictate what content I produce, what topics I choose, what I say, or how I say it. You get no extra say than those who watch for free.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is better than PayPal because it allows me easily know who is supporting me and gives me the tools to interact and share things with those supporters.\u003cbr\u003eI currently have a \"Supporters\" section on the EEVblog forum that is similar to this, and that will remain and I will post to both.\u003cbr\u003eJust like the forum though, I have absolutely no plans to provide special content for paid supporters, so consider anything on here a bonus. But I do value my financial supporters, so you might get some outtakes, to view a video before everyone else if I have one cued up waiting, or some other deal.\u003cbr\u003eBut the problem I want to avoid is one of expectations. My priority must and will remain producing content and maintaining and running the blog and forum as I currently do, so that\u0027s why I can\u0027t and won\u0027t promise anything to supporters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eARE YOU CHANGING TO PAID CONTENT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, absolutely not! Nothing is changing. Think of this as just yet another way to donate to me.\u003cbr\u003eI do not have the time nor the inclination to produce exclusive content for paid supporters. That would be a really dumb move on my part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IF I DON\u0027T WANT TO PAY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s cool, your viewership is more than enough, thanks! This Patreon thing is just another way for those who do want to support me financially, to do so.\u003cbr\u003eBTW, I use Patreon myself to support other bloggers I watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO MONTHLY AND NOT PER-VIDEO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows either Monthly donations, or a donation every time I release a video.\u003cbr\u003eI will only use the monthly option, because asking people to donate per-video for a regular blog like mine (several videos per week) is not fair. Some people may not like or watch every video, yet they would be charged every time I released a video, no matter how short and uninteresting to them. In fact, I\u0027m not sure why anyone would watch and like every one of my videos, as they are usually quite varied in content and style.\u003cbr\u003ePer-video would also inevitably lead to complaints of \"You got $$$$ to make \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e stupid easy video?\"\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also feel guilty if I knew I got paid per-video, and I don\u0027t want to slip into any sort of temptation to produce more but crapper videos just so I got paid more. I don\u0027t want that, and you don\u0027t want that.\u003cbr\u003eI just want to continue doing what I\u0027m doing now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks to all of my supporters, whether or not you are just a regular viewer who watches, or you choose to support me financially through Patreon or some other means, whatever the amount. It is much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003eRegards\u003cbr\u003eDave.\u003cbr\u003e"
