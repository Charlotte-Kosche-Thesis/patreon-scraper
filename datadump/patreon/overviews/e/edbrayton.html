I\u0027ll have a new co-host, Dan Ray, a retired professor of constitutional law. The show will focus on politics and legal issues, mostly. It\u0027s an informal show, just the two of us riffing off each other about the issues of the day. We may also do interviews here and there, but it will mostly be just the two of us discussing things. You will be both informed and entertained.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe plan to produce one new show each week, one hour long. We may expand to two hours later, depending on how it goes.\u00a0"
