At the beginning of my transition over four years ago, I made it a point to be open about my journey along this path by writing and sharing photos along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you head over to my Instagram (@emmetisjack) you\u0027ll see a truncated version of what I hope to do here - empowering self portraits with text that is inspirational, authentic and vulnerable. I want to share things that people don\u0027t normally talk about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrans or not, artist or not, I hope my words offer you some comfort, some inspiration when you are most in need. The human experience can be so affecting, it\u0027s nice to know that we are not alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout a reader or a viewer, my creations would fall flat.

I, like everyone else, need to be able to pay my rent, my bills, and medical expenses. As a trans person the latter adds up quickly. I also need to eat and clothe myself - have yet to find a way around that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile it\u0027s never any fun to ask people for money, my hope is that you\u0027ll value this content in such a way that it makes a difference in your life.
