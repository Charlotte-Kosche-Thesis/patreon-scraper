They have been written by hand as are\nall books in Elven culture, by employing calligraphy with original Tengwar scripts developed by me, and in harmony with J.R.R.Tolkien\u0027s ideals for mastery of art\nand craft, machine-independent creativity, unique and meaningful\npersonal expression. Each book in my \"Parma Eldali\u00e9va\" project\ntransforms into an Elven calligraphic work of art part of\nJ.R.R.Tolkien\u0027s literary legacy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first book that is ready in a\nTengwarin calligraphic art is a \"version\"/\"portrayal\" of the English text\nof \"The Hobbit\". Even if this book is never released by a publishing\nhouse, you will help it see the light of day as you will receive as rewards the first\nprinted copies of it when a certain\u00a0number of supporters and level of support are\u00a0reached (details given below).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition to its core seven volumes\n\"Parma Eldali\u00e9va\" also includes many other works of art among which\nare the first maps in Tengwar.

I\nam an artist, calligrapher and graphic designer. I have been doing calligraphy for more than two decades. In the past six years I have\nbeen giving everything of myself into developing the \"Parma\nEldali\u00e9va\" (\u003cem\u003e\u0027Book of the Elves\u0027\u003c/em\u003e) project that includes the first books in\nTengwar, while supporting it on my own. I began working on it in 2009 in \u003cspan style=\"color: #000000;\"\u003eTokyo where after working for some time as\na graphic designer (I graduated in that field in Japan) I was working as a Western Calligraphy teacher\nand as an English Assistant Language Teacher.\u00a0 Since 2011, when due to personal\nramifications from the March earthquake I suddenly had to move back to\nBulgaria, I have been supporting it with my savings and friends\u0027 support.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003eThe lack of interest in fine art and non-Hollywood Tolkien-inspired projects in\nthis country have been imposing a lot of problems on my working conditions ever since and\nhave significantly slowed down my work. Some of the most unpleasant problems have been, for example, the difficulty to\nobtain proper art supplies, work \u0026amp; storage space, and the impossibility for quality\nwork-related communication.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.parmaeldalieva.com/images/TsvetelinaKrumovaElmenel_Me3_1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe \"Parma Eldali\u00e9va\" works of\nTengwarin and Eldarin art and scholarship are a most respectful tribute to the\nworks of J.R.R.Tolkien, which inspired them. Every part of the project at its present stage is a fruit of many years of labor\nin many areas, including in the development of unique and Elven\nsensibility-befitting (as the Elves have been introduced to us by\nJ.R.R.Tolkien) scripts. I have invested much heart, dedication, labour and time in creating them as close as possible to Elven aesthetics and style as Tolkien defined them. Not imitating any historical human styles and scripts I\ncreated something new, original, and as authentic and untouched by our \u0027marred\u0027 world and\nhistory as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.parmaeldalieva.com/images/TsvetelinaKrumovaElmenel_b3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have been giving and will continue to\ngive everything of myself to my work on this project that has become entwined\nwith my life. Recently I found it very difficult to continue supporting it on my own, even as\nI have reached an exceptional creative and skill level and as my ideas and visions\nhave matured immensely after six years of exercise and a first finished\nmanuscript. I would like to start working on the next art book that is inspired by \"The Silmarillion\" (and one more text). This is something I have\nbeen anticipating from the beginning and for which the first \"Parma\nEldali\u00e9va\" has been, among other things, a preparation and a proof of my ability to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I need your support for? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI need your support in order to secure adequate working conditions,\nproper art materials supply, and the time to focus on the work on the \u201cParma\nEldali\u00e9va\u201d books and Tolkien-inspired art.

Until now I have somehow managed to support the project by myself in addition to doing all the work on it, but that has gradually become very hard. I have also reached a stage when I need to employ my hard-won skill, the scripts I have developed, and my many ideas by focusing on its art full-time and to the best of my abilities. I would be glad to share the joy of my creations with those who value them and help them enter this world!

I will be able to bring into being as many images from my imagination as possible. I will create my art with quality supplies and in proper work environment. That will allow me to use my skills in the best possible way and ensure that my works will be appropriately stored and preserved. I will have the necessary work conditions to do more diverse illumination for my calligraphic art as well as much more drawing and painting. My work communication opportunities will broaden, which may lead to more people being able to see and enjoy my art.\u003cbr\u003e",
