Read on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eBACKSTORY\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5 years ago, I was a college student singing a song in the shower. And out of nowhere, the idea came to me: What if I made Obama sing this? That peculiar shower idea became both the weirdest story and most impactful moment of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year, what started out as a hobby became a full time job with a bigger vision. This isn\u2019t just about making Obama sing pop songs, it\u2019s about the expressive power of video remix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u2019S VIDEO REMIX?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the one hand, video remix\u2014\u00a0taking existing videos and re-editing them to give them new meaning\u2014\u00a0is addictingly hilarious.

Where there is content, there is remix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u2019s not just about how much fun it is to watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe video remix is the most powerful medium for creativity we have today. And I believe that with the right tools, we can empower millions to harness that creative power and create some amazing content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this year, I\u2019m all in on making it happen. We\u2019re in a good place to start\u2014\u00a0we have one of the biggest video remix channels online. And thanks to your love, it shows no signs of stopping, even after Obama leaves office.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE PLAN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePART 1: EVERYONE SINGING EVERYTHING\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen Obama leaves office, Baracksdubs will expand: talk show hosts, movie stars, news anchors, athletes, and politicians (yes, Donald Trump) will sing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(By the way, also yes, Obama will still sing. He\u2019s leaving office but not the planet. He has a role to play, and I\u0027m excited to explore that with you.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePART 2: NEW VIDEO REMIXES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut after this, we\u2019re going to explore new forms of video remix that direct our editing ju jitsu and strike the same sense of wonder Baracksdubs does. We\u2019ll develop new types of video remix that make you laugh and can reach millions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePART 3: ELMNT APP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd while we\u2019re building Baracksdubs into the place to watch the best remixes, I also plan to build you an app with the tools to enable you to remix anything. I\u2019m calling it ELMNT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eELMNT breaks down any piece of content (photos, audio, video) into it elements (get it) and allows you to remix those elements. Want to replace Jack in the \"I\u0027m flying\" scene from the titanic? Got it. Want to dance next to Justin Bieber in his latest music video? Sure. Feeling crazy? Replace Jack with Justin Bieber in the Titanic scene. ELMNT is all about removing as many barriers to creativity and allowing you to focus solely on bringing your creative idea to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s the vision, guys! Dubs to the extreme, new video remixes, and the ultimate video remix app. I\u0027m building a community of remix lovers and, at the same time, an app that enables you to contribute to that community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think what we\u2019ve built for the last five years can be turned into something much bigger. And I\u2019m so serious about this that I\u2019m leaving my Tennessee home and driving 2600 miles to Los Angeles, where I\u2019ll be surrounded by people who can help make this dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut despite all the attention the channel has gotten\u2014 from artists like Kanye, news sites like Buzzfeed, and even the president himself\u2014 and the help I\u2019ll receive in LA, the channel has been missing a big piece of what I believe is required to make Baracksdubs successful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHIS IS YOUR STORY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 85% of the videos on Baracksdubs aren\u2019t monetized due to copyright claims on music. I can\u2019t make a living off the 15%. But this isn\u2019t just about the money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s about involving you intimately in the direction of the vision.
