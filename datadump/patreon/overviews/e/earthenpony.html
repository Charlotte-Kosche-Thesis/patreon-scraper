I am looking to branch out into creating sculpts based on topics such as anime, gaming, and animation (everything from network cartoons to youtube animations!) I\u0027ll also still do the pony thing of course on a commission basis, I wouldn\u0027t leave behind the fandom that got me started!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a youtube channel which has recently begun to grow in subscribers and views, so I plan to focus a lot on that as well. that means I will be posting more tutorials, but also videos of myself just screwing around and experimenting with props and collectables!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is to help with purchasing supplies and props, and hopefully, to help pay bills and such so I don\u0027t have to work a regular job. This will become my regular job! 40 extra hours per week to work on sculptures! That would be amazing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, really hoping this works out, I really don\u0027t need that much to make this dream come true, though of course with more income comes bigger and better projects!"
