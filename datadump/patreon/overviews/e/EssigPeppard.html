I pencil, ink and color my own work, utilizing both traditional and\ndigital mediums. Recently, I have also collaborated as an artist for children\u0027s books and as a storyboard and concept artist for Honda Motor \nCo., Capcom, Scion, and PlayStation.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I\u0027m not feverishly penciling out the next step toward some crazy \nidea of mine, I run a daycare at an Elementary School and I volunteer as\n an Artist Mentor teaching comic book creation classes in my local school district to Elementary and Middle school levels, teaching narrative structure, illustration, and peer collaboration.",
