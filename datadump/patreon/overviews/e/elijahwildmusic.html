    "summary": "The work to be done has no end or limit and is often overwhelming. And yet, as the years pass I find myself slowly easing more and more in to the fullness of my role in it all. It goes something like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day I work to grow, articulate, and live through a world view that is at once endlessly adaptable and highly stabilizing. To cultivate a sense of shared values within the community through conversation and song. To seek out and connect the myriad of creative, serene,\u00a0hard-working individuals and communities scattered up and down the Appellation mountain region in particular: an open and inclusive tribe of bad-ass sweethearts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my honor to play this role, and I do it with pride. But it is a long, slow, often intangible, and frequently arduous journey, and I want to know that I am at it for more than just my own self gratification. I want to know that I am also creating value for all of you, my intrepid community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I invite you to join me in all of this, to share my excitement and to help me hone my vision. To deepen our connection by going through all of this together. Because although in the end we must each walk the path alone, it is good to know that in the meantime we still have each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for your support, whether or not you decide to give this thing a go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou all inspire me every day =]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love and appreciation,\u003cbr\u003eJonathan Elijah"
