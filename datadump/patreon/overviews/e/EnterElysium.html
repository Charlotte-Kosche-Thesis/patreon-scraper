    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003eHello\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027m EnterElysium and for the past year I\u0027ve been creating videos on YouTube varying from the regular edited\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRIJYvLmc-o\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWorld War \u0027K\u0027 series in Kerbal Space Program\u003c/a\u003e to Let\u0027s Plays such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9vZ1f_m7Fs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eXCOM Need You\u003c/a\u003e where I spend my time sending viewers to their deaths. I\u0027ve also run the occasional piece of educational content such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGMpOFibFJU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"Who Really Won the Space Race?\"\u003c/a\u003e centred on my second channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to some lucky timing, a great fanbase and a decent measure of hard work I have actually been able to almost make this a livable full time job. This allows me to create lots of great content for viewers, but this depends entirely on ad revenue from the adverts on my videos. These ad revenues can fluctuate wildly and the adverts themselves can be fairly intrusive to your viewing, to the point where many people run adblock software which prevents me from earning any revenue. In addition to that all too frequent bogus Content ID matches can prevent me from earning anything off of videos that I have put time and effort into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAd revenues are also incredibly tiny, to the point where 1,000 views, even 10,000 views, is nothing. It\u0027s a system that actively penalises videos with a lot of effort put in that only get a few tens of thousands of views, or\u00a0even a hundred thousand views, and encourages you to make lots and lots of easy content such as straight unedited LPs. And while there is no problem with straight unedited content I would like to also be able to put some more effort into videos, to have an edited series and be able to do the odd piece of educational fun-fact content without worrying if it\u0027ll get the half million views to be \"worth\" the time. This is where Patreon helps out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon and how does it help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is a subscription system that allows you to donate a small amount to me each month to support me in what I do. By doing this you help me move away from relying on the YouTube ad model and allow me to put more thought and effort into my content. It\u0027ll help me cushion the wild fluctuations of ad revenue and also allow me to not constantly fear bogus Content ID claims redirecting my income. I won\u0027t have to focus on appealing to the largest number of views possible while ignoring the statistically \"worthless\" thousands of other people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003eGoals\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon provides me the ability to let goals and targets for funding, however I am not a massive fan of these because any target I set would be subject to the shifting, ever-changing world of YouTube and I would \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0want to break a promise to you guys. So the few goals that I have and will set will be only those that I know are realistic. In some cases I may find that I can implement these goals before they are reached since I will work a lot of spare room into these to make sure they are not unfeasible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I don\u0027t have any set goals for Patreon, the channel is going well and I cannot think of anything I can do as an iron-clad promise that would make a stretch goal worthwhile. Feel free to make suggestions however!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003eRewards\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eYou can pledge at any tier you like and cancel at any time! Rewards are listed below and all of them come with my most heartfelt thanks for supporting me and my work. Plus you don\u0027t need to feel bad about running adblock on my channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever for those of you unable to pledge for whatever reason, do not worry. No normal video content will ever be permanently exclusive to Patreons (out takes or similar may be), I am grateful for all of you whether you can afford to be a Patreon or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease Note: All rewards are fulfilled or updated once Patreon has finished collating Patreons for the month normal around a week into the beginning of every calendar month. Typically LPs are filmed once per week and as such changes take around a week (although this does vary) into the new month to be visible on released content. Also note that names used for Patreon will be used for the Needs You (possible name-in-game) perk tiers, if your username is offensive or similar, or has crazy punctuation/not latin characters, or if the game has a very strong theming system to the names (for instance KSP\u0027s \"all Kerbals have the lastname Kerman\") then I reserve the\u00a0right\u00a0not to use it or change it slightly to be acceptable (most cases this will be the choice). Or possibly to replace it with Bob.\u003c/em\u003e"
