    "summary": "First of all, thanks for visiting this page. Hopefully it means you find EVOwners useful and want to contribute what you can. If you\u0027ve never used EVOwners before, then\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.evowners.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eget yourself over there\u003c/a\u003e if electric vehicles are your kind of thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is EVOwners?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEVOwners is a discussion forum for all electric vehicle owners and enthusiasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I starting a Patreon campaign?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEVOwners has a wealth of information and provides a lot of value both to current EV owners and also to potential owners. However, it costs money to run the site so I\u0027m looking for a little help from the EVOwners community to keep the site running. This will also enable me to develop the site with the best interests of the community in mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA detailed history...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEVOwners hasn\u0027t always been EVOwners. I actually started a small forum called Twizyowners back in 2012 just as the Renault Twizy was launching in the UK. There wasn\u0027t much information for potential buyers at the time, so it seemed like a decent idea. It turns out it was; the forum helped countless people decide whether or not to buy a Renault Twizy, and the forum quickly grew to be the most popular Twizy forum in the English language.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I upgraded the site numerous times to make sure it provided the best possible experience for the forum members. I moved to more expensive dedicated hosting and migrated the site to new, much more current forum software to ensure that the site ran smoothly at all times. I allowed generous image uploads on the site so people could post pretty much as many images as they liked without restriction and offered a marketplace where owners could buy and sell vehicles and accessories for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring these years and up until now, I have personally funded the site each month, except for a small handful of generous donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June 2016 I decided to open the site up to all EV owners (not just Twizy) in order to try and grow the site to the scale where it could pay for itself. After all, the EV market is growing quickly and there are plenty of people with lots of questions about all kinds of EVs, not just the Twizy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI rebranded the site to EVOwners to try and attract a much broader audience, however it wasn\u0027t as successful as I\u0027d hoped in the short term and the forum has stayed very Twizy-centric. Due to the relatively small number of active users it has made the site difficult to monetise as I\u0027d hoped.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis brings me to Patreon. Enough members have told me that they find EVOwners valuable enough to donate a small amount each month to help with the running costs of the site. I have provided three different funding levels, with their own respective rewards. You can see them to the right of this about page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time, and hopefully see you on the forum!"
