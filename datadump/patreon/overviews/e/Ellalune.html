Well, to be frank, we are both freelancers and making indie games is hard. To do a successful Kickstarter campaign, we would have to somehow save up enough to survive for an entire month, or more, to focus full time on managing the Kickstarter. Of course, if it were to fail, we would have exhausted all of our time and resources, only to disappoint the die hard fans of our work that would suddenly lose out on not only proudly supporting a project that they love, but all the cool rewards they had hoped to receive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, we can get started now. And the more support we receive, the more we can focus on the game and give back to you guys. And if we foster a successful Patreon campaign, we will be supported on a monthly basis, without having to risk blowing through our Kickstarter budget due to inaccurate guesstimation of how long the game will take to make. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you only want to support us for one month as a single donation that you think is worth it, that\u0027s totally cool! If you want to chip in a little bit every month, that\u0027s pretty awesome too!
