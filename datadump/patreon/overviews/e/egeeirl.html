    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWho Is Egee?\u003c/h2\u003e\nI\u0027m a guy that does\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/EtherealGaming1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e and codes somewhat random Open Source projects such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/egee-irl/gsc-docs\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGame Server Containers\u003c/a\u003e. I also host various public game servers on my own server infrastructure, and \u003cdel\u003erant\u003c/del\u003e blog from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eYou Do YouTube?\u003c/h2\u003e\nYup, I\u0027ve been doing YouTube since 2014. Originally I aspired to be kind of like LGR for Linux.. Reviewing older \u0026amp; obscure Linux games to get people more aware of Linux as a platform for gaming and whatever else. I gradually began to diversify into more technical (and interesting) videos like benchmarks and coding, and the rest is history. I don\u0027t really do Linux gaming or review videos anymore because there\u0027s not a huge audience and there\u0027s other channels that do those videos much better than I ever did.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eYou Write Code?\u003c/h2\u003e\nI\u0027ve been a professional software engineer since about 2008, though I only held the title of \"Software Developer\" for about 9 months before I switched to a different title. I started out as a lowly SQA engineer before becoming an SDET, and later settling on a DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer title. However despite that title, I\u0027m not a terribly strong coder and I don\u0027t have any formal training or education in Software Engineering; I am entirely self taught. I specialize in configuration management and cloud stuff (mostly AWS \u0026amp; containers).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have *alot* of Open Source projects on my GitHub and have contributed to many other projects over the years. I enjoy building \u0026amp; automating things and coding programs is just another way of doing that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYou Host Game Servers?\u003c/h2\u003e\nI live in a town with\u00a0municipal broadband internet (which is somewhat uncommon here in the US) and prior to hosting a slew of public game servers, I always ran a private game server for friends. When Egee.io started and we started our own Discord server, I began to make servers public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game servers started out as a somewhat subtle \u0026amp; inclusive thing to our own little community but they\u0027ve grown in popularity. Our Rust server gets upwards of 50 randos coming \u0026amp; going between wipes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI built\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/egee-irl/gsc-docs\"\u003eGame Server Containers\u003c/a\u003e to make it easier to create game servers on demand. Some of our game servers such as Minecraft and Rust are persistent and stay up for months. Other servers like our TF2 and Gmod servers are only up for events because interest wanes after a few weeks. GSC lets us create game servers on the fly and dispose of them easily when we are finished when them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\nIn 2016, I noticed that my electricity bill had gone up slightly and the ad revenue earned from YouTube wasn\u0027t quite enough to cover it. I decided to incorporate my YouTube channel and game server offerings so I could at least deduct the expenses and get a better idea of how much I was spending. For 2017, I had just under $400 in total anuall expenses related to operating the game servers \u0026amp; producing videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost folks don\u0027t realize it but, I\u0027m a sole provider for a family of \u003cstrong\u003e6\u003c/strong\u003e. As my channel and game server popularity grows, so do the expenses.\u00a0Up until 2018, I didn\u0027t provide a way for folks to contribute or otherwise support me and the channel. Patreon provides another avenue of support for folks who want to offer support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0027s Next?\u003c/h2\u003eLuckily for everyone, I really enjoy making YouTube videos, coding, and hosting the game servers and even if folks \u003cem\u003edon\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0donate, I will continue doing it. Donations and support provide a supplementary source of income to spend on hardware upgrades and general upkeep; utilities and such.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it\u0027s really up to you. If you want to see the channel \u0026amp; network grow, feel free to chip in a dollar or three. If you are cool with the way things are now, that\u0027s fine too \ud83d\udc4d.\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
