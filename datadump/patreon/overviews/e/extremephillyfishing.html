    "summary": "Since I was a kid, I have always loved the sport of fishing! More than that, I always focused on learning about different Species of fish and catching different types of fish. Did you know that there are more than 25.000 fish Species on planet Earth? Did you know that every year, about 200 new fish Species are described and archived? And yet, even in the angling community nowadays, the overall angler seems to pay attention only to the Species that he/she favors, sometimes even entitling other Species as \"trash fish\" or \"rough fish.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy objective is very simple: rather than fishing for just your average \"Bass\" or favoring a group of fish Species, I want to video and catalog whatever I can catch! I believe that there is no such thing as a \"trash fish,\" and that all fishes should be respected on the same level, for they have their own roles in nature. Despite of shapes, colors, and sizes, I am constantly exploring new venues of water and fishing different places in search of new Species of fish. More than that, I am constantly sharing the knowledge that I acquire with those who watch my videos -- where to fish, what is in there, what to use, how to catch: an educational approach for a better fishing community. That is Extreme Philly Fishing! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s called Extreme Philly Fishing because of my fishing style. \"Extreme\" because I fish without boundaries -- I am not bounded by a certain Species or a certain location. In other words, I am constantly going out there, exploring new places and catching different types of fish. \"Philly Fishing\" because I started my quest in Philadelphia, PA, USA. Note, however, that I was born and raised in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. And you should be even more aware that my family was originally from China (Qing Dao), migrating to Brazil in 1987. Thus, I am not only an angler, but also a multi-cultural individual with 4 languages at my disposition: Portuguese, Spanish, English, and Chinese mandarin. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see in my videos, I don\u0027t lack charisma. I don\u0027t lack the knowledge in the field of fishing and I also don\u0027t lack on my determination to accomplish my dream. What I do lack nowadays is income -- money. Exploring, fishing, archiving data, editing videos, writing blog posts -- those all take a lot of time! And as we all know -- time is a commodity nowadays, and it will always be a commodity in life (for our time will always be limited). Thus, to be as close to my dream as I can in this life time, I need YOUR help to succeed. I need your financial support to be able to go to farther places and do this for a living.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour financial support will be used for better filming equipment; thus, better quality YouTube Videos. It will be used for transportation costs, so that I can travel all around the USA and perhaps even make trips on the International level. It will be used for fishing equipment, for fishing is not a cheap sport. And more than anything else, I hope I will be able to reward you for your support by giving you GOOD QUALITY educational videos, where you will get yourself more acquainted with the sport of fishing, the different Species of fish in our planet, where to find them, how to target and catch them, etc. In other words, after watching my videos, I hope you go down there and give it a try as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, by being part of my Patreon community, you will be entitled to multiple different perks, which I offer from time to time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery contribution helps and not a single cent will be wasted. Your efforts and contributions will be reflected on my video production work -- i.e. my YouTube Channel. And, hopefully, I will be able to entice you in joining the wonderful world of fishing that this planet has to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTight lines and FISH ON!"
