Starting my career as an illustrator I worked for TIME Magazine and Philadelphia magazine, among many others. For a time, I was also creating art for a multitude of bands. Music art might be my favorite type of project, especially LPs, just because of the nostalgia that surrounds them. Another source of inspiration for me has been graphic novels. I did the art for one in 2004 and wish to return to the medium with my own creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy oil paintings have been in galleries across the country, not only in New Orleans but in California and Maine. Selling my work professionally is a joy. For someone to own a painting that I made the sense of joy and accomplishment cannot be beaten. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist, I am always inspired by the many facets of creativity in the world. Along with my paintings and graphic novels, I wish to make metal whales and sea creatures. These sculptures will be constructed from steel tubing and rods that I will fuse using TIG welding. The sculptures will vary in size, the first being very small. The culmination of this project is a full-sized 80 foot whale. I plan to sell these sculptures either in a galleries or along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd lastly I hope to bring back my skateboard company, Effigy Skateboards. This was a pivotal project for me that I feel never reached its full potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be adding and revising my goals and rewards as time goes, plus the addition of a video, so bear with me in this ongoing process. I thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

I have done everything from creating art for Time Magazine, CD art for bands such as Zao and Further Seems Forever, illustrated a published graphic novel, and even run my own skateboard company. My most recent and quite possibly largest scale endeavor is writing and illustrating my own graphic novel series, entitled Effigy. The storyline for my book series was hatched while running my skateboard company(of the same name) and was originally planned to coincide with the release of new board art. I hope to achieve success with the novel and bring back the boards. Many of the characters in my stand alone paintings are characters for the series and will appear over time, as either major or minor players.",
