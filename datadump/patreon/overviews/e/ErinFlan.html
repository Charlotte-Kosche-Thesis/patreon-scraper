One\namazing conversation with this mystery girl and then they would never cross\npaths again. Then this afternoon, he was rereading their conversation\u2014a\nsmattering of comments left beneath a video on YouTube of one of her\nfriends\u2014and he clicked on her name. She had mentioned the blog in another\ncomment somewhere. He hadn\u2019t tracked it down, just saw it there on her page and\nthat was it. He had found her blog. He found \u003cem\u003eher.\u201d \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Love in the Time of Internet?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat does it mean to be in a relationship when the couple has\nnever met face-to-face?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWill she really have dark hair?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIs she even an artist?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCome figure out with Hawthorn and me in\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLove in the Time of Internet!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Project\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSince I began writing \u003cem\u003eLove\nin the Time of Internet\u003c/em\u003e back in December of 2014, I have had the idea\nfloating at the back of my mind that this is a story that needs to reach\nreaders. Early on I latched onto the idea of releasing it chronically. I wrote\nplays that were produced in high school and I miss that connection to the\naudience\u2014of seeing people laugh and joke and \u003cem\u003ethink. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I may be too young to have firsthand experience with\nradio shows I am definitely within the age of TV. I have waited a week, a\nmonth, a year, to figure out the next part of the story and as much as the wait\nis frustrating it was worth it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI liked being in the midst of something. I liked having\nothers talking and thinking about the same things I was talking and thinking about. I\nliked hearing the theories and being a part of something bigger than myself. I\nread insanely quickly and I hate when books end. Stretching out the story,\nmaking me wait, keeps the world open in a way I love. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Project Release \u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOriginally when the idea struck I was enraptured by the\nthought of sending it out by mail\u2014people taking a few pages with them outside\nor to the bank, people waiting by their mailbox for the next chapter. I would\nstill love to follow through with this idea if money permits because mail is\nfun to receive and that joy is slashed daily by bills and advertisements. So\nwhy not make fun mail? Why not send out a story? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHowever if the money does not permit or even if that is not\nhow you like to read, I will be sending it out electronically via epub so you\ncan read it on your computer, phone, or other kind of reader. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBottom line: I want this story out in the world. I can only\ndo it in English, but I will mail overseas if you tell me how many stamps I\nneed in order to do such a thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eWhere You Folks Come in\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWithout readers I am dead in the water. I need your help\u2014I\nneed the brilliance of others. So become a patron. Invest a dollar. What\u2019s a\nsingle dollar in this day and age? \u003cstrong\u003eAnd\ntell me what you think.\u003c/strong\u003e Most importantly I\u2019m interested in your take.  I want you to talk. I\u2019ll be setting up a\nFacebook page for all this to go on. And hey if you have time I\u2019d love if you\ncould spread the word. Thanks and happy readings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eThanks!\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA big thanks\nto my little sister, Megan, and little brother, Mark for lending their artistic\nskills to my video and to my dad for reading the expert for me.
