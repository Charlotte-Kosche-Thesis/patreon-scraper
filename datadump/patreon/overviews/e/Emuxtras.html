Over time, activity and forum administration became neglected at Xbox-Scene, and the community found themselves under our roof. The EmuXtras team have taken emulation on the Xbox from a casual level to a professional level, by including tiresomely self-created \"Xtras\" which include Box Art, Video, VG Maps and Manuals, as well as an organized synopsis database. The goal of the EmuXtras community is to enhance the retro gaming experience starting with those still clunking the original Xbox around. While \"Xtras\" still are developing, Xbox homebrew and retro emulation has flourished at EmuXtras.net over the last 5 years. We haven\u0027t gone anywhere and we\u0027ve always delivered. Let\u0027s make sure we stick around forever, shall we?\u003cbr\u003e"
