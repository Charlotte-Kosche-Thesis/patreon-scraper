But we are losing the spaces available for small companies to operate in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis last year a number of prominent small to midsize companies in the community were forced to fold, downsize or merge with other artistic venues because they lost their space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAffordable space is needed.

We\u0027ve produced three full scale shows, launched our Education program, offered Wellness Workshops, received our first grant from the Multnomah County Cultural Coalition, and made close connections with local businesses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePhase 2: Operate on a year-round basis. (Currently!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to continue growing at a sustainable rate, we need to create the stable, internal structures necessary for operating year round.

(Future...)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the final phase of our vision, we will fundraise for the rental and renovation of our community building, the Enso-Arts Hub. Our goal is to partner with a for-profit company to assist with rising rent costs, and to attract foot-traffic to our space. For example, during day hours, a tea company might operate out of our lobby area, while classes take place in the theater behind. In the evenings, the tea company would take over Concessions for our productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE YOUR $$ GOES:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2017 -18 ANNUAL EXPENSES:\u003cbr\u003eArtistic Staff: $31,950\u003cbr\u003eOperating: $3795.99\u003cbr\u003eWord Elf Theater Classes \u0026amp; Camps: $4250\u003cbr\u003eTheater \u0026amp; Wellness Workshops: $780\u003cbr\u003eStudent Director Mentorship: $2600\u003cbr\u003e\"SHE IS FIERCE\" Staged Reading \u0026amp; Benefit: $465\u003cbr\u003e\"SHE IS FIERCE\" Main Stage: $10,922\u003cbr\u003eBenefit Performances: $1675\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2017 - 18 INCOME GOALS: (not including earned income)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFall Fundraiser (2017)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndividual Donations: $10,000*\u003cbr\u003eGrants: $5,000\u003cbr\u003eSponsorships: $1250\u003cbr\u003eStudent Mentorship KS: $1750\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpring Fundraiser (2018)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndividual Donations: $10,000*\u003cbr\u003eGrants: $5,000\u003cbr\u003eSponsorships: $1250\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
