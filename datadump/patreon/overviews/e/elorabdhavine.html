    "summary": "I\u0027m Elora, a forty-something year old daughter, sister, mother and grandmother.  Having lived in the same area my whole life surrounded by family, I am VERY rooted to the Pacific NW. In the last 23 years I have been in service to my family, my church and my profession.  I did it all with an open heart and felt fulfilled so much of the time.  As a single mom, I had created a safe, secure and loving home and community to raise my daughters in.  I also had a successful property management career.  My life was so good...yet somehow I was not singing my souls song into the world the way I was intended to.  So I found myself tired and restless and yearning for something I did not know how to articulate.  I felt selfish for wanting more yet I knew it was time to make a shift. Travel is a passion for me and connecting with other like minded souls through healing work, photography, art, music, essential oils, wellness and spirituality. Although I love to travel, I do not do it lightly.  I like my comforts, I like to be prepared for everything, and to have my gadgets.  So through a serendipitous meeting the idea was planted to take my creative and healing business on the road in an RV...AND that is what I have done!  I am just a few days into my journey as of this writing and it feels scary and exciting.  I have so much I intend to do...intend to see..intend to share...intend to BE in this next book of my life.  This is a perfect platform for me to share it all with the world, and to receive the support needed to keep going.  I am so grateful for life, for being generous, and shining my bright light in the world.  I hope to inspire you to step outside your comfort zone and be brave in whatever is calling you.  We are on this journey together and I am excited to hear from you.  Together we will support and celebrate each other through our laughter and maybe some tears.  Great BIG Blessings for your generous support."
