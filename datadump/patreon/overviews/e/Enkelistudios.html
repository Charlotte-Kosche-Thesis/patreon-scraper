    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eI am a freelance system designer and engineer, who also spends his free time developing Mods for Video games from Mount And Blade and especially Age Of Empires. But lastly the popularity of my work has taken me to take more time than I have. So I open this patreo for all those who enjoy my work and want to support it.\u003cbr\u003eYou will not be supporting a specific job, if not my work as a designer, programmer and independent animator, so your contribution can go both to a simple design and diversity of Mods and mobile games where I am currently working as well.\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution would help me to dedicate more time to this hobby and to be able to bring you with greater speed and quality diverse works for which you can be here. An example:\u003cbr\u003eRise of History, if I receive your support I can work faster in every civilization and therefore you will have new civilizations on a constant basis. Same with my mods for Mount And Blade or mobile games like Empires where I\u0027m currently working.\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my work and want to support me do not hesitate to do it, since that too would allow my work to become something bigger and therefore bring more people and be able to make a team dedicated to this alone.
