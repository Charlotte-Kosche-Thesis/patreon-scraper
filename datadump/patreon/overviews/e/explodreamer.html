I finally managed to upgrade my recording device and I thought that maybe I can start here, and share my videos on YouTube!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll I want is for \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79,129,189);\"\u003eYOU\u003c/span\u003e to enjoy watching what I enjoy playing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI fell in love with gaming a few years back once I started working and could afford to buy games! I kept telling friends who aren\u0027t familiar with gaming how mindblowing Bioshock is, how exciting Dishonored is, how mind-numbingly entertaining (this is a compliment) Assassin\u0027s creed is, and how I hate (and by this, I mean I love it so much) a certain Legend of Zelda mechanic changes in every game.. But it\u0027s so hard to explain with just words and gestures, and I decided:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003eHeck, I\u0027ll show it to you when I play the game!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThrough Patreon, I want to be able to upgrade my equipment so that I can deliver something better and even more entertaining. As this progresses, I want to be able to give back to those who supported me in any way that I can. All I want is for YOU to enjoy what you\u0027ve watch, perhaps change your mind about a game or gaming in itself, and join me as we have the fun of our lives playing games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003ePayment?

Barely anything.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos are on Youtube and my recording progress is really really slow, so I didn\u0027t think that it\u0027ll be fair for my patreons! Every finale episode of a series will be a paid content video. It\u0027ll be something that comes to you every once in a (perhaps) long while.
