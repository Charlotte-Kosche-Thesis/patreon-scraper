EGS is a comedy about a group of friends dealing with magic, alien technology, immortal beings plotting drastic changes to the world as we know it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you\u0027re here, you probably already know that!

I\u0027d like to bring it back, but It would normally be difficult for me to justify the time it would take to regularly create new EGS:NP comics. With your help, however, I\u0027ll have the ultimate excuse to have no excuse to not make more EGS:NP comics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...That was confusing. Bottomline: \u003cstrong\u003eFunding = more EGS:NP comics!\u003c/strong\u003e Check out the Milestone Goals in the left column of this page for details. Individual\u00a0rewards are below and designed to reward people while still ultimately sharing any new EGS content with everyone."
