    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eElsewhere\u003c/em\u003e is the world in my head. It is the space between, between the everyday and the extraordinary. It\u0027s a quest to to define reality as we want it to be, not as what has been handed to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create things that makes life more magical, that fosters enchantment, connections, and extraordinary experiences. I make artifacts, totems and environments meant to bring that glittery tingle, or a sense of mystery, or just pure enjoyment. I like to hide gifts in the forest and make treasure hunts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently my main focus has been\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.finderscreatures.com\"\u003eFINDERS CREATURES\u003c/a\u003e, my ongoing public art treasure hunt. I make small, sparkly totem creatures and hide them for you to find. There\u0027s an app and everything. Supporting this Patreon is directly funding an ongoing free art treasure hunt for all \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here? \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy reasons for being are to make fun, magical work, and to help guide the next generation of artsy folk. That\u0027s it, that\u0027s all I want to do. Make, and teach. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI teach and mentor as an adjunct professor at the Pacific Northwest College of Art, as well as privately mentor high school seniors to help them choose, apply and get admitted to art school. Being a young artist is one of the most confusing and harrowing experiences; helping them through it, helping them see how capable, how powerful, they are is one of the most satisfying things I have ever done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe things I make take a lot of time, a lot of material, a lot of work and funds. They don\u0027t create as much liquid capital as they take. I rarely price the salable items as high as they should be because I want people to have them, own them, use them; I want them to be accessible. I want these things to exist whether I have the budget for it or not.\u00a0I am hoping that the things I put out in to the world are worth something beyond the suggested retail price. I think the world needs this... needs magic and glitter and wolfibous, needs guides for young artists, hopefully needs me. I think this is far more important work than anything else I could possibly do, regardless of salary. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping that all this is meaningful to others as well, that you think I\u0027m doing more good for the world this way, that you might be willing to support and patronize art and glitter and magical goofy rainbow things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny way you contribute to this means the world to me. Whether it\u0027s pledging, responding to a post, sharing this page with your friends... you have no idea how much it means. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout your humble narrator: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make things. To the point of obsession. There was never any question that I would pursue art, and I have several degrees with the letters FA in them. I sometimes stare in wonder at my silly little life: I have participated in lengthy discussions on the difference between a Thing and an Object. I have defended glitter as a legitimate critical concept and defined a converted short bus as a magical otherspace. I have written essays on why My Little Ponies are, in actuality, significant and sacred objects.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy parents are very proud. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn art, there is a lot of pressure to have a \"thing\"-- something you are known for that you can promote and grow over the years. This is just good business sense. I have NEVER been good at this... I have been told I am not a good Capricorn. I love \u003cem\u003elearning\u003c/em\u003e. I love figuring things out. I love the high of a new project, of diving into research and total immersion in whatever I am working on. I am \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e good at figuring out how to make things (or objects).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Elsewhere:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElsewhere is the magical world that got me through grad school. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore moving to Oregon for school, I was living in the Bay Area and running a small clothing line called BeastWares, based on making anything that sparkled. I loved it and loved the people who wore my work, but the grind of dealing with full-scale garment production was draining me. I was both sewing items myself and locally outsourcing, doing all the photos, shipping, website, marketing, designing.... It was not sustainable and I was missing something creatively.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrad school was a whirlwind of work, creativity, critical thinking and madness. Best thing I ever did; if you\u0027re a maker-type, I highly recommend the Applied Craft + Design MFA.\u00a0Through it, I learned to distill what my work was about, to realize that it\u0027s not the medium that matters so much as the message. It didn\u0027t matter so much that I wanted to express myself in a thousand different mediums as long as I knew what my line of inquiry was. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Elsewhere was born.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I care about is magic, and wonder, and approaching adulthood in a way that retains the childhood readiness to be amazed and surprised. I care about making things that explore and express this, whether it\u0027s a plush of an imaginary creature, a magic traveling cloak, or a powerful amulet. Elsewhere is the word that kept coming up again and again... a connection to an enchanted place that is not exactly other, but is more a state of mind. It now serves as the name of my world, the banner under which I work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also a place with an open-door policy, so you are welcome to come hang out here with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOnward to Adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to thank any and all of you who read this. The internet is a beautiful, but loud thing, and sometimes I forget that when I was growing up I didn\u0027t concern myself with likes, followers, or my personal brand. I try to stay in that space. That being said... we need each other. I\u0027m not asking you to be another like on a post; I don\u0027t want you to be a statistic. I want you to be a patron in the sense of being a partner on this ride. I want to connect to a community, to share this world with others living their own scary, thrilling, painful, beautiful creative lives."
