I\u0027m an independent games developer who has been self-taught from the ground up and works in a variety of game-making tools, but primarily Game Maker, RPG Maker, Unity, and Twine.\u00a0I\u0027m currently working on several projects in various stages, and intend to keep making games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn terms of the games I make, the term I like to use is eclectic games - I don\u0027t like to constrict myself to any one genre, and experiment frequently with styles and I like to experiment.\u00a0My main influences are Masahiro Ito, Hayao Miyazaki, Hidetaka Miyazaki, Shinichiro Watanabe, Satoshi Kon, Hidetaka \"Swery 65\" Suehiro, Fumito Ueda, Hideo Kojima, Tove Jansson and David Lynch -which I think is a fairly good indication of just how far-reaching and anachronistic my games will be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still learning so the objective of this Patreon is to share my development process to help other prospective devs and to share my experiences with learning - you will be joining me on my journey and watching me improve in real-time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Pay? What do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon will primarily focus on detailed updates and blog posts revolving around all aspects of the game-making process from the early conceptual stages right through to alpha and beta testing. This means you get an in-depth look at the work that goes into making a game; including writing; designing and conceptualising to finished assets; soundtrack work; concept art and cut content as well as access to alpha stage demos and unfinished/unreleased content. In addition to an in-depth look at my game-making process, there will be essays on influences, games in general, and my thought process throughout all of this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also posts about playing and disseminating games from the perspective of a developer- what I learn, take away and notice as I play.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not like to put my content behind a paywall, so all basic content [blog posts, game analysis, update progress, devlogs, etc] is available free of charge in the various places you can find me- this Patreon content is, however, more in-depth and has a lot more \"behind the scenes\" content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to the games and Patron content I run a blog over on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://eclectia.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e. All accessible for free- this is just extra dressing!
