I\u0027m a plush crafter working full time and looking to expand my business!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e On Patreon I will be posting exclusive content and early previews strictly for patrons! Things you\u0027ll see will include sketches, polished art previews, extra work in progress pictures of my plushies, and early concepts of plush designs that I\u0027ll ask for your input on! Every so often I\u0027ll hold special offers for my supporters, and soon I\u0027ll start giving out regular physical rewards! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does the money go toward, you may ask?\u003cbr\u003eAt my current level of funding, the money helps greatly with monthly supply costs and funding new projects. I hope to raise more funding so I can stop worrying about life costs and start expanding my business even more! With bills and whatnot to pay for, this is a distant goal that I hope my supporters will help me achieve sooner. I hope to one day have some commercially manufactured designs that I can bring to you at a more affordable price!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you receive?\u003cbr\u003e- all tiers can view my patreon exclusive content including additional WIP photos, in depth descriptions of projects, previews, and more!\u003cbr\u003e- higher tiers can receive tutorials, patterns, drawings, and even small plush!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, any help is very much appreciated.
