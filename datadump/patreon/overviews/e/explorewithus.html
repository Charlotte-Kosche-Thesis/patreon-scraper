    "summary": "Listen, it\u0027s time to have a heart to heart ... \u003cstrong\u003ewe need your help\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe never wanted to start a Patreon. Asking you to donate has never been something we wanted to do ... I actually loath writing this, but we are at a crossroads with our channel ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you\u0027re probably wondering what the problem is, and the problem is YouTube and the advertisers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t heard, many advertisers have pulled their ads from YouTube, which means channels like ours are only making a very small fraction of what we were making just a few days ago ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me back up for a second and assure you that \u003cstrong\u003eWE WILL NOT\u003c/strong\u003e stop making videos ... that\u0027s not the issue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe real issue is ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo We Make More Or Less Content For You ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love making these videos for you, and we were hoping to start making two or even three videos a week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you have probably noticed, we recently started to produce two videos a week, one on Saturday, and one on Wednesday ...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen it happened, the YouTube advertiser fiasco...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe now have ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwo Options Depending On What You Do Next ...\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first option is you click away without donating. You like our content, but not enough to donate, and that\u0027s fine. We can\u0027t fault you for this. We never started this to ask for donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the majority of people do this, we will have to cut back to one video a week, maybe even one video every two weeks. I will tell you why in a few minutes. It\u0027s okay, but that\u0027s the reality we are facing right now ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eor ...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou donate a very small amount, say $1.00 per month. If enough of you donate even $1.00 per month, eventually we will make enough money to produce two or maybe even three videos a week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have over 6,000 places to explore and share with you. We can\u0027t wait to get out and see them and record them for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right more content, better content ...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you may be wondering ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Money To Produce These Videos In The First Place ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make these videos, we spend at least $500 per video. We have to purchase things like fuel, food, and we have to maintain our explore vehicle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention the fees from our editing software, music license, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, we can either go back to creating a video when we have the extra funds to do so, or we can product more and higher quality content that you love. The decision is up to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo click the Donate button and let\u0027s get this party started!"
