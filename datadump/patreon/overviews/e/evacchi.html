I\u0027m a 20 year old student illustrator currently living in London and studying at Camberwell College of Arts. I spend a lot of my time drawing cartoon fanart but I also sometimes illustrate comics: I\u0027ve drawn two original comics, both longlisted for the British Comics Awards, a one page comic for Leeds Thoughtbubble\u0027s 2016 Anthology published by Image, and a number of short fancomics. I also used to self-publish fanbooks (which Patrons will be able to take advantage of!!) but these days I mostly like to design fashion items and doodle to my heart\u0027s content. I\u0027m also currently developing an original comic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://iaqksg-db3pap001.files.1drv.com/y4mtpIVbeUMxiw5MSkYCKLNcJUM5z3zZIVryGFbfFnXZNgGjHgyBGvvi6TGeXp8Gq_YVXWivVaCeCDfEsVgbkWiMRocG3b1-GfSKB61pmz5j2MbhntZZaEXIAOs0eBom-QW8Nz2DQ_Ak3fQL_g1X174SjNcDmgC5QVW4C-h8lXY_n_I7dPjz3DuXwGWT_HEMdO_e8bfLvCfciBg_mWgECHXlQ?\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving in London is expensive! Unfortunately, as I submitted my transfer application too late (whoops!), I\u0027m stuck here. I currently make a living doing conventions around the UK and northern Europe but this is a lot of work on top of being a full-time student and also includes paying out a lot of money at once for tables etc. Creating work to sell is also a very different process can be quite restricting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://hy98dw-db3pap001.files.1drv.com/y4mTyRhT7bqk0RR8JEhxdY0rQ3XmnzfUPanj_aqT0AXHAvljjzTNHxtDlvlcH2A_BsuIXTBxgEBAEgHEy_b0G8BPhvcqw8RFA8sTZFCNEilgf5vbsDIA5soJX_i__JU-BNRf46oQp4iqaTeDYujhsBZUE4UjyOBr9H8qRncXQfhfOlDK2V2HvlrAM-n48APQnUTCNGbFpKed8_brnE53fRAHQ?\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like releasing art on the internet for free (weew!) and I love everyone who has supported me through the years, but with your help I can take my art even further!
