For the most part, we deal with game design, world building, fiction, and on occasion music. We have a number of projects in the works for release between this holiday season and next year. But for all our ability and effort we continuously meet the same roadblocks: a lack of art staff. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon project is set up for that very same reason. But for our Patrons, we have something more than helping us with our arts - we\u0027re going to offer you guys something unique. More than just insight and free adventures. More than just early releases of our projects. You\u0027ll get unique chances to help us with the stories, the creatures and the characters for our projects. We will also be releasing Patreon-exclusive adventures, Patreon-edition projects and bonus content during our Kickstarters and Indiegogo events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best thing about this is that we want to keep this in the hands of the average game. Most gamers don\u0027t have bundles of cash to spend on the games they want. With your help, we\u0027ll be able to create quality product for numerous settings and rules from between Savage Worlds, d20, FATE and so much more! This way, as players you will get the chance to \"play before you pay\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo what will you get out of it? Well, that depends how much you can donate to the cause! At lower levels, this will include video commentary, Hangout Livechats to play in unique games and you will get to vote on what kind of content we produce exclusively FOR YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you want to play a Savage World game wherein the characters are trying to escape from a prison ship? How about games in the Fallout setting? What if we could make a FATE CORE storyline focused on fighting kaiju/giant monsters? Or what if we offered a unique story using customisable rules that you helped in desinging? All this and more!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo please take a look at our Patron award levels and see if you would like to contribute. We\u0027d like to thank you for your time and your support - we can\u0027t make this happen without you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEiric Eadb\u00e1rd P\u00e1draig\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject Designer\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRobert Hertzog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject Coordinator\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMap Arts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDennis Stewart\u003cbr\u003eE.E.

The key thing is the name of my company - Haphazard Projects. We do a bit of it all. But in terns of this Patreon project, we are going to focus on all thing gaming. This could be comic books, RPG book reviews, responses to the Q\u0026amp;As we find out there. But gaming with dice is our main bit here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been in the gaming industry proper for 10 years, and we\u0027ve releases five game books. More would be nice. Our art department could use a huge 1up, as could our session vlogs and industry vlogs as well. This telling last bit is due to the face that we have no art department. We\u0027ve got our favourites who have expressed interest and a few guys doing concept art here and there as they can. And you know, as cheesy as it sounds every $1 helps. From helping out with my coffee addiction all the way up to improving/acquiring new hardware/software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo come along for the ride! Learn about all the ends and outs, ask questions - I love the sound of my own voice so I never get tired of hearing new questions! But narcissism aside, I love gaming. I love introducing new games to gamers who had no clue about suchness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"And may your days be Five Moons Bright\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEiric E\u00e1db\u00e1rd P\u00e1draig\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject Designer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRobert Hertzog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject Coordinator\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
