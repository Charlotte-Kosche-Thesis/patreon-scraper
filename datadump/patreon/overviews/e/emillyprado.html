    "summary": "It\u0027s no secret that the literary world and publishing industry are still largely homogenous. In 2015, Lee \u0026amp; Low Books found that within the world of children\u0027s books,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.leeandlow.com/2016/01/26/where-is-the-diversity-in-publishing-the-2015-diversity-baseline-survey-results/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e79% of the industry identified as white\u003c/a\u003e. And while those facts are alarming, the diversity in mainstream media newsrooms are, unfortunately, quite similar. Even as publications increasingly sound diverse, many of the editorial staff don\u0027t reflect those diverse voices yet. When looking at coverage of the 2012 election, the 4th Estate project found that\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://specialreports.4thestate.net/bleached-lack-of-diversity-in-newsroom-front-page-election-coverage/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e93% of front page print articles were written by white reporters\u003c/a\u003e. You might think that because that was six years ago, things might be different, but alas no. In the case of beloved NPR, their newsroom\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2018/01/23/570204215/nprs-staff-diversity-numbers-2017\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehas remained 75% white since 2012\u003c/a\u003e\u2014only two percent down since 2012.

The thing about freelancing is that I\u0027m not incentivized to research for long periods of time. Freelance writers are paid on a per word or flat fee basis. While some publications pay higher rates for investigative work, breaking into that niche of industry still requires me to put in hours of time without a guarantee of pay off. Staff writers are supported and can rely on steady income when working on larger, longer stories, but freelancers can\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I hope you will come in. \u003cstrong\u003eAlthough my work already focuses on uplifting the stories of folks from marginalized communities in music, art, and activism, I want to dig deeper into stories that still matter, but just require more time\u003c/strong\u003e.
