    "summary": "Hello everybody! I would like to thank each and everyone of you for checking out my Patreon page. In June of 2014 I started a blog named Everything Ham Radio. Why did I start it you ask? I have always wanted to write something and I love to teach. At that time of my life, there was two things that I was most passionate about, being a 911 dispatcher and amateur radio. Even though I had been a dispatcher for nearly ten years at the time, I wasn\u0027t to sure how well a 911 blog would go over, and I had been a ham for about 18 years so it made so much more sense. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with my mind set, I started my research. I looked at web hosts and other things that I would possibly need to start a blog.\u00a0What I found out I needed was:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings that would cost money:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eA domain name\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA web host\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSomeplace to host my email list\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThings that didn\u0027t cost money:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIdeas about things to write about\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhere to share my posts at\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLots of time to do it in\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA post schedule\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand a bunch of other small things to go along with it\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThe ideas came pretty easy at first even though my writing skills needed some work. But as time went on and the more posts I got under my belt, the better the posts became. I am still a work in progress, but I\u0027m getting there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA year and a half into my blog I decided that I wanted to branch out and start a podcast. I had listened to several different amateur radio podcasts and all of them seemed to pretty much be about the same. They were interview style podcasts with a different guest every episode. Which is all well and good, but it\u0027s really not the kind of podcast that I wanted, so I again sat down and figured out what I wanted to podcast about, recorded all my intros, outros, and everything in between and shortly after the first of 2016, I started my podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the podcast, came additional costs though. I now had to pay for a media host and equipment to record my podcast. Unfortunately, as a dispatcher, sole income provider and a foster parent, I couldn\u0027t afford much so I had to start off on the low end of things and I would really love to be able to upgrade my equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are my plans for the future?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, I would love to be able to have my blog and podcast pay for themselves. I would like to be able to pay all my hosting fees and afford some new equipment to make my podcast better. I would love to be able to do all this and not have any ads on my page or in my podcast. I think that both of them take away from the content that I want yall to read.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy absolute end goal is to be able to quit my \"9-5 job\" and work from home with my blog and podcast providing a full time income so that I can stay home with my wife and kids.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
