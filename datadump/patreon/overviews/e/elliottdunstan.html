    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGhosts in Quicksilver \u003c/strong\u003eis a biweekly-updating webnovel that launched on January 15th, 2017. Based in Ottawa, the novel follows Jamal Kaye, a would-be private eye with a chip on her shoulder and the power to speak to the dead, as she tries to solve a murder. In the process, she falls deeper and deeper into the hidden underbelly of Ottawa - a place filled with immortal beings, mind-readers and powers she\u0027s never known.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Elliott Dunstan, and I\u0027m a fantasy/speculative fiction writer, with a particular interest in dark/mythic fantasy, queer fiction and horror. \u003cstrong\u003eGhosts in Quicksilver \u003c/strong\u003eis my baby, but I also do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePoetry - especially poetry collections, zines, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBook and short story reviews\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFanfiction for Fullmetal Alchemist, Voltron, Lord of the Rings and other assorted fandoms.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eHow will your pledges help me with all this? There\u0027s a few different ways!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) You\u0027ll be supporting Ghosts in Quicksilver directly! GIQ is free to read online, but pledges help fund my time, which means more time to make GIQ the best it can be. It also goes towards potential merch, including physical printed copies, extra material, t-shirts, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Your pledges also fund my other projects, including crafts, poetry, etc.! I print and design my zines myself, and mostly make my crafts out of what I find, but in the future I want to expand what I can do. For example, I can pay an artist to design a cover for a book, or find and buy specific material to make a custom design for someone instead of making do with what\u0027s on hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Your pledges go back into the writing community! As an independent writer and editor, I want to collaborate and cooperate with writers, editors, artists and readers, especially other independent/crowdfunded creators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinks:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr: \u003ca href=\"http://gatesofmoonlight.tumblr.com/tagged/writing\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://moonlitwaterwriting.tumblr.com/tagged/writing\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNovel:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ghosts-in-quicksilver.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://ghosts-in-quicksilver.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
