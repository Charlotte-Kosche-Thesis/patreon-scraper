I am about far more that just making money by selling my own work. My artistic vision is inclusive rather than exclusive. I love this quote from Anne Bannister of \u003cem\u003eReflections Magazine:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u0027Devoid of artistic snobbery and without a hint of smugness, Emily takes huge delight in opening up to anyone who wishes to learn.\u0027 I don\u0027t just have the ambition to see my artwork hanging on walls and galleries around the world, I want it to take root in people\u0027s hearts, where it can give life to the great blooming force of creativity that wants to grow in all of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis alternative source of income will eventually increase the fields in which my artwork is able to roam: hospitals, schools, children\u0027s homes... Your support could help bring colour to people and places where it is much needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this isn\u0027t just about money. I also need your backing through the encouragement that your support provides. Your ideas will be listened to and taken into account.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in return for your support, I would like to accompany you on your own creative journey. Remember that there is no \u0027i\u0027 in community, OK, so there is, but it\u0027s surrounded by a whole bunch of other letters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become a Patron I will add you to our Patreon Facebook group where we can talk and get to know each other in depth. If you choose not to support me in this way, that is fine too, but I do hope that we can continue to connect in other ways.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

This amount of money would help me have enough regular income to be able to stretch myself out fully into my career as an artist. It would help me believe that my work has a future and would enable me to start to dream bigger dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to be able to do more projects using facebook live. I would love to be able to invest in better equipment. A better microphone and a better lens for my camera. I could start to buy more exciting art materials, which I could use for live demonstrations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money would also help me free up time to find new ways to interact with you all. So many ideas... I could do more live art classes for free... We could drink a glass of wine together and all paint the same thing... It would also give me more time to spend on the community art page, and to dedicate more time to each of you on the Patreon Facebook Group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have to turn people away who would like me to give art classes to the people who would really benefit, and people who would like me to paint murals for children\u0027s homes and hospices. If my income didn\u0027t depend solely on sales of paintings to individuals my creative vision would be able to expand in a remarkable way, I\u0027m not even fully able to see in which direction. But that\u0027s where you come in. I will remain accountable to you via this page, and you can help guide me as different possibilities open up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$650 is about \u00a3500. This would help me dedicate time every week to causes and people who I would not otherwise be able to help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce this goal is reached I have even bigger ideas and bigger goals. With a lot more support I could open a community studio, where anyone in need of a creative outlet could stop by anytime. Imagine how this could work with the homeless, with refugees and with recovering addicts. I could create a mentoring system that would eventually function without me, so I could go on and start up different projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour $5 might not feel like a lot, but if only 5% of my Facebook followers support me with $5, that would provide me with \u00a33,000 every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
