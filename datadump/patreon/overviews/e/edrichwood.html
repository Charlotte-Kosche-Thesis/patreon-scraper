Most of our most valuable art masterpieces were possible because they had some benefactors who had the vision and understood, that if the artist has to be worried about selling his art...then is not art really, it is just commerce!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what we are living now, practically all music is commercial. With internet there are not even record sales really anymore. So, the music industry is not really a place for art....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do believe that music should be done by the impulse of creating something extraordinary and beautiful, music is not a product to sell.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thanks to internet, a little donation of a group of visionary and sensitive people like you can make a living for an artist. You don\u0027t need to even have a lot of money, even with the smallest donations, the system still works. So, wealthy or not, you can still become a benefactor (patron).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour tips will change my life.
