That means that I also have to worry about paying the bills and keeping my kids fed. Between that and spending time with my family, \u003cstrong\u003eit\u0027s been tough finding the time to work on my music.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in.\u003c/strong\u003e I thought it\u0027d be cool to use Patreon to give those of you who like what I do a way to support me. It works like this: you agree to send me a certain amount of money every time I release a new video...it can be as little as 1 dollar, or as much as you\u0027d like. You can also set a limit for each month to make sure you don\u0027t go over your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on how much you pledge, you get some extra perks, like free song downloads, exclusive content here on the Patreon feed, guitar lessons, and more. Just look below to see all of the rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy adding your pledge, you\u0027re letting me know that you want me to keep doing what I\u0027m doing.\u003c/strong\u003e And the more support I get, the more time I\u0027ll be able to dedicate to it, which means more songs, more often!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
