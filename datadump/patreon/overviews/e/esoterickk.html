I\u0027ve always been very passionate about gaming and I \nlove to share helpful tutorials where I can, or just show cool things \nreally.\u00a0 But all I can say that any donations is incredibly appreciated and a massive thank you to those who do!\u00a0 They really are a massive help and it allows me to be able to invest more into my setup and help the channel grow too.\u00a0 In saying this, do not feel obliged to donate in any way, shape or form - but if you do choose to do so, I am very, very grateful. :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eEsoterickk\u003cbr\u003e"
