     "about": "Adam Sommer is an astrologer. One who is dedicated to augmenting your experience of astrology through playful words, inspiring podcasts, and hopefully, life changing readings as well. He has been practicing professionally for nearly a decade, working with clients and students all over this beautiful world. Trained and certified by Maurice Fernandez, he has used this sturdy foundation to explore many other branches of the astrology tree\u2014like Jyotish, Evolutionary, Archetypal, and Traditional forms\u2014but likes to find himself sitting beneath the tree, not solely hanging from the branches. By borrowing from many traditions and applying the techniques in his own life and the countless clients he has worked with, he has stumbled into what he calls, \u201cKosmognosis:\u201d A direct and alive relationship with the cosmos\u2014up there and in here\u2014which infinitely informs the participant with the most unique strain of wisdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.: My Intention :.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eTo be of great assistance to you and the rest of the Astrological world by helping spread the \u201cword.\u201d Astrology is not a joke, it is not just a science, a language, or some \u2018New Age\u2019 ego stroking system.  It is a \u003cem\u003emythic \u003c/em\u003emap which shows the myriad ways \u003cem\u003euniversal archetypes \u003c/em\u003e can show up in our lives.  It is not set in stone, and in many ways, it is impossible to describe. I feel Astrologer\u2019s belong in the realm of the Poets.  And for me, in all the work I have ever done with the \u003cem\u003eplanets and stars\u003c/em\u003e, it is most importantly healing to the Soul. This is my intention.  To bring deeper, more magical context to your life, so you can finally get on with it, and live the life you were meant to!!!\u003cbr\u003e",
