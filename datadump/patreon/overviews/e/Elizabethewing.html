I\u0027m passionate about people \u0026amp; surprisingly obsessed w/the color Orange. Traveling is huge on my priority list, which has led to quite a few surprising adventures. If we meet in person feel free to call me Beth, but professionally I prefer my full name, Elizabeth. I\u0027m active in my community and a huge part of my drive to serve comes from doing life with Jesus Christ.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWork:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, one of the biggest projects I\u0027ll be working on is an indie film currently titled; \"You can stay or you can go,\" inspired by true events. To follow along head over to the production\u0027s FaceBook page; \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/talleywags?ref=br_tf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/talleywags?ref=br_tf\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSummary:\u00a0It\u0027s a reverse narrative about a young twenty-something who could have had everything, die of a heroin overdose. The majority of the film shows how the the cycle of addiction affects friends and family. This will not be a feel-good, anti-drug film. You can expect a lot of truthfulness and interesting philosophies about life coming into play. We hope to encourage others to share their stories by creating this movie and understand what it\u0027s like for those who have lost a love one to drug addiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the rest of this year, as more projects will be happening after the movie, I want public accountability to showing up and publishing work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will feature:\u003cbr\u003e-Self-portraiture series\u003cbr\u003e-Films\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Writing\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportant Side-Notes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth good and bad things are happening this year, and I really don\u0027t know how else to continue growing without the support of my community. So if you have the means and want to support me in a tangible way, this is a huge and helpful step. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar adds up, but if you would to go above and beyond, you can pledge at the higher levels and then reduce when needed. If you see how hard I\u0027m working on the indie film and want to get me through it\u0027s completion (est. July) than great! Pledge $100+ and then when the late summer comes you can cancel or reduce to a lower tier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all my gratitude, thank you!"
