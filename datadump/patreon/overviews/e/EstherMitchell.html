I\u0027m looking to raise the necessary funding, through patrons like yourself, to be able to publish these books myself, and thereby be able to donate much larger sums to the charity or charities tied to each book.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have one book ready to go, at this time, and at least five other books planned, with the possibility of much more than that, depending on support and the level of funding raised by each book to be donated to the charities they are for."
