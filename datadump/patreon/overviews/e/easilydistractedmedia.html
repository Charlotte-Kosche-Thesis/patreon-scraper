Thank you for checking out my little corner of the big Patreon platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eTL:DR\u003cbr\u003eI like making a lot of things, my main goal is writing and creating stories that feature positive representation of marginalised people. Give me money and you get cool perks!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Aaf, though most people usually know me as gay romance author \u003cem\u003eRosa Swann\u003c/em\u003e, New Adult romance author \u003cem\u003eSkylar Heart\u003c/em\u003e, Young Adult author \u003cem\u003eEmmy Engberts\u003c/em\u003e or the girl who makes planner videos at \u003cem\u003eEasily Distracted Planner\u003c/em\u003e on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Easily Distracted Media?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEasily Distracted Media allows me one place where I can share all the cool things that my brain comes up with over time. This includes my written fiction but also things like non-fiction articles and books and YouTube videos. The name was chosen because I\u0027m very easily distracted, I\u0027m autistic and ADHD, so I often find myself working on multiple projects at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy current works in progress:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Rosa Swann\u0027s Omegaverse Mates World, serial with a new novella released every 2 weeks.\u003cbr\u003e- Emmy Engberts\u0027 Her Elysium and The Other Dress, weekly chapter updates on Tapas.\u003cbr\u003e- Easily Distracted Planner\u0027s videos on planner 101 for easily distracted people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been an author for the last two years, and almost all of that time and focus has been on the stories I produce under my Rosa Swann pen name, and while I love writing them, I have more stories to tell. Running three pen names side by side and trying to keep a YouTube channel updated is hard work and I\u0027m doing almost all of that on my own.\u003cbr\u003eIn the last year, I\u0027ve started to run into two problems. Firstly, keeping separate pen names is hard work, but doing cross-pen name promotion isn\u0027t always a good idea either because of different branding and fan bases (especially if you have no idea if people will be interested). Secondly, I\u0027ve been starting to produce things that either aren\u0027t sellable products (youtube videos or blog posts) or things where people may want to support me but where a system isn\u0027t as easily in place long-term (weekly chapter updates on Tapas for Emmy Engberts).\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027m pretty good at creating stories and things like that, I\u0027m really bad at some other parts of the publishing process. Gaining a steady flow of income through Patreon means that I can free up my own time to create more by hiring other people to take over some tasks, and this means I can use that extra time up for projects and ideas that I currently can\u0027t work on (for example designing my Easily Distracted Planner-planner or writing an Urban Fantasy book series) because of the pressure to make enough money to keep supporting myself financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, this isn\u0027t all about me, this is also about you!

The main features of these stories are LGBTQIA and neurodiverse main characters.

These are books with straight couples, bad boys, sexy times (yes, sexy sex scenes) and lots of emotions. The main features are characters who deal with more direct (mental) health issues like depression, anorexia and loss. They\u0027re a little darker and more gritty than Emmy\u0027s stories, but they still present a positive outlook in the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://rosaswann.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eRosa Swann\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAuthor of sexy gay romances. This is my main pen name and the main project I focus on as it\u0027s my only source of income currently. Most of the work on this pen name is mpreg books, so they feature men getting pregnant in a world where this is possible. For the last year, all these stories have been taking place in a single world called \u0027Omegaverse Mates World\u0027. The main feature of these stories is a focus on societal imbalances of (gender) roles in a restrictive society and characters who deal with (spousal) abuse, depression, loss and what happens when you don\u0027t conform to the roles society gives you. These stories have sex scenes and feature two or three men being in relationships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYoutube?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. I\u0027ve been running a blog for a long time (different blogs at different times), but when I got more involved with the planner and the ADHD communities I realised that blog posts\u00a0aren\u0027t everyone\u0027s thing. So, I decided to start doing videos of some of the blog posts to make them more accessible.\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCparXyHA8Wdp7UzEyhoVLQA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eEasily Distracted Planner\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e was born. I\u0027ve uploaded \u0027Plan With Me\u0027 videos, where I show how I plan my week, a planner unboxing video and the start of an \u0027Intro into Planning\u0027 series that I really want to continue. I\u0027ve filmed a couple more videos but because of time restraints, they\u0027ve not been edited and uploaded yet.\u003cbr\u003eThe focus of the planner videos is showing and explaining how planning can work for people who have ADHD, autism or other neurodiversities, or for those who just haven\u0027t found the right planning method yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow, that was a lot of text...\u003cbr\u003e"
