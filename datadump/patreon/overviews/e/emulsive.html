You pay in your local/selected currency but because Patreon is a US-based website, everything is written in USD. Your payment will be charged in your local currency but converted to USD.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e2) Will you have patron-only content?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYes. The goals (top left of this page), show what patron-specific content/stuff I have planned. I will ensure that any content that will only initially be patron-only, and will make it\u0027s way to the main website after a short delay.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e3) I don\u0027t have much money, how can I help?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s a $2 per month tier. It might not sound like a lot but it all helps. You can actually set your own patronage everything from 10 cents to a million dollars a month. If you would like to help out in another way, I\u0027m always on the lookout new photographic work, thought pieces and reviews to share with the community, so \n\u003ca href=\"https://emulsive.org/articles/calling-contributors\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejust drop me a line\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e4) Can I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYes of course.

EMULSIVE will continue to be an independent community resource. I will continue developing my relationships with the film and wider analogue photography industry and continue to build ties between them and the wider community they support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e6) Can you help me with something else? \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, absolutely.
