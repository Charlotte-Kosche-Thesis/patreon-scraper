The central theme of all my work is the unconditional love of God that brings peace of mind. That love lifted me out of a mindset where I was trying to prove my worth to others by what I did. Resting in God\u0027s love has nurtured me into a life full of rest and creativity,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMY STORY\u003c/h4\u003eSinging, painting and making music came naturally to me at an early age. I was playing the guitar and flute by the age of ten and was in choir at school.I had a dream when I was a teen - to do music and art full-time. I toured with a band in my teens and we had tons of fun..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eBut then, when the band dispersed, I chickened out.\u003c/h4\u003eNo one without the looks and the connections could get a record deal at that time. I gave up. But things are different today. Anyone with talent can create music and publish it independently.\u00a0\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003eAfter college (economics, not music, duh!) I got married, moved to Sweden and worked all sorts of jobs trying to force myself to make \"a career\" and prove to people that I was good at other things than music. I did o.k. but all the while I felt sad, depressed and approached a semi burned out state. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got back on track \u003c/h4\u003eThen, I started reviving my creative self again by getting back into art more and more. It was a way to release the stress I felt and a whole lot of fun, I taught art and multimedia at a junior high school for years. Eventually, I started a company where I painted art on demand using watercolours, oil paints, acrylics, graffiti and airbrush techniques. I could paint anything on anything you could say. It was fun and I still enjoy painting but that wasn\u0027t really my heartbeat either.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eArt was my way back to music\u003c/h4\u003eIn 2012 I did an art show called \u003cstrong\u003eSoul Steam\u003c/strong\u003e where I exhibited 44 works of art about the stress I saw crushing people in the workplace. I used all my various techniques to illustrate how stress feels. I added a song, a poem or an article to each painting to further explain the painting, illustration or sculpture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe response was greater than I had imagined!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The visitors encouraged me to record my songs, something that my husband had been nagging me to do for years. It took a couple of years to switch gears and learn the how to\u0027s and buy the equipment I needed. When the kids moved off to college I took the dive...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhen my kids started moving away from home, I got serious about music again\u003c/h4\u003eI had been writing music all through the years but stuffing them in ring binders. I spent the past few years learning recording, studying songwriting and music production and now we are starting to see the result. I am amazed by how this is coming together, how the\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I am just getting started taking back the years that seemed to be lost forever. They aren\u0027t....\u003cbr\u003eHere is a video of the change My Mind Project. It will be done this year. (2018), a little later than I\u0027d hoped but much better than I ever imagined.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Change My Mind Project\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypeAtEhx0uQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for being a part of my community.
