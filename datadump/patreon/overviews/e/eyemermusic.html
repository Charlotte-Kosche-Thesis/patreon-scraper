    "summary": "Hi There!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Sarah, a musician and illustrator from Belgium. This page will focus on my musical project \u0027Eyem\u00e8r\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you all probably know, trying to make it as an artist can be hard work and nothing in life is free. So for me, this applies as well. As a musician I always have something new to pay for, while the income is currently not that much. Apart from being a musician, I also study and that takes up a lot of my time too. Still, I really don\u0027t want to give up on my passion. That\u0027s why I am asking for help from you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you do, you ask?\u003cbr\u003eYou can support me and my work by becoming a patron! Let me explain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs stated on the Patreon site, a patron is \u0027someone who pays a few bucks per month to a creator\u0027. Your \u0027few bucks\u0027 help the creator to keep making what they (and you probably also) love! In my case, this is music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere will your money go to?\u003cbr\u003eWell, It will definitely be used to get my songs properly recorded, cause that\u0027s honestly a big cost. Other things I might use it for are music equipment, professional music videos, promotion of a song on social media, ...\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you as a patron get in return?\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your contribution:\u003cbr\u003e-You\u0027ll get a big thank you+ get early access to new covers on my Youtube Channel  \u2764 \u003cbr\u003e-I will follow you on social media  \u2764 \u003cbr\u003e-You will receive a private link to demos / finished songs that are not out in the world yet. Very exclusive  \u2764 \u003cbr\u003e-Let\u0027s Skype! We can discuss the meaning of my songs, or any song in the world you love. I can play you some music! Let\u0027s do this, would love to meet ya  \u2764 \u003cbr\u003e-I will send you a post card I made myself (the original drawing is drawn by me, but it\u0027s a legit printed-in-a-copy-center-card!)  \u2764 \u003cbr\u003e-I will write you a song. You get to be a part of my lyrics! \u2764 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eYou can follow me here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/eyemermusic\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/eyemermusic\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eyemermusic/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/eyemermusic/\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/eyemermusic/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind my music:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://eyemer.bandcamp.com/\"\u003ehttps://eyemer.bandcamp.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/68A1tXqAVvbSsXjZKklxwN\"\u003ehttps://open.spotify.com/artist/68A1tXqAVvbSsXjZKk...\u003cbr\u003ehttp://youtube.com/sarahdevreese\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
