    "summary": "Meet Nkateko Success. He is a smart, caring, and dedicated 7 year-old. I first met Success when he was just 3 months old. His mother, Mabel, was my colleague and best friend in South Africa, where I served in the Peace Corps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey live in the rural NE Limpopo province, where public education is free, but sadly, it is overcrowded, underfunded, and understaffed. They aren\u0027t able to provide their students with the necessary tools  to overcome the myriad of systemic social problems affecting rural South Africans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe good news is that Success is very bright--he received the highest marks in his village school--but he wanted more. Last year, in the first grade, he asked\u00a0his mom everyday to go to the school in town (private school) where they speak in English, because he said he wanted to go to college and learn to be a pilot. (South Africa has 11 official languages, but as English is the official language of business, a\u00a0person cannot hope to go to college or have a higher paying job unless they are fluent in English).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving long wanted to send Success to a private school, but without the funds myself, I started a fundraiser on Razoo.com to raise enough money for a full year of school. I am happy to say that I had an outpouring of support--we raised more than our goal of $2,500!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe has now completed his first term of grade 2 at the private school, and his teacher is constantly telling Mabel what a \"smart\" and \"hard working\" student Success is. He is gifted in math and numeracy, and while he is behind his fellow students in English, his teacher has no doubt that he will catch up quickly because of his persistence. Success says that he loves his new school and his new friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to ensure that Success can keep going to this school. I have two monthly patrons already to Success\u0027s trust fund, but I want to establish more. My long-term strategy is to have enough money in his trust fund so that we can invest it. That way, the need for constant fundraising will be lessened, as the money can start growing on it\u0027s own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cost of Success\u0027s school this year is just over $2,000 for the year (not including meals, school supplies, transportation, or uniforms). That may sound like a lot, but that $2,000 will literally change the course of his life. I am not trying to be hyperbolic--I lived in his village and volunteered in the village schools. At these schools, there is a shortage of teachers, an absence of books and supplies, and a sense of defeat. Classrooms have 50-65 students each, and often go full periods without a teacher. Students repeat grades multiple times, and it is not unusual to find 16 and 17 year-olds in grade 6 who still don\u0027t know their alphabet. And without an education in a rapidly modernizing South African economy, the cycle of poverty will only continue for these children.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEducation is not a guarantee out of poverty of course, but it is the only card Success has to play. Plus, don\u0027t all children deserve to have a quality education no matter what?\u00a0At this school, Success is guaranteed to have textbooks, reading books, computers, English instruction, and quality teacher time. They have a drama, arts and dance program, as well as a physical education program and their own swimming pool! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis school is a top-performing school in South Africa. They boast a 100% graduation rate for their 12th grade students. A top school in a rural area; a top school that is just a 15-minute car ride from where Success lives; a top school that is completely out of his reach without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider helping Success get a quality education. No amount is too small--$5 is enough to pay for his school meals for a week, $12 pays for his textbooks for the year. $30 pays for his transport for a month. $170 would pay for an entire term of his schooling (4 terms in a year)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd who knows? Maybe together we will raise enough money for more children than just Success to go to school! That is my dream. But for now, let\u0027s make Success a success!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
