It also takes up a lot of time, which makes it hard to juggle this with school and makes it quite tough for me at times. So, any amount donated is really very much appreciated, not just for the monetary value but also the feeling of support and encouragement I get, that there are people who appreciate my translations enough to donate money no matter how small the amount. The donations will keep me motivated and bring about translations of greater quality (i\u0027m still trying hard to translate better), and of course gives you guys early access chapters and extra regular chapters when certain goals are reached :).\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I would be able to support quicker translations and pay the editorial team. In addition, patrons will get extra chapters ahead of the translations along with adding regular chapters to be released. Thus, you get more chapters and contribute to quicker updates! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTranslating is a taxing procedure that can take up to six to seven hours between everyone involved per chapter. We work hard to ensure the highest quality of translations so that it\u0027s at a professional level. However, we all have full-time jobs and duties besides translating.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003eOur current goals:\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 1 ($500):\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a08 regular chapters a week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eTier 2 ($1000):\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a09 regular chapters a week\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 3 ($1500):\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a010 regular chapters a week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 4 ($2000):\u003c/strong\u003e 11 regular chapters a week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 5 ($3000):\u003c/strong\u003e 12 regular chapters a week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 6 ($4000):\u003c/strong\u003e 13 regular chapters a week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 7 ($5000):\u003c/strong\u003e 14 regular chapters a week\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re currently at 7 chapters per week! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tWhat is Patreon? \t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cem\u003ePatreon is a site which lets users make a monthly subscription to a specific product.
