I am here to create things that soothe me and the people around me, things that help me to cope with anxiety and reality, things that explore the natural world and the history of symbolism in culture. I\u0027m here to create things with magic, and things that help people find magic in the world and in themselves. I\u0027m here to use my hands to divine meaning from the moments in-between, from plants and rocks and water, from my ever-changing understanding of what it means to be OK.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53cecb94e4b0eb57e5fcb098/t/5907cdd92e69cf0188ce2c36/1493683677582/?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt some point in my college career, it became apparent to me that my passion was deeply rooted in my love of the outdoors, as well as my love of timelessness in the form of symbolism, earthly magic, and the creatures that make up this world we live in. I\u0027ve illustrated a full deck of Tarot cards (for my undergraduate senior thesis and for myself, something I don\u0027t plan to put out into the world) and am currently in the middle of working on a 70 card oracle deck (The Hollow Valley Deck of Symbols) that will use archetypal symbols from across cultures to divine meaning in everyday life and experiences, and to act as a guiding light for anyone in search of something.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also an avid zine-maker and printmaker, and use my illustration skills to design tattoos, band merchandise, logos, branding, and personal commissions of all kinds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see lots of examples of my work on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://erinalise.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/eerinalisee\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53cecb94e4b0eb57e5fcb098/t/5a8b0751c83025f59ad502a6/1519060823802/symbolbanner.jpg?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOUR SUPPORT MEANS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eI can create more, and more often.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI can put The Hollow Valley Deck of Symbols out into the world, in its greatest form, with all of the magical objects I dream of including with it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI can continue to grow as an illustrator with access to the time and supplies I need to do so.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI can focus more on creating larger, more long-term projects. Currently, in order to fund my art making, I spend a great deal of time on product development, order fulfillment, art booths, and shipping.

Each card will feature an archetypal symbol with meanings rooted in a wide range of cultures, pared down to its essential meanings but with a sense of depth to each card, allowing the user of the deck to more deeply understand their own thoughts and direction. My plan is to launch a Kickstarter campaign in mid-August 2018, which (if funded) will allow me to publish the deck, as well as a companion booklet, card layout cloths, and enamel pins.
