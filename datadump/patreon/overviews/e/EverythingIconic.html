    "summary": "Hello Beautiful People! First of all, thank you. If you\u0027re taking the time to look at this page instead of watching Bravo, I\u0027m eternally grateful. If you\u0027re here, you probably already listen to the podcast Everything Iconic with me (Danny Pellegrino). I\u0027ve been having the most amazing time creating the show. Hearing from listeners and talking to the celebs I love has been a thrill. I started the show back in late September of 2017 and I had no idea if anyone would like it. It has been growing because you all have been so great to tell friends and family to listen (even when my audio wasn\u0027t super professional). The support from you has made me work harder to bring you quality tech and content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve loved rising to the occasion as best as I can, but it\u0027s been financially draining. The cost of hosting the podcast, paying for a producer, paying for graphics, website hosting, and buying donuts for my guests has added up. I\u0027m trying to keep the show as ad-free as possible. That\u0027s why I\u0027m turning to you all. I want to continue to make the show the best it can be, and invest as much time and money into it as possible to make it even better. I have some crazy exciting guests planned for the future, themed episodes, my first live show (!) and more on the horizon. My dream is to hire another person to work on the show to help with scheduling/editing/etc., and to actually pay the person who has been making my kitschy graphics for free since the beginning.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, I\u0027d like to offer even MORE extras for patrons, but for now, I\u0027m offering a few rewards. A dollar a month will make me forever grateful for you allowing me to keep making the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $4/month donation (the cost of one cup of coffee, or a dollar per episode), you will be truly iconic. This will get you my eternal gratitude for helping to make the show a better show AND the exclusive monthly bonus episodes. This will be me, sometimes solo, and sometimes with my hilarious friends (and the celebrities we all love) talking about Housewives and the other reality TV/pop culture nonsense that consumes us. The bonus eps will arrive throughout the month. I\u0027m guaranteeing at least 1 bonus episode per month, but I\u0027m aiming for 1 a week. I don\u0027t always get to cover the shows we love each week, so the bonus eps will be an opportunity to really deep dive in some Bravo and will be a bit looser (because these won\u0027t be edited) than the traditional episodes. I\u0027m also recapping old episodes of #RHONY, and these recaps will be included at $4 or more per month reward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next level is $9/a month and will get you an exclusive bonus mini-episodes each month, plus the #RHONY recaps. I know it\u0027s the same as the $4 tier, but I wanted to encourage you to donate $9. That breaks down to just $1.80 per episode a month (including the bonus ep)! That\u0027s doable, right?!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next is $50 a month and will get you the bonus ep, the #RHONY recaps, the gratitude, and a video thank you/video shoutout of your choice from me. In the future, I\u0027ll be looking for feedback from you guys to see if there is anything else you want offered or would like the show to address. I truly appreciate all the listeners, and I hope we can all keep growing this thing together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, if you sign up and donate now, you will get access to the first bonus #RHONY pilot recap episode. Regardless of how much you donate, you will have access to the patron feed and will get to listen to me break down the very first episode of #RHONY with such gems as Jill asking Bobby for money to send her daughter to fat camp, Lu coming home with Aston, and Bethenny eating with Jason #1. This is a sneak peak at what the bonus episodes will look like, and it\u0027s a thank you for signing up!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you all. xoxo Danny"
