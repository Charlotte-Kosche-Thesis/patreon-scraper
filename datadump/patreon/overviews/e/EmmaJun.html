Here\u0027s my links and things so you know I\u0027m a real person.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://about.me/imagineemmajun\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://about.me/imagineemmajun\u003c/a\u003e but here\u0027s the short version... eer. Short-ish. Short like Michael Jordan.:\u00a0I make the interesting wordy stuff that goes inside of books. I\u0027m also a freelance translator in Japanese, Chinese and English too so I might translate books at some point in the future.\u00a0Unlike a lot of writers, I\u0027m also about the collaborations. My dream is to work closely with an artist to produce stunning visual and intellectual works that make you laugh, because we all need distracting from that big black void behind us that\u0027s trying to crush our souls (don\u0027t look at it!). So, if i can help with that, I will.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, I\u0027m tearing my soul apart to form short stories which I sell on Gumroad for whatever you feel they are worth. What the hell, it\u2019s only my soul, right? I aim to produce one every two weeks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a chance for supporters to subscribe and support me to make stories more frequently and better. You can provide feedback before the final release, get access to private blog entries and WIP progress reports and my strangely adorable doodles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing more than anything (well, maybe not boobs and certainly not long hair, but you understand figures of speech, right?) and I want to spend more time doing it and less time slaving for a pittance and lining someone else\u2019s pocket. That takes a lot of my time and even more of my spirit and motivation so with more funding I\u0027ll be able to donate more time to my stories, and improve faster and feel like I have a reason to live. That means more and better stories for you to enjoy!.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be able to commission an amazing artist to generate cover images and illustrations for the story to make it more appealing and captivate new adoring fans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a number of other lofty goals too, such as illustrating my novel for its final release, producing a regular web comic or two, and making animated videos as a writer. Let\u0027s save those until I start earning some money though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are kind enough to help me out, I swear I won\u0027t waste your adoration. If I make you amused, laugh or stop you turning around and gazing into the void for a while I\u2019ll be happy and I\u0027d appreciate your support or a share online as thanks. A share online or a word to friends in the really real world is as good as a dollar, but it all helps. So, if you can\u0027t afford to pledge money to my projects, just click on a share button and tell people why you like my work. I\u0027ll seriously love you forever, and probably cry into my tea too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, my lovelies!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
