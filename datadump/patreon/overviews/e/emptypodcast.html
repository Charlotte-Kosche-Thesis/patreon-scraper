Six colonists seem to have lost their memories. They find themselves on the other side of the universe and have to piece together the past. It\u0027s hard to do that when there\u0027s not any life in the universe anymore...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy we\u0027re asking for Patrons...\u003c/h3\u003e\nAs of right now, we\u0027re struggling to gauge just how invested our audience is in our story. To get an accurate estimation, we\u0027ve set this page up. If you like what we do, we ask that you be one of 50 people to donate a dollar and show us that what we\u0027re making is worthwhile.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re also paying for everything out of pocket. That means we only have so much money to spend. If we can get some extra money, we could make future seasons of Empty that much better. We also plan on making more great Audio Drama\u0027s, so other greater audio equipment would go a long way to helping us make them sound as good as we\u0027d like them to.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat do I get for donating?\u003c/h3\u003e\nOh fun stuff! No matter how much you give, we\u0027ll give you a personal thanks as well as access to the scripts! If you give our second tier $5 donation, we\u0027ll also mention you during the credits. Finally, if you donate to our limited-reservation $20 tier, you will get your name dropped someway somehow in an episode!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhen would I be getting charged?\u003c/h3\u003e\nOnly when we upload a real episode. If the Patreon takes off, we\u0027re likely to upload a lot of stuff. For now, we\u0027re just uploading the official episodes here. Once we start uploading other stuff, we won\u0027t charge a penny for that stuff. No, just the episodes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThank you for reading this far!\u003c/h3\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve read this far, we\u0027re confident you\u0027re interested in us! If that\u0027s the case, we\u0027re excited to have you on board to donate! Once we release our first episode, we\u0027ll take a look at those who donated and send out our first personal thanks! Feel free to give us to your frineds. We can\u0027t expand if you don\u0027t give us reason to.\u003cbr\u003e"
