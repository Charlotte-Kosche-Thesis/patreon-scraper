    "summary": "My name is Empress Kush.\u00a0 On top of making fun videos for you to enjoy, such as my internet show \"Beer and a Bowl\", I also rap, sing, write, and produce my own beats and am currently working on a long-awaited album, slated for release in 2018.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m not just an entertainer... I am a revolutionary.\u00a0 I focused on earning billions of dollars with my music and videos, so that I can redirect the vast majority of those funds toward various charitable and philanthropic ventures.\u00a0 I\u0027m changing the game.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn tour, we will always stimulate the local economy as much as possible by seeking small businesses for all of our needs. \u00a0For example, local merchants will be hired to produce limited edition merchandise, which will be sold only at events in that region.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, 10% of proceeds from each show will be donated to local charities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to use Patreon to fund my music and videos because of the monthly support feature, which as far as I know is unique to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003eEnough monthly support will allow me to quit my jobs and focus entirely on making music and videos to entertain and inspire you, as well as invest in new music equipment and software.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your ongoing support, you will be granted exclusive access to Patrons-only content and activities, such as my secret social media profiles (coming soon).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHERE IS HOW I WILL USE YOUR DONATIONS: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.\u00a0 Towards finishing my album and recording new music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.\u00a0 To invest in new equipment and music creation software. Currently, I am looking to purchase a new Apple laptop and vital software. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3.\u00a0 To cover monthly expenses so that I have more time to create music and videos for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4.\u00a0 To fund various organizations and causes that I support, such as bringing relief to the homeless (more details below).\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWHY YOU SHOULD BECOME A PATRON: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. I believe my mission in life is to tell the raw and uncensored truth about myself and my experiences, to give a voice to the voiceless and let people know that they are not alone in their struggles. Therefore, I believe that my music and videos need to be widely available, and I can only do that with your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Through the success of my music, I intend to fund as many charitable and philanthropic ventures as possible. My goal is to get to the point where I can give away at least 90% of the after-tax proceeds brought in by my music and merchandise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  3. One of the ways I intend to manifest this goal is by keeping my own living costs low. I see no  point in using wealth to acquire opulent earthly symbols of financial success. Rather, I see myself as a wealth distribution hub. Let my financial success become a vehicle for positive, progressive change in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome Goals:\u003cbr\u003e- Fund community centers \nin low-income areas, providing education and recreation for both \nchildren and adults.  These community centers broaden participant\u0027s \nexposure to arts, sports, sciences and business training as well as \ngiving young people vital training on how to be responsible and \nsuccessful in the adult world.\u003cbr\u003e- Care for the homeless population by \nproviding clothing and shoes, blankets, personal hygiene kits, food and \nwater, and inspirational materials.\u003cbr\u003e- Finance the building and maintenance of schools anywhere it is needed.\u003cbr\u003e- Always open to suggestions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no limits to the possibilities of what we can accomplish \ntogether.  I seek to unite people from all walks of life as \ncitizens of the Empire of Kush.  In this unity, we can pool our \nresources to provide inspiration and assistance to those who need it \nmost.  You are not just Minions, you are members of a global movement to\n restructure society within a culture of Peace, Love, Unity, Respect and\n Responsibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "Empress Kush is a name to remember.  Her stick-in-your-head beats and memorable hooks are meticulously forged in her studio in Los Angeles, where she writes, produces and performs her own genre-defying blend of hip-hop, pop and edm. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePairing soulful singing with edgy rap, Empress Kush\u2019s style is fresh yet familiar, catchy and cutting edge.  She bares her soul with a rawness seldom heard in today\u2019s mainstream rap music, drawing you in with fun, funky tunes and tugging on your heartstrings with bitterly honest lamentations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmpress Kush is most often compared to Eminem as a rapper, and with good reason:  The Empress learned to rap by studying Eminem.  As a vocalist, fans say she brings to mind Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani, Pink, and Tori Amos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn Christel South in a suburb of Los Angeles called La Crescenta, Empress Kush has been writing and performing her entire life.  She wrote her first piano piece at age 4;  as a seventh grader, she entered a music composition contest and was awarded 1st place in her school district.  Always multitalented, Empress Kush has starred in several musical theater productions and participated in many more.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last sixteen years, Empress Kush has honed her skills in writing, rapping, and producing her own music.   A diverse performer, Empress Kush plays \"just enough piano to write music\" and surprises you with the breadth of her vocal abilities. But it doesn\u0027t stop there: Empress Kush\u2019s creative skills extend beyond the musical realm, as she ideates and directs her own music videos as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmpress Kush released her first single, \u201cWe Smoke The Blunts\u201d, in 2014; but long before that, she started writing and performing under her given name, Christel South.   Empress Kush made her debut as a character in the video for \u201cOH NO, THE 5-0\u2019s COMIN!\u201d by Christel South, which was released in 2010.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Christel South, the Empress released two other official music videos, \u201cHolla 818\u201d (2009) and \u201cRock Hard Juicy\u201d (2011).  The \u201cRock Hard Juicy\u201d EP was released in 2012.  Her Youtube channel as Christel South attracts viewers from all over the world; you can expect the same from Empress Kush as she gets the ball rolling.  Her upcoming album, \u201cCrazy Bitch\u201d, paints a vivid picture of the life and personality of Empress Kush.  \u003cbr\u003e",
