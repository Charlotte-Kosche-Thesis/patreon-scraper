    "summary": "I was a\nteenager brought up on a diet of Video hits and television. I idolised pop\nstars like Mariah Carey and followed my parent\u2019s obsession with Celine Dion.\nGrowing up with a mother who had a pretty incredible history in individual\nsportsmanship I was always supported with my endeavours and encouraged to strive\nto the best of my abilities. Beginning with my primary school talent quest\nwhere my current best friend of the time disowned me because I wouldn\u2019t let up\nand let her sing the song that she wanted to and so in turn we went head to head.\nProgressing right through numerous Eisteddfod\u2019s eventually appearing on\nnational TV with a cameo in Australian Idol (at this time, I was only 16). I was\nbedazzled by all the same crazes, the fantasy of making it big, and a constant\nhammering of self-doubt and anxiety to be accepted. Still, when I look back on\nmyself one thing I do notice is that I had my own uniqueness. At 16 on\nAustralian Idol I wasn\u2019t your typical 16-year-old on Australian Idol. I was\nloud, outspoken, brash, boyish, and chose to sing Bjork\u2019s \u2018It\u2019s Oh So Quiet\u2019\nalmost taking the piss. I liked hanging out with the kooks, the wierdo\u2019s, I didn\u2019t\ndiscriminate age, ethnicity i surrounded myself with people who inspired me. I wanted to step out of\nthe norm.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI kept on\nkeeping on with performing arts well into my 20s finishing up a relevant degree\nat 24. Still I don\u2019t feel at this time I understood the purpose of what I was doing. I could\nembody meaning, touch my own heart and the hearts of others. I was a well-sculpted performer but I had no direction other than the starlight sold\nto me which became fickle in my late teens as I was jaded with most popular culture. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn London\nin subsequent years I found myself a mess. Goals seemed unattainable and I no\nlonger held the motivation for them. I felt bottled up. Trying to be something\nthat no one was entertaining. I had what one could describe as an existential\ncrisis and left. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA friend\nbought me a one-way ticket out. A world of creativity spilled out of me. I\nbegan writing a book that was prophesying my reality. I participated in the\nworld\u2019s largest fringe festival and I discovered a fringe of \u0027AWOL\u0027ers\u0027 just\nlike myself living in communities on the periphery. I witnessed government and\ncorporate audacities inflicted upon people who have abandoned capitalism\u2019s\nluxuries for a devotion to purity in ideals.
