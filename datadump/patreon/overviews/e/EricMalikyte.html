First, Patreon is based on the old idea of patronage, where wealthy individuals would become the patron of an artist or writer so they could do what they do best, create. Except, Patreon is even better than that, because it connects you directly with the people who are creating the products that you love. You\u0027ve probably heard of Kickstarter, right? Patreon works a bit differently in that instead of funding just a singular project, you\u0027re contributing a smaller amount regularly (per story), and receiving an exclusive membership to content that you either get to see first, or, content that no one else but patrons get to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for where your money will be going. As a writer, I need to hire editors and beta readers\nin the continued production of my books, there\u0027s also the subscription to various services and magazines that help to inform me about various things that are happening in related markets to my genre. I\u2019m also working on a website, and I\u2019ve\nalready paid for the domain and web hosting, I\u2019ve had to hire a web designer as\nwell. Your money goes towards paying for these things and making the stories I\nrelease here better and better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE BOTTOM LINE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat being said; the first story is already ready to go. It\u2019s\ncalled \u201c\u003cem\u003eTo Dance on Her Digital Strings\u003c/em\u003e\u201d, and it\u2019s about a society that\u2019s\nentirely controlled by an AI called Aurora, where the citizens of this society\nare nothing more than mere playthings, and one woman\u2019s attempt to change things\nafter she finds herself on the wrong side of Aurora\u2019s attention. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag49/DNova1202/To%20Dance%20on%20Her%20Digital%20Strings%20Cover%20Low%20Res_zpsp18fnyts.png\" style=\"width: 295px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u2019ll join\nme for it, and many other stories to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Eric Malikyte\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll stories featured on this Patreon are the property of Eric Malikyte.
