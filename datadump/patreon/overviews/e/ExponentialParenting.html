    "summary": "I\u2019d like to start a conversation about exponential parenting. In other words, knowing that emerging technologies are progressing exponentially how do we prepare our children to live a meaningful, fulfilling life in the future - in case of a 6 years old that\u0027s 12-16 years from today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote that I\u2019m not saying \u201csolving education\u201d... that is an even broader larger problem. Though the two are related I\u2019m not focusing on access to education, inequality etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPeter Diamandis explored this topic too and as a starter I would suggest to read up on his thoughts if you haven\u2019t already.\n\u003ca href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2016/11/14/overhauling-how-we-teach-our-kids-in-a-world-of-accelerating-change/\"\u003esingularityhub.com/2016/11/14/overhauling-how-we-teach-our-kids-in-a-world-of-accelerating-change\u003c/a\u003e\nand in the Exponential Wisdom podcast episode 39.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEinstein said (and I\u2019m paraphrasing): if I had an hour to solve a difficult challenge I would spend 55 minutes asking the right question because once I had the right question I know I can find the answer in the remaining 5 minutes time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI find that our public education system is not even asking the right questions.\nJust three thoughts provoking notes there, to show how bad it is: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Montessori method - considered still modern - is over a hundred years old.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSir Ken Robinson (and his publisher) has launched the third edition of the book Out of Our Minds.\nThe interesting thing to me is that the first diction came out about 17 years ago, in 2001. So what changed since then? I\u2019m afraid, not much.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTED prize winner Sugata Mitra with his \u201cschool in the cloud\u201d work is basically saying it\u2019s better to ask kids a great question and leave them be. Yes, often doing nothing would produce better results than what is being done in education today.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eMeanwhile- as you know - technology is advancing ever more rapidly. The rate at which humanity acquires knowledge is increasing exponentially. \nOne day not too far from today AI will mature and it will be immoral not to have your kids be taught by an AI. If we futurists are correct about the timeline... then today\u2019s kids might be the last generation, the last class, who will be taught by humans all the way through K12. How crazy (in a good way) is that?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\"I\u2019m also certain that 99.999% of humanity doesn\u2019t understand or appreciate the ramifications of what is coming.\" - Peter Diamandis\u003c/blockquote\u003e \n\nI agree. Based on my own conversations parents who care and have the means to augment their kids schooling focus on \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ebetter grades, tutoring\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esecond language\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esports\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emusic, dance\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecreative arts\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eusually in this order.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my opinion teaching kids to code, building LEGO robots or maker education is also a narrow view.\n\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main values of Singularity University and Peter Diamandis\u0027s Abundance community is the cognitive framework to think about the future, the progress of technology and to anticipate change.\n\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of what I called \u201cexponential parenting\u201d is to apply this framework to the raising and education of kids. Not someone else\u2019s kids. My kids and your kids.\n\nIf this is something that resonates with you, interests you, something that you are working on then I\u2019d love to connect.\nLet\u2019s start with a brainstorming of what are the right questions to ask when rethinking how we educate our children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
