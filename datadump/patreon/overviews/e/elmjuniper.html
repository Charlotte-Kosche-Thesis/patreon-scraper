Dabble meaning spend 90% of my free time to bring you fanfiction and fanart you\u0027ll love. If you like my art and writing and want me to\u00a0be able to continue focusing my efforts on art for all things nerd, consider supporting me here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I work full time and only have so many hours left to work on my 3D and writing on, my aim is to finish 2 images each month. \u00a0This number can however vary and may be less may be more, though no more than 4 images per month. Because of this you will be supporting me per image instead of per month or per week. This means that if I post fewer images one month, it costs you less. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy don\u0027t I have any patron-only pictures? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI\u0027ve always loved creating things that evoke emotions or feelings in whoever sees or reads my work.
