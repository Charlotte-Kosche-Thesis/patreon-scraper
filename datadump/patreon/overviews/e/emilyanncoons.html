    "summary": "My name is Emily-Ann Coons, also known as \"Sureen Ink\", and I\u0027m trying to raise money to help me out in my daily life. At the moment, I make about $500 a month working in fast food, but I also have about $16,000 worth of medical bills that keep demanding me to pay them. Unfortunately, with my current $400 a month in other bills (food, power, internet, etc.) I can\u0027t exactly afford to pay those bills. As well, I write stories and have artists who draw me webcomics that I write for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money will go to helping to actually pay those artists who currently receive nothing for their hard work, as well as helping me to pay my medical bills. My artist friends have offered to help out as well by offering different benefits (such as requests, access to sketches, lineart, etc.) to anyone who donates. So, any donations would be greatly appreciated, and would be met with joy and thanks! As well, if I can raise enough, I might even be able to start paying some people to start programming a video game I have in mind!\u003cbr\u003e"
