My desire has been to form a community that is welcoming to all, helpful, and a great community to be a part of. Several years later and the community is still growing! I am amazed by all of the awesome support and friends I have come to make on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks to the dedicated community on my channel as well as my wife, family, and insomnia, I am close to turning this awesome hobby into a career. Patreon will hopefully become a stepping stone to launching this into a full time career as a content creator. How does this help you? I will be able to have more time to release high-quality videos for all your favorite games! \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,89,0);\"\u003eWhy do I need your help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI am trying my hardest to turn Youtube and Twitch into a full time job. I currently work another job as a full time computer administrator. Given I basically work two full time jobs with Youtube and my other job, I am working roughly 60+ hours a week splitting my time between the two jobs, which can be very challenging to balance my time between them and making sure I have enough time to spend with my family. My dream and goal is to become a full time Youtuber and Twitch streamer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I am able to do nothing but Youtube and Twitch, I will have more time to produce longer, higher-quality, better edited videos of your favorite games with more games to come. By becoming a patron with a monthly pledge, you will be helping me to bridge the gap between what I need financially to become a full-time content creator, help pay off those pesky student loans, and provide stability during the inconsistent times that Youtube sometimes presents revenue-wise. You would be giving me the ability to bring new, exciting, and higher quality content every single day as well as stream more often on Twitch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCheck out the Milestone Goals on the left to see what things you could potentially help me with and the new projects I could start with the combined pledges here on Patreon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,89,0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatron Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eTo become a Patron, you can pledge any of the amounts you would like below.
