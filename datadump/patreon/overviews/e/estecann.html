    "summary": "Thank you so much for being here, and for your support. I could never do this without you. Thank you for creating the space for me to be my fullest, truest expression - so I\u0027m able to contribute to the world the song that\u0027s in my heart.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an artist, fashion model, singer-songwriter, traveller, creator. I\u0027m a trained coach too - I coached about 2000 people to make their lives better. Now it\u0027s my turn.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI was born in socialist Hungary and ate bread and butter 6 days a week until uni, where I studied philosophy because my mom said so, though I wanted to study music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCompared to where I come from, I\u0027ve done quite well for myself. Surviving in London alone, with no one to fall back on....- and it\u0027s been difficult - sometimes until this day I struggle to pay the rent; so maybe now you see just how much it means to me to be able to be here, stop surviving alone, and be able to just be who I am and give what my heart is so eager to give to the world - with your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
