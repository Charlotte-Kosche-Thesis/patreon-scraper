My name is Leif Gifford and I am the proud Founder and Editor-in-Chief of ENBY Magazine. I identify as the non-binary gender neutrios (they/them pronouns, please!) I am white and able-bodied. I understand and recognize that the above give me immense privilege, even within my community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been in love with print media all of my life. I was a bookworm as a kid, and still am. Newspapers, magazines, and zines adorn my room. I started contributing to \u0027zines when I was 14-15. I\u0027ve written for \u0027zines in Glasgow, Scotland, as well as Toronto. I\u0027ve written on a few blogs, too (all of which are now inactive).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a passionate, driven person dedicated towards strengthening and creating more awareness within our North American non-binary community through print.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what is ENBY Magazine?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eENBY Magazine was originally made by and for Canadians, but given the political climate and just logistically, we have expanded our scope to all of North America. In 2017, we will likely only be able to create one or two more issues of the magazine, but in 2018, we hope to be a tri-annual publication for good.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eENBY is a great place for writers, artists, poets, and all-around great enbies to come together and share parts of their lives with each other. We ask for submissions from people all around the continent, who come from a variety of different backgrounds. We strive to represent as best we can the diversity of our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIssue #1 launched on December 15th to great success! Many enjoyed the amazing content within its 32 pages. We hope to make Issue #2 even bigger with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope that our magazine might empower non-binary individuals to be proud of their identity and love themselves a little more, even if it\u0027s tough sometimes, and to know they don\u0027t need to fit into a stereotype in order to be valid and loved. ENBY is a hug in print form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m an cis/binary trans/LGBQA+/straight ally. Can I support this project?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely! Many allies (however they fit into the LGBT community or not) are lining up to buy magazines and subscriptions. Much like a person who does not identity as female would like to read feminist magazines or other publications, ENBY serves as a way of looking into our identity\u0027s culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe encourage allies to purchase and support our magazine. Not only can you/they become more aware about things like pronoun usage, definitions, gender expression, identities, and non-binary culture, but it can also help others (like friends, family members, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re expecting ENBY Magazine to be a Non-binary 101 resource, however, you\u0027ve come to the wrong place! We don\u0027t exist to serve as an educational resource for those outside of the community. For that stuff,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant\u0026amp;ion=1\u0026amp;espv=2\u0026amp;ie=UTF-8#q=what%20is%20non-binary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econsult other resources online\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy fund stipends?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur real end goal of this Patreon is to fund stipends for our contributors, who will be on contract to create high-quality work for our magazine (and perhaps, in our future, a blog of sorts). In the LGBTQ+ community, many individuals come from low-income backgrounds, are between jobs, or could really use some extra cash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides, if we kept making this a volunteer gig, conversations with artists/ writers we work with might turn out like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pics.onsizzle.com/we-cant-pay-you-but-the-exposure-will-be-great-2946327.png\" style=\"width: 373px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know that our contributors will be grateful that their work is valued enough to be paid.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can I get involved with ENBY Magazine?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you a non-binary or questioning North American? Then you can get involved in ENBY Magazine as a contributor!

Is that okay?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not the amount that you give. It\u0027s the purpose behind it that really makes the impact. If everyone who came onto our Patreon page donated one dollar an issue, it would still make us here at ENBY feel like we\u0027re really making a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.
