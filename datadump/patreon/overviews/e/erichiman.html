With your help, the song can come to life visually as much as it has musically.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs an independent musician, the money I make on the road goes to two things: bills (so I can live,ha) and right back into music (graphic design, printing posters, gas money, band pay, tolls, hotels, music videos, etc). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe help and money I received for my latest release, GRACEFULLY, let me put together THE BEST sounding record of my career. That music has led to opening shows for Leon Russell, Patty Griffin, Edwin McCain, and more (even my musical idol, Ani DiFranco, said she was impressed with it, WHAT?!!). \u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027d like to do more. To bring those same resources and to create the best looking videos of my career; starting with songs from GRACEFULLY. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron is totally optional.
