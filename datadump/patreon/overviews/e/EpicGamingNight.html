We then quickly started a podcast so we could share our love and stories about gaming. The podcast has grown and we have been able to have amazing guest like designers, publishers, and media personalities from all over the board game industry! It has been awesome to see more people excited about the podcast and to see our weekly downloads consistently grow. Our favorite part is being able to interact with all of our listeners from all over the world! With the help of an awesome friend, Roy was able to contribute to some of The Dice Tower variety shows like \"Board Game Blender\" and \"Throat Punch Lunch\" for over a year now. In October 2016 we started \"Favorite Game Friday\" on Instagram with a lot of awesome contributors from the Instagram community. It has been a great way for up and coming board game enthusiasts to share their diverse love of board games. Roy started making video reviews on The Dice Tower in December 2016 (with the help of Rob in some reviews as well). The goal was to make short high energy reviews that showcase the components, appearance, and our thoughts on a game! \"Favorite Game Friday\" has also been picked up by The Dice Tower and thousands of viewers look forward to it every week! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will the money be spent?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBills - such as software subscriptions and website fees.\u003cbr\u003eEquipment - Upgrading audio and video equipment. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGame of the Quarter/Month - When we reach this goal, patrons will vote on an game each Quarter/Month that we will buy, play, review, and giveaway!\u003cbr\u003eCon Coverage - Cons cost money but are a huge deal in the industry!
