Our goal is making the best videos with music, helping composers (both the famous and the new \u0026amp; upcoming) to promote their work, and building this epic community. \u003cbr\u003eThere are 2 kinds of big project we do which always receive a lot of support and appreciation: Epic Cinematic (movie \u0026amp; music mixing, fan-made trailer, cross-over videos...), and Epic Music Mix (long-hour videos of music playlist with specific theme, for specific uses).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Why do we need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe are a team working on different tasks of video-making and related stuff. This costs money, and a huge amount of time. We have bills to pay, so that team members can work full-time with their best effort. We need\u00a0to pay for video materials and new equipment - as you all know, video-making requires high-end PCs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, we have permission from some brands and composers to use their music in our videos. This is good, thank all of them very much, but if we can pay them fairly, it\u0027s better. If so, we can even manage to release a downloadable audio-only version of music mix for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy helping us, you\u0027ll also help to support the composers and expand the Epic Music community, which is rather small right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e How do you help us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can choose to pledge\u00a0some money and receive rewards as shown on the right column of this page. Thank you very much for that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support more, go for higher pledges! Anything is appreciated, you\u0027re all amazing. Plus, you\u0027ll get amazing rewards! :D But please do not feel obliged to give us money. To have you as a fan is our great happiness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will make the most of what we can manage and afford, to bring you the best rewards.
