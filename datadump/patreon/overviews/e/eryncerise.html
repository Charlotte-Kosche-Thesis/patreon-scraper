    "summary": "Hey there one and all! My name is ErynCerise, and I\u0027ve been making YouTube videos regularly for about five years now. I\u0027m most well-known for my Love Live! School Idol Festival tutorials and scouting videos, and more recently I\u0027ve started a new project that combines my love of academic media writing, anime history, and cute floofiness -- \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMahou Profile: A History of Magical Girls\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. This Patreon campaign mainly supports that project, as well my \u003cstrong\u003eLove Live scouting videos\u003c/strong\u003e, the \u003cstrong\u003eSunshine Sunday podcast\u003c/strong\u003e, and possible future endeavours including my \u003cem\u003e~mysterious top secret waifu project~\u003c/em\u003e :o\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMahou Profile \u003c/em\u003eaims to chronicle the entire history of the Japanese magical girl genre, show by show, in chronological order. There will also be a good deal of general anime history thrown into the mix, as well as reviews of each show and discussions of related topics such as feminism and depictions of gender in media. So if that\u0027s your bag, then please consider throwing a couple bucks my way! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to try and do this full time and make more videos more frequently for everyone. Even if that doesn\u0027t happen though, the extra support really does help with my monthly expenses. Your support will also help give me wiggle room to save for certain things I need like, say, a computer that\u0027s isn\u0027t pushing a decade old! \ud83d\ude05 In exchange, you can get cool stuff like early access to videos, research and viewing notes for \u003cem\u003eMahou Profile\u003c/em\u003e, your name in the credits, promotion for your own videos or art, or even full video commissions from me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent avatar art in videos, banners, and other channel art by Olivine Arc: \u003ca href=\"https://listography.com/olivinearc?m=0580652416\"\u003ehttps://listography.com/olivinearc?m=0580652416\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTitle card art for Mahou Profile by Onsta: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/OnstaMonsta\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/OnstaMonsta\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
