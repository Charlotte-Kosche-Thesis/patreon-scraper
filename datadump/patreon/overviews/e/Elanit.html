    "summary": "Get access to my Elder Care Focused Research at Columbia School of Social Work, cool t-shirts and a GRAND PRIZE of tickets to a ROCKIN\u0027 Dance Art Graduation Party as I research Non-Attachment Therapy and complete my Master\u0027s Degree. My first career is in large-scale art installations and parties so it promises to be good. The research asks whether Non-Attachment Therapy (NAT) for Present Tense re-empowered living can alleviate the known depression of late-stage frail seniors. NAT is available to any age group and the philosophy behind the method is addressed by the books: The Bucket and The Stone \u0026amp; Stitches for Seniors both available on Amazon. My life and job experience include Therapeutic Recreation Director at both Skilled Nursing and Assisted Living facilities, Senior Living Memory Care Director and Home Care Outreach Director. A graduate of New York University, I began my practice of non-attachment and minimalism as a teenager. My work has been covered nationally and internationally including full features on CNN, in the NY Post and Italian Glamour among others. Linkedin.com/in/elanit/ Vimeo.com/2872058 Remiculture.com"
