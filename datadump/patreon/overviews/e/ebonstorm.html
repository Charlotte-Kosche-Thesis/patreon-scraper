Sufficient to allow me to work full-time as a writer.

Life was good. I had a great job with an amazing team of technologists who worked with me and there was no better life to be had. Then the Great Reset a.k.a. The Great Recession happened. In the Bay Area, this meant being over the age of 30 meant technology jobs were no longer for you unless you had an extremely narrow set of skills (programmer, developer).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust like that, I became marginally employed and within six months as companies folded all over the country, my long-term period of employment drew to a close. I worked for nearly thirty years in a variety of corporate offices, but the climate had changed drastically. Youth became the currency of the day. A trip to Facebook showed me only the young seem to have jobs in technology corporations these days.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was undeterred. I found other work but then the second half of the Great Reset became apparent. The kind of pay I used to make simply wouldn\u0027t happen any time soon. I resigned myself to this new state of affairs and sallied forth.\u00a0However I had no idea what it would be like to raise my son without the benefit of my previous salary. However, the upside became apparent. I would get to spend FAR more time with my son and this turned out to be of great benefit to him, since none of the therapists we worked with were having much luck with his autism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy son has progressed greatly from those early days, thanks to having so much time to spend with him. Losing my ability to find IT work became an opportunity to train my son at a level I never could have paid for if I had a job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of being a diaper-wearing, barely literate, barely speaking individual whose emotional range was, by my doctor\u0027s estimation, would be similar to a bowl of plastic fruit, my son, Kimahri is warm, friendly, intelligent, quirky and yes, still autistic. He attends a school which makes accommodations for him while he mainstreams as part of the standard education. He plays a clarinet, excels in math and sciences, hates history and English (because of the lack of structure) and he is working on his first foreign language, Chinese.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnbeknownst to me, the turn of fortune which cost me my career, helped me raise my son to have a life far greater than any of his doctors had predicted. We are not out of the woods yet. He is now in his school and with work becoming more challenging to find, I have resorted to participating in the Algorithmic Economy (or the gig economy, depending on where you live). This has proven to be both educational and challenging often in equal measure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWORK INSTABILITY\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUltimately, the gig economy is unsustainable. What makes it worse is I write articles on this very subject.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Gig Economy is driven on paying workers less each year for the same amount of work. Since the turnover is so high, few participants notice the reduction in pay each year. I noticed it because I have been a driver for Uber for three years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTraffic in the Bay Area is literally some of the worst traffic in the United States. Rush hour lasts for four hours and by the time it clears, it\u0027s time for the return trip. Driving is more dangerous and more unpredictable. I have driven over 60,000 miles as an Uber driver with no accidents, no incidents and despite the company\u0027s reputation, my clients love me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI push on with it because anything else prevents me from being available for my son, whose need now is greater than ever, because he is at a critical point in his development. Anyone remember high school? Few remember it fondly, especially if you were different. My son is as different as it gets. I want to be able to be there for him and this is why I continued to pursue writing. It gave me the option of working on projects in a number of ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mentioned earlier I am a writer/editor for a number of small publications. These publications are still in the scrappy stage where they have lots of heart but not a lot of money. I see their potential and continue to try and work with them because it broadens my skill base and increases my visibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eMY FINAL CHALLENGE:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy foolish pride: I have been a member of Patreon for almost two years. Why didn\u0027t I update my page sooner?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause I was suffering from a case of foolish pride. Having worked my entire life, sometimes two jobs at a time, I never thought it would be possible for me to ever want or need the help or support of other. I was of the mind: I help people, not the other way around.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut a series of misfortunes have left my household more challenged. A beloved pet died recently and I was surprisingly emotionally affected. I believe I was vulnerable because my wife\u0027s diagnosis of kidney failure meant she would be on dialysis and the one-two punch left me reeling. Then my daughter came back home to live with us after her landlord decided he wanted to engage in the Bay Area\u0027s favorite game: raise the rents as high as the law will allow. By putting her out, he could maximize his rent between clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all of these things going on, I still pushed forward. Slower. More deliberate. But it wasn\u0027t until a recent science fiction conference I attended where friends, family and social media acquaintances \u003cstrong\u003ehelped me raise funds to travel to this event in Washington D.C\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheir support made it possible to make connections, promote my writing career, and expose me to opportunities I had scarcely dreamed were possible.\u00a0Many of my sponsors here dug deeper and helped with my trip and I was humbled by their belief in my work. It is with their suggestion, why I returned in an effort to fix my page and explain why the need for a change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have come to the conclusion I am an artist in need of patronage. Seems like a no-brainer, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eExcept I have never been keen on the idea of being an artist. I fancied myself a scientist who used creativity to augment my work. It was only once I started writing full time, just how much creativity I never tapped into. So much creativity I write almost every day. I wrote\u00a0300 articles a year were being written long before I became a member of Patreon. (I have had such numbers for the last five years running.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what I have learned is Patreon made it easier for me to write. The humble offerings I take home monthly, would allow me to skip part or all of a week of my driving schedule. It gave me five days of focused attention and often my best work comes at the beginning of the month during the five day window after Patreon pays out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rest of the month is far less productive. I still average an article a day, but the ease and quality of the first week is simply more difficult to achieve. To write the novels sitting in my living room will require more of the focus Patreon allows me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am embarrassed to admit, there are partially complete novels on my living floor. Since I have been driving for Uber, at the end of my day, I am simply too frazzled to even attempt them. I want to write them so badly... I mean look at this cover. Shouldn\u0027t this be a book already?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe good news is: It\u0027s mostly written. The bad news is: it still needs work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal: \u003c/strong\u003eMy friends tells me there are people out there who are willing to support my work. I just have to be willing to ask. Given my prideful nature, it has been a challenge for me to ask for support. Seeing what Patreon has done for me thus far, I believe it can allow me to create at a level, I have scarcely begun to reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, I am asking you, dear reader: If you have come this far, join me on this journey. If all you have is $2 a month, I graciously accept. Then get all of your friends to do the same. A thousand people, at $2 a month and were done.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get out of it? Besides a warm feeling? (Don\u0027t discount warm feelings, they are amazing if you experience them regularly...) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will gain access to a wide array of my writing, some of it, never seen anywhere but on Patreon.\u00a0While the bulk of my book writing goals are speculative fiction in nature, I am hoping to write other non-fiction works based on my library of writing I have done online, particularly in Quora. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://list.ly/list/sqs-the-world-according-to-superheroes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe World According to Superheroes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, I will be compiling my most interesting essays on comics, comic history, and the comic industry. There isn\u0027t anything quite like this book on the market and I believe it will make a mark. Follow the link and you can get a sample of what\u0027s in store for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you give more? Absolutely.\u003c/strong\u003e I will be working out the tiers of giving and what\u0027s available to you, if you can give at a higher level. But understand, my goal is to have you give in such a fashion it is both invisible and painless to you. If you give the equivalent of a cup of coffee a month, and then you just don\u0027t buy one cup that month, you have donated to my cause without doing anything except skipping a cup of overpriced coffee at Starbucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePainless donation is the key. Sharing the possibility with your friends is also a good way to help. I don\u0027t just write science fiction. I write all flavors of fantasy as well. Epic fantasy, magical realism, afrosurrealism, urban fantasy, sword and sorcery, wuxia, and alternative histories. I dabble in horror and poetry and have even taken to writing non-fiction to appear in the occasional literary journal. I would like to do more literary work as my experiences as a military person and my early corporate days were transformative in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can count on me to create journalism discussing aging, ageism, social issues, technology, science, economics and computer-related topics.\u00a0Three hundred short stories, essays, articles and with your help a few collections and novels are just around the bend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill it be easy? I am not going to lie. No. It won\u0027t be easy. But if it were easy everyone would be doing it. Wait. Everyone IS doing it. Everyone fancies themselves a writer these days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe difference is: \u003c/strong\u003eNot everyone is doing it well. I have a commitment do doing it well. I have a track record of doing it right. And I intend to continue, with your help. I am going to list the most recent publications and let you catch up on the vast archive of work already in progress. A great deal of my work is available online but if we form an alliance, I will make it easier for you to find the BEST of my work right here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thowze.carrd.co\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBIOGRAPHY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThaddeus Howze is a prolific writer of speculative fiction, scientific, technical and cultural commentary from his office in Hayward, California.
