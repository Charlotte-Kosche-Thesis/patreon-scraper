When I was a little kid, I would write little short stories for my friends and family. As I got older I realized I loved doing it. Eventually, I started writing more stories and posting them online for people to read. I knew I was going to grow up and be an author one day. I currently live in the Tampa Bay area in Florida with my wonderful wife and adorable baby boy. Besides writing, I love to camp and hike. Much of my free time is spent exploring the beautiful nature of Florida.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWHY PATREON?\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eI like spending my time writing and researching books. But advertising and editing take up a huge portion of my time and not to mention the costly endeavor they are. It\u0027s hard to advertise yourself as an indie author. Many of the cheaper methods out there simply do not work and the ones that do can be pricey. With your help, I will be able to focus more of my time on writing and creating exciting new content on a more regular basis. That means, more books published throughout the year! Who wouldn\u0027t be excited about that? Plus, it\u0027s a great platform for me to get closer to my fan base and offer amazing rewards like free books and first looks!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSINCERELY, THANK YOU!\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eIf you\u0027re here, it means you have thought about supporting my page. I can\u0027t even begin to express my undying gratitude for even the thought. It means so much to me that there\u0027s a community of people who want to see others succeed in their passions and are willing to help them get there. You\u0027re an amazing person for even considering the support. I thank you very much for your interest in me and I hope you enjoy the books I am determined to write for many more years to come!"
