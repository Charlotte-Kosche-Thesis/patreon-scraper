    "summary": "I\u0027m a professional animator who\u0027s creating Dark Souls comedy cartoons and HP Lovecraft not-so-comedy animations! I have several shorts in the works right now, and am opening this Patreon to help cover some costs associated with my animations, now that Youtube isn\u0027t so reliable anymore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny help given will help me hire voice actors, sound designers, and musicians which are the main things I can\u0027t do on my own. Right now I use mostly royalty-free and free-to-use assets (along with sounds from the Souls game series in those particular videos).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m purposely leaving the goals section blank as it doesn\u0027t make much sense with the way I want this to work. No matter what amount I\u0027m making, I will use it to improve my cartoons. However, a higher amount will allow me to afford things faster. For example, if I have to spend less time saving up to hire an actor there will be more content with voice acting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo- help me make some cartoons, and help some people get paid!\u003cbr\u003e"
