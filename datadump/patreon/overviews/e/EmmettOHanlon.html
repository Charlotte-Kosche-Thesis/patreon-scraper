Many of you know me as one of the principal singers of chart topping Irish singing group, Celtic Thunder. You may also know me from my youtube channel, where you\u2019ve come along with me on trips around Chicago and around the world, as I pursue my opera career. But maybe you\u2019re just stumbling across my page now for the first time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAllow me to introduce myself. Yes, I tour with Celtic Thunder, a fantastic group of other male singers who are just as busy pranking each other as they are singing and touring. I am a baritone, who is wrapping up my second, and final year at the Lyric Opera House in Chicago. But thats not all. Over the of the past two years, I started a vlog as a means to keep myself busy in my down time, and a way for me to connect with fans while I wasn\u2019t able to see them on tour.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDuring this time, I have been able to really grow my connection with fans, and viewers. It has made a big impact on my life as an artist, and as a human being looking to connect and share common interests with people around the world. From there, the Patreon project was born.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eWHAT THE HECK IS PATREON...?!?!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPatreon is a fan club, a vlog, a concert venue, and all around connection hub! A place where people come together not just to connect with their favorite content creator, but to support, and take part in the creative process itself. Patreon serves as a platform for me to release all types of content from posting updates, and vlogs, to live streaming shows, and more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe biggest difference, is how it allows for additional involvement from you, the viewers! Each Patreon pages comes with a tier system. Each tier varies in cost per month depending on the level of involvement you choose. By signing up for a tier, you will have access to a variety of goodies, or \u201cRewards\u201d, but also a different level of involvement! In the description videos for each tier, you can learn more about what that tier has to offer to make the choice that best suits you! Can you still follow me on social media, and be updated? Absolutely. This new project is meant to go beyond the social media pages, and beyond \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cfollows\u201d. What I look for the most on my pages, is hearing from you! Patreon and its tiers, allows us to truly stay connected, and for you to truly be heard and become apart of the show!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 195, 20); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO...?!?!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\tIf I sign up, how does that help you?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe beauty of Patreon, is you know exactly where your monthly donations are going..because they come right back to you! With your help through these donation tiers, I will be able to take your input and interests, and expand on them to ensure you\u2019re seeing more of what you like. What do you want to hear? What do you want to talk about? What do you want to see more of?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe money collected from this page goes directly into developing new projects and segments for my video content, such as interviews with amazing artists, and fully produced short films. It will also go towards studio recording time, investing in quality merchandise, being able to come to smaller towns for shows, hiring amazing band mates, and so much more. Everything we will be doing here will be truly viewer driven. I\u2019ll be taking your questions, chatting to you daily, and bringing you behind the scenes wherever I go! I can\u2019t do any of this without your help, without your involvement.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI have been blessed with fans who have greeted me backstage, sent me letters in the mail, your generosity has extended all the way to my cats! Your support is one that I cherish, and respect. I want to do you proud, and create something together that will be long lasting. Pop into the videos now to hear me explain more, and check for recent vlogs, where I will be addressing any of your remaining questions about the Patreon Project!!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
