By age 17 he was signed to a LA development/management deal with the popular Texas band Gypsy Tree.\u003cbr\u003eThough he has never broken into the main stream music industry, If you watch popular TV shows such as Celebrity Rehab, Sober house, SKINS or discovery channel you have probably heard his music.\u003cbr\u003eWhile the subject matter of his own experiences are sometimes serious and heavy, his light hearted jovial manner shines brightly in his live performances that express a rich hope and love of life that is both accessible and inspiring.\u003cbr\u003e",
