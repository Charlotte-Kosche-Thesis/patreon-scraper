I regularly respond to videos, taking apart their arguments in a fully referenced fashion. I post videos every Friday and Sunday as well as most Wednesdays. This means that I post over three hours of content each month! So consider possibly donating even a single dollar towards that production, especially in light of cinema costs. Hell, I even allow you to have your own food and drink whilst watching. ;P"
