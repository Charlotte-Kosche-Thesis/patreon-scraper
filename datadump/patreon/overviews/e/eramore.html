Times\n are changing and media has a new approach. Not many people purchase \nnewspapers. Instead, majority get their news and information via social \nmedia, but the fundamentals never change.\n  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe story of Eramore started as an experiment and is the result of 15 \nyears of practice and experimenting with the sequential art form. Over \nthe years, I have learned that being able to draw interesting and funny \ncharacters was only half of it. The most important half is breathing \nlife into them. It was missing a soul- developing and cultivating a \nvoice. All the art for Eramore is hand drawn and inked, then scanned \ninto the computer and then digitally painted. I continue to learn and \napply new techniques as times goes by. I hope you enjoy Eramore as much \nas I enjoy creating it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEramore is a linear progressive story that moves along a timeline. \nHowever, there will be random strips and gags related to the cartoon but\n not necessarily in sequential order. I do this for two reasons. One: \nwhile writing, a good idea hits, daring me to approach it and work it \ninto a gag for the strip. Two: a daily comic strip should stand alone. \nMy goal is to have the readers spend a few seconds of their day with the\n characters. Even if they have never heard of Eramore they can still \nappreciate a touch of humor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\n want to invite you and all of your friends, family, distant relatives, \nacquaintance\u2019s and enemies to join me in this quest. All of your \nfeedback suggestions and input will be received with open arms. \nWelcome to the world of Eramore!\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",
