Getting a peek into how creative people do what they are passionate about is my fuel! Every day I juggle a bunch of fun and exciting work; new goldfish sculpts, pet portrait commissions, shirt designs, painting resin casts, making molds, sketching up new ideas for figurines and stickers, and the list goes on. So, I thought I would share my world with you guys and any useful tips I\u0027ve learned along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day, you don\u0027t have to become a Patreon, I will still put out regular content on Facebook and Instagram.\u00a0But by joining ,you will be receiving triple the content, all of which will be exclusive to Patreon supporters only and you will be directly supporting my ability to keep creating more art, tackle bigger projects, invest in better equipment, and to keep improving for you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Patron Rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t become a patron right now, that\u0027s ok! I know everyone who supports me gives what they can, when they can, and I appreciate it so much! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do decide to become a monthly contributor, there are some super exclusive and cool rewards available each month! On the right side of the page you\u0027ll see the different tiers currently available, how much and what that level gives you each month. As time goes on and hopefully as the number of patrons grow, I will add new tiers and new rewards!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only does this allow you access to patron only content, like \u0027How To\u0027 videos, tips and tricks blogs, behind the scenes tidbits from my studio, and exclusive 2D and 3D artwork, but you can also participate in the community section of the page and send me all the questions you want!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease understand that there are a limited number of sign ups for each tier.
