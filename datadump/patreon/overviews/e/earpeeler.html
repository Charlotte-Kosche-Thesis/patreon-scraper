    "summary": "Earpeeler was setup as a supplement to all of the other great news sites that cover mostly hard rock and metal, and bring you news on a frequent basis. \u00a0Although we do veer off into other directions on a daily basis, the main focus is rock based music.  Since podcasts have been growing at a tremendous rate, it is almost impossible for the classic sites to keep up with every show out there.  Well that\u2019s where earpeeler comes in, helping bring attention to all of those hard working podcasters, bloggers, and radio shows that are out there interviewing your favorite artists. It is a one stop shopping site to allow you to catch up on your favorite bands, shows, or anything else you might want to check out while on the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have decided to use Patreon to try and take the site to\nthe next level.  There are tons of things\nwe would like to implement, but currently cannot do so for economic\nreasons.  Some of the immediate goals are\nto switch the site to a dedicated server, and have our developers perform a\ncomplete behind the scenes reworking of the site. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe money currently generated from the site, via our merch\nstore, Amazon links, and the ads we currently display, are not enough to expand\nour operations further.  The idea to leverage\nPatreon is twofold, seeing if there is enough demand out there to implement\nwhat we have envisioned for the site, and seeing if we can finance the site\nfurther.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes we have a merch store, but we will be offering members only merch via Patreon as a reward to those that help out during this campaign. \u00a0The idea is to make this last, and similar to band fan clubs, rewards on a yearly basis. \u00a0If you pick up a t-shirt now, it will be part of a limited run for that calander year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
