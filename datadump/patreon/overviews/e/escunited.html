Storing that kind of data is not cheap and only keeps going up as more and more content is created by our users. Server costs and any repairs/maintenance doesn\u0027t come for free and often requires us hiring a professional for the job and they want to get paid, too. Travel and the subsequent accommodation, shipping and transportation of expensive equipment as well as upgrading our technology eats a big hole into our budget. As we approach the first ever Asiavision contest, we want to be there for you covering this new exciting venture as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand that some of you will only be able to give a little and every single dollar counts.

This website is run by Matt Friedrichs, the Editor-in-Chief and resident Eurovision nerd. I have been a fan since 1998 and have been attending the event since 2011. I reside in Soutern California so far, far away so it\u0027s not easy to just come over but I make it work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy team is spread all across the world, we have people in the United States, Malta, United Kingdom, Serbia etc. So while I may not be local, we try to have a local presence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, it means the world to me!"
