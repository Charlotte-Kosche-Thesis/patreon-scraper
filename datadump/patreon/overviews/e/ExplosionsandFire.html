I also run Extractions\u0026amp;Ire where I post longer syntheses and talk about my feelings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been running this channel off my own funds for a few years and that hasn\u0027t been a problem because I obviously love doing it, but I\u0027m ambitious. With more subscribers comes the desire to do more interesting things. Experiments that shouldn\u0027t be done at home, explosives that have barely been synthesized before, building equipment that can do super cool things. All presented in video form. But the more exotic I get, the more expensive things are, so I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me here lets me be more crazy. (This is questionably a good thing. Mum please don\u0027t read that sentence). Let\u0027s do some great chemistry together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
