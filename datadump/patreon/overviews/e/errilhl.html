This has multiple reasons, mostly it\u0027s a financial issue coupled with real-life events for my artist, which makes it hard for her to work on this game (it is actually quite a bit of work) without getting much payment (as it is right now). It\u0027s not meant as \"pay me more!\" or an excuse, just an explanation. As you can see from some of the updated reward-images, we are gonna go with DAZ-created characters. I will, for now, keep the existing backgrounds, so the game won\u0027t be fully 3D, more like a 2.5D at best. We\u0027ll see how it works when adding the new characters to the script.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn the meantime, here is a couple of images of the new character-sprites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s5.postimg.cc/yo2iafcnr/jules_reward_pose_cr.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJules\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s5.postimg.cc/vvu0rku6f/anne_ahead_redcasual_p1_eo_cr.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnne\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s5.postimg.cc/lwyyayv9z/karen_about_head.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKaren\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s5.postimg.cc/5z2n3vsxz/3840x2160_cat_reward_pose-_Beauty_cr_cr.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCatherina\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s5.postimg.cc/d5vjy64mv/miss_novak_pointer_stick_cr_cr.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMiss Novak\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
