    "summary": "Welcome! Thank you so much for joining me on this journey!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you will get access to everything I am creating and be a part of the process! Ill be posting videos of new songs, clips of songs that are in the works so you can let me know what you think, cover songs videos of your request, and more! I plan to unleash my creativity all over this site! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s more about why I am creating this site (I highly recommend reading it):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to think that becoming a musician was somehow the easy way out. But, after 14 years of trying to balance making an income and doing what I was put on this earth to do, I realize, this is so far from the truth. The struggle is real! \u00a0The industry has changed so much. In some ways for the better, but in other ways not so much. Especially for the artist. We find ourselves wasting valuable creative energy in jobs we don\u0027t enjoy, and trying to \"squeeze in\" our creative pursuits with what little energy we have left. Or, we become the \"starving artist.\" Sounds fun, huh?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently watched a talk by Jordan Peterson called \"Why You Need Art In Your Life.\" He spoke to something that resonated so deeply with me. Well, two things. First, the fact that if we are here to create art in the world, and we are not doing that, a part of us is actually dying inside. And it feels that way! And that is in no way serving humanity. The second, is that the world needs more beauty! Now more than ever. Us creators are here to bring beauty into the world. Why isn\u0027t that more supported? Why is it that only the \"lucky\" ones get to be compensated well enough to just keep creating??\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love this website because it brings back the joys of patronage! Back in the old days, musicians and artists had patrons that supported them so they could create continuously. Usually rich ones. But, with technological advances (i.e. sites like these), we can now reach larger audiences who can contribute very small amounts that add up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW IT WORKS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonate whatever amount feels good to you! It can be as little as $1 a month! If it ever doesn\u0027t feel in alignment with you anymore, stop it at anytime.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
