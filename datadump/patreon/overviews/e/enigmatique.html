Life is too short for normal clothes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e But why Patreon?\u00a0After regularly hearing \u0027you are totally wasted in your 9-5 job and should be costuming\u0027 I decided to\u00a0commit to making my costuming\u00a0a\u00a0bigger\u00a0focus and share\u00a0my knowledge. So many people have said that they would love to attend my costume workshops but have other work and life commitments, so\u00a0 this platform\u00a0allow me\u00a0engage with a\u00a0wider audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I will create a garment based on my library, pattern collection or original designs. The process will be photographed and notes provided to help you create your own beautiful garments. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for\u00a0joining me\u00a0and I look forward to getting to know you and\u00a0seeing\u00a0all of your\u00a0creations. \u003cbr\u003e"
