In all that time my commitment to documenting and celebrating the diverse pleasures of human sexuality has never wavered. \u00a0Currently I have three specific passions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003ePreserving an independent adult internet;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDocumenting the sources of erotic material; and\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDigital curation of vintage erotic art.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eAny one of these could be a full-time job for me; each would be my dream job. I want to do \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eso much\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e more of them all. \u00a0To afford the time for that, I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Curation Of Erotica\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first internet pastime was downloading sets of dirty pictures from Usenet. \u00a0To assemble a \"complete\" image set was impossible: I was paying six cents a minute to Compuserve, running a 2400 baud modem. Most of my sets would \u003cem\u003eforever\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be incomplete. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that warped something in my soul. \u00a0Now, when I visualize the adult internet, I see it as an infinite\u00a0thicket\u00a0of incomplete erotic sets. \u00a0Finding fragmented and dispersed erotic libraries, bringing them together, searching out the gaps, going back to primary sources -- there\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003enothing\u003c/strong\u003e I like more. \u00a0The \"best\" three images from some obscure source are in 10,000 places, and (if we\u0027re lucky) attributed properly in two of those places. The other seven images from that source might or might not be on the internet at all, and the text that was first published with them? \u00a0Good luck! \u00a0Finding those rare correct attributions, searching out the true source, assembling the \u003cem\u003ecomplete\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0sets, giving them context, and then publishing and archiving the entire package so it won\u0027t get lost again: this is what I most love to do in life. \u00a0Presently I do \u003cem\u003emuch less\u003c/em\u003e of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erosblog.com/2014/08/27/becat-erotic-etchings-le-canape/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethis curation\u003c/a\u003e than I would prefer, because it takes oodles of time (and often money) that I currently can\u0027t afford. \u00a0Your Patreon support changes that equation. \u00a0Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDocumenting Erotic Provenance\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe internet never forgets a dirty picture. \u00a0But it gets \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e confused, sometimes, about where they came from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything that\u0027s ever posted on the internet leaves a trail. But the trail is in soft mud, and it\u0027s always washing away. The Wayback Machine (love it though I do with a passionate lust) can only catch snapshots and fractions. \u00a0Every broken link and missing website and deleted blog and banned Tumblr and failed social media platform is like a new bit of dead grey matter in the stroke-ridden brain of the internet. \u00a0Interrogating that brain and expecting clear, simple, correct answers? \u00a0Good luck with that! \u00a0But it\u0027s a big brain, and much remains. I have a special skill, honed by years of pursuing my digital curation hobby, polished with many hundreds of paid research commissions, and reinforced by a quarter-century of close attention paid to the internet\u0027s dirty pictures. \u00a0If you provide me with a dirty picture (art or photo, it doesn\u0027t matter) that\u0027s on the internet, I can identify the source of it about ninety percent of the time: artist, photographer, place of first publication, \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e significant about its origin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m now offering this skill to Patrons. \u00a0(See my Patron rewards for details.) \u00a0And, though I\u0027ve never before\u00a0written in detail how I do it (\u003ca href=\"http://www.erosblog.com/2016/10/27/how-to-find-a-flying-fuck-porn-provenance-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethis comes the closest\u003c/a\u003e), when this Patreon reaches its first goal, I will write an in-depth Patrons-only guide. \u00a0Nothing can replace my twenty-five years of practice, but I\u0027ll do my best, offering a full list of the search tools I use and writing down the best summary I can of my search strategies. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently strive to provide a good attribution for everything that is posted to ErosBlog, but I\u0027m pressed for time. \u00a0Many days, the work commitments that pay my bills leave me just a few moments to work on the blog. Thus, too often, my attributions are weak. Even when I identify the source or an artist, I may not take the time to find a good link, or to provide complete context. \u00a0Your Patreon support will change that. \u00a0The more support I get, the more time I can take and the more detail I can provide in attributing the erotic material that appears on the blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePreserving An Independent Adult Internet As The Open Web Declines And Fails\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndependent erotic expression on the internet faces many threats. Sometimes I write about them, because that\u0027s the only potentially-helpful thing I know how to do. \u00a0The two specific threats that most firmly grip my attention are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1)\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSearch discrimination\u003c/strong\u003e, which began when Google started assuming people do not want to see adult results unless they use an unrelated explicit keyword along with their actual search term. It now finds its expression in an infinity of apps, devices, and social media platforms that simply \u003ca href=\"http://www.erosblog.com/2013/06/04/pornocalypse-now-the-google-glass-timeline/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eexclude adult content\u003c/a\u003e from their walled gardens or blacklist most adult keywords in their \u003ca href=\"http://www.erosblog.com/2015/06/02/why-cant-you-search-for-eggplants-on-instagram-pornocalypse/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003einternal search tools\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.erosblog.com/2013/12/03/no-pizzles-no-preggers-googles-android-bad-words-list/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epredictive algorithms\u003c/a\u003e, and even their \u003ca href=\"http://www.erosblog.com/2013/05/06/google-glass-no-fuck-for-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evoice recognition engines\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cstrong\u003eThe\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.erosblog.com/?s=pornocalypse\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#Pornocalypse\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which is what I call the tendency of closed-platform internet companies that welcome adult content at first (using our stuff to accelerate platform adoption and growth) and then later evict all of us stinky sex-people once it\u0027s time to start courting the prudish/squeamish Wall Street or Silicon Valley moneybags investors. \u00a0Exclusion of adult expression by social media companies and walled-garden device/app platforms is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erosblog.com/2014/04/08/where-your-adult-site-visitors-went/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ean increasing crisis for the independent adult web\u003c/a\u003e as an ever-larger proportion of internet traffic moves into these apps, the ones (which, increasingly is \u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eall of them\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e) that run on smartphones and have been forcibly Bowdlerized by the platform blue-noses who gatekeep the proprietary walled-garden app stores.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started blogging, I didn\u0027t set out to be a journalist; and indeed I\u0027ve been known to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erosblog.com/2010/11/29/college-professor-alternet-porn-statistics-fail/#comment-139194\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evociferously disclaim\u003c/a\u003e any journalistic pretensions. \u00a0But I approach journalism most closely when reporting on the ways in which adult expression is made unwelcome on the modern internet. \u00a0Print journalism never touches this subject and the \"mainstream\" internet press usually doesn\u0027t notice these stories or doesn\u0027t fully understand them. \u00a0\u003cem\u003eSomebody\u003c/em\u003e has got to do it right, and too often that somebody is me. \u00a0As with my other two blogging passions, your support will help me to do more of this, and to do it better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-- Bacchus\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
