I\u0027m trying to move forward with projects, but being a college student does not help when it comes to doing all of the content for you, the supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create content on YouTube, and it\u0027s slowly picking up steam. I have also begun streaming on Twitch and pushing myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI battle with depression and making this content keeps my mind busy and makes me feel like I have a purpose, and when someone compliments my video or stream, it means a lot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, whatever you guys donate will mean the world, whether it\u0027s $1 or $10. I will do rewards and exclusive content for you guys, like monthly giveaways and other shindigs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank each and and every one of you so much for your support!"
