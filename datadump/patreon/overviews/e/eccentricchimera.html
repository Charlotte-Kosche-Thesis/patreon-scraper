    "summary": "Hello, Everyone!  Welcome to my Patreon Page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m known by the name \"EccentricChimera,\" though I usually prefer friends to call me \"EC\" or just Chimera, because It\u0027s much easier to type out. I\u0027m an aspiring and ever-developing artist and writer who\u0027s looking to start making content on a more professional basis.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is partly because of a few financial troubles that I\u0027ve been going through recently, and partly because of my own growing desire to finally start working towards making my project goals a reality. \u00a0I\u0027ve got so many awesome ideas that I\u0027ve been wanting to start on for a good while, from written stories and comics, to short animations and even games. Simply put, there is a lot of stuff that I want to see completed! \u00a0And I\u0027m more than willing to put as much effort as I can into making that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I suppose we\u0027ll start with the simple stuff:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Transformation Content Exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell...it\u0027s a little complicated to explain in detail. \u00a0Transformation-themed content is any type of media that has a focus on the drastic physical or psychological changes that the characters involve go through. \u00a0It can be something as simple as a human-to-animal transformation, or something more complicated, even suspenseful, like a gradual metamorphosis into some strange alien creature. \u00a0Or maybe it\u0027s more psychological, like watching a character\u0027s personality evolve as they are forced to adapt to a new environment, form, or outside influence. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs long as the changes are interesting and well-thought out, it can definitely make for some great transformation fiction!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersonally, I\u00a0tend to specialize in the more lighthearted toony transformations, particularly the type of comical and (often physically impossible) cartoony changes more common in the old squash-and-stretch style of cartoon shows. \u00a0This type of TF appeals to a small group though, which is why I\u0027ve been trying to expand my range a bit. \u00a0Of course, I won\u0027t just be doing only Transformation content, or even just anthro art. \u00a0Like I mentioned, there\u0027s a lot of stuff I want to do...even though TF will still be the main focus, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will My Support Go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, a lot of it will go into house bills, food, and gas so I can use more of my time to draw, write, and plan for future projects. \u00a0If there\u0027s any money left after that, I\u0027ll be investing it into stuff like a new drawing tablet and better video editing software, things I can use to improve the overall quality of my content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, So What Ideas Do You Have in Mind?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, for the moment, I\u0027m planning for a bunch of transformation and non-transformation-themed content in preparation for bigger projects, some of which will likely be based on suggestions from my patrons. \u00a0I figure that it\u0027ll make things better if you guys get to have a say in what art and stories you\u0027d like to see. \u00a0This also includes suggestions for TF-themed custom items, like pillows and mousepads, which I\u0027ll be using sites like CafePress and Zazzle to make. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have two comics and one major story series in planning at the moment, but I don\u0027t want to give away too much information on those just yet. \u00a0Moreover, animations and other projects will also be going up on my Youtube channel, which is currently in development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, the majority of\u00a0new rough sketches and story snippets that I make as practice will go up exclusively on this site, as an extra little reward for patrons. \u00a0Keep an eye out, because I\u0027ll be giving regular updates on work in progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thanks for reading and checking out my page, and I\u0027m very grateful for any support you give!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
