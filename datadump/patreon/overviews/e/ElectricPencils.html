These days I don\u0027t go out much and I quit drinking, so maybe pledge what you would\u0027ve spent on buying me a drink back in the old days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously, writers are no different from other artists. We struggle to make ends meet. We have day jobs and daydreams. We have equipment that we have to maintain and replace. (This laptop is more than 7 years old. That\u0027s like 110 people years. It randomly shuts off and overheats to the point that my flesh is burning off the bone when I type on it. For example.) But it\u0027s a lot harder for a writer to earn that extra cash sometimes. Not much call for poet-buskers these days or even coffee-shop gigs where I could read my latest stories and have people tip me. It is what it is, so here we are, now and together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I do and have the funds to support someone who is trying to create something honest, I greatly appreciate that. If I\u0027m not your guy, there are literally millions of artists to support and I would encourage you to find someone you can help out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/Peace\u003cbr\u003e"
