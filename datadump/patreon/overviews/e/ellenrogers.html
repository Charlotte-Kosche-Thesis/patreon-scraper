    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been a photographer my entire life, or at least for\nas long as I remember.\u003cbr\u003e\nI guess most people would point out that I\u2019m an \u2018analogue\u2019\nphotographer; meaning that I use only darkroom processes and film to create my\nworks. But honestly, for me there\u2019s no other way. These techniques are all I\u2019ve\nknown and have become part of me and my work, my craft if you like. As the\nworld has moved on around me I\u2019ve stubbornly stuck to the equipment and\nprocesses I\u2019ve come to love. They\u2019ve become something that, when married with\nmy imaginings form part of a whole entity that would cease to exist without\nthem. The processes, chemicals, cameras, lenses, film and all the other dusty,\ndecaying photographic instruments ARE my work and the finished print you see is\nthe impression left by all those things colliding with my inner thoughts and\nexpressions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://blog.ellenjanerogers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/14711432_1313529338718102_583386925140130605_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few reasons... We live in a time that lays between two great eras, namely\nthe eras of film and digital production. Those familiar with my work will know\nthat I use many techniques that were antiquated even before I was born. But as\ntime wears on even the more mundane and previously mainstream film materials\nare vanishing from circulation. Many groups and individuals have worked to halt\nthe disappearance of film from our culture but even the most optimistic amongst\nfilm supporters now has to face up to the sobering fact that film will\neventually become a museum piece.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhilst this may be the eventual outcome there exists a\ncurrent period of flux wherein supplies of film dwindle and manufacturers\nslowly disappear. For most of my life I\u2019ve struggled within this \u2018twilight\u2019 of\nthe era of film but only more recently has this uphill march become almost too\nmuch for my bank balance to maintain. Finally it has begun to drive me from the\nthing I love the most - my work. Next month I give up my studio space\nand darkroom and condense my operation to my home. This is combined with a\ndwindling supply of chemicals and film as prices rise has lead to a curtailing\nof the amount of work I\u2019m able to produce each month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI rarely work in the fashion\nindustry as I once did, now - these days, I am a part-time lecturer and I make art when I can afford to.\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to use the money you can donate to take on more darkroom work and afford supplies for shoots each month. My main focus has\nbeen a personal project called \u0027Gnosis\u0027 you can read about it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.ellenjanerogers.com/blog/2016/03/27/gnosis/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Every day I plan and consider this project, it\u0027s a labour of love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0All of my work is hand-printed and hand-coloured, the final output\nis a scan, here are a couple of them...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://blog.ellenjanerogers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/untitled-1-of-1-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://blog.ellenjanerogers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/untitled-1-of-12.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can I offer you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs well as increasing and enriching my work I wish\nto offer those who become patrons of my work extra material as a form of\nthanks. After donating through Patreon you\u2019ll receive updates and behind the\nscenes photos and films of the projects I\u2019m working on (Patreon allows for this\nand there\u2019s no extra signup anywhere else). I want to give people a chance to\nsee behind the curtain of my process and all that goes into making the work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFinally\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith yours and other fellow patrons\u2019 support I hope to be\nable to, not only continue to expand my body of work and publish new shoots\neach month but also expand into new territories without as much fear of the\neconomic consequences. Without the support of all of the people who follow and\nbelieve in my work I certainly wouldn\u2019t have come as far as I have. I\u2019m\ngrateful to everyone who has kept me afloat and who continue to allow me to do\nthe thing I love.\u003cbr\u003e"
