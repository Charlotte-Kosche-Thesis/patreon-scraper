    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://blog.emepps.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SelfPortrait.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello there, friendly being! My name Emma Epps and I\u0027m a writer.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you found my books on Amazon or in the wild and you want to read more, you\u0027re in the right place. Or if you enjoy my free book reviews and travelogues and want to support me in making more, you\u0027re also in the right place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me start with the really short explanation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis website you\u0027re on is called Patreon. You can buy my books individually on Amazon, but they take a big cut and it\u0027s not a particularly good deal either for you or for me. But \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is more like a subscription: you pay me directly to write. \u003c/strong\u003eThis could be a very tiny amount, like $1 a month, or, if you\u0027re rich and awesome, it could be a lot more. In exchange, you get access to things only patrons get! For example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$1 a month gets you stories, excerpts, and posts that are available only to patrons.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$2 a month or more gets you copies of everything I have written and will write.\u003c/strong\u003e Currently, that\u0027s seven books for less than the cost of one hardcover at Barnes \u0026amp; Noble. And I add one or two books a year, which won\u0027t cost you a penny extra!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5 a month or more and you start getting Reward Points\u003c/strong\u003e to spend on goodies like signed paperbacks, original art, stickers, and video chat Q\u0026amp;As! These aren\u0027t like those obnoxious reward points that build up slowly and expire when you\u0027re not looking. These actually get you neat things soon, and they last forever.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in other words, if you like my writing, get it here. I promise you won\u0027t regret it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, that was the short intro. If you\u0027re still here, here\u0027s the longer About Me. I write:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFiction. \u003c/strong\u003eMy books usually have magic in them, so they\u0027re fantasy, but they rarely fit into a nice subgenre like epic, urban, steampunk, or grimdark. To give you an idea: my \u003ca href=\"http://www.emepps.com/it\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emost well-known novel\u003c/a\u003e is a court intrigue drama told from the point of view of an interpreter on a diplomatic mission...and \u003ca href=\"http://www.emepps.com/csaa\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy most recent novel\u003c/a\u003e is a romantic comedy set in a high-magic alternate America. I get around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings I like to write about are linguistics, comedy, music, art, magic, war, love, friendship, politics, philosophy, culture clash, and ethical conundrums. I can\u0027t personally lay claim to being funny, but my characters sometimes are. \u003ca href=\"http://www.emepps.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can find excerpts of my books here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBook reviews. \u003c/strong\u003eIn my day job, I\u0027m a bookseller. I write two-paragraph reviews of every book I read, which means mostly sci-fi, fantasy, graphic novels, classic literature, and assorted nonfiction - history, science, psychology, and whatever peculiar subject I need to understand for what I\u0027m writing at the moment. The reviews are available free online. \u003ca href=\"http://blog.emepps.com/category/highlights/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can read some recent highlights here\u003c/a\u003e, and there\u0027s also a link to sign up for my review newsletter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTravelogues.\u003c/strong\u003e My travelogues are neither the terrifying-cockroach-hostel kind nor the five-star-hotel kind, more the inevitably-things-go-slightly-wrong kind. I wish I had the chance to write more of these. \u003ca href=\"http://emepps.tumblr.com/tagged/travel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy most recent travel journal is here\u003c/a\u003e, and it\u0027ll be expanded when I put it into paperback form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome months I write tens of thousands of words of fiction; some months I\n write no fiction but bust out dozens of book reviews. I get to travel \n(and therefore write a travelogue) once every two years or so. And \nsometimes I need a break from looking at words, so \u003ca href=\"http://emepps.tumblr.com/tagged/my-art\"\u003eI draw\u003c/a\u003e. You may not be interested in \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e of these things, but I can promise you, \u003cstrong\u003eyour patronage will be turned directly into creative work\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend between 25 and 35 hours a week at creative projects. If you believe I should be able to do that and \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e be able to afford health insurance, Patreon is the system that lets you chip in. And I try to make dang sure you get some really cool rewards in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePatreon signup\u003c/h3\u003eBy becoming a patron, you\u0027re pledging to give a set amount every month. This renews indefinitely unless you cancel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will be charged for the current month as soon as you pledge \n(since you get access to my work right away), and thereafter charged on \nthe 1st of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIf you pledge $1/month....\u003c/h3\u003eIf you\u0027re a bronze level subscriber, you immediately get access to all my patron-only posts.

I provide all common formats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhile I try really hard to get ebooks sent to new subscribers within 24 \nhours of receiving your pledge notification, it could potentially take a\n couple of days.\u003c/strong\u003e Especially in the Summer or holidays when my workload is highest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach new release will be sent as an ebook within a week of release to any patron pledged at $2/month or more. Other than make sure I have your current email address, you don\u0027t have to do anything special. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIf you pledge $5+/month or more....\u003c/h3\u003e\nAs soon as you sign up, you will start accumulating points that you can use in my Patron Reward Store!
