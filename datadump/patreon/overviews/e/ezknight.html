    "summary": "Hey Game Development Fans,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Zachary Knight, I am one of the Co-Founders of \u003ca href=\"http://http://divineknightgaming.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDivine Knight Gaming\u003c/a\u003e. We are a small game development studio run by a pair of brothers. We have made a number of small free web based games, and a couple of PC games over the years. Our most notable game release of late is \u003ca href=\"http://manlyboy.divineknightgaming.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eManly Boy\u003c/a\u003e, a triple collection of Gameboy themed games. We want to continue to make small enjoyable adventure games like those found in Manly Boy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I have decided that I want to take a little time each month to focus on honing my skills and creativity and make one small game each month. I want to make them special, but adhering to the genre of a top down adventure. I want to try to make each one a unique experience well worth the time spent making and playing them. As I make more games, I will be able to build the skills and libraries needed to make even bigger games faster. This means better value and fun for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make these games, \u003ca href=\"http://divineknightgaming.com/2015/02/the-power-of-free-the-tools-we-use/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI use a variety of free and open source tools\u003c/a\u003e. The big thing is that I use the free and cross-platform engine HaxeFlixel. This awesome engine has a strong support structure and a lot of great games have been made with it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of you Patrons, I will make one game a month. You will get early access to the game I make each month. I plan on making the game early in the month, and release it publicly the 1st of the following month. Patrons will receive the game as soon as it is done, but no later than 1 week before public release. There will be some exceptions to this rule, typically surrounding participation in game jams, but i will come up with other perks as a thank you during that time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will have more news as I get this rolling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what do you say? You want to help me out here? I think you do. Why else would you have stuck around to the end of this thing. Give it a try. Every little bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
