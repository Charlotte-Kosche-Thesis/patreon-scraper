    "summary": "My name is Eric Schock. I\u0027m a comic creator. I\u0027m the owner of Evil Robo Productions. I\u0027m a graduate of the Kubert School, and I love what I do. Joe Kubert once said \" You have decided to do comics, your not doing it for the money, because there\u0027s no money in comics. You are doing this because you love what you do. \" I\u0027ve learned this to be true, but like all life\u0027s works I\u0027ve done this because I believe it is important to create stories, artwork, and inspire to dream of things that have not been created, I still have tales to tell. I\u0027ve been creating comics independently for 12 years, I\u0027ve done artwork for free for many organizations, as well as local comic shops and provided conventions with promotional work. I\u0027ve worked\u00a0with groups of artists, and running a comic company was probably the most important learning experience of my art career. It truly showed me what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might be asking yourself, why should you pledge to this page? For myself I found Patreon as a \"new\" beginning. This realization has given me time to look at the world that I live in, its not a place for dreamers. Art cost money (supplies, paper, etc.), Comics cost money to produce (design time, colors, letters, editing, cost of printing, distribution, ), just to live it costs money (rent, car payments, phone bills, school loans, food, even going to conventions to get books out to public) . All these things I knew, but never looked so close because \"this\" was only a part-time work. Producing artwork take time, and in the last few years I\u0027ve been focusing full-time on the day job, and half-time on my work. I want to make this my full-time job, and you can help me do that.\u00a0I love what I do, my passion goes beyond what is viewed as a hobby. For the first time in my life I\u0027ve had the chance to do something for myself, and I\u0027d like to share my love, and experience with those who would support me with this endeavor.\u00a0With your pledge I will be using your support to focus on artwork, and produce the very best that can be created. By going to conventions, buying art supplies, printing comics, and finally after everything living a life where I can finally do what I\u0027ve always love......draw comics, and create artwork."

So I started to draw and read comics. Comics were a big thing for me. I knew any place I lived my favorite heroes would be only a few moments away. I dove into those pages reading everything I could, my mind was a sponge. I was learning what it was to be a comic artist. These guys didn\u2019t do it for the fame or money; they did it for the love of what they did.",
