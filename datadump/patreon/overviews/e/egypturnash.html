She\u0027s got to pull herself together before a hive mind can take over the planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like these things and would like to support me making more comics with your wallet, then read on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOU GET FOR YOUR MONEY.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll post fragments of work-in-progress to Patreon now and then, and I\u0027ll be tossing up full pages the moment I finish them rather than you having to wait for big chunks to be finished.\u00a0Occasionally there will be extras like a desktop-sized copy of a really detailed panel, early unglitched peeks at deliberately-corrupted pages, and so on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027ll also get all the electronic versions of my books as they become available. Some or all Patreon supporters will probably get mentioned in the back of the next book along with the big Kickstarter backers, I\u0027ll figure out the threshold for that later on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou \n\u003cem\u003ewon\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e get any side stories or other extras made just for you. Creating comics takes a lot of time, and I don\u0027t want to delay finishing them any more than I have to - there\u0027s a thing I want to say with each story, and then I want to move on to something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMostly, you\u0027ll just get a nice warm feeling from supporting femme-focused casually queer independent comics. \nI\u0027m told you mostly feel this sensation somewhere around your perineum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW MUCH IS THIS GONNA COST?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, that\u0027s up to you. You can choose how much you give me per page - from a few cents to thousands of dollars - and at the end of the month you\u0027ll be charged based on how many pages I finished.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy official update schedule for Rita was \"aim for two pages a week, don\u0027t stress if life gets in the way\". I\u0027m hoping for a similar schedule with Parallax. On good months I get around 8-10 pages done; on months full of cons or really complicated pages I finish... less. If you decide to become a patron of my work, you\u0027ll be paying a variable amount per month based on how many pages I managed to draw. You can set a maximum amount of money per month as well, in the unlikely event of me getting super productive. And if I don\u0027t draw any comics in a month, I\u0027ll get zilcho from you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently charging separately for the top and bottom halves of most Drowning City pages, as they\u0027re \u003cem\u003ehuge\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0- I\u0027m drawing it to fit on A3 paper, and planning to release it as an A4 book you read sideways. I spend about the same time on half of one of those as I do on a full page of Rita or Absinthe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m Margaret Trauth. I\u0027m a fortysomething transwoman. Born in New Orleans in the early 70s, went to Los Angeles for animation school, spent a decade hanging around the periphery of Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8, burnt out and moved back home three days before Katrina. Nowadays I live in Seattle, where I get regular cuddles from my ex-with-benefits. My hair hasn\u0027t been its natural color since 2003; I have UV-reactive dragon wings tattooed on the backs of my arms, and I\u0027m pretty much incapable of staying sane in anything resembling a \"real\" job.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI make comics that reflect who I am and the people I know and love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSTAR WARS OR STAR TREK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Culture.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WILL I DO WITH THIS MONEY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, right now, I inherited enough to not have to work for several years if I live sensibly, which is allowing me to dedicate all my time to resolutely personal projects. I\u0027ve been incredibly lucky. So I won\u0027t be able to say \"I\u0027ll quit working for The Man and treat comics like a full-time job\" because I kinda already do. But I\u0027d like to keep on doing this kind of thing long after that money runs out. I\u0027d also like to start building the support staff I need to not worry about anything besides drawing the next page of whatever I\u0027m working on at the moment.\u00a0Shipping print books, trying to figure out how to promote my work, buying ads, sending out review copies, trying to get my stuff into comic shops, getting it into e-reader formats, all of these take time away from \n\u003cem\u003emaking the comics.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll also probably blow some of your money on books and games now and then. Gotta feed my mind some new ideas to turn into the next comic, after all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work but can\u0027t even spare a few cents a month, that\u0027s cool too. You can still read it online for free without guilt. It\u0027d be nice if you\u0027d tell your friends about it, blog about it, post about it on social media, nominate it for awards, or otherwise give it a little free publicity - word of mouth is worth a lot now that everyone is drowning in cheap entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve read this far, let me close with links to my work.
