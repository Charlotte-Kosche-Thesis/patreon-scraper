    "summary": "My name is Emaline Delapaix and I am a Berlin based Australian singer songwriter and musician who quit my Canadian day job back in 2010 after going through some serious depression. I decided that the only way I could heal myself once and for all was to take some responsibility for my own happiness, make changes and live my life in a more authentic way and at the same time help make my dream come true of being a full time singer, writer and musician, making a full time living from original music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with only an acoustic guitar, suitcase and my Canadian cat, I moved across the world to a little caravan in rural Eastern Germany during the middle of winter, teaching myself guitar and piano on a little midi keyboard while venturing out to play shows on the weekends, honing my live skills and making a little money to pay the bills. These shows included a lot of house concerts which I owe a lot to and continue to play to this day because of the intimacy between the audience and musician.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the next two years I worked my butt off playing many shows all over Germany and Europe and made a little EP called Between Breeding Seasons which I am very proud of in May 2012 with some recording/playing help from jazz guitarist Karsten Lipp. Several years on and I have played over 300 shows in Europe and North America and am proud to say this past year I contributed some music to an Arte TV documentary as well as made a new EP CD recorded by myself and guitarist Lukas Creswell-Rost called Exorcism. You can find out more about those CD\u0027s at www.emalinedelapaix.bandcamp.com. My next EP CD will come out in November 2016 and I began working on that in January of this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a lot of you know I play a lot of live shows and have been ill over the past 12 months losing my voice on and off and missing out on work has been a huge financial strain not to mention all the guilt I felt when I had to cancel on several occasions. I really enjoy playing live but I do play a few more shows than I should to help me survive financially and it has been affecting my health and my ability to work on new material and finish my new CD as a lot of you know. :P. Right now I am working on making a lot of changes in my life to reduce being out on the road as much focusing on quality vs quantity, giving myself the possibility to rest and keep my health in order as well as to ensure I have the time I need to work on new music and create new records.\u00a0So here I am asking for your help so I can keep bringing you good quality, authentic music and keep on being a full time musician which I love so much. I\u0027m going to start recording and putting up audio and video demos of new songs each month exclusively for people who want to support me via Patreon and if you want you can support me with a pledge each month listed on the right hand side of my page and get some bonuses too. There are many options of support possible from the cost of a cup of coffee to the price of seeing a film. All of it counts and I would be so grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd just incase you were wondering. YES! following this dream has helped with my depression. I am no longer on medication, I would say I am at least 50% happier than I was and that life decision I made back in 2009 was one of the best things I ever decided to do. I\u0027m not going to lie. It has been hard at times, bloody hard but pursuing a dream that had burned inside my chest, body and mind for so long was definitely worth it and I am excited to see where the next leg of the journey takes me!\u003cbr\u003eI wouldn\u0027t be here if it wasn\u0027t for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU! DANKE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ex\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eemaline"
