    "summary": "I love creating things, from jewelry to cosplay and so much more. I am a huge Geek/Nerd and I\u0027m proud of it. I love fantasy! Games, books, movies, it doesn\u0027t matter. I also love sci-fi but fantasy is my top genera. My favorite fantasy creature is Dragons! I play both table top games like D\u0026amp;D and video games of a wide variety. I really enjoy painting minis for TTRPGs but I love making things from scratch even more. All my current cosplay costumes I have made myself from scratch. I also love making dice and potion jewelry, dragon egg figures, occasional steampunk pieces (when I get my hands on some gears and things), candles in nerdy shapes like the dice and dragon egg candles. I will be expanding on the shapes of candles and adding a few more scents vary soon. I am going to mold a skull candle as well soon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why have I made a patreon? Its vary hard to be an artist right now. I can\u0027t pay my bills by only selling the stuff I make at conventions and other events. The winter months tend to have virtually no events going on. And since I am stuck in my local area that means 2 to 5 months of no income. I had an etsy shop open for a while, and when I first opened it I would get a sale now and then, but I wasn\u0027t making enough to keep putting in funds for listings and all the effort required to get people to even go look at it. I have just opened a shop section on my facebook page, but I am not expecting a whole lot of success there either. I just haven\u0027t had a lot of luck with online sales. So rather then trying to drum up sales I am creating a club kind of thing for those that are into the kinds of stuff I make. Kinda like a community where you will get neat handmade items.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a discord server to help make this into more of a community then just yet another patreon where you subscribe and you get rewards. I want to get to know those of you who are into things like dragon eggs, dice keychains, potion necklaces and other things like that. I want to find people like me who want to talk about minis they have painted, cosplays they are working on, get some D\u0026amp;D games going and the like. The discord will be for everyone who subscribes, friends, and my TTRPG group. Let us come together and nerd/geek out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how does each reward tier work? I\u0027ll break things down for you here by each tier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDiscord - everyone gains access and it is available 24/7 tho I will not be on it 24/7, but when I am on feel free to chat with me so we can become friends.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDigital Prints - Once I have people that have signed up for this tier I will get with a photographer friend of mine (I have a few to choose from)\u00a0and do a session in a cosplay/costume/outfit of some kind. I have a vary wide range. Then once I go through the proofs I will pick one to be shared with just this tier after its finished being edited. Never at any time will these photos contain nudity in which you see my nipples or pelvic floor.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCandles - You pay for a bundle. The only time it may be a single candle you receive is if I am sending out a new large size candle that burns for a long time. My current dragon egg candles burn for approximately 5 hours continuous burn time. They are the size of my small dragon egg figures. I am planing larger candles but can\u0027t accommodate quite yet. When the weather gets hot out I will remove the candle bundle tier because I don\u0027t want to risk any melting during shipping. So those of you who want candles I will make a post on patreon to give you warning that I will be taking it down a month before I do, that way you can switch to another tier if you like till the weather cools off again.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDragon Eggs - with the dragon eggs I will be sending everyone the same paint job each month. So for example in October I may do an orange and black themed egg in the spirit of Halloween and that is what would be shipped out. Or i may decide to ask for votes on the paint job for another. I will also be doing patreon exclusive paint jobs. I hope to do lava and frost eggs soon. Any exceptions to sending everyone the same kind of paint job will be by special request.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEades Beads Loot Crate - Each crate will be full of all kinds of things I make. Dragon eggs, candles, jewelry, keychains, painted minis, and more. As you give me feedback about the crates you received I will try to customize them a little more to your tastes. example: you tell me you don\u0027t like candles. then I would stop putting candles in the crates I send to you. Each month\u0027s crate will be different from the last, and each person\u0027s crate will vary slightly especially once I can start to tailor them to you a little.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIf you head over to my facebook or instagram you will be able to see photos of the things I currently make. You can also just buy items out right on my Etsy shop.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/eadesbeads\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/eadesbeads\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/RinasEmporium\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003etwitter: @EadesBeads\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/RinasEmporium\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eInstagram: Eades_beads\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading about my patreon, I hope to chat with you on discord!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
