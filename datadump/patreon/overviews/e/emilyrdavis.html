    "summary": "Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon page. As soon as I heard about Patreon, I jumped on board.\u00a0I wrote about this whole thing over on my blog (you can read that post \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=613804\u0026amp;rf=193780\"\u003ehere \u003c/a\u003eon Patreon) but the short version is that I think this patronage idea is revolutionary. It\u0027s a way to crowd-source full support, not just the sexy project to project stuff. This is where real support of the arts lives. This isn\u0027t just buying a ticket and purchasing an experience. This is where the people can start supporting artists from the ground up. While they\u0027re creating. For what they are creating. Total awesomeness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a struggling artist. (We all are, really. Even the most successful ones. This is why my blog is called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://artiststruggle.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSongs for the Struggling Artist\u003c/a\u003e. The\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/emily-davis-91527608\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epodcast\u003c/a\u003e is called that too.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo watch the Patreon video about how it works:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtu.be/wH-IDF809fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://youtu.be/wH-IDF809fQ\u003c/a\u003e (It\u0027s got cool drawings and it\u0027s only a minute long.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt goes like this:\u003cbr\u003eYou pledge $1 (or more!) for every time I post a blog entry to my blog, Songs for the Struggling Artist. You set this up to do it automatically, so you don\u0027t have to think about it. \u00a0And you can set a maximum, so in case I started posting something every hour on the hour (VERY UNLIKELY!) you\u0027re not out more dollars than you want to be. (I usually post between 3 and 8 times a month.) You can also set a limit so that your pledge is a predictable amount each month. If you only want to give me a dollar every month - just pledge a dollar and set your maximum for a dollar! I appreciate every little bit whole heartedly.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a way to support both me and my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons get my good news before everyone else - and I am always looking for opportunities to express my appreciation for my patrons. I am incredibly grateful for the gift of your patronage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
