    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u00a0Welcome to Elves Lair Games!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 First\noff, thanks for stopping by! \u003cbr\u003eWe would also like to thank our patrons!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo a little about GreyElf. I have been  involved with computers for well over 25 years, designing and building computer systems, also developing software and hardware solutions for business and\u00a0 personal computer solutions. I have over 5 years experience in 3D environment software called OpenSimulator as a core developer and system administrator for Virtual Realms Grid. Also we have over 2 years experience as core developer on a private World of Warcraft server using C++ programming language to program a software package called TrinityCore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo then I discovered the world of Visual Novels Games.\u00a0 I got to know some great friends.\u00a0 Through a good friend suggested we make our own Visual Novel Game.\u00a0 So I went to work learning how to design a Visual Novel Game.\u00a0 I started with learning Unity Development platform and re-started to learn C Sharp again. Then I played little with writing a story line and\u00a0 found out I can actually write stories.\u00a0 \u00a0But soon I found out making a Video Game is not just about writing and Unity developing.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a lot more to game development, planning a type of game, planning a host for the game, advertising the game, looking for other types of talent to create a game and also funding the creative process.\u00a0 So my friend and I started to do the research to find the information to create our game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e What we found out there is no one good source for that information.\u00a0 We had to search and figure things out on our own. We are still learning about all the great information and sources for game creating.\u00a0 With how hard it is to find the proper information and how time consuming it is, I started to wonder just how many games never got made because these resources of information is so hard to find.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that got me thinking why is there not a place or company that could help.\u00a0 Then I thought why not create a place for game creators to get help with all these hard questions. A place where someone else could do the research for all the details of creating a video game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so Elves Lair Games was born. Our mission is to assist video game creators to bring their game ideas to reality. Our video game production company does not buy the licenses of games, instead we allow creators to retain ownership of a game title. We work with a video game creators that have a game idea to provide innovative solutions and expert guidance though out the game creation process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe some of the services we provide are as follows:\u00a0 Game Production Guidance, connecting Game Creators to Game Creating Professionals ie: writers, Game Engine Developers, Graphics Artists, Sound Engineers and Voice actors., Game Hosting Site Options, Game Creation Funding Options,\u00a0 Advertising Options and anything other needs in the creation of a video games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0If you have a game idea we make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want a full consultation about creating a Video Game,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease contact us!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe have a Discord Server:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/tJCZMAU\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/tJCZMAU\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

I have been working with\ncomputers for well over 30 years doing different things, from building\ncomputers, computer networking, the internet and of course gaming.  But I never professionally worked in any\ncomputer related fields.  Recently to\nstarted to play a few games made here on Patreon, got to know a few people and\nI found out that I can understand how to program games in Unity.  At the same time, I was also helping a few\ncreators write storylines.  I really\nenjoyed helping write for some games.  So,\nI am putting my Native English writing skills to use.\u003c/div\u003e",
