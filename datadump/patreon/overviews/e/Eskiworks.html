    "summary": "My name is Katie Hofgard, most of you might know me by my online moniker, Eskiworks.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been a full time freelance illustrator since I graduated from Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in 2009, and before that part time since 2003.\u00a0 I spend the vast majority of my time and creative energy making art for others, bringing their stories to life with my artistic skills.\u00a0 My brain is BURSTING with ideas of my own, and I very rarely get the time to work on them because I\u0027m so focused on my freelance work.\u00a0 I currently support 2 people (my husband and myself) and one (cranky princess) cat with my art here in Colorado, and finding time to make personal work is very difficult. So I created this Patreon page to help fund the creation of personal work without me having to worry about the expense of doing so.\u00a0\u00a0 Here are the projects I am working on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeaFeathers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeaFeathers is a world building project I\u0027ve dabbled in for a few years now, featuring the crafty winged canine species I\u0027ve dubbed Alecani.\u00a0 Most of my stories in this world surround the adventurous Nym; a rusty colored Alecani gal with a gift for plant based magic and a dedication to her family and friends.\u00a0 The cast of this story continues to expand and stories deepen, with Nym\u0027s family, friends, nemeses, and an entire world and history for her to explore.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been posting assorted concept art and stories in my \u003ca href=\"http://tea-feathers.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTeaFeathers tumblr\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 The final format for TeaFeathers would be a full color illustrated novel (or perhaps several), chronicling Nym\u0027s journey from a young adult who lives in the family home, to an experienced and powerful magic user with a great many unusual friends.\u00a0 I don\u0027t want to give too much away, but I do have a lot planned for her!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEskie - A True Story\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen I was 7 my mom got me a puppy for Christmas; a little American Eskimo dog I named Wolfy.\u00a0 Wolfy was my best friend growing up, through hell and high water he stuck with me.\u00a0 Wolfy passed away at the ripe old age of 16, many years ago. So strong was the impact he made on my life, that my current studio name is an homage to his breed (Eskiworks).\u00a0 He had a wonderful and unusual life for a dog, running wild in the Colorado rockies by my side.\u00a0 I\u0027ve always wanted to tell his stories in a comic format, to honor him and keep his memories.\u00a0 Back in college I \u003ca href=\"http://katiehofgard.deviantart.com/gallery/7593245/Eskie-A-True-Story\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003estarted this comic\u003c/a\u003e as a class project, but as post-grad responsibilities mounted, I stopped.\u00a0 I am revisiting this project with a fresh style, and all my current experience as an illustrator, to finally tell the world Wolfy\u0027s amazing story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your goal amounts based off of?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoals are based off my current hourly rate for freelance illustration.\u00a0 The idea is to buy time to do it all, just like clients buy my time to create work for them.\u00a0 This way I can be flexible in what I do with the purchased time; writing or illustration for TeaFeathers, story boarding for the Eskie comic? There\u0027s lots to do!\u00a0 Every time I do Patreon goal related work, I will stream it live for all to see.\u00a0 I find it wonderful to have the audience to interact with, and a way to validate my work hours. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will I get my rewards each month?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will send rewards after your pledge is processed each month.\u00a0 As my Patreon has grown, rewards have shifted from physical the digital rewards.\u00a0 Sometimes the message system here can be fickle, so if you do not receive your rewards via the message system here, please email me at wolfnymph @ gmail . com with your name on Patreon, your pledge amount, and the month for which you didn\u0027t receive your pledge\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u00a0 Without you, I could not pursue my personal vision for my artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to follow me in other places online, here is where you can find me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://katiehofgard.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantart\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://eskiworks.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Eskiworks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/Eskiworks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
