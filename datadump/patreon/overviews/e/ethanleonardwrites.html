    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\"Ethan Leonard\u0027s fiction is a flammable cocktail of magic, meaning and madness with deep import and wisdom. He\u0027s from a new generation of short story writers imagineers, re-engineering everything for the reader.\"\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e -- Tom Paine, author of \u003cu\u003eA Boy\u0027s Book of Nervous Breakdowns\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello fellow readers and writers! I am a second-year Fiction MFA student, the acquisitions editor of \u003cem\u003eBarnstorm Journal\u003c/em\u003e, a recent finalist for Southwest Review\u0027s \u003cem\u003eMeyerson Fiction Prize\u003c/em\u003e, and an honorable mention in Glimmer Train\u0027s \u003cem\u003eNew Writers Award\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eVery Short Fiction Award\u003c/em\u003e. My stories have been published with\u003cem\u003e Reservoir, Buffalo Almanack, Kaaterskill Basin Literary Review,\u003c/em\u003e and others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m come to Patreon via Monica Byrne, whose Patreon video introduced me to the ways in which short fiction writers can earn a steady flow of financial assistance more efficiently through its services. As a writer working on their first novel however, it\u0027s harder to provide the same service: charging my backers for each completed work. Since creating and publishing a novel is a process that often takes years to complete, it would be harder to garner financial support with that structure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet, there may be lingering concerns that a novelist may not finish the project, that the money put into backing the efforts of the project risks not coming to fruition. Fortunately, as a student in a fiction program, the thesis -- this novel -- is my requirement for graduation. I\u0027ve already finished one-hundred pages of a first draft, and I\u0027m currently working on the second. In the coming semester, I will be working almost exclusively on its completion, with all my thesis hours compiled into a three month period, and summer, followed by continued thesis work in the fall of 2017.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, \u003cu\u003eI still need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile creating the novel costs little to nothing in theory, being in school, potential emergencies, traveling for conferences and thesis research, continuing education (which cannot be covered by financial aid) in the Fall semester of 2017, and devoting time to my Patreon feed will come at the cost of both time and money. The more money I raise from backers, the more security I\u0027ll be able to afford, and the more time I\u0027ll be able to devote to the novel. The more backers I have, the easier it will be to show publishers that I have a readership, thus raising the chances of its publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more people who help, the easier all this becomes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, you might be wondering: \u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I write about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrack stars jumping bottomless pits, Biblical apocalypses during the Westward Expansion, smart-mouthed sex demons, doppelgangers, and more! I have a specific love for the strange, surreal, and otherworldly. Writers like Kelly Link, Aimee Bender, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Jorge Luis Borges, Donald Barthelme, J. Robert Lennon, Umberto Eco, and Italo Calvino are some of many names that have inspired my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my novel about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA private detective, in an effort to maintain a secret from going public, is coerced by a police lieutenant to help track down her sister\u0027s boyfriend, who\u0027s falsified identity has led to a cold trail in the wake of his vanishing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you, the contributor, expect?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMeta-fiction\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea humorous premise growing darker over time\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt least one character who loves bad jokes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA mix of the supernatural, detective fiction, and a perfectly healthy obsession with the filmography of the Coen Brothers inspires this narrative.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s going to be a wild ride, so please join us!"
