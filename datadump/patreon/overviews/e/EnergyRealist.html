Besides having gone to San Francisco Dec. 2014 to target 24,000 visitors at the AGU conference in December I have been updating and adding citations to the book based on the same title as the website and Facebook group. The working title is Energy Reality: The Necessary Renaissance and how it can save our future, give us back the oceans, clean the air, fix the economy, eliminate most nuclear waste and supply fresh water.\u00a0I will be looking for a publisher.\u00a0The book has great potential for raising awareness about the energy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResponse #1 \"...Looks great! I like the exciting, narrative-driven approach....\" -\u00a0 S. Waldman, PhD, Risk Communicator\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResponse #2 \u00a0\"Rick, a nice piece of writing! You have ruined my morning, as I spent most of it reading your book instead of working! The Earth, Water, Air, Fire prism to view the World is a good one, but I will have to read a good deal more of your book to see how you develop the themes...Your book hit the sweet spot. I will be reading more. I hope you start to talk about Thorium energy as a more acceptable alternative...\" - T. Herring\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResponse #3 \"You continue to amaze me! And I thought you were \u0027just\u0027 a fantastic musician. As for the nuclear stuff, you manage to bring it down to a level I can understand. I enjoyed it!\"  J.

There are no groups at the grassroots level that enables a way to become informed that weigh in on all the issues. The model we encourage for change is to go beyond the computer. Reach out and get heard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have created three blogs about different aspects of energy and nuclear power. \u00a0My passion is to share my findings and ask that if you want to stop coal from ruining the oceans and stop the coal burning that kills humans and all kinds of wildlife that you join me. I will be happy with small donations because that is the most many of us can do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy other blogs are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://deregulatetheatom.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeregulate the atom\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thoriummsr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThoriumMSR\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThere is also a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/deregulatetheatom\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeregulate The Atom Facebook\u003c/a\u003e group and an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/energyreality\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEnergy Reality Facebook\u003c/a\u003e group."

     "about": "I am a citizen of Earth. I am a musician and writer, an ecomodernist/environmentalist who recognizes that energy is the key to what makes civilization function and \u00a0an artist mature in years. Priorities change for all of us. My music has been the most important part of my life. I now find myself leaning towards activism for causes that improve the quality of life. So my conclusions you will be surprised to learn about. Making a green paradise is not my short term goal, however raising awareness about the effects of burning fossil fuels such as coal, wood, dung, oil, natural gas etc is high on my list. So yes I can entertain you with my music. I have a few songs that express my love of life and nature. But I am here to fund my blogs and my latest book. You will discover that my planning has not been to become an international music sensation, although I would not turn down opportunities, but more to be a communicator and dare I say community leader.",
