Along the way, we stopped at a tiny island in the middle of the ocean, where I met a French sailor. He just so happened to ask me to be with him in Paris, so I got on a plane and went there! Now an author of fantasy, the writer of the Delos Diaries and a part of The Delos Project, I now bring you the French Diaries. In it, I\u0027ll be detailing this crazy adventure of mine whilst in France, talk about our travels and our new adventure of buying our own boat!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you as always for your kindness and love!",
