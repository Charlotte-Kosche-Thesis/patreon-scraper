Most importantly, by supporting the Esoteric Order of Roleplayers, you make it possible for us to keep this crazy gaming train a-rollin\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur recording philosophy is \u201cfriends around the table\u201d with minimal editing, with sessions usually lasting around three hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we do once-weekly group games and periodic \u201cduet\u201d games. Depending on funding levels, we may expand this to online games with select supporters as well, which will be recorded and added to the feed.\u003cbr\u003e"
