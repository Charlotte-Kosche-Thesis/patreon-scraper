    "summary": "Hello. These are two reoccuring comments I get from younger viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* \"You helped me improve my grades, because your approach to reasoning and information helped me learn how to think critically.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* \"You made me interested in politics, something I used to think was one of the most boring topics imaginable.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese comments are sometimes accompanied by a story of how the person used to be extremely politically correct. If you ask me, I don\u0027t think my work is entirely useless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook at the video above - that\u0027s what a pain in the ass it is to do videos. Even though my work may appear effortless it really isn\u0027t. Writing a script takes a couple of days since I want to gather sources and give a thoughtful analysis. Recording usually takes 5 hours. Editing can take 2 days and doing subtitles can take 2-4 hours depending on how long the video is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here you already know the kind of videos that I do, and what you personally get out of them. And sadly my channel is one of a kind in Sweden. YouTube is my main income and it\u0027s not really giving me a lot. If you like my work, feel free to donate say 1 dollar a month. If just half my subscribers would do this I\u0027d get a lot of money to live on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\nlife is more or less dedicated to my channel. Even when Im not making\nvideos, Im still involved in the process. Even when Im just casually\nbrowsing social media, I will come across something and go: \u201dHey, I\nshould include that in a video.\u201d Even when Im not making videos, Im\nstill writing future scripts, or perhaps doing research. Of course I\njust chill out and do nothing as well, in other to recharge my\nbatteries, but the point is this: It\u0027s an interwoven continual\nprocess. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen followers write me for help, I take the time to\ngive them advice. Of course I don\u0027t have the time to reply to every\nsingle message I get, but I do read most of them, and take the time\nto engage when it truly matters. That\u0027s why I think it\u0027s reasonable\nto ask for a monthly sum.\u003cbr\u003e"
