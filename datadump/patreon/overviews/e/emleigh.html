Content for us just doesn\u0027t exist, it turns out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where From the Veins Press comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe armada of characters who are chomping at the bit to change the way you think about science, magic, love, and life are dying to be let loose into this world; but they (and I) need your support.

Leigh is a queer, genderfluid medical student and freelance author who probably spends too much time playing with their cat and drinking hipster beer at a hipster co-op with their fiance.
