My students and congregants are encouraged to consider Patreon as an option for supporting my clergy service on their behalf, as they are able, but no one is turned away from my rituals or public services for lack of funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get what I can done on my own time and dime, but right now my resources are very limited, and it slows me down tremendously. Currently I am almost completely financially dependent on my partner. While he is a wonderful, supportive man, he is also an atheist, and I can not in good conscience expect him to single-handedly support my clergy practice in service to a community that doesn\u0027t include him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon patronage would allow me to remove the financial burden of any Pagan expenses, at least, from his shoulders. If I received more, it would contribute to my further education and living expenses, allowing me to focus more of my time and effort specifically on my clergy services, and devotional writing and art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--Ember--\u003cbr\u003e"
