    "summary": "After 20+ years studying art history, architecture, folklore, ethnography, and archetypal imagery, native New York artist Emily Anne presents her original hand-drawn ink and paper graphic designs.\u003cbr\u003eDrawing on her studies of indigenous art from sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, the Pacific Northwest, the American Southwest, the Pacific Islands, pre-Hellenic Indian subcontinent, and all pre-Roman pagan European and Mediterranean societies, Emily brings a fresh, fluid, modern vision to themes present in art from the Paleolithic to the postmodern.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAll of Emily Anne\u0027s designs are original pieces, the creation of which takes between one day and one week. Each piece may evolve into a larger or smaller finished product, in some cases becoming a continuum of variations on a theme.\u003cbr\u003eEmily Anne is pleased and proud to bring you, the monthly Patreon Subscriber, a guaranteed one medium sized original drawing per week and one large drawing per month - with between 5-7 smaller graphics, \"blink\" drawings or concept proofs - occasionally, high quality live photographs of New York City architecture, landscape or character-driven portraiture may be offered in lieu of ink and paper submissions if they are in keeping with Emily Anne\u0027s aesthetic. Finished drawings will only be available for viewing/download by Patreon supporters, but any level of support will have access to digital images of finished pieces - in other words, you can view and download digital images of Emily Anne\u0027s work for as little as $1/month!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease contact Emily Anne directly with any requests, questions or concerns. Thank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
