    "summary": "Thank you for coming to my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am a writer, currently working on a science-fiction story series, \u003cem\u003eEvery Man\u0027s Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e, which can be found on the Literotica website \u003ca href=\"https://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?uid=1519345\u0026amp;page=submissions\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e (opens in a new tab, or do a web search for \u0027Literotica, Erinaceous\u0027 - over 18s only).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEvery Man\u0027s Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e is set in the future and features a man who discovers a planet of women. It has sexual content but the story isn\u0027t quite so stupid as it sounds (if I may say so myself).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn accompaniment to the story series is a stand-alone story that I wrote for the Literotica Geek Pride event in May 2018. \u003cem\u003eMurder on Capella Space Station\u003c/em\u003e is a murder mystery set in the same narrative world as \u003cem\u003eEvery Man\u0027s Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e but dated 15 years before chapter 1. It features an event in the earlier lives of some of the characters and adds some background to the story series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will publish new chapter here on Patreon first and then on Literorica. My aim is a chapter a month but we\u0027ll have to see if that is possible due to many work committments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe version of \u003cem\u003eEvery Man\u0027s Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e on the Literotica website is not the final version, which I plan to publish in the form of series of novels (six or seven). Improved versions of the story (in html, mobi and many other formats) will be future rewards for Patrons. I am working to sharpen the dialogue, cut out some padding, eliminate loose plot threads and generally polish up the work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also working on other rewards for Patrons, such as a list of characters. If I can earn enough, I want to commission art-works (a bit like the image of the blonde Woodlander girl - Carlin Erinsdaughter, perhaps - on my banner) to illustrate the story and be front-covers to the novels. I know exactly what Widlchild, Yael and Hestia look like. I will start trying to commission illustrations next month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso if I earn enough, I will commission book covers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that everyone who enjoys my story will become a Patron and support my writing. If would like to devote as much time as I can to writing (which I love), first by completing \u003cem\u003eEvery Man\u0027s Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e, then moving onto a new project which exists in outline so far. It is an adventure story, with a mystery, danger and some sex.\u003cbr\u003e"
