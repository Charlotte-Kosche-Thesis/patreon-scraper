However I will say that I\u0027ve been writing pathfinder campaigns and short stories for almost 5 years alongside conceptual art for my group as well as commissioned projects. Other than that I\u0027m just an average person that has a penchant for anime, manga, and a bad sleep schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow what\u00a0 I want to do focus more on personal projects though and breathe life into my imagined characters and worlds, mainly in the context of standalone portraits and written chapters with interludes of character art. However as I am very scattered in my focus, don\u0027t be surprised by odd songs, 3d modeling, and memes.
