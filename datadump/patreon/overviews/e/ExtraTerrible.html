You have very wisely, decided to assist one mad individual to frustrate hundreds, if not thousands of people with his ridiculous fever dream of an engineering project, while finding new ways to interact, inspire, and create with one another through the magic of VIDEO GAMES. You are very smart, and attractive (mostly attractive) for making this bold and attractive move.

Jason makes a couple controllers that should have never existed, and his friends try to play them without leaving in anger.
