You can always put a limit to the amount you want to pledge per month to safe guard yourself in case I go completely artistically crazy and start writing 50 songs per month. Your donation will be automatically deducted from your account at the end of the month. You can change your pledge amount at any time. Each tier of pledging has different fun rewards. See below!"
