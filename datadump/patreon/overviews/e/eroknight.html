    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m EroKnight! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI draw R-18 works which can be found on \u003ca href=\"http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=15376185\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePixiv\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/EroKnight/profile\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHentai-Foundry\u003c/a\u003e. However, both sites have file size limitations. The former also sometimes requires censorship, and the latter doesn\u0027t allow... easily more than half of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been asked a few times if I had a Patreon, and seeing so many artists I know on here has convinced me that I need to have one running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, almost all of my works are commissioned pieces. I honestly haven\u0027t drawn for myself in forever, but I believe Patreon could assist me in doing so-- and bringing you more art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to run this Patreon kind of like a blog. I\u0027ll post works in progress (WIPs) of the pieces I\u0027m working on, sketches, studies, and of course final illustrations. Perhaps I\u0027ll do a tutorial or two down the line. And you know, I\u0027ve always wanted to do a doujin. There\u0027s a huge artist community on here, especially for NSFW art, and I want to contribute in any way I can. And of course, improve my own art in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery drawing I post here will be available to everyone in high resolution and uncensored in .PNG format. The full resolutions (3500x5000px+) will be available to Patrons at the $5 tier and upward. I would like to one day create an artbook for these works, if possible, but I won\u0027t even be able to get to that point without your help. If I use this site for a while, I\u0027ll have a better grasp of how best to deliver the artwork. Until then, I\u0027ll add everything to the feed, and try my best to keep everything organized!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in the process of restructuring my tags. With only five, I wasn\u0027t too sure how to do it up until now, but I will be prioritizing two tags in every post-- \u003cstrong\u003eFull Resolution\u003c/strong\u003e/\u003cstrong\u003eSmall\u003c/strong\u003e/\u003cstrong\u003eWIP\u003c/strong\u003e for the \u003cem\u003etype\u003c/em\u003e of image it is, and then the property the drawing\u0027s characters belong to. This way, those of you with slower browsers or on mobile devices can go to the \u003cstrong\u003eSmall\u003c/strong\u003e tag for easy browsing, and patrons can click right to \u003cstrong\u003eFull Resolution\u003c/strong\u003e to only see full images without the clutter of everything else. As soon as I find a good place to host .PSB files (they are way too big to upload directly to Patreon, even zipped), I\u0027ll be sure to add a \u003cstrong\u003ePSD \u003c/strong\u003etag. (I use PSB files since they can be much larger, but \"PSD\" is much more known.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have gotten into streaming earlier than I thought, so come by \u003ca href=\"https://piczel.tv/watch/eroknight\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePiczel\u003c/a\u003e if you\u0027d like to see me work!\u003cbr\u003e"
