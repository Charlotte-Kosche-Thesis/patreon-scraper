    "summary": "In 2013 I heard about Bitcoin, ... so what. Just a toy money I thought. But, what if, just what if it could be useful, somehow. After reading about it more and more, I decided to buy my first 0.2 BTC. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI watched my wallet, I got another wallet, I transfered BTC from one wallet to another.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 I bought my first miner, then another one, then a third one, then - I made the big jump to buy a bigger miner, actually two pieces together with my friend Joseph.\u003cbr\u003eI calculated, that in just 17.5 days I could have a RoI of 100% of the miners\u0027 cost. However, the delivery was delayed, then finally we go the miners and the power consumption was much higher than in the web description. We got the miners and the company disappeared. Well, at least we got our miners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI setup a pool, with auto switching, ... great! Now Joseph could just point the miner to my pool as I do and the pool will switch to the best performing coin. The plan was perfect, however, Joseph is married, ... the miner is too loud, ... he could not turn on the miner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen the big drop of Bitcoin price came and we could not earn anything more than the power bill. We turned off the miners. My miner worked 5 weeks, Joseph\u0027s miner worked only when his wife was not at home for a total of 40 hours. Clearly not a way to earn the miner\u0027s cost back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I found the next big thing: to trade with coins. Yahoo!!! I could with a small amount of money and with the mining of exotic coins get some money together, I invested into a trading bot. Excited I watched as the coins got more and more, ... then the bot was not maintained anymore. Again!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI switched to another trading bot.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used all my money and invested in C.A.T. (Cryptocurrency Automatic Trader), I set it up, I learned and learned, ... and I helped others. I helped many people and forgot that I could benefit in the same time from my knowledge of operating the bot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where we are now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know more about C.A.T., go to \u003ca href=\"https://cat.elmit.com\"\u003ehttps://cat.elmit.com\u003c/a\u003e and if you want to know more about me, go to my online business card: \u003ca href=\"https://bc.elmit.com\"\u003ehttps://bc.elmit.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the next step?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany things to come:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinish, enhance all the pages here on Patreon as well as post some articles\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd more intelligence to the chat bot on my Telegram channel\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd videos here \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd more function to my https://cat.elmit.com web site, like F\u0026amp;Q, ...
