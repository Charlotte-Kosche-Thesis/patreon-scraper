If not, that\u0027s fine, and I appreciate you coming to visit my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently a student at SCAD working toward a BFA in Animation, and pretty soon I\u0027ll be graduating. Aside from of course art, I love to play video games (PS4 is my console of choice), watch movies, create worlds and characters to live in said worlds, and basically over-analyze my favorite shows/games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve used this patreon before in the past to support my work as a hobby but I\u0027ve since evolved as an artist and, in turn, I\u0027d like to change this patreon to help support me as a freelancer and a professional artist. The content shown here will either be early access before I post it on one of my social medias, or completely exclusive, where only my patrons will be able to view said content when its released. This includes WIPs of artwork and animation, storyboards, visual development work on my indie films, and maybe even polls where you help me decide what I should work on next!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money gained from this patreon will go toward the things I need: food, clothes, art supplies, better equipment for animation, stuff that I can use to churn out better content for myself and for those of you who choose to support it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny type of support, monetary or not, is appreciated far more than you will ever know, and I thank you all so much for taking the time to look at my work! Please feel more than free to ask me anything if you have questions or concerns and I\u0027ll respond as promptly as possible. And thank you again for visiting my patreon!\u003cbr\u003e"
