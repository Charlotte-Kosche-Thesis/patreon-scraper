    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patereon page and thank you for stopping by, I greatly appreciate all of my patrons and future patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Esca Bowmer and I am a writer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is a Novel? A book of long narratives in literary prose. And what is a book? A\n set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of ink, \npaper, parchment, or other materials, usually fastened together to hinge\n at one side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore I have to ask myself \u2026 What AM I creating?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am happy to report that although I haven\u0027t obtained any degrees in English or creative writing (unless communications count?) I am a writer\n who reads as much as I write. And although self taught and disciplined I\n have successfully completed 4 years of NaNoWriMo \n(\u003ca href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/),\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.nanowrimo.org/),\u003c/a\u003e won short story competitions, had my work \npublished in various places both online and in print, a book published and created scripts for radio. All of this whilst working a full time job in the demanding IT industry!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut fate and destiny have stepped in and dealt me a new hand, in the form of redundancy from my day job. Now this could be a negative and I could bitch about circumstances, or I could look at this in a positive light and say this is a sign to finally pursue my passion full time - which is the dream and one well worth chasing! I chose to feel positive and I believe with your support I can make my dreams a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough your patronage I hope to be able to create works of fiction - be they novel, novella, short story or flash fiction - for everyone to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will set me free and allow me to focus on my creativity and write full time and produce some of my best work yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Website is \u003ca href=\"http://www.escabowmer.com/ \" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy Blog is \u003ca href=\"http://escabowmer.blogspot.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
