    "summary": "\n\nAt Esprit Tech and Jeti USA, we are always on the lookout for ways to improve our level of service. From improving our product offering to after sales support, we want our customers to be happy with the decision to give us their hard earned money. One of the ways that we have tried to do this is through our product support videos. We have covered new products and services available, done comparison videos to help in product selection, and created an entire series of introductory and programming videos to support our line of products. These have always been short videos with an attempt to give the customer just enough to get them on to the next step.  We have come to realize that while these short videos are great for some of our customers, but a large percentage of you would really appreciate if we can offer more. Maintaining a unique and customized view in today\u2019s complex and ever-evolving world is the only way to go forward. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGRAFIKA: Where Your Money Goes\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where Patreon comes in to play. We will now be able to offer more in-depth content for the customers who need it. Our Patreon page is about building a community around the passion that we all share for model aviation. This new platform will allow us to tailor the content to the needs of those who take part in this new community with us. Need a specific topic covered. Want us to address a programming or technical solution that you are looking for, we can do that too. For a tiny fee, we will be able to provide exactly what you need; it\u2019s all about combining resources and creating a community. This doesn\u2019t mean that we will be eliminating all of our existing free content; just that we are adding a platform to provide highly customizable solutions to those who need it most.
