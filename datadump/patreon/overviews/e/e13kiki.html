I also spent many years on a detour as a digital marketing strategist before finally returning full time to what do best and love the most in life: creating illustration art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut this here is not about my commercial work. With your support, I can use Patreon to help me spend more time with my personal art, espcially art featuring Bear. My ultimate goal is to be able to support myself solely from this personal art that I so love to make. To achieve this I need the time and thus the funding to take this step.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://e13.de/artstore/wp-content/uploads/Bibliobaer_Detail.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003eBear in his library\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWho is Bear?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve been best friends with \n\u003cstrong\u003ea fun-loving, dry Martinis drinking bear with an epic classical library and a giant appetite for fresh salmon and hot Bratwurst\u003c/strong\u003e my whole life.
