Since my stay with the Yawanaw\u00e1 tribe in 2011 during their festival, I\u2019ve been so moved by the evolution of their music, from traditional chants to soul-stirring songs accompanied by guitar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Yawanaw\u00e1 songbook will be a downloadable PDF and multimedia experience. It will involve collaborative effort between individuals in the tribe, Brazilian friends who have visited the tribe, taken groups to the village and accompanied the Yawanaw\u00e1 in their journeys to other parts of the world.  Here\u2019s what\u2019s involved with putting this songbook together:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst we need to verify that the words are written correctly, and we need the help of a member of the tribe to do this. There are many informally transcribed songs, with people\u2019s best phonetization of the words done by Brazilians and other Westerners, written out from people listening to ceremony recordings, but this is not the same as having the language written correctly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe also want to include information about the tribe, as well as their own introduction to this work. This requires the assistance of a translator who can simultaneously translate their Portuguese into English. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe want to record on video Yawanawa musicians singing the song, so that we can include audio with the song lyrics, rather than include a clip cut out of an ayahuasca ceremony, with people vomiting in the background.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u2019ll include professional photos of the tribe.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe want to enlist the help of a professional musician to indicate the correct guitar chords. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere\u2019s also the graphic design of the book, and putting together the web pages that will host the video as well as the lyrics, should people want to click through to the recording.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThis digital songbook is a labor of love and will be offered to the world for free, for anyone who wants to learn and sing these powerful healing songs from the forest. In order to bring this work to fruition, we are calling upon the support of our tribe to make this project a reality, so we can share the culture and music of the Yawanaw\u00e1 people around the world. \u003cbr\u003e"
