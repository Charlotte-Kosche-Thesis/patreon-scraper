It grew out of the former Experimental Film Society collective which was formed and managed by the company\u2019s founder and director, Rouzbeh Rashidi. EFS concentrates on nurturing film projects which reflect the distinctive cinematic vision that it developed over its eighteen year existence as a not-for-profit collective. EFS produces films that are distinguished by an uncompromising devotion to personal, experimental cinema. These films adopt an exploratory, often lyrical approach to filmmaking and foreground mood, atmosphere, visual rhythms, and the sensory interplay of sound and image. EFS is at the centre of a new wave of Irish experimental filmmaking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEFS also curates screenings of experimental film, mainly by filmmakers and artists associated with it, both nationally and internationally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEFS was founded in 2000 in Tehran, Iran by Rouzbeh Rashidi and has been based in Dublin, Ireland since 2004. As a film collective, it produced, co-produced, or otherwise assisted in the production of over fifty no-budget or very low-budget feature-length films and 500 short films. In 2011, EFS began to organise screenings, performances and talks, an initiative which has since resulted in over one hundred events all around the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn mid-2017, EFS became a company limited by guarantee to facilitate the increasingly ambitious and professionally funded projects it now focuses on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo request or book the Experimental Film Society programme, please contact:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eexperimentalfilmsociety@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eRouzbeh Rashidi archives and produces films by EFS filmmakers, as well as arranging, programming, and presenting screenings of this constantly-growing body of work. He also manages all EFS online video hosting (including EFS \u2018\u003ca href=\"http://www.experimentalfilmsociety.com/video-on-demand/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVideo On Demand\u003c/a\u003e\u2019) where a selection of short, medium, and feature-length films are available for streaming and download.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.experimentalfilmsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mirage-1024x576.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eEFS is getting bigger and bigger, with EFS filmmakers creating new films constantly, and screenings and events happening all over the world. This is great! But the other side of the coin is that the costs and the workload associated with running EFS are also increasing. EFS is run on an entirely voluntary basis and the small income generated from screening fees doesn\u0027t begin to cover the basic expenses incurred. So far, core costs have been covered almost entirely by Rashidi and other EFS filmmakers out of their own pockets, but this is becoming increasingly unfeasible as activity increases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe crucial value behind EFS and experimental art in general is creative freedom, the willingness and ability to break boundaries formally, thematically and sensorially. It\u0027s not news that this type of work and commercial imperatives don\u0027t sit together easily - or at all! This is why we\u0027re using Patreon to reach out to adventurous viewers who value such uncompromising work and might consider becoming patrons of our truly untameable art.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will your money be spent?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eWe are seeking to cover the basic running costs of EFS: administration, materials, the upkeep of our websites, promotion and running of our screenings and other events. But our most pressing and urgent concern is the maintenance of our archive. To safely store and protect our legacy of some 60 feature films and 500 short films requires a constant updating of hard drives. Any support for this is hugely appreciated.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wK0dli9mliw/VKp5GAicmVI/AAAAAAAABjI/Xm5gxvmDWe0/s1600/8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
