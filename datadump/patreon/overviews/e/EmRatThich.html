You love this sport and you want to improve your table tennis as fast as possible?\u003cbr\u003eIf yes, welcome to my channel dedicated to free\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eTable Tennis Coach Videos.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a table tennis coach in France. I started to coach young developing players since \u003cstrong\u003e2012\u003c/strong\u003e. I have full-time jobs and during my weekend spare time, I create detailed videos about Table Tennis Coaching Videos. Every Sunday, I upload one video about table tennis (tactics, techniques or equipment) on my Youtube channel. I collect the ideas during my work days, and at the weekend, I make a video montage and narration. This process takes normally about 6h - 8h to finish, I normally end up at 2 am Sunday morning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I include the time that I need to watch several table tennis tutorials (mostly in English and in Chinese), \u003cstrong\u003e10 minutes\u003c/strong\u003e coaching video can take upwards of \u003cstrong\u003e18\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0hours\u003c/strong\u003e. With the help of my friend (Chinese), I will transfer the idea, the philosophy into English as clear and as simple as possible. English is not my native language, so I have to narrate several times for one phrase in my video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking table tennis videos is very entertaining. Your feedback about your progress has motivated me a lot. That\u0027s the main reason that I continue to make these videos on Youtube. This activity is only my hobby so I can\u0027t make many table tennis videos as you request. I think that making a Patreon page maybe a good idea to promote the serious table tennis coaching. With your support on Patreon, I can put more time on creating table tennis coaching videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well for those of you that may be new to Patreon, a pledge is a recurring monthly donation. You are free to opt out at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eEmRatThich Table Tennis Coach\u003cbr\u003e"
