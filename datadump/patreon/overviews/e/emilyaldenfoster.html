    "summary": "Hi,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Emily and I make a lot of awesome stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have seen some of my videos or read one of my zines, or maybe you avidly consume everything I make. I love making this stuff and sharing it with people. In the past two years my videos have been featured in 8 shows, festivals, and tours all over the world. I\u0027ve traveled to zinefests in five cities, and done readings of my work at two of them. All of that might sound impressive, but unfortunately it hasn\u0027t made me any money. Photocopies, table fees, and entry fees add up to more than I make off of my zines and videos, and that doesn\u0027t even account for the idea of paying myself for the time I spend working on these things. I\u0027m lucky that I\u0027m able to make art at all, but\u00a0I would love to make it a more financially sustainable part of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is where Patreon comes in! You can pledge to make a small (or large!) financial contribution for each video or zine project I complete. This will help me cover the costs of making things and distributing them throughout the world, and maybe even pay me a little bit for the hundreds of hours I spend making stop-motion animations or crossword puzzles. Hundreds of hours is actually an understatement. Not all of my projects are as labor intensive, but one crossword puzzle zine took me 1,000 hours to compile. A stop-motion video usually takes even more time. Sometimes I\u0027m working on things for a really extended time period (Gold Diggers of 1829 took 3 years) and sometimes I finish things really fast (Busmograph took a week once all the drawings were compiled). So I don\u0027t do a TON of projects, but I do usually complete something new every month or so. Patreon is cool because you can set a limit on how much you donate per month - so if you pledge $10/project but you can\u0027t afford more than $20/month, you can set a $20/month limit for yourself. That way if I finish 8 projects in a month you\u0027ll only donate for the first two. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to keep making videos and zines, regardless of the finances. The videos I make will continue to be available to watch for free online. The zines I make will continue to be sold for slightly more than they cost to copy. So if you like my work but don\u0027t want to make a financial contribution, that\u0027s okay. I also accept kind words and good vibes. However, any monetary donation you could make would be greatly appreciated. And there are cool rewards for donating! Hooray!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! You are the best!"
