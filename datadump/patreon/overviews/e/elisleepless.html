Currently it\u0027s also a way to push back against the homogeny and lack of representation in the art world. I was motivated seeing relatives and other loved ones trying to conform to specific beauty standards, or rejecting it but having few honest imagery they relate to. I want to make images that viewers connect with and see themselves in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also shoot self portraits, although not as consistently. I turn the camera on myself to remember situations I was in and to explore multiple identities as a trans artist with OCD (among other things). Sometimes it\u0027s a coping mechanism to push through turbulent emotions. Sometimes it\u0027s just self reflection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to use half of my Patreon earnings to help with the bills that come with living in the city so I can focus more on making art and a little less on what kind of Metrocard I can get. The other half would help me directly with shoots (buying and developing film).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be donating 10% a month to organizations that support women\u0027s healthcare, lgbtq organizations, and personal fundraisers to donate directly to people in need. When I reach 200 I\u0027ll start donating 15%.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for viewing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(from a piece I submitted to Autostraddle)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u2019m saying is not\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat art solved my problems but instead\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat the strength I found through creating and through fighting back still pushes me forward\u003c/strong\u003e"
