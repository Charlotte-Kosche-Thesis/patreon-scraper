Currently, only the first 7 issues of Fusion and the trade collection of Episode 1 of Dude in Distress are available in\n print format, but I expect to add several new print comics in 2018 including Issues 8 and 9 of Fusion, and the first trade paperback collection of Fusion\n(collecting the first story arc of \"Welcome to My Life\" in Issues 1-4, as well as bonus content exclusive to the trade collection). If things really get to crackin\u0027, I might even be able to get the trade collection of Episode 2 of Dude in Distress ready by the end of the year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support here will not only help with production of Essay Bee Comics material, but it\u0027ll also be sure to thrill Savunn. Patrons will also have access to some exclusive behind-the-scenes material (with lots of exposition), and early peeks at material that\u0027ll eventually post to the webcomic sites.\u003cbr\u003e"
