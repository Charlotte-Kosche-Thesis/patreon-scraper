     "about": "My name is Elizabeth Sullivan, I\u0027m  a 23 year old cosplayer and costumer maker based in Kent in the United Kingdom.\u00a0I have always been creative, loved to dress up and play games since I can remember, so when I found out about cosplay it seemed like the perfect hobby for me, I could carry on doing my favourite things and become a part of a friendly community. It has helped me find friends with similar interests and dressing up at conventions has built up my confidence.\u003cbr\u003eAlong with a creative lifestyle I have always wanted a creative career, I have formal qualifications in Art and Design and Photography and attended the University of Creative Arts where I gained a Foundation Diploma in Fashion Design and Textiles.\u003cbr\u003eOnce I finished university I decided it was time to leave my full time job find somewhere part time so  was more free to follow my dreams of doing something I have a passion for and do well, I started off making a few Disney princess costumes for a company in the area and from there I had several people contacting me for commissioned pieces. I have met so many great people and learnt a lot of new things from them, I want to continue gaining skills and hope that one day i\u0027l be able to go full time making costumes and taking commissions for people such as yourself to purchase.\u003cbr\u003eOther than making costumes in my free time I also love photography, watching films and TV series and playing games on PC, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.\u003cbr\u003e",

It\u0027s great for use on amour and weapons as well as creating little accessories. The material is really durable but still quite light and has the ability to add ridiculous amounts of detail to your costumes! I used this on most of my armored Murloc cosplay.",
