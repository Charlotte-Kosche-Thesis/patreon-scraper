Unfortunately, I overworked myself on commissions and patron rewards, got a new job as a paramedic, my mother\u0027s health declined, got behind on EVERYTHING I owed people, and really found myself in a funk. So for 2018, I decided to shut down my commissions, at least temporarily, and concentrate on personal projects and clearing out my queue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027m starting to find my rhythm, I\u0027m trying to be a better artist and start posting regularly, so I\u0027m back at patreon with a few new twists! I\u0027m not here to overwhelm myself again with trying to fufill rewards, so everything will be really simple. But I\u0027ve got something for everyone! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here because you like my work and want to support me, you are FANTASTIC and I\u0027ll be happy to reward you with all the behind the scenes views, early access content, and discounts and free content on my plushies and art that I can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here because you want to learn all I can impart about plushing and embroidery, I\u0027m SUPER excited to teach and help you improve your craft! Ask any questions you may have, learn my processes, and get access to free embroidery files and patterns for your own use!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever the reason that you\u0027re here, I\u0027m unbelievably excited to have you, and I\u0027m honored that you love my work enough to support me! Any amount, even at a $1 tier, helps me keep doing what I love without the fear and anxiety of working on my passion that isn\u0027t paying the bills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

If I\u0027m making this much per month, though, I can finally take the time to realize my dream of imparting this knowledge to the world! After I\u0027ve done the ones I have planned, I\u0027ll happily take suggestions for the next series!",
