(They seem to have a LOT of knowledge ...and great guest interviews!)\u00a0Sylvia and Diana have interviewed equine trainers, veterinarians, clinicians, Olympic athletes, and even scientists!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShortly after May 2014 something happened and they began to become overwhelmed with life and turned to other activities to pay the bills :-(\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAmazingly enough, fans began to ask if they were going to record and publish again and, truly, although it was difficult, Sylvia and Diana really missed producing the podcast and would gladly confront all the difficulties again to get back to their recording schedule, if only...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSylvia and Diana love horses, love their fans, and both they and their horses need to eat and be well to keep creating and producing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e...if only they could cover their bills and still create! Then Sylvia learned about Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat the Heck is Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaha... This takes Sylvia back to 1995 when she asked, \"What the heck is the Internet!\" ...but we digress... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is one way that you can help Sylvia and Diana cover their costs for the creation of Equinely-Inclined! to bring you even more episodes and perhaps some super special rewards as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose an amount to pledge per month and, depending on the amount of your pledge and the rewards they have set up, you will have access to their creations and possibly special episodes or events!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Support is Truly Appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love learning about horsey stuff, and hearing about Sylvia and Diana\u0027s sometimes crazy equine adventures, please help them out by supporting their efforts to bring all the best equine info your way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t have one already, set up your Patreon patron account and choose your amount to pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page and all the rewards and monthly levels are a work in progress. Check back to see what new rewards are being offered so you can see if you want to make a change to your monthly pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh! Did you know that only patrons can post on the Equinely-Inclined! Patreon page?
