    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Our Shows\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe shows we produce at the Excellence In Podcast Studio all follow a similar mantra - to provide the best, honest, safe for work audio content we possibly can. We\u0027ve seen a number of \"success stories\" shared privately by listeners - be it the resolution of personal problems, technical issues, or just providing the motivation to make it through another day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.hearthcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHearthcast\u003c/a\u003e - Covering the World of Warcraft and the rest of the extended Blizzard Universe.\u003cbr\u003eSince 2009, Hearthcast has been covering the Blizzard Universe on a weekly. Rewt and Freckleface provide everything from tricks and tid-bits to insightful information they hope you\u0027ll find useful in the World of Warcraft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Rewt\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been podcasting for over 17 years, always striving for the best quality sound and engaging content I could provide. My passion for podcasting has outgrown my home, and my journey has led to to create a micro-studio we loving call The Excellence In Podcasts\u0027 Studio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started podcasting in my computer room in my home, I had a single \"mini jack\" microphone plugged into my laptop. I\u0027d have to keep everyone in the house silent for the duration of the recordings, outtakes and all. With a drive to continually improve on sound quality, I have found myself setting up micro-studios in my places of employment, and then finally finding a small 20x10 room I could lease to give my equipment a safe location to call home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout The Crew\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not just me, either. I know the limited success I have achieved already is largely due to the people in my immediate circles who either podcast with me as co-hosts, provide helpful advice, or even lend a hand in giving me technical support when I\u0027ve needed it. This is as much about them as it is me, if not more. I owe a lot to each of those people for their efforts and support over the years. I\u0027ve pledged my time, knowledge, and insights to each of them in hopes to build their successes as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout The Studio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started in a small room at my house. That grew into dragging gear into a conference room in a downtown Orlando office building (with horrible acoustics, I might add!). From there, I started occupying unused space at my place of employment. All along I was trading up equipment searching for better and better quality. Now we record in a much more controlled environment, although it can be a bit confining as it\u0027s only a 20x10 office space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe walls of the Excellence In Podcast\u0027s Studio are covered with memories. From events we\u0027ve attended, places we\u0027ve gone, \u00a0a paperback library started by one of our listeners, to a hand drawn envelope art from friends. It\u0027s the memories we make each episode we produce that drives us to continue striving for the best quality we can achieve, supported by emails, tweets, phone calls, and more from our loyal listening audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that each of you work hard for every dollar you have, and I greatly appreciate any amount that can be sent our way each month. It\u0027s true what they all say, every little bit does help. As outlined in our goal process, everything we gain will be put back into the shows we produce at the studio in one form or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I close this piece, I\u0027d like to thank each of you for reading. Until next time, this has been Rewt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHumbly,\u003cbr\u003e~Rewt"
