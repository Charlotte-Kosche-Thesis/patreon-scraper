No record label. No middle man or woman. Just you and me. Patron to creator,\ncreator to Patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my intention, through my music, to offer you something that is healing, nurturing and supportive to you personally and to our collective experience of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic is not only an art,\nit is a human need. All life is made up of vibration. We all carry a song\nwithin us and when we connect to music through listening, live performance and\nonline mediums, we touch our own humanity and basic ability for compassion, something much needed during these times. \u00a0Art, and music especially,\nbuilds community, creates a deep relatedness across cultural, religious,\npolitical, and social differences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to join me here, I am not only\ndeeply grateful, but I hope in being part of this journey with me you will find\njoy, connection, and a deeper sense of open-heartedness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I dive into the nitty gritty of Patreon and how it all works, here\u0027s\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little background and some things you should know:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been a working artist since 2011. Since that time, I have been fortunate to make\nmy living through various combinations of teaching and performing music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2016 with the support of over 200 people, I raised $7,000 to finally complete my first\nfull length album \u201cLittle World.\u201d This incredible gift from my community, has\nallowed me to work with a wonderful producer in an effort to bring my recorded music to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2017 and beyond, Patreon is a continuation of this effort\nto grow and share my music with more and more people. Your patronage helps me continue\nto create music and live as a working artist. Unlike kickstarter, your\ndonations do not go specifically to a project (although they do help outway costs\nlike recording, website hosting, touring ect) \u2013 but in all transparency, your\nsupport also helps me to pay for my life so I can devote my time and energy to\nmaking music. There is a lot time that goes into being an artist from daily\nmusic practice, song writing and rehearsing to recording, making videos and handling\nthe \u201cbiz\u201d side like booking and promoting shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a Patron, you are helping me to put in the time it takes to bring you the best music I can make, devoting my time to creating and sharing with less and less time spent teaching, fundraising, and whatever else I must do sometimes to \u201cpay the bills.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you become a Patron, you are supporting my 2017 goals to:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRelease my first full length studio album \u201cLittle\nWorld.\u201d\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eDo a series of mini east-coast tours, made up of\nmostly House Concerts (my favorite performance environment.

As I grow, I may release content\nmore often. To ensure that you never contribute more per month then what works for you, be sure to set your \u201cmonthly maximum.\" For example: If you want to give $3 per song, but never\nwant to pay more then this per month, set your monthly max at $3 so you know\nyou will only be charged $3 or less each month. You can set this at your final step\nof checking out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eSome of the songs I release here on Patreon, will\neventually be available via iTunes and Spotify, but you get to hear them first\nand some of them are exclusive to Patrons and will not be released elsewhere\nelse.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eAs a patron you will get access to my Patreon\nfeed (like a private FB group) where we get to interact and you get exclusive Patron\nonly posts where I regularly post blogs, musings, updates, answere your\nquestions or feedback and share with you:\u2026 (..()\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eI post to the patron feed every 1-4 weeks, so\ncheck back soon, post your questions and enjoy being part of my community!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nI hope you will decide to join me on this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour support means the world to me.

     "about": "Emma Back is a musician, coach, healer, teacher and thought leader in feminine empowerment and founder of SSOL (SHE SINGS OUT LOUD).  A Gypsy-Folk-Pop songstress, fiddler, live looping and vocal artist, Emma has been creating music and performing her entire life and has been a full time touring musician since 2011. She is in the process of recording her second album and has performed in the US, France, England, and Israel.  Emma has trained extensively in spiritual and personal empowerment disciplines including Tibetan Buddhism and Jewish Renewal and as a coach with Landmark Education.  She holds a BA in music from Naropa University - an institution specializing in contemplative and Buddhist inspired education. Emma is on a mission to help people connect deeply with one another, dissolving the barriers of separation that she believes are at the root of war and suffering.  She aspires to be one of many voices currently emerging to help re-awakening feminine values (in ALL genders).  She is fiercely committed to her own self growth, continuing to inquire, discover and integrate what it is to be a woman and live from feminine wisdom as an artist, spiritual seeker, and peace activist in today\u2019s modern world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Emma\u2019s music:\u003cbr\u003eEmma Back is a dynamic and passionate performer.  Songstress, vocalist, fiddler and live looping artist, she emerges from Balkan, French, Klezmer and Americana Folk influences.  With Sensual, Bold and Raw Expression, she uses a loop pedal system to create an intricate sonic experience yet her songs embody at their core the simplicity and heart of the troubadour.  Emma\u2019s lyrics have been called \u201cvisual to the point of a cinematic short film\u201d (Colorado Music Buzz), invoking the voice of the divine feminine and world issues of war and diaspora.  Her powerful presence onstage creates a sacred intimate space where her audience can touch their humanity and deepest longing for connection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.shesingsoutloud.com\"\u003ewww.shesingsoutloud.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.emmasong.com\"\u003ewww.emmasong.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:emma@emmasong.com\"\u003eemma@emmasong.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
