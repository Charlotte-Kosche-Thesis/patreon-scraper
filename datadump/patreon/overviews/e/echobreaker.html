    "summary": "Hi Everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Echobreaker and I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia. I have been a DJ/Mashup artist for over 6 years. I got into music because, to put it simply,\u003cstrong\u003e I LOVE MUSIC\u003c/strong\u003e! I love the way it makes me feel and I love sharing that feeling to others. Every time I play, I feel like it is a little bit of my soul being put on public display for everyone to see. It is calming, yet exciting. It is calculated, yet very rewarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.giphy.com/xT1XGDOo5Fzsd0lezm.gif\" style=\"width: 481px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately, I found their was a gaping hole in the EDM community here in Atlanta. With Facebook cracking down and Soundcloud becoming more and more difficult to promote by the day, it is becoming harder and harder for DJs and producers to get their name out in the city they love! To solve the problem, I created Spin \u0026amp; Chill, a radio show where I showcase some of Atlanta finest producers and DJs!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also focus on major events and unique streams, like Hardwell and Imagine Festival. We try and look at upcoming technology for producers, DJs, and content creators around the world. We focus on making the music fun and exciting to watch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI need your social support and help raising capital in order to make this show bigger and better! I want you to help me decide pivotal directions of the show!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWith your funding, we can hire a full time staff that allows us to create events around Atlanta. With your help, we can review more often and do more events. I will be able to book bigger Atlanta artists on the show, more importantly, I can reach larger audiences, allowing more artists to perform and get their chance on camera!. It will allow you to be able to see more of the tech you want to see, more of the DJs you love and more insight into conversations that are important for Atlanta. With our new studio, we can even have DJs become content providers themselves. With enough subscriptions, I can hold events within Atlanta with artists chosen by you, the people!\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon will fund future livestreams and engage you in my creative process. \u003cstrong\u003eBasically, think of this as subscription service I provide to the people who want to see my dreams become your reality.\u003c/strong\u003e I want you to feel invested in my success. We can create a unified front of music in Atlanta!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy commitment to my Patrons includes the promise of frequent exclusive updates on my newsfeed, monthly rewards according to your subscription rate, and access to unique services only available on Patreon. I set the goals and rewards up in the most transparent way possible so you can see exactly where your money is going.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is not to become rich from this. My goal is doing livestreams that I could otherwise only dream of.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all depends on you, the viewer, to make this possible. I am doing this because I love music and I hope you too. Now let\u0027s make something magical together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.giphy.com/l3vR5gXp6z0j1ZhuM.gif\" style=\"width: 477px; float: left;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "Hi Everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Echobreaker and I am from Atlanta, Gorgia. I have been a DJ/Mashup artists for 5 years. I got into music because , to put it simply, I LOVE MUSIC! I love the way it makes me feel and I love sharing that feeling to others. Every time I play, I feel like it is a little bit of my soul being put on public display for everyone to see. It is calming, yet exciting. It is calculated, yet breathtaking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I got tired of promoters and club owners telling me, the DJ, what to play and when to play it. Musicians shouldn\u0027t be told what to play, as that limits our artistic expression! Each artist brings his/her own style and unique sound to the table, and why can\u0027t that be heard? Why does someone have to pay a cover and go into a smoky room just to hear their favorite DJ spin? With that in mind, I created Spin \u0026amp; Chill, a radio where I showcase some of Atlanta finest producers and DJs! We showcase every Monday at 7pm!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have already had some major backers for the show, I have had artists from #WTFISAGENRE, Bass Family, #GOLDFAM, and more. I have had Cohan, Eddie Gold, Alex Lucas, Vitillaz, DODGR, and Patrick Morgan on to play. I have the strong support of AfroAcid as well as other labels in Atlanta!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been only going for two months, and support has been very strong. At this point, I have had over 300 viewers to my personal website, over 15,000 minutes watched, and over 700 channel views.",
