The most important\nquestion you can ask of anybody which is what I now say even for the Parkland\n[school] shooting \u2013 instead of what\u0027s the matter with that kid, I say what\nhappened to that child?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nThe skills I teach help encourage good choices,\ndevelop a positive attitude, and demonstrate to children how to act rather than\nreact by tapping into their inner resource skills regardless of circumstances.

Of course, his dad has his own\nproblems and NO SKILLS to cope, so dumping on a child is the norm. How much do\nrepeat apologies really help?
