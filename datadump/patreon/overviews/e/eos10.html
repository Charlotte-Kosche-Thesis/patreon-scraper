    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIn 2014, we launched EOS 10 as a scripted radioplay and podcast about a couple of mal-adjusted doctors on a space station.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe did eight episodes then and seriously, totally fell in love with these characters. More than a few of you did too, and now, less than a year later, we\u0027re about to launch our second season with 10 new episodes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/eos-10-a-scifi-radio-play/id928069318?mt=2\u0026amp;uo=4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking EOS 10\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,0);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-b-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/1398974_295359367334386_2377429823712211816_o.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\" width=\"300\"\u003eEach episode of EOS 10 takes months to produce\u003c/span\u003e, from conception to writing through several drafts, to casting and rehearsals, to recording, editing and mixing. Our writers (three for season two!) and our actors on average accept far less than they\u0027re worth in payment (sometimes, as low as $10.50 an hour for recording, the minimum wage here in D.C., and sometimes, they choose to accept nothing and volunteer). Still, \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,0);\"\u003ea full season of EOS 10 can cost upwards of several thousand dollars\u003c/span\u003e to produce, and that\u0027s on a tight, shoe-string budget. For the first season, all of the costs came from the pockets of our producers and creator.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow you\u0027re helping\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst\u2014 thanks! \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,0);\"\u003eYour help means so much to us. It really does.\u003c/span\u003e We love how much you guys are into the show, and that alone makes it worth while. But thanks to our patrons, we\u0027ll be able to keep producing EOS 10 and most importantly, support the artists whose work makes it all happen. Your pledges go to paying our actors and writers, recording sessions, new fan outreach (we want to share these stories as far and wide as we can), music and sound effects, sometimes even better equipment to record and edit on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen am I charged?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOnce we start posting episodes, Patreon charges credit cards once a month \u2014 there is typically one episode per week, so in a normal month you\u0027ll be charged for about four episodes (4 x your $pledge) at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many episodes will I be charged for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027ll be 10 this upcoming season. So, your pledge is on a per episode basis, but you can change or cancel it at any time. You can also cap the monthly amount you\u0027re charged when you make or edit the pledge. We\u0027d love it if you stuck around for the whole season, though :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will I get my rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSome will go out to those who stay at their pledge level for all ten episodes, so once the season runs. Others, like digital rewards will go out sooner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
