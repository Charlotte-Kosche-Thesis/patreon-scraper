My name is Mark Abrams. Since 1978 I\u0027ve been tooling away at my RPG named Elthos.  It\u0027s been a long and wonderful road, and over the following 30+ years I\u0027ve been running campaigns, building out the system, and creating an amazing assortment of tools that help with Gamemastering Elthos.
