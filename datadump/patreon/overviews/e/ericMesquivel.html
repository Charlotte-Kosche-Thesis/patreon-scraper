    "summary": "I\u0027ve been a full-time professional comic book writer for about six years. It\u0027s an insane job, impossible to land and twice as hard to maintain...and one nobody can really teach you how to do.\u00a0 In fact: it took me ten years to figure out how to transition from a published author--holding down side jobs at comic stores and coffee shops to pay the rent--into a full-fledged professional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a comic book author consists of SO MUCH MORE than just putting words on paper. It\u0027s finding collaborators, negotiating terms, developing relationships with editors, exhibiting at conventions, pitching, managing time, researching subjects, reaching out to retailers, analyzing market statistics, piloting social media...and the list goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found my way by falling down in public a lot--burning bridges with suits, embarrassing myself in front of childhood heroes, succumbing to bouts of deep depression due to a lack of direction and a basic misunderstandings of industry politics--but maybe you don\u0027t have to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to start downloading everything I\u0027ve learned about myself and my craft into a regularly updated Patreon, as much for my own edification as anyone else\u0027s.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon, updated AT LEAST once a month, will include details about what I\u0027m currently working on, recent successes and victories, unpublished pitches and scripts, \"director\u0027s commentary\" on published work, reports from the convention scene, and frank, honest opinions about the state of the industry that I don\u0027t feel comfortable posting on social media, where potential employers might see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t going to be the kind of fluffly, self-promotional garbage that clogs up your Facebook feed. It\u0027s gonna be some down and dirty, hardcore comic book shop talk.\u00a0 Not for the faint of heart, and not available anywhere else. And the WHOLE CATALOG is available for the price of a monthly comic.\u003cbr\u003e"
