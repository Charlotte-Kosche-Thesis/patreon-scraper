    "summary": "Encounter Wargaming is about celebrating all aspects of the Miniature Wargaming Hobby. We wish to strengthen and nurture the community by helping hobbyists improve their skills and knowledge by offering tutorials and services that make the hobby more fun and easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are chiefly a hobby focused YouTube channel looking to bring you top rated content for your favourite miniatures games. Currently we release videos on YouTube every Tuesday and Thursday and a Podcast on Fridays available on iTunes and Google Play. This we provide to everyone for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy become a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a Patron, you pay $1 or $2 for the 2 weekly videos that you would normally get for free. That\u0027s the Tuesday and Thursday releases. In return you get these videos on the Sunday before they would normally be released.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you will also get access to our Hobby Time series that involves a behind the scenes look at what hobby projects we are currently working on. This makes you an Encounter Wargaming Insider. Not only do you get invited to see what we\u0027re working on but this will also give you insight of what to expect from Encounter Wargaming in the coming weeks. Something only Patrons have access to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now we put out 2 videos a week. This is approximately 8-10 videos a month. If you can\u0027t afford to pay $8 - $20 a month that\u0027s ok. You can set the monthly maximum on your account to be whatever you want. If you only want to give us $1 a month, that\u0027s fine too. It will still get you access to all the same stuff we\u0027ve listed above. If you want to give us more than $20/month we would greatly appreciate that too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of all this we take our Patrons suggestions to heart. If you have any content you want to see in our videos or anything you need from us you can email us personally. We value our Patrons and want to create friendships with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou becoming a Patron helps us in many ways too. It gives us the ability to reach our goals. These you can see on the sidebar to the left of this window. For each goal there is an additional reward for you. The more you give, the more we can give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do I become a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve had some people ask us how to become a patron. It seems it\u0027s a little confusing at times and we want to make it as easy for you as possible. So let\u0027s put it in simple terms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep 1: Sign up with Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStart by clicking the Sign Up button at the top of the screen. This will either ask you to sign in with Facebook or provide them with a Name, Email and Password. Easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep 2: Go to your Email Inbox and Confirm your registration. No Problem. Now you can create a Patreon Profile. Go crazy and have fun making a profile. But don\u0027t forget to come back to us after step 3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep 3: Add a card or PayPal account to your profile. In your Patreon Profile you will see a section that says payment methods. Here you can connect to either your Credit Card or your PayPal account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep 4: Come back to this page \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/encounterwargaming\"\u003ewww.patreon.com/encounterwargaming\u003c/a\u003e and become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s that simple. We love that you are interested in becoming a Patron of Encounter Wargaming. Thank you so much for helping to grow this amazing thing we call Encounter Wargaming.\u003cbr\u003e"
