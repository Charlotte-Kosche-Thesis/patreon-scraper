    "summary": "hi, my name is Liz.\u00a0you might know me most from the writing about games i do. i believe in compassion and brutal honesty, two things that are incredibly lacking in games\u0027 spaces. the website Critical Distance just named me Blogger of the Year for 2013 for my \"raw, deeply-felt appreciation for structure and form\". i also made a game called Problem Attic which has been described as\u00a0\"provocative\" and \"an indescribably important videogame\".\u00a0 in the past year i\u0027ve given talks at the No Show Conference in Boston and QGCon in Berkeley on issues of gender and inclusiveness in game \u0026amp; art spaces, among other things. i\u0027m also starting to branch out into thoughts about culture, particularly art\u0027s role in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emy focus is on changing the ways we talk about, consume, and make art in the 21st century. \u00a0my own work is an attempt to explore the boundaries of different new media with a strong emphasis on videogames, and to facilitate a deeper, more compassionate understanding of ourselves and the world around us. i believe that art can be deeply revolutionary, and will serve an extremely important purpose in the years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003edespite some success in the past year and a half, i\u0027ve still been struggling a lot to get recognition and find outlets to help me make some sort of a living off my work. \u00a0i have a hard time finding publications receptive to what i want to write that can offer me much, and i\u0027ve not had much luck at finding paid gigs to do music or sound for games, nor outlets that would be willing to compensate me for my work in games.\u00a0because of my situation, i\u0027ve been living rent free at different friends\u0027 places for the past couple years - but i can\u0027t keep this up indefinitely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewhen you\u0027re struggling and nothing seems to gain much traction, especially when you do things a little bit differently from other people, finding the motivation to make things can be very hard come by.\u00a0that\u0027s where you all come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein particular,\u00a0making music is something i\u0027ve done since age 12. it\u0027s always served a central part of my life, and it hurts me a lot that i struggle so deeply to find motivation to make it. but\u00a0right now i don\u0027t have the necessary\u00a0connections or equipment to play shows and i\u0027ve had next to no luck emailing music publications, and i haven\u0027t been much luckier finding gigs doing music/sound for games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei\u0027m also, however, looking for people who like the art i make and the criticism i do and want to keep seeing more of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003esince i make a lot of different types of things, i\u0027m setting a monthly goal. so, if you want to support me, you\u0027ll be paying for whatever music, games, articles, or art i do in a month. and then i\u0027ll make a monthly post on my blog summing up all the things i\u0027ve done each month, which is what you\u0027ll be paying for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- liz"
