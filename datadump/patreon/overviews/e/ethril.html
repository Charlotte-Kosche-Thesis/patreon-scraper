    "summary": "Thanks for coming over to my Patreon even if it\u0027s just by accident!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Sarah, but I mostly go by Ethril in the world that is the internet. I like to think that I\u0027m a very creative person who enjoys writing, drawing, and creating jewelry. Currently I am a college student studying to become a k-8 teacher (but I would love to become a full time writer).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been ghost writing for awhile now, but I really would like to have one of my stories published under my name one day. Right now though I do not have the time to work on my own stories since I am a full time student writing on the side to pay my bills. If I can earn enough here through Patreon, I\u0027ll be able to cut back on ghost writing to work on my own stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do write:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI actually enjoy writing in many different genres. My favorite is, and always will be, fantasy, but I do enjoy sci-fi, mystery, romance, horror, paranormal, furry, smut, and adventure. I\u0027m not very good with thrillers, but I\u0027m willing to learn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides my ghost writing (which is very dull actually), I do write a great deal of fanfiction. I write my fanfiction on my own time for free. One day I would love to be able to write my own novel and have it published. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my fanfictions here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/~ethril \"\u003eFanfiction.net\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/Ethril/pseuds/Ethril\"\u003eArchive of Our Own\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I don\u0027t write:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHard-core gore, violence, abuse, under-age romance, and substance abuse. Some things can be written in small amounts, to create back story or to move the plot along, but I will not write a story solely around these things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do my rewards work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMost of my rewards are based off of what I make as a ghost writer. On average ghost writers make $1 per 100 words. So for a novel, say 50k words, I would make a one time amount of $500. That\u0027s a lot of work for a story that I can\u0027t even put my name on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTier 1- the Awesome Follower\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to Patreon only content\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsually these are updates on which story I am working on, how many words have been written, ideas I might have for future stories, etc. Maybe even some short stories that are under 1k words.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSneak Peak summaries of future works\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhenever I have a chapter or story fully written ahead of time I will post a summary here on patreon for all you wonderful followers to read!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatron-only polls that determine which stories I work on first each month\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEach month I will decide, with your help, the order in which I work on my stories. I want to create 1 chapter per story per week. The order for the next month will be decided based on the final tally at the end of the current month. The story with the most votes will go first, the next one will be second, etc, etc. So if there is a story you particularly enjoy, convince others to vote for it\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive polls to determine what happens in stories.\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSometimes there will come a time in stories where I can go multiple directions with the plot.

Once a month you can tell me and I will work with you on rewriting the chapter. Some things can\u0027t be changed, but fate can always be altered. This 1 chapter rewrite can only be applied towards chapters that have been written during the current and previous month (so 2 months worth of chapters). I\u0027m not going back to rewrite chapter 1 that was written years ago.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading through all of this!
