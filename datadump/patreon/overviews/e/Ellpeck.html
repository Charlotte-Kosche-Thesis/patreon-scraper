    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s going on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey everyone! I\u0027m Ellpeck, an indie game developer and retired Minecraft modder from Germany. You might know me either from my pretty popular mod\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ellpeck.de/actadd\"\u003eActually Additions\u003c/a\u003e or the game I\u0027m currently working on,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://rockbottom.ellpeck.de/\"\u003eRock Bottom\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know more about me and what I do, you should definitely check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ellpeck.de/\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much if you decide to support me here. Keep in mind: You might get some pretty cool stuff back, too. Just check out the rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile working on my mod Actually Additions, occasionally people have asked me if there\u0027s any way they can support me. At the time, I didn\u0027t really need support in money form, but now I\u0027m a student and I live in my own apartment, so a little additional money really can\u0027t hurt.\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I really like giving back to the people that support me, and Patreon is a good way of doing that because of the rewards system. You can check them out on the side to see what you can get for giving me a bit of your money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eObviously, that\u0027s not mandatory though! Even if you don\u0027t support me here, I still love you. I promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I said before, I\u0027m a student, so it will mostly go into pizza, ramen and paying my internet bills. But seriously, there\u0027s a lot of the stuff the money goes to: Living and paying for university, obviously, but also for me to buy the occasional game or cool product that I see, because buying new stuff makes me really happy.\u003cbr\u003eSome extra money is a huge help either way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are tons of rewards you can get, actually! Because Actually Additions and my game Rock Bottom are my two main big projects, there are rewards for both of them available. \u003cbr\u003eIf you like Actually Additions and support me because of that, you can get one of the rewards that give you a little visual trinket to show that you support me (and also to make you look really awesome).\u003cbr\u003eIf you like Rock Bottom and support me because of that, you can get early testing access to the game to help me fix all the bugs and make the game even better, along with some other cool stuff.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting me! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: Pledging does not give you the unquestioned right to the reward that you are receiving. If there are circumstances in place that make the reward unavailable to be distributed at any given time, they do not give you the right to a refund or a reward of a higher tier. The rewards system is not a purchase.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
