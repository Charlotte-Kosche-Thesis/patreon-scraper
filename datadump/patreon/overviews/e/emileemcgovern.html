    "summary": "I am so grateful for the way you all care for me. Sometimes it feels so supernatural it makes it hard to comprehend, hard to wrap my head all the way around it. I\u0027m not sure where all of your belief in me comes from, but I am beyond grateful for its existence. You\u0027ve all been with me since the beginning, watched me grow, and stood by me when I doubted even for just a second.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsking for help is never easy for me. I don\u0027t want to be anyone\u0027s responsibility, or burden. But i\u0027ve learned that I cannot keep people from being a bigger part of something. I don\u0027t want to reject or deny anyone\u0027s attempt at getting involved. If supporting me is something you feel strongly about, something that allows you to feel purposeful in moments when many are feeling useless, then I cannot let my pride be what takes that away from someone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs most of you know, I\u0027m not the best at making money with my photojournalism. I\u0027m completely self funded. Many publications want to use my images, but aren\u0027t really willing to pay for them, and I refuse to give them away for nothing, to outlets that will then make money off of them. If I had it my way honestly, I\u0027d continue to keep myself separate from them, so that I can maintain control over what stories I tell. This is why I would like to put the power in your hands. You are who I\u0027m doing this for. I want to work for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I am continuing my coverage of Marjory Stoneman Douglas. As of today, I have only made $70 off of my work from this story, and that immediately went towards travel expenses for Tallahassee. Next week I will be traveling to Washington Dc to cover the March For Our Lives. All of the funds would go towards renting a car, gas, and possibly housing if needed. I\u0027m not really sure yet how this site works just yet, I\u0027m not sure if they allow one time donations, or if it\u0027s only monthly ones. I\u0027m still figuring this all out. So bear with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never feel alone in this journey. Thank you all for being with me. I hope to make you the most proud every single day.\u00a0"

Making sure that translates into my work is of the utmost importance to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want the truth at all cost, regardless of whether it will positively or negatively affect me. I want to do what\u2019s right at all times, and challenge others to do the same. In this world, living a life like that can be difficult. I\u2019ve found that it isn\u2019t something valued a lot of the time, and it is something that regularly is incredibly misunderstood. But for me, being trustworthy is and always will be worth all of that. It is worth the pain, it is worth the work. As a photojournalist my goal is and always will be to work for the people. That way the truth is the only agenda. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until this point I\u0027ve personally funded every single story I\u0027ve ever covered. I walk away not making any money or breaking even. I walk away in debt. Because I am that devoted to this. I am that devoted to the truth. And I am that devoted to the public. I want to make sure that people stay connected to their sources. And that way their source stays accountable to them. I want to make media personal. I want to represent you.",
