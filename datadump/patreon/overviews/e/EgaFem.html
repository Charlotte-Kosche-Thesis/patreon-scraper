We believe women should be treated as adults, with equal responsiblity to men. It is time society stopped belittling women, and started expecting women to empower themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe it is time for society to stop treating women as pathetic little victims, special cases, weaklings who can\u0027t succeed without automatically having a leg up, and delicate little flowers who needs constant protection, please support our work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe the war on women, the institutionalised sexism that spreads a systematic message that women should be in constant fear of men needs to end, help us raise awareness and show women they are strong, that they can act, not only be objects to be acted upon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will go towards creators time and effort, allow more content to be created, and pay for equipment for additional content and improved quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope to keep the content free at the point of use, and we will continue to dedicate as much as we can to EgaFem - but your financial support will make a huge difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will be \u0027free\u0027 and \u0027paid for\u0027 content?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaid content requires extra time and effort such as extensive editing and research. Examples include articles that cite data and required research, summary videos, and videos that require extensive editing to bring multiple sources of footage together. Content that cost money will also be included, such as paying for services to improve the quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFree content requires only time and a small amount of effort. \u00a0Examples include opinion pieces, livestreams, let\u0027s play videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough it all takes time and effort, some takes more than others. Quality content should be recognised\u00a0and encouraged. This will promote EgaFem to concentrate on quality rather than quantity to ensure you get useful content from us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if there is particular content you wish to see more of (e.g. more opinion pieces, livestreams etc), and wish to be included as paid content to encourage them please let us know and we can change the \u0027paid\u0027 and \u0027free\u0027 boundary over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see what the money is spent on, see the Funding page on the website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://egafeminist.blogspot.co.uk/p/funding.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://egafeminist.blogspot.co.uk/p/funding.html\u003c/a\u003e"
