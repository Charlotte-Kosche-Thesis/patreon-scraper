Now I see, it\u2019s not that easy. Rushing to release a video before the end of the month it not good for me and my inspiration, nor for video quality. Doing this, I\u0027ve found that I\u0027m absolutely unable to turn my coolest scenarios into animations. This was not easy, but I\u0027ve decided to change my policy, and below are the most important reasons. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1. Length.\u003c/strong\u003e People often ask me why my videos are so short. Why I never do long story/plots and pre- scenes, only short eating action. The answer is simple: I must start and finish a video in 30 \u003cbr\u003e\ndays. I would be glad to bring more variety and cool features to my videos, but I\u0027m very short on time. With my soft/hardware, it takes about 15 days to make a single minute of pure animation, and \n\u003cbr\u003e\nabout 10 days more to render this. In addition, I need a couple of days for mastering in visual editor, adding FX and music. So, with my old policy, only short animations were possible, this is \n\u003cbr\u003e\nwhat I\u0027d definitely like to change.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e2. Backgrounds.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m so bored of these flat picture backgrounds in my vids. I would like to create some cool dynamic environments like in Cake Inferno\u0027s videos! Would you like me to?? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e3. Throat, epiglottis, intestines.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m obsessed by the idea of making long full tour fatal and non-fatal videos, but there are no good and realistic internal models around. I have to make them \u003cbr\u003e\nmyself, but I can\u0027t spend my time on modelling when limited to 30 days. This is the only reason why I still haven\u0027t finished a HD remake of my \"The Whole Way\" video.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e4. Clothes.\u003c/strong\u003e Do you know why in most of my videos I show only giant\u0027s face and mouth, but not a full body? This is simple! Because once I finished a video and have a few free days, I spend them on such important things as updating the mouth or stomach, but not on less important things like clothes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e5. More characters.\u003c/strong\u003e I hate to use the same character models from video to video. I want to make new ones, probably even based on your ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e6. Prey sizes. \u003c/strong\u003eUnfortunately, resizing tinies models in not that simple and fast as you would think. It\u0027s complicated. Once I move to a new policy, I will fix this too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e7. Interactivity. \u003c/strong\u003eI would like to be more interactive. I mean - add some polls to let YOU decide which characters to pick, which types of content do you want to see in the next videos, probably even help me pick a scenario for upcoming project. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e8. Skill level.\u003c/strong\u003e I hate to say that with an older Patreon policy (monthly videos), I absolutely had no time for improving my skills, reading tutorials and passing classes. I do all these animations \u003cbr\u003e\nMANUALLY which is very, very slow! I know, much of the work I do could possibly be automated. If I learn these secrets, or, probably, even new software, in result I will be able to make longer, \n\u003cbr\u003e\ncooler videos even more frequently!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e9. Drawing.\u003c/strong\u003e You like well-drawn pictures, don\u0027t you?? Me too, me too! And (shhh! It\u0027s a secret!) I\u0027m not bad in drawing. So, why don\u0027t I create this kind of stuff?? Guess why, guess why. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese are only some important reasons, but there are even more. In other words, I need to take time for growing in skills, making new models, working on backgrounds and internal organs, cool\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nstories, clothes and everything. I want to grow up. I want to make videos longer and better. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eSo, how frequently will I release videos from now on?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is impossible to say, it entirely depends on the project I start making. I still love short animations of pure eating process, so, if I get a really good idea, I can make a video in 20-30 \n\u003cbr\u003e\ndays. If I start a bigger project with a story, speaking characters, multiple preys and pre- scenes, like \n\u003cstrong\u003e\"7 Deadly Sins: Greed\"\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003e\"The WONDERS\"\u003c/strong\u003e, this will definitely take longer, 2 months or \u003cbr\u003e\nmore. Videos like \n\u003cstrong\u003e\"The Whole Way\"\u003c/strong\u003e require special models like throat, stomach, intestines, half-digested and totally digested textures, fluids and particles, clothes, rooms and furniture - this is \u003cbr\u003e\nnot an easy task. Unfortunately, I have only two hands, and I will need to take time to create the required models, visual and sound effects. But don\u0027t worry. I will be sharing W.I.P materials with \n\u003cbr\u003e\nyou, so you will always be informed how the process is going. Some long videos may be split into episodes. So...
