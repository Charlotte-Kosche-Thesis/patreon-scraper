    "summary": "Hi!! My name is Eric Lofgren. I\u0027m a freelance illustrator who lives in Canada. I\u0027ve been freelancing for close to 15 years now, providing covers, cards and interior illustrations to many clients in the RPG and CCG markets. Over the course of those years I have created a lot of art and have made a lot of friends. It\u0027s been an immensely rewarding time and I\u0027ve enjoyed every minute of it. But now, after satisfying all those many Art Director\u0027s art briefs, I would like to expand my creativity into creating art which satisfies my own ideas. Art which fires my own imagination, just like when I was a kid, filling sketchpads with drawings of rockets and dragons. To that end, and with your awesome support, I want to fill this page with monstrous and fantastic creations that excite not just mine, but all our imaginations and fills our days with a break from the mundane. Wanna take a ride? :) \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.ericlofgren.zenutech.com/eric/patreon/dragon_rock.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor this Patreon account, I will be sticking with my first true passion; pen and ink. I love doing color work, which I do a lot of for my freelancing, but I\u0027m never really left with anything tangible at the end (beyond some sketches). So providing this work in ink, I will have a physical record of everything I create. Something that, if at all possible I can actually provide to some of you in the way of large size (300 dpi) scans. I will also be making available scans of production sketches. And quite frankly, more often than not the sketches I make are just about as good as the finals.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.ericlofgren.zenutech.com/eric/patreon/bl_creature2x2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, I will be working on as many creations as my work load allows, or on how large this Patreon account becomes. And in that time I will share as much of the process as I can. From basic thumbnails, to larger sketches. To pre-ink pencils and process shots, as well as close up detail views of the inking. And I\u0027ll also share my thoughts on the creative process whenever it seems relevant. But whatever the case, you\u0027ll be a close part of each creation I make........ \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.ericlofgren.zenutech.com/eric/patreon/beginning.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on making this with as much participation as possible. Hey, you\u0027re all helping make this a reality, so it\u0027s only right. So if I get enough of you along for the ride, I\u0027ll be posting polls as to what to work on next. Whatever gets the biggest vote wins. Every pledge level will get that option. But on occasion I\u0027ll also invite high level supporters to give their own input, as well. If you\u0027re idea is awesome, I\u0027ll likely draw it up. Just remember that we\u0027re making monsters and dragons here. No fairies. Or elves. Unless they\u0027re meant to be awesome and cool looking fairies and elves. Then I\u0027ll consider it. Orcs and other Hobgoblins on the other hand, are always allowed :) I\u0027m also a big fan of H. P. Lovecraft, so there\u0027s every likelihood that you know who could make an appearance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.ericlofgren.zenutech.com/eric/patreon/cocthulhu_B\u0026amp;W.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of each illustration, depending on what\u0027s been created and what I have lying around, I will be providing scans of sketches and finals, per reward levels. I\u0027ll also make prints available for each illustration, as well. Likely with a discount for contributors. I have a large format Epson 3880, so print making is a snap. And the inks and paper are all archival. I also have a sure fire method of shipping safely, now in place, as well. if I\u0027m able to reach a suitable level that allows me to just concentrate on this Patreon account, then the rewards will be more generous. I would even be happy to offer more to you all if the support is there. From postcards to buttons and maybe even t-shirts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, I hope we all have some fun with this. And I hope you are patient with me as I get up to speed on this venture. There may be some editing after this goes live. In time though, I\u0027m certain all the kinks will be worked out, and if I can eventually just concentrate on this Patreon account, there will be no end to the limits of our imagination.....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.ericlofgren.zenutech.com/eric/patreon/dragon_slayer.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!!!!!\u003cbr\u003eEric\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ericlofgren.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.ericlofgren.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
