But if I hit this goal, I can justify taking a few days off to produce one new pattern every month! (I\u0027m still going to be trying to do this, but this way I can guarantee it!)",

If I\u0027m making this much per month, I can take the time out to create these videos and release them! Patrons can help me decide on the videos each month!",

If I\u0027m making this much per month, though, I can finally take the time to realize my dream of imparting this knowledge to the world! After I\u0027ve done the ones I have planned, I\u0027ll happily take suggestions for the next series!",
