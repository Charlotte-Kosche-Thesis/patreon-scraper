I try not to pigeonhole myself into one genre of video because I enjoy a wide array of things and want to showcase them on my channels.  I want my viewers to feel welcome, pick up the good vibes I\u0027m putting down, and laugh right along with me.  If you\u0027ve made it this far, you probably already know this.  If not, welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFolks, I\u0027ll be real.  Videos require a budget.  Continuing to do taste tests and unboxings require a lot of financial overhead.  I\u0027m not sponsored and I\u0027m not getting PR mail or free product.  Everything you see, both behind the scenes and on camera, I\u0027m paying for myself.  I love doing this and sharing this with people - producing my own video content is the first time I\u0027ve ever actually felt creative - and it has helped me build a wonderful and growing community.  Since the threshold for YouTube monetization constantly changes, I am hoping that Patreon can be a more direct way of improving my budget, growing my channel, and getting even more one-on-one feedback from my audience.\u003cbr\u003e"
