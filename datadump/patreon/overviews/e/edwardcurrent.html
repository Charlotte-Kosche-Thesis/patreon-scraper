    "summary": "Hi everyone! I make YouTube videos, both comedic satires and serious videos, to combat ignorance and intellectual dishonesty. From 2008\u20132013 I made a popular series of comedy videos that poked fun at religious fanatics, but after 100 of those, I had scratched that itch and decided to move on to topics that I consider to be serious and threatening today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my missions is to denounce and delegitimize modern conspiracy theorists, or what I call \u201cdelusional conspiracy believers\u201d: 9/11 Truthers, anti-vaxxers, global-warming deniers,\u00a0mass-shooting hoaxers,\u00a0flat-earthers, and the like. The 21st-century conspiracy believer \u2014 they really aren\u2019t theorists, because they never have a coherent theory \u2014 \u00a0is a threat to modern society. The internet has given them a voice, but now they are the most vocal people in the room. This anti-intellectual movement is growing, threatening to replace science and enlightenment with a latter-day superstition and anti-establishment paranoia that appeals to small minds and the baser instincts of the human psyche. This scourge on society is driving us back to a new dark age dominated by unscrupulous hucksters, fear-peddlers, and showmen. For example, Donald Trump!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos can be edgy and controversial at times, and I tend to make political videos during election years, so if you have any content concerns and/or you can be easily offended, please check out my video catalog here or at\u00a0youtube.com/user/EdwardCurrent before you donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy five-word summary of the United States of America is \u201cwhere dumb people speak loudest.\u201d Please help me counteract this trend, with my unique brand of videos that shine a bright light on the darkest corners of the human experiment. Thank you!"
