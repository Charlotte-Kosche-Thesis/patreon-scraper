    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e So, who are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tA single creative mind in a sea of millions, a simple amateur author that has always found escape through the world of fantasy, sci-fi, and games like so many others. Someone that grew up writing, roleplaying, reading, and gaming as my escape from the chaotic grip of life itself. I try to include these ideas in my work, I write for two reasons. One, because to me it\u0027s one of the few things in my life I could ever consider a passion, and two, because my hope is to ease the lives and stress of my readers. If my writing can help even one person escape from the harsh reality we all live in, for just a bit to delve into a world of fantasy and wonder, then I am more than pleased. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\tI have been writing for most of my life as an escape and finally begun taking it seriously, seeking out those that enjoy my works and are willing to help me grow. Most of my works include a focus on short stories that interconnect in a world that I\u0027m slowly developing through every character\u0027s story. In the end, I hardly think I\u0027m anything special, but I pride myself on the few weapons that I have. The strongest being my adoration of the variety of cultures out the world has to offer, and how to best interweave them throughout my works. I want to spread these stories, this writing, through the minds of as many as possible, opening them up to new ideas, new cultures, faiths, thought processes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \tWhy Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting out as an author is difficult, anyone that\u0027s ever had the thought of \"starting on a book\", or even simply taken a glance at a conversation with an author, published or not, has come to realize that. Creating for a living, in general, is a rocky road for anyone to travel. Despite this, it\u0027s been a dream of mine to be a true author for most of my life, ever since I was a child opening my first Tolkien\u00a0novel or D\u0026amp;D rulebook. Patreon offers the perfect method for amateur\u00a0authors and creators to do what they love for a living, by being supported by those that they knew enjoys their works, and so I\u0027ve chosen it in the hopes of it helping me expand my passions to those around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Patreons, to me, represent:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnyone that appreciates the time invested into my work and wants to support what I do.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePeople that want to see more from me than just a few short stories.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReaders, listeners, and those that are simply curious that want to help keep the creativity going strong and encourage me to continue chasing my passions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFriends, Family, and Fans that care for me and in place of taking me out to dinner once a month, or buying me that coffee, want to instead help support something that is incredibly dear to me.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThe goal for this is quite simple, to try and help fund the chaotic and rocky path that comes from living the life as a creator. A personal website, completed full-length novels, proper video hosting for my ramblings and thoughts, proper interaction with me as a writer and more. Perhaps eventually even reach the point of true publishing, and printing, perhaps even audio instead of just something as simple as eBooks. Specific details can be found in the goals section!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What do we get in exchange?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinding a proper way to offer rewards is always difficult for me, as I\u0027m happy to provide much of my content for free and this limits me inherently. I\u0027ve put in a few rewards that, hopefully, you\u0027ll find intriguing but for the most part the only reason I ask for anyone to support me would be, quite frankly, because you enjoy the content that I provide you. If you enjoy my short stories, my rambling posts and thoughts, just what I offer in general and you want to support my works financially that\u0027s truly all I can ever ask for.\u003cbr\u003e"
