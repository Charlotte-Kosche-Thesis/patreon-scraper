    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe calling-on song...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sing songs. Some traditional folk songs from the British Isles. Some covers. Some that I\u0027ve written with my partner, lyricist and graphic artist, Somhairle Kelly (or indeed on my own!).\u00a0 Some settings of other lyrics and poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe five-verse ballad...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making music since I was a small child, and fell \nhead-over-heels in love with folk music when I was not much older. I\u0027ve been a jazz bassist and a classical soprano and a choral composer. Now, at not-quite forty, I\u0027m a folk mezzo, and a ukulele player, and I tend to look longingly at low D whistles and lap harps...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also disabled, having been chronically ill since before I reached adulthood, complicating a lot of my music-related schemes! Getting to folk clubs, let alone gigging, is difficult for me. Which is why I am so utterly in love with my SM58 microphone and Shure X2U mic-to-laptop device, and the wonders of Audacity. I record most of my songs in bed these days. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim at present is to build up my repertoire, write \nmore songs, make the odd video, and get a lot more recording done, which is where you come in. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI generally aim to record at least one song a month over the course of the year, releasing albums, EPs, download-only singles, and song or practice videos on Youtube as and when things feel right for that. In practice it\u0027s often less than once a month, but that\u0027s the target. :-) Increasingly I also want to post photos, artwork, and general updates on here, and I\u0027m always open to suggestions for other things to write about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCare to join me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd now, the\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eencore..\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMoney from Patrons will help me to eat and pay the rent, always useful for a budding musician. ;-) Looking ahead, it will mean better recording equipment, the possibility of professional studio use every so often, and hopefully eventually the purchase of a lap harp to use for accompanying myself, playing instrumental music, and accompanying other singers and storytellers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to downloads of the tracks, Patrons receive lyrics to all the songs I record, and some also receive sheet music too. The especially generous will get sent bits and pieces that I\u0027ve made - I\u0027m not the best artist or crafter (I leave that to my partner!), but make Kumihimo braids and I sketch, and photographs may also be forthcoming in time. The most generous will get something written for them specially once a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd remember: you can always set a limit per month on how much to give, so if I have a super-productive month you\u0027re guaranteed not to have to pay me more than you can afford. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also find me on Bandcamp (\u003ca href=\"https://ellythefolk.bandcamp.com/),\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://ellythefolk.bandcamp.com/),\u003c/a\u003e Facebook (\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EllyTheFolk),\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/EllyTheFolk),\u003c/a\u003e Twitter (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ellythefolk),\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/ellythefolk),\u003c/a\u003e Youtube (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUV13A2AM3NjKjHWuqH68-Q)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUV13A2AM3NjKjHWuqH68-Q)\u003c/a\u003e and Wordpress (\u003ca href=\"http://ellythefolk.wordpress.com/).\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ellythefolk.wordpress.com/).\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
