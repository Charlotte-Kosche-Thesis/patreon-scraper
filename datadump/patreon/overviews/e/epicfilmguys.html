But, one day, if we ever made enough money doing the podcast, we could quit our day jobs and produce EFG content for a living. This is a very lofty goal, of course, but with your support (and the support of all of our amazing contributors, listeners, and friends), we could make it happen one day. Think about it- Epic Film Guys programming five days a week! Special episodes, weekly commentaries, live events, and watch-along events are just some of the great things we could do, given the time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis one\u0027s easier than you think!
