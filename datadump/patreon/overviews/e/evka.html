I have ambitions to start gig photography, and continue travelling more and sharing street photography of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see a selection of my work (and why I need a more professional website)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://evkaphotography.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo many realms of photography fascinate me, I\u0027d love to be a tour photographer for a musician, do promotional shoots for a variety of different campaigns.
