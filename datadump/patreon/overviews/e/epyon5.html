Primarily, my subject matter consists of \u003cstrong\u003eHORROR\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eCOMIC\u003c/strong\u003e related icons. I make a living by traveling pretty extensively throughout the country exhibiting at various comic and horror conventions (usually two a month) and sometimes I\u0027ll participate in gallery exhibits. Some of you may be familiar with who I am. if not, nice to meet you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I HERE AND WHAT DO I OFFER?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInsight my friends... sweet glorious insight. As an artist who not only makes paintings, but also travels to various conventions to exhibit such works, I feel I have plenty of tips, tricks, and techniques that some of you may find useful. Ever wanted to exhibit at a comic con? I have advice on that. Ever wanted to make art with stencils and spray paint but not sure how? I have advice on that. Specifically, as my PATREON page develops, I plan on posting works in progress, video content that features behind the scenes studio work (how things are made), as well as my thoughts on the best way to succeed on the convention circuit. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd let\u0027s not forget the rewards... delicious rewards!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, I\u0027m going to open up my studio so you can see what I do, how I do it, and what it takes to make art. And with your support through \u003cstrong\u003ePATREON\u003c/strong\u003e, I can keep making art and hopefully inspire you to do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU,\u003cbr\u003eEPYON5\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Sometimes though I mix it up and go back to traditional oil painting. You might be asking yourself, \" How the hell does he make a living as an artist? With no day job no less?\" Great question. The answer is... barely. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s true, I\u0027m able to avoid the day job. But to do so, I am constantly making as many items as I can. And then I travel to comic and horror conventions at least twice a month to sell prints of my work to pay the bills. \u003cbr\u003eI decided to share the process of my creations in hopes to obtain patrons, and in doing so, can keep making the best work I can possibly do.\u003cbr\u003e",
