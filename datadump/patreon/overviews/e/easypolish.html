We create a video series that enables people\nfrom around the world to access authentic dialogues as they are spoken by\nnatives. Right now, we publish two kinds of episodes: street\ninterviews \u2013 conversations with people in the streets for advanced learners and Super Easy Polish \u2013 episodes\ncreated especially for our beginning students to help them learn the\nbasics. All of them have subtitles in both Polish and English and they are published on Thursdays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/644/33237248822_ab4173771b_h.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eWe have been producing the Easy Polish series\nfor around two and a half year now. At this point we would like to say a huge\nTHANK YOU!!! to all of you who have been with us. Thank you for all positive\ncomments and supportive messages we received from you. Nothing motivates us to\nwork harder than seeing that our effort is appreciated. Yet, two recurring question\nthat we hear from you are \u201cCan I get a transcript for this video?\u201d and \u201cCan you\nshoot more episodes in cities other than Katowice?\u201d. Until now the answers were\n\u201cno\u201d because firstly, Easy Polish is still just an additional project next to\nour everyday duties and we didn\u2019t have enough time to do more for you and\nsecondly, because we had no money to invest in the project. That is why we\ndecided to make the first step to make our project more professional and turn\n\u201cno\u201d into \u201cyes\u201d with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3948/33540054861_29c53cb607_h.jpg\"\u003eCurrently our first priority is sharing with\nyou more learning resources that you ask for. On the right side you can find\ndifferent combinations of materials that will help you learn from our episodes\nmore efficient. Transcripts, mp3 files for our episodes and videos without\nsubtitles \u2013 everything that some of you have asked for. With the money that you\nwill contribute in exchange for the additional materials we will be able to\ninvest in new equipment and also travel to new places in order to show you the\nwide variety of different regions in our country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2874/32579113443_f50a055f61_h.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eStreet interviews are the core of our project,\nso we decided that for now only these episodes will be published in extended\nversion. We promise to produce two of them every month and publish them here on\nPatreon with their additional resources. In the meantime we will also keep\nproducing Super Easy Polish and some additional episodes that will be available\non YouTube for free. We really want to increase the number of episodes\navailable on Patreon in their extended version in the future, but this will\ndepend on the feedback from you. For now the realistic plan is to have two episodes a month on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2930/32891431240_16220c1e70_h.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) So\ndoes Easy Polish cost money now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eNo, all\nvideos we produce will continue to be free. But if you decide to support us,\nyou will get access to great additional resources (transcript, mp3 files,\nvideos) that help you deepen your learning experience with Easy Polish\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Why do we need your support?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo we can\ndedicate more time to doing what we love: producing Easy Polish videos for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) How many videos does Easy Polish produce?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e2 videos\nper month count for Patreon. We will definitely produce more and publish them on YouTube - however, for only episodes two per month you will be able to receive additional materials from Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4) On Patreon can I spend more money than I want to without knowing about\nit?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo,\nbecause you set your maximum amount. If you want to donate 3$ per video and never more than 3$ per month, you choose to donate 3$ per video and set your\nmaximum support to 3$ per month.\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE NOTE: Unlike crowdfunding sites similar to Kickstarter, Patreon is not a one time payment, but a monthly support for creators. This means that once you subscribe to Easy Polish you will be charged for each episode that we publish here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5) Can I stop with Patreon at any time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes, you\ncan cancel your subscription on Patreon at any time if you no longer have the\nmoney or desire to support Easy Polish.\u003c/div\u003e"
