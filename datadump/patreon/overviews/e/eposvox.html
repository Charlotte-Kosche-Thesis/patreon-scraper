This place is for those of you who want to support what I\u0027m doing in ways that directly help me continue to create more (and better) helpful content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t heard of or used Patreon before, the concept is pretty simple. You support a creator (in this case, me) financially each month to contribute towards content creation and development. In my case, you\u0027re supporting free educational content centered around technology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a great platform, and I\u0027m so thankful it exists. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however much you\u0027d like) per month to keep this machine moving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/9891990.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I create content in bulk, my Patreon page is set up for monthly contribution. \u003cstrong\u003eYour pledge is a set amount of money each month that you\u0027re contributing towards the content.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Keep in mind I normally post 3 times a week, if not more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s also a tiered reward system in place, giving more direct access to myself to those who contribute more. For example, $7+ contributors get early access to \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0videos I post (sometimes months in advance), and $30+ contributors get access to my own Discord voice/text chat server.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is some exclusive behind-the-scenes content that Patreon supporters receive, but it\u0027s all extraneous - \u003cstrong\u003eall of my educational and review content will continue to remain free and open to the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can view the list in the right sidebar to see the specifics of the various rewards tiers. I\u0027ve also established specific goals of income levels at which I would be able to do new or better things. I don\u0027t expect these to come quickly - they\u0027re just an outline of what could be done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.apa.org/Images/money-title-image_tcm7-188291.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to continue to invest as much time (and my own money) as possible into producing free educational content and videos for YouTube viewers and website readers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy work takes a lot of time. I put more work into my YouTube channels and website than many people put into their full-time jobs. I just graduated from university, so I could be working a \"traditional\" full-time job, but I see chasing this path as being more important for the time being.\u003cbr\u003eMy work takes time and money, but it\u0027s something I\u0027d never want to stop doing. As the financial security of YouTube\u0027s ad revenue system continues to dwindle, it starts to seem more and more like I may have to push my online ambitions to the side unless I supplement more revenue.\u003cbr\u003ePrimarily, I want to continue creating as much helpful content as possible. I have a never-ending list of content ideas and topics, I just need the freedom to create it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis can also help me replace broken equipment, invest in better equipment for higher-quality videos, and generally free up my time to get more done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eShoot, I don\u0027t have money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.originenergy.com.au/content/origin-ui/en/business/solar/go-solar/solar-business-solutions/_jcr_content/mainparsys/column_control_5/par1/one_image/image.adapt.1280.high.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem!

I work hard to provide great and high-quality educational, technology-centric content. My goal is to provide helpful how-to videos, quick and easy tech tips, guides on bigger-picture concepts, and product reviews which are consumer-friendly, helpful, and entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started YouTube back in 2008 - the early days of the platform. I\u0027ve tinkered with it off and on - having started focusing on gaming content - but over the past couple years I\u0027ve started to really lock down and get serious about creating helpful tech content. I\u0027ve published over 1,000 YouTube videos on the main \"EposVox\" channel alone, with a few side channels going as well. I\u0027m serious about my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI sincerely hope you consider contributing, and I know I won\u0027t disappoint you.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThanks so much for your time,\u003cbr\u003e~ Adam // EposVox\u003c/div\u003e"
