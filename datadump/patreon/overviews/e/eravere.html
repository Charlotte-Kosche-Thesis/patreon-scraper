This is something incredibly special to me, and a goal I have had for quite some time and would not be able to reach without your help. So thank you, from the bottom of my heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support means more than I can possibly ever explain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThere are many of us out there who enjoy reading stories. It doesn\u0027t matter if that\u0027s a poem, a short story, a graphic novel or even a full length novel. We all like to see the worlds that other human beings can create with only the touch of their fingers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I\u0027ve come up with something a little different!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know myself as a reader, there are times when I would very much love to feel more actively involved in the lives of the characters I\u0027m reading about. Even if I\u0027m on the edge of my seat, unable to put my book down, there are just simply times where I wish I could influence. Where I wish I could ask the author why they chose this scene. Why they went with a character trope, why this plot hole? Why not this other thing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven when it comes to something as simple as smut, it is nice to have an active involvement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, that\u0027s what I\u0027m here for!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Hunted\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll supernatural races have been hunted to the point of near extinction. The human race was, as usual, afraid of anything different. So they have become all but extinct. Hunted to the very edges of the earth, their death has been all but guaranteed through the greed and hatred of humanity. If \u2018non humans\u2019 or \u2018extras\u2019 are found above the surface, then they are shot on sight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of this, anything \u0027supernatural\u0027 fled to sanctuaries, or safe havens. Forced to leave their homes, their jobs, and everything they knew in order to save their lives and those of their family. Thankfully, they found a way to survive. By means of Sanctuaries and Safe Zones throughout the world, they have found a way to not only survive the attempted extinction of their existence, but to grow. As far as is known at this point in time, there are four safe havens or compounds for all those that are even slightly \u2018different\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThey fight for their lives. For survival, even as surviving each day has become a war in and of itself. The humans are still coming for them, doing anything they can to kill them off. Once and for all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe war is coming. And it won\u0027t be pretty.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe purpose of this patreon is to give the readers a chance to flow, to grow as the story does. It is going to be a living story, rather than a story that you pay for and read. Those who support me will get the chance to see into the in depth character profiles. The plots, the dynamics. The upcoming ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not going to include discord in this as a means for \u0027rewards\u0027 as there is a server that goes along with the world created, where people are welcome to roleplay and include themselves in this world that I have created with the help of people incredibly special to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere, people are welcome to ask questions and watch as the world develops - in real time. This is not only going to be a living story, but also a way to allow others to enjoy a setting that has taken me years to get to this point.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach document will be sent to those who contribute as a PDF, so that you have a \u0027physical\u0027 copy of my work - as physical as it can be, at any rate.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
