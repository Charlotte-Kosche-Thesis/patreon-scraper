    "summary": "In 2014, when Abigail Connor was only five years old, she made up a team of heroes who have to beat 1,000 bad guys to save their world. She called them The Electric Team. Her dad,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://leightonconnor.com/\"\u003eLeighton Connor\u003c/a\u003e, liked the idea, and decided they should turn it into a comic. They went looking for an artist and, fortunately, found\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://samanthalbert.myportfolio.com\"\u003eSamantha Albert\u003c/a\u003e, who had the necessary skills at drawing post-apocalyptic landscapes AND unicorns. Soon, they started serializing their story at \u003ca href=\"http://www.electricteamcomic.com,\"\u003ewww.electricteamcomic.com,\u003c/a\u003e and making print copies of each chapter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are, several years into our labor of love. It\u0027s been a rewarding experience, and we\u0027ve received lots of kind comments and good feedback, but it turns out that making an ongoing comic like this is expensive. We love telling this story but we can\u0027t do it alone, and that is where we turn to you. We have come up with perks and incentives that we think you\u0027ll enjoy, to make this a fun experience for us all. We are extremely grateful for any support we receive, and we thank those of you who have already supported us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
