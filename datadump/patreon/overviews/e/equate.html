We were founded by like minded gamers with a passion for Fortnite. After many frustrating games queuing with random people, we decided to work on something that would solve that forever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Vision\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe entire reason for making this community is to offer an awesome place where players can come make friends, compete in contests, rank up and always have someone to play with. We want to put focus on all of us normal players, a place where you don\u2019t need to be a pro to win some money, form a team and hopefully someday compete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Donate?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, thank you for supporting this community and helping us grow. We know everyone works hard for their money and it means a lot that you would give any of that to us. The donations will go to a number of things but almost all of it will be put towards making our community a better place for you guys. When we hit our first goal of forty dollars a month, it will go towards sponsoring our contests and allowing us to give away one-thousand v-bucks every week! In the future, as we grow we would love to venture into sponsoring some of our streamers, and creating t-shirts. Thank you again for helping us make a great place for you guys to play, anything helps!"
