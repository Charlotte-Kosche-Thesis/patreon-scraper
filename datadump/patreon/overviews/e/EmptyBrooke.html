    "summary": "Having been an avid fan of storytelling through sequential art for about as long as I can remember, the idea of creating comics consistently either for a hobby or for a living has been a prospect eagerly picking at my brain since I was a wee cluster of cells. As life progresses, however, sometimes it offers up challenges or bumps in the road that prove to be too difficult to overcome on one\u0027s lonesome. This is where Patreon comes in:\u003cbr\u003eMy handle is Empty Brooke. My interest or perhaps specialty is comics. As many will know, comics are a time-consuming process and art itself is a finicky sort of thing that requires a good amount of time and care before it wants to work for you just right. Patreon is a means of supporting an artist and helping them to climb that endless ladder, in getting their work finished in a timely manner and getting it out there for you, the audience, to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI do not expect people to support me enough to make this my full time job \u003c/strong\u003eand as such I will still be working on my own to keep myself under a roof and fed enough to keep drawing. Patreon support, however, pays for extra time to spend working on art, extra time to hone my skills and continue to progress, extra funds to expand the scope of my artistic operation and, in time, extra time to spend on \u003cstrong\u003eanimated projects\u003c/strong\u003e... Also regarding comics, like seriously, it\u0027s what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn joining me on my journey through this process, you will receive additional bonuses which will only grow and be expanded upon as more and more planned projects come to light. The more support given, the faster projects can be released and the more projects can then be planned to fill the void.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that unless ever specified for particular paid jobs or special events, my comics will always be available online and in their raw forms for free. Patreon is simply a means of making sure that I\u0027m able to keep doing that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs support grows, more and more projects will be added to the roster of things I\u0027m able to work on. Currently planned are three entirely separate comic books. Future planned projects include even more comics and comic series, as well as Youtube Commentaries, art livestreams, and even a \u003cstrong\u003ecomic book review show which would be completely animated!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0How cool is that!? I would also love to get to a point where I can start supporting other small artists in the form of commissions either for the published final comic books (for back of the book artwork), or even for thumbnails for youtube videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you enjoy comics and perhaps share the thought process of supporting artists, then I hope you would please consider helping me to get these stories out and at a quality that lots of people could enjoy. It really does help me a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so very much for your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-EB\u003cbr\u003e"
