    "summary": "If you\u0027re reading this, chances are you already know me, so hello and welcome, friends! But if an introduction is in order...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMy name\u0027s Liz\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf you know me, it\u0027s probably from my writing on\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://blizzardwatch.com\"\u003eBlizzard Watch\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dealnews.com/\"\u003eDealNews\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.techlicious.com/\"\u003eTechlicious\u003c/a\u003e. But now I\u0027m delving into fiction and working on a novel. It\u0027s a sci-fi, time travel thriller called \u003cem\u003eAccidental Futures\u003c/em\u003e, which started with me watching \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e and thinking \"I could write a better time travel story than this.\" (Sorry, but I don\u0027t remember which episode I was watching.) In its current incarnation, it is absolutely nothing like \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e, but that\u0027s where it started. The first three novels in the series are already outlined, and the first one is due to my editor this year \u2014 so \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAccidental Futures\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and its sequels\u00a0will happen whether or not I get the financial support to cover the cost of making them\u003c/strong\u003e. (Though the schedule on getting them finished may be different depending how much support I get and how well the books do to help me cover costs.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal for noveling is to write two or three books a year (maybe with some short stories or serialized fiction thrown in for variety), all of which will be published as ebooks on Amazon (and perhaps other platforms). And, while these are the ideas I have sketched out right now, what those books are could change \u2014 if \u003cem\u003eAccidental Futures\u003c/em\u003e doesn\u0027t pan out, I could land on something else entirely.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe high cost of writing\u003c/h2\u003e\nI\u0027ve been a freelance writer for about a decade now. Freelancing means cobbling together a lot of writing and editing work to make a living every month \u2014 which is sometimes just a continual scramble for assignments and paycheck. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I enjoy writing and the freedom freelancing offers me, but like any job, it can be stressful.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I decided to forge into fiction writing, the big challenge was finding the time. Where could I carve out a few extra hours to write fiction that was doing nothing to help pay the bills? While there are plenty of authors who support themselves by writing books, writing and publishing can be pricey \u2014 and a lot of authors keep day jobs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a look at the costs:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOutline review ($150).\u003c/strong\u003e A walkthrough of a story outline with my editor to make sure I had all the bits and pieces to make the story work.\u00a0I decided to do this instead of developmental editing, where you do a similar review process but with a full draft, which would cost in the $1,000 range.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLine editing (around $1,200, depending on length).\u003c/strong\u003e This includes the basics of fixing grammar and spelling, but also polishing everything up to create a great finished project. I could spend less on editing or more on editing, but I\u0027m working with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lisapoisso.com/\"\u003eLisa Poisso\u003c/a\u003e, an editor I\u0027ve worked with for a long time and whom I trust implicitly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCover art ($100 or more).\u003c/strong\u003e Pre-made art, where an artist has put together a layout and drop in your title, can cost as little as $25... but isn\u0027t necessarily great. Professional cover designers making something completely custom for you charge $500 or more. The old adage of \"you can\u0027t judge a book by its cover\" is a lie. The cover is the first thing people are likely to notice about your book, and it either grabs their attention or it doesn\u0027t.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTaking those costs, I\u0027ll probably spend around $1,500 to publish one novel, without leaving wiggle room for something going wrong. (What if cover art costs more than I expect? What if I decide I really need to do developmental editing to make a solid story?)\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd then there are a host of minor expenses. I spend over $300 per year on web hosting and domains, which I use to help people find me and my work online. I relaunched my site last year with a new URL, logo, and design, and intend to use it as an online portfolio of my fiction and non-fiction work. I also need software for for writing, planning, editing, and formatting. Advertising can help a book get noticed, but it costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCa-ching, ca-ching, ca-ching.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThis is where you come in!\u003c/h2\u003eI know I went off the deep end with business speak up there, and I apologize if your eyes have glazed over. I promise I am not a mindless marketing automaton, but sometimes I have to think like one. Self-publishing means I\u0027m doing the creative stuff, the technical stuff, and the business stuff by myself. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m here because the chances of a first novel being a breakaway success are similar to the chances of winning the lottery. It\u0027s likely I won\u0027t cover publishing costs for my first book, and that makes it harder to write the second one and the third one. If I keep at it, there\u0027s a good chance my books will eventually pay for the cost of creating them \u2014 but until then, it\u0027s financially difficult.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith\u00a0Patreon, if you\u0027re interested in my work, you can help me offset the cost of creating it. Plus you get to hear a lot of me talking about writing, some behind the scenes content, and original fiction.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat I\u0027ve done and what I\u0027m doing\u003c/h2\u003e\nI\u0027ve already gone through outline reviews for the first three books in the \n\u003cem\u003eAccidental Futures\u003c/em\u003e series.\u00a0I have an editing date at the end of November \u2014 which has gotten pushed back a few times due to health problems \u2014 but after that I\u0027ll need to work out cover art, formatting, and distribution.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will be writing the \u003cem\u003eAccidental Futures\u003c/em\u003e trilogy regardless of whether I reach any of my Patreon goals.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0However, if I don\u0027t meet those goals, that means I still have to do enough freelance writing work to pay my bills and cover publication costs \u2014 which cuts in to my time for writing. \u00a0If I don\u0027t meet my first goal, I may not manage more than a book a year, though I\u0027ll do my best to do more than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m estimating about $250 per month per book, which covers all the costs of production and lets me cut back on freelance work to focus on getting writing done. If I can hit that goal, I will definitely be getting out a novel a year, and try for two. At $500 per month, I\u0027ll have the money and time to fully cover two books per year. And at $750 per month, I\u0027ll add a serial story into the mix, which Patrons will receive episodically, but will eventually be published in ebook form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI also have two high-end goals for more art (wallpapers, character art, or comics) and doing audiobooks. While I can handle most of writing and publishing on my own, these are things I would have to get outside help for \u2014 and that means more expenses. Unless I hit these goals, these are pie in the sky ideas that I won\u0027t be doing any time soon.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I go, I\u0027ll let you know what I\u0027m up to and explain what I\u0027m spending money on, writing-wise. I know I had no idea on a lot of the costs that went into publication before I started trying to do it myself, and if you\u0027re interested in that kind of behind the scenes, patrons can see the process as I figure it out myself.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e"
