I offer you a challenge: can you name a mainstream fantasy character who is LGBT? Lord of the Rings? Nope. Harry Potter? Not in the books themselves. Marvel Cinematic Universe? Maybe there\u0027s \"no audience\" for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been reading fantasy fiction since I was very young, and in that time, I\u0027ve rarely seen myself represented in the stories I love. So after decades of wanting it to be true, I\u0027ve decided to make it happen for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Eric Avery, and I\u0027m a writer (who happens to be gay) who strongly believes in authentic, diverse races, sexualities and genders being present in mainstream fantasy. Most of what I write incorporates these characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this worth my time?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eYou don\u0027t need to be a patron to read my books. All of the chapters of my current novel \"The Path of Mages\" are public and free for everyone to read. It\u0027s a young adult fantasy (imagine that J.K. Rowling and Mercedes Lackey had a baby) that focuses on finding your place in the world (what we writerly types call \"coming of age\"), magical insanity, body-swapping villains, and a plethora of LGBT-positive heroes and villains in a genre that badly needs more diversity. Oh, and the story is actually great too. This isn\u0027t an SJW project.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support this unknown writer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing stories since grade two, and still have them tucked under a bed in my parent\u0027s house. I\u0027ve always wanted to write stories for a living, but let\u0027s face it: it\u0027s not very realistic. If you enjoy what I write, consider supporting me so that I can make a small humble living on my passion. I develop a ton of content for patrons so that you get to follow along on my journey as I write novels and have some fun along the way! Take a look at the rewards for more info. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far: \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU! \u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re a lover of fantasy fiction, or a fiction writer yourself, I hope you\u0027ll be as passionate about this endeavour as I am. I believe in making my own magic, and writing stories and characters that I wish were around when I was a struggling gay kid. I hope you enjoy them!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

Eric has been writing his entire life, from short stories written on construction paper when he was eight to writing interactive fiction, novels and short stories.
