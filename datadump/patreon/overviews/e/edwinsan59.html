    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Edwin Santander, I\u0027m creating custom Pok\u00e9mon cards. Although this is just the prelude to a long journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say it\u0027s just the beginning since I\u0027m not really a professional artist, bacause I never studied art, I do not have any knowledge or pre-concept of what art would be in itself. although that does not stop me from desire to be a renowned artist and that\u0027s what counts for me, because right now, I feel like an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a 22 year old university student, I am studying a mechanical engineering career. with no purpose in life other than to graduate and become a slave, where I will probably end up in a office postrate in front of a desk signing papers and playing minesweeper on the computer. I know that science and machine design is important, but...\u00a0but it\u0027s not what I want, and it was only a few months ago that i realized that I do not really want to be an engineer, I am currently studying the 8th semester, in just under a year I should graduate. Although it is not what I want, I want to be an artist, draw, paint, create wonderful things from my mind, one of my goals would be that someday I could be an illustrator of TPCi Cards.\u003cbr\u003eEvery day I stay awake for hours without being able to sleep since my life has no meaning beyond that of getting up to follow a completely boring routine, I hear my mother say daily: \u0027\u0027You have to be happy, you have family, you have a ceiling, you have a girlfriend who loves you, there\u0027s no reason to be unhappy,\u0027\u0027 That\u0027s why I\u0027ll start with this, because the only time of the day where I\u0027m really happy is when I sit in front of my recycling sheets to scribble and pretend that I\u0027m a great artist, drawing during the evening with my electronic books of Andrew loomis downloaded illegally from the internet or in front of my computer and try each possible option in the photoshop or the paint tool sai.\u003cbr\u003eThanks to certain people who supported me before I could buy a graphics tablet and that\u0027s why I\u0027m here in front of you, opening my patreon for you, I hope and you can see me grow as an artist, because I think I can achieve great things, I hope and you also believe in me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-For over here I\u0027ll be offering personalized cards from the Pok\u00e9mon world.\u003cbr\u003e-But then I will be offering Nintendo art in general (Pok\u00e9mon, The Legend Of Zelda, Splatoon, Arms, etc.), Animated Series, Videogames in general, anime (Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Etc.), In addition to my original illustrations.\u003cbr\u003e-In addition I will be listening to suggestions from my patreons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow could your Pledge can help me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat money would go mainly to pay me an art school, since my desire to learn is immense, in addition to paying the necessary utensils for this, later I would be getting better equipment to draw digitally (a new computer, a better graphic tablet, brushes, pencils, crayons, aquarelas, etc.)\u003cbr\u003eI will also be interested in starting to manufacture Playmats for trading cards games (Pok\u00e9mon, Yu-gi-oh, Magic the gathering, Etc.), making printed T-Shirt and in addition to printing the cards that I make, so when the first two purposes are met I\u0027ll be thinking about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can follow me on my social media!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Edwinsan59/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.walkingrancanaria.com/wp-content/uploads/fbicon.png\" style=\"width: 72px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/EdwinSan59\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/capsocial-round/500/twitter-128.png\" style=\"width: 71px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edwin.san59/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://icon-icons.com/icons2/1211/PNG/512/1491580635-yumminkysocialmedia26_83102.png\" style=\"width: 71px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s start this trip, and your push will be a good way to start!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
