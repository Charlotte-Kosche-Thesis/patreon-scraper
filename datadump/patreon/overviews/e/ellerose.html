    "summary": "Hola!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a girl, not unlike most 21 year olds; raging brunch enthusiast, desperate to see more of the world, Instagram blogger purely for food-porn, willing to spend countless hours in a line for a good spot at a music festival and thankful for a heart and lungs to give me air and life each day. \u003cbr\u003e...Except that my bodily organs are slightly dysfunctional. \u003cbr\u003eAnd\u00a0so, I welcome you to the wonderful chaos that surrounds me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent 6 months in Africa and it changed my life in so many complex and msyterious ways. The people, the air, the overall magic of the place was indescribable...It may or may not have been malaria that caused this crazy jumble of words, but thats another story..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked with deaf children in Malawi when I was 18 years old. I say \u0027children,\u0027 but they were wise beyond their years. You can read about some of my experiences\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://africanadventuresandexplorations.blogspot.com.au/search?updated-min=2013-01-01T00:00:00-08:00\u0026amp;updated-max=2014-01-01T00:00:00-08:00\u0026amp;max-results=8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0I did a lot of fundraising for the cause and earlier this year I worked briefly with Oxfam and the Fred Hollows Foundation.\u00a0There are plenty of organisations that need your help and I 100% encourage you to go out in the world and spread the love. \u0027Small acts of kindness will change the world.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I know how it goes when someone starts asking for money. This\u00a0usually the part where you start fidgeting, avoiding their gaze and meshing together all the sporadic excuses you can conjure up. \u003cbr\u003e... For the most part, I \u003cem\u003eTOTALLY\u003c/em\u003e understand how annoying it is to be approached by one of \u003cem\u003ethose\u003c/em\u003e people. You\u0027re going about your day, minding your own business and \u003cstrong\u003ebam: \u003c/strong\u003e\"just a quick question for you today m\u0027am\". . .\u003cbr\u003e. .\u00a0Yes, I want to be a good person. Yes, now it\u0027s super awkward and even though I don\u0027t want to give you my \"dollar a day, which is as little as a coffee a day,\" I will, because I\u0027m being shown a picture of a starving child and lets be honest, I\u0027m probably in a supermarket complex, which is why you (the fundraiser) is positioned here, because it proves that I am infact, a consumerist on some level and therefore do have money to give.... but mayyyttee, the timing is impeccable and it couldn\u0027t be worse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankfully, this is the internet. I am not one of those people here. Whoever you are and wherever you may be, you are reading my work in your own privacy. I can\u0027t see you; you\u0027re free...literally. No charge for these little articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND SO, while I will be\u00a0very thankful and appreciative of any token of appreciation, dollar or donation that you willingly choose to spare for me, I mostly thank you wholeheartedly for reading my words and attempting to make sense of a sick girls musings.\u003cbr\u003eBy no means is my past volunteering or current illness a measure of why you should donate. That is all merely part of my adventures, a chapter in my story. I\u0027m here for my words, and they\u0027re here for whoever is willing to read them.\u00a0That thought in itself is as helpful as your pennies. \u003cbr\u003eSometimes the road gets lonely.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my little bit of freedom,\u003cbr\u003eELLE."
