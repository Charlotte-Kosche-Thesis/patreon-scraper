As the\ncreator of my work I strive to craft worlds and interconnected expansive\ncontinuity. From 2006, I\u0027ve been creating my own characters and now have\nseveral hundred under my self-published banner\nSeppuku Comics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough Patreon, I hope to receive\nmore support so that I can have the necessary supplies and community to produce\nmy art. The more you donate the more content I can produce, and the more of my\ncreation the world can enjoy. I wish not to be contained, but become something\nmore than I am. I was gifted with a healthy dose of talent and I wish to share\nit with others. Currently, I have one comic issue selling in one local comic shop.\nI plan to do much more than that. I want to leave a larger mark on the world\nthan that \u2013 your support can open more doors to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI greatly appreciate any\nsupport you are willing to give, because I\u0027m broke \u2013 or as I like to think of\nit as, \u201cexpenses challenged.\u201d Today I live in a trailer home with the four\nother members of my family, and soon I\u0027ll be heading to the Chicago area where\nI plan to attend an art college. Unfortunately, that takes even more money to\npay for than it costs to produce my art. Anything you can send will be worth a\nlot to me, my work, and my whole family. Thank you to all my patrons, and watch\nfor my work."

In the near future I\u0027ll be moving with my immediate family to a town\nnear Chicago, where my relatives live. I\u0027ll also be attending art college in the area. I\u0027ve recently started my own comic publisher, Seppuku\nComics, which uses my characters and art. Many of my stories mix\nserious social commentary and the joy of the extravagant role of superheroes\nwith powers. I now stay with my mother, stepfather, and two little brothers.I periodically see my father who lives in northern Virginia (and we often make YouTube videos together for my channel: Krypton Critics). \u003cbr\u003e",
