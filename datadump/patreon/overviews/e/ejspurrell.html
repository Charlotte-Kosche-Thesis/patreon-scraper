Since I was a young man, I had always maintained a strong passion for storytelling in its many forms. As an adult, that translated into many hours spent in the process of worldbuilding, whether it was for a grand epic fantasy land, or a dark dystopian future civilization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2008, I reached a milestone with the publication of my first book, fantasy novel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ejspurrell.com/children-of-the-halo/\"\u003eChildren of the Halo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003eand continue writing fiction to this day with its upcoming sequel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ejspurrell.com/the-liars-law/\"\u003eThe Liar\u0027s Law\u003c/a\u003e, and the post-apocalyptic space opera,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ejspurrell.com/solruin/\"\u003eSol:Ruin\u003c/a\u003e, both due in 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, I started the Ink \u0026amp; Artifacts Podcast, the flagship vehicle for Ink \u0026amp; Artifact Productions. While the podcast exclusively covers topics of the history, psychology, philosophy \u0026amp; application of storytelling, I have begun to use it as a launching point for several audio-based productions, including audiobooks and original audio content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s your situation, EJ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it\u0027s rather simple. I have a number of stories that I would like to tell. I\u0027ve no lack of ideas. I have a bevy of skills involved in the telling of stories, and damn it, that\u0027s precisely what I intend to do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the current time, these stories come in the form of text, but pre-production has started on an audio drama series entitled \u003cem\u003eRelics\u003c/em\u003e, featuring a cast of trained voice actors. An audiobook version of \u003cem\u003eChildren of the Halo, \u003c/em\u003eadditionally, is in the works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, these things take \u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e. As a labour of love\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, I would like both the website and the projects I engage in through the site to be self-sufficient.
