    "summary": "Thank you so much for checking out my page and supporting my journey. I have been an artist all my life and just recently found this page in hopes to pursue my talents even further. I create paint as the old artists did thousands of years ago using plants and minerals from which I gather from the earth. Some of these paints I create have been found on rock walls dating back 400,000 years old. Most of my travels so far collecting minerals and plants, have been in the USA but I have my eye on many other places around the world. I can also go to certain destinations and collect what I need to make a beautiful painting just for the person or collector whiling to pay for the journey. These types of commissions would be videoed as well and presented with the original painting. I hope you all enjoy my journey as I dazzle the world! Thanks again and may God bless!! ..............\u0026gt;\u0026lt;((((*\u0026gt;\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
