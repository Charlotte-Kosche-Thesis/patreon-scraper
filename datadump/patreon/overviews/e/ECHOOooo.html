    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do: \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eAs an algorithmic artist, I write \u00a0computer software with quite a bit of randomness that I set loose to create wonderful, intricate, and visually-interesting works. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon thing???\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0Patreon is a platform that enables anyone to be a Patron of the Arts for as little as $1/month. \u00a0You select the artists you want to support and tell Patreon how much you want to contribute each month to reward the artists whose works you value. Patreon is a platform designed to encourage artists to continue producing their work by providing a small monetary reward as a token of your appreciation and your encouragement for what we do. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtists, for their part, pledge to produce at least one work of art each month and describe what we make and how we make it. \u00a0Our patrons become a community of friends who can read about the work we do and better understand why we do what we do and the process we go through in making each particular piece. \u00a0 Artists can also provide various rewards to our patrons based on the level of support provided. \u00a0For example, my rewards range from a hearty \"THANKS!\" for a $1 monthly contribution to my tip jar, to a top reward of original pieces of art each quarter for someone with an interest in collecting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s my niche? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve created several different types of algorithmic art and I hope to share some examples of my work here on Patreon. \u00a0 For those who might be wondering, algorithmic art is a work of art that is produced entirely by a computer algorithm, a computer program written by the artist - it is essentially an artistic result that comes from a sequence of mathematical equations. \u00a0You might think of the computer as the paint and canvas, while the algorithm is my paintbrush. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy programs range from simulations of physical contraptions that could never really exist in the real world to simply writing some math equations that I intentionally design to produce some image that I\u0027d like to see appear on the virtual canvas of the computer. \u00a0In the first case, I don\u0027t always have a particular result in mind and the image the algorithm produces is often a surprise -- if it\u0027s a good surprise a work of art is created! \u00a0 If not, I tweak the program and try again. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the second case, I have an image in my mind of what I\u0027m trying to convince a computer to produce and I try to string together some mathematical equations in an attempt to make that image come to life. \u00a0In either case, it\u0027s often the \u003cem\u003eprocess \u003c/em\u003ethat is the motivating factor for me, and not always the result. \u00a0I ask myself, \"what can I do with science and \u00a0mathematics that can entice a computer to produce something new and interesting without human intervention\" (other than saying \"GO!\")? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art comes directly out of the computer using the algorithms I\u0027ve coded into the programs I write. \u00a0At its core, every work I make is based purely on mathematics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the Creations and Activity links about? \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Each time I create a new, print-worthy work of art I post the result to my Patreon Creations page (you can find the link at the top of this page). \u00a0I try to make a new \"Creation\" at least once each month, and often I end up with several. \u00a0As I work through various issues and discuss what I\u0027m trying to do and the process I go through to make my artwork, I post these discussions to the Activity page (the Activity link is up at the top of this page, too). \u00a0I often post my failures, which quite often result in strange, unexpected images of one sort or another. \u00a0Sometimes, a \"failure\" (when the resulting image is nothing like the result I was hoping for) ends up being something quite strange and different - and perhaps even becomes a work of art in its own right - even if it was not something I intended to make. \u00a0Those are often the results that lead me in a new direction!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ECHOOooo?ty=a\"\u003eActivity\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003epages\u00a0are kind of like an on-going blog about my process while the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ECHOOooo?ty=c\"\u003eCreation\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003epages show primarily just the end results, the final works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFlowers from Algol: \u00a0An Example \u00a0of my Creative Process for Making Algorithmic Art. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eFor the first few weeks I will share a perennial favorite that I\u0027ve been working on for many years. \u00a0In fact, I\u0027ve been tweaking, and improving this particular algorithm for almost ten years. \u00a0This algorithm produces a flower that emerges spontaneously from a blank canvas background, appearing to materialize out of empty space. \u00a0I produce these flowers by running a computer program I\u0027ve written to model a strange contraption. \u00a0This imaginary device consists of 1024 springs that are all connected to one another in a ring. \u00a0My program models the physics of the springs, making their motion react like a set of real springs would react if they were stretched and released to vibrate in space. \u00a0I simulate the process of stretching out\u00a0the contraption, releasing it, and I then draw a fine line representing the position of each spring at an instant in time. \u00a0After shortening the length of each spring by a small, random amount and then calculating the physics of motion and adjusting the new position of each spring over a very short duration of time, I draw their new positions and repeat this process many thousands of times. \u00a0As the contraption collapses, a beautiful flower spontaneously emerges. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe image shown above (in the banner of this page) is a small thumbprint of an actual drawing. \u00a0The original is over 12,000 x 15,000 pixels and is printed on heavyweight, 100% cotton rag, acid-free paper using archival-quality pigmented resin ink. \u00a0You can see the full image at somewhat higher resolution than this thumbnail on my \"Creations\" page...it\u0027s the image for Week 1."
