    "summary": "Welcome to Echo\u0027s Location! Here you will find an eclectic mix of jewelry, accessories, home decor, and various other trinkets, all with a metaphysical twist, as well as reliable tarot readings done just for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Arianna and I am the owner, designer, creator, and house diviner here at Echo\u0027s Location. I spend my days crafting beautiful trinkets, practicing divination, and traveling around the country in a travel trailer with my family, all of whom will surely make special guest appearances here from time to time.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been crafting for over ten years now. I began in high school with simple jewelry and a bit of sewing and gradually expanded to all sorts of other crafts in college (crochet, more intensive sewing, upcycling... You name it, I tried it).\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduation, I found myself back home working as a nanny and trying to find \u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003esomething\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0to bring more meaning into my life and more beauty into the world. That\u0027s when I began exploring the magical side of crafting. I started learning about different crystals and their properties, which led me into learning about herbs and \u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003etheir\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0properties, which eventually snowballed into learning tarot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA couple of years ago, I decided to try my hand at selling some of my pieces and, surprisingly enough, it worked well! As my business developed, I began to blend more of the things I\u0027m passionate about (the magical and metaphysical, my tarot practice, my desire to help people around me in whatever way I can) into it as well, which leads me to...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Echo\u0027s Location?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEcho\u0027s Location began in 2015 as a small Etsy shop and, occasionally, a booth at local pagan festivals and LARPing events. Since then, it has evolved into much more: an online shop full of beautiful, handmade trinkets and divination services, as well as my full time job!\u003cbr\u003eI currently offer an array of wire-wrapped and macrame crystal jewelry and wands, bottle charm necklaces, suncatchers, embroidered art, and more, and continue to create more unique pieces every day.\u003cbr\u003eMore than anything else, Echo\u0027s Location is a passion project. Nothing brings me greater joy than sending beauty and positivity out into the world, especially in the form of art that I have put my heart into. I have poured myself into this entirely and am so excited to see where it goes from here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this whole Patreon thing actually work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThink of it as a tiered subscription service. \u003cbr\u003eYou pledge a certain amount to donate to me and my work once a month. This part is important! \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is not like Kickstarter.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Your donations will be taken out once a month until you change your mind and cancel your subscription, so to speak. It is a \u003cem\u003erecurring \u003c/em\u003edonation.\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange, you get something cool from me once a month. What you get is determined by how much you donate and can range from access to patron-only content to a grab bag full of goodies delivered to your door and a personal tarot reading once a month (and more!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do your donations do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour continued donations do a \u003cem\u003elot.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0The money I make here helps me access more and better materials to bring all of you more and better crafts. It helps sustain and grow my business. It pays for marketing like business cards and Facebook ads. It \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0helps me pay my bills without a \"normal\" job, which frees up my time to make more pretty pieces for all of y\u0027all and allows \u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to be my full-time job. By donating to my shop, not only are you helping me, you\u0027re also helping yourself and others who enjoy the work I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get in return?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAside from feeling great about yourself for helping someone pursue their passion? Check out my awesome reward tiers and see for yourself!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere will also be super cool bonus rewards for \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0patrons when I hit milestone goals, so definitely check those out too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
