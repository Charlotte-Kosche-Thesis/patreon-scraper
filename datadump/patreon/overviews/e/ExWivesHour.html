I called in and quit my job that very day, both because I was having a blast- and because I COULD NOT find clean pants, and we kept hanging out. We never talked to those friend again. Except for a quick message to say thanks for introducing us and off we went into the sunny days of Washington Summer. We were 19 years old. \u003cem\u003e(We\u0027re in our early thirties now.\u00a0Fred is going to be pissed that I have photographic proof still. Oddly enough, we\u0027ve aged well.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eFred was attending the Community College in town and she got me to start taking classes there. I was sullen and unimpressed. Then the learning kicked in and getting to take classes with my \u003cem\u003efancy new girlfriend\u003c/em\u003e delighted me. I discovered a deep love of Psychology, Social Science and Women\u2019s Studies. Fred kept her focus on Science and Zoology. We moved our studies to Washington State University the next summer. \u003cstrong\u003eFred graduated with a B.S. in Zoology in 2008 and has continued to amuse me and others with scientific facts, information and logical thought patterns. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we were at university, we were the only LTR in our GLBTA(Gay, Lebian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance) club, so we ended up being a hub for numerous young queers, both in our apartment and around campus. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked at GIESORC (Gender Identity Expression and Sexual Orientation Resourse Center) for the duration of my time at WSU and Fred worked in the Science Lab. Listen to a quick recounting of our extensive partying on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/plots-plans-and-our-patreon/s-pBY7c\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlots, Plans and Our Patreon\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe left college, Fred with a B.S. and me with a long line of classes to finish, and moved to Portland, Oregon to live with our friends in SE. Our friends were always saying we should make a sitcom, and after 5 years, numerous roommates, pets and a divorce, our podcast,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEx-Wives Hour\u003c/a\u003e was born. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFred and I got divorced in 2010. We took about six months apart, on other sides of the country and when we came back together, we were tenetive. It took about a year of carefully negociating our feelings, being honest, connecting with one another and just hanging out as friends to realize- we were totally still besties. It\u2019s been 15 years of being best friends now and we both think: IT\u2019S FUCKING AMAZING to be best friends with your ex-wife. We think it\u2019s great fun and we wrote a cheat code to how to do it:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/10-ways-to-be-best-friends\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e10 Ways to be Best Friends with Your Ex-Wife\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started the podcast in 2015, right after I published my graphic novel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Off-Doodles-Finn-Graves/dp/1495481549\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRich Off My Doodles\u003c/a\u003e. We were looking for something interesting to do and were really enjoying each other\u2019s conversations. I had multiple friends who used Soundcloud as a platform for their music and Fred was listening to podcasts, so we decided to give it a try. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe came up with some hilarious topics during Season 1, such as:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/ex-wives-hour-ep-2-cults-and\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCults and Preppers\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/ep-6-pets-poop-and-deadpool\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePets, Poop and Deadpool\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/ep-7-lets-talk-about-s3x-baby\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLet\u2019s Talk About S3X Baby\u003c/a\u003e! We had a great time doing it, and people were listening to us, laughing and telling us to keep doing it. So we did.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/sets/ex-wives-hour-a-podcast\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWe created 21 Episodes in Season 1 and we got funding to do it for a full year. Hell Yeah!\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, we listened to all our podcasts, created a new plan and launched into\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/sets/experimental-sounds\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSeason Two\u003c/a\u003e. Halt! Stop the Presses! Full Stop. We hit a grownup roadblock. Full time jobs knocked us on our asses. We started struggling to make the deadlines. We were broke and somehow still managed to be funny, but the pressure was on. We took a break. Wandered off, did other things. Fred applied to Vet Tech School, I managed a tattoo shop for six months and finally finished that B.A. in Social Sciences from WSU in 2017. Time passed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then, we began to miss it. Our listeners climbed. Inch by inch. People were still listening to us. \u003cstrong\u003eSo, we got together, had a business meeting and decided three things.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. We both wanted to finish\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/sets/experimental-sounds\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSeason 2.\u003c/a\u003e We just needed to find funding. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. We loved the idea of returning to the podcast. We\u2019d both spent time away from it and listened to various other podcasts. Our friends who we consulted, agreed- we\u2019re pretty good podcasters. We\u2019re funny, accessible and relatable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. We wanted to connect more with our audiences. Bringing Melinda in as a guest star resonated with both of us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! We\u2019re back.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/sets/experimental-sounds\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSeason Two: Art and Science are Real! Is back in full swing.\u003c/a\u003e We\u2019ll be updating our podcast weekly (Friday evening around 7pm), so you can listen to us on the weekend. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s been an interesting journey. We\u2019re three years into this process and we\u2019ve learned so much, from each other, from listeners, from our friends and supporters. We want to thank each of you from the bottom of our hearts. Getting to connect with you like we have, getting to be silly together, to explore concepts relevant to our lives, means the world to us. Podcasting puts Fred and I in a different mindset. A curious one, interested in the world, ready to laugh and enjoy everything with a touch of wonder and Fred\u2019s brilliantly critical mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eGratitude!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eThank you to\u00a0\u003c/b\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/bkopihua\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBkopihua\u003c/a\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/b\u003e\u003cem\u003efor the funding and support during the first year of the podcast. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThank you to the\u00a0\u003c/i\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/finngraves\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatreon supporters of FinnGravesArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/i\u003efor the second year of funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eThank you to Alyse Thomas, \u003c/b\u003e\u003cem\u003ea loyal listener and friend for over a decade, who provided funding for\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ex-wives-hour/sets/experimental-sounds\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEx-Wives Hour, Season 2: Art and Science are real.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlyse\u2019s funding provides podcasts for all of you from March 2018-March 2019.
