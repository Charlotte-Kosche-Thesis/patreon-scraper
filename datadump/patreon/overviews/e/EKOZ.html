    "summary": "EclectiKOriginZ is an ever evolving lifestyle more than an art label, store, or business. It\u0027s a spiritual learning experience in creating through a variety of media to open up the mind and explore the infinite possibilities of life. It is dedication to sustainable design by using donated and/or local materials, upcycling/recycling items, trading for goods and services, supporting the community, and spreading love whenever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist living with social anxiety, bipolar disorder, and high sensitivity to an increasing number of things, life can be overwhelming. Creating things, experimenting with various media, and discovering new opportunities have become not only a priority, but a necessity for sanity. The search for answers never ends, and this is only the beginning. The discovery of art therapy, music therapy, and an eclectic assortment of spiritual healing practices has ignited a desire to share this experience in the hope that it ignites others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral years of bouncing from school to school ended with a Bachelor\u0027s degree in Interdisciplinary Visual Art that covers everything from painting and drawing to 3D modeling and game design, art history, marine biology, and an understanding of several different languages (including programming languages). Between going to college, working, volunteering for local causes, and just life in general, it was a crazy time. Because I spent so much time in school, that\u0027s all I knew. The past few years have been spent learning about myself and what I really want to do in the world. I\u0027ve met some irreplaceable, incredibly supportive people along the way and don\u0027t know where I\u0027d be without them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife has led me on a strange path, to say the least, but with the support of family, friends, and patrons of this site, I would like to get started on the path to exploring the world while doing what I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

I downloaded an app on my phone for daily readings and browsed through the card descriptions on a regular basis. Beyond the digital versions, I was rarely exposed to tarot decks. I\u0027d like to say this is because I\u0027ve been driven to make my own deck. An egyptian deck recently made it\u0027s way into my possession, but it\u0027s missing cards, and although I still get very responsive readings, I just don\u0027t feel comfortable reading for others with that deck. So, this leads back to making my own. I\u0027m excited to finally start this project and obtain a better understanding of tarot by providing services. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen this goal is reached and maintained, daily card readings will be available for all patrons.\u003cbr\u003eThis goal also unlocks a monthly personal reading giveaway.
