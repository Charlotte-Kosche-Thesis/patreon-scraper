    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eEd Buziak creates \u2018hand painted\u2019 artworks\u2026 literally, by hand!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor you, my prospective patron, owning any of my personal hand-prints is proof-positive that you have a unique piece of evidence of my identity. When I say \u2018unique\u2019 I mean that because there is no exact repeatability to my methods or output, every time I coat my hand with acrylic paint of whatever colour, tint or shade, it touches a different portion of my skin and, on contact with the paper receptor, reveals a different set of palm and fingerprints. And, each of these two or three-colour prints will have a different \u2018register\u2019 every time. There will only be a limited number of these hand-prints created at Levels 1 and 2 of this theme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach acrylic-on-paper hand-print will be created during my daily morning period of meditative Tai-Chi\u2026 the first colour applied immediately before my routine, and the second colour when my exercise programme reaches completion. My desire is therefore that positive energy is put into each individual piece of artwork\u2026 with the flow and movements of my hands during this exercise being part of this artistic creative act. And if you place your own hand in contact with the print of my own hand we will have made a connection\u2026 an \u0027artistic handshake\u0027 if you like, and a personal greeting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of the \u0027patronage\u0027 everyone receives at least one tangible piece of original art and, as a bonus, one or more of my ebooks, downloadable as either an ePub or in the pdf format. The subjects I have written about for many years are a) Photography in general from my base in France, b) Postal history which I have assembled since childhood, and c) Image sales through stock photo agencies\u2026 they will be sent out in that order. Each tome has a minimum of 50 images accompanied by descriptive, anecdotal articles totalling tens of thousands of words\u2026 and will provide very informative and enjoyable reading!"

     "about": "Artist... photographer... writer... francophile... vegetarian... fixie cyclist... minimalist... easy going...\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI studied Interior Design at Manchester Art College in the 1960s, working in the TV and Film industry for a decade, before turning to photography full-time. I published and edited specialist photographic magazines on darkroom techniques for several years, and now supply images to stock photo agencies worldwide. However, half a century after leaving art college a different artistic output is returning as I rediscover ways of working with paper, pencil and paint... a reaction to current digital photography being too technically processed rather than being a more satisfyingly creative hands-on operation!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ello.co/edbuzz\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ello.co/edbuzz\"\u003ehttps://ello.co/edbuzz \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e",
