We live and breathe the 4X genre, and like you, we want to know everything about past, current, and upcoming video game releases. Some of us have played 4X games since the first 4X golden age which started in the early 90\u2019s. With the coming of this second 4X golden age, we want to do more than just play these games; we want to influence the development of the genre and we want to champion the genre by spreading the word of its great games and opening them up to wider audiences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s great you say, but what does that have to do with you?

We aren\u2019t satisfied with just reading what others write and watching what others post. We are an intelligent group that like our games to be deep, meaningful, and thought provoking.
