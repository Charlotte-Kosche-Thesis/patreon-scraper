As a Teaching Artist for The Song Room I\u0027ve even taken my students to perform with me at amazing venues, including Deakin Edge at Federation Square in Melbourne. I live in Ballarat in Australia with my awesome wife and kids, and I also really quite like science, history and comic books!\u003cbr\u003e",
