This is a time consuming effort that often conflicts with my startup and consulting work. I am trying to find creative ways to fund this effort. While many hapi community members are fully employed by companies that actively support their contributions, my resources are limited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMaintaining hapi takes about 30-40 hours a month. This includes reading every issue in the core module and all the module it directly depends on, reviewing all pull requests and commits made to these modules, and answering complex questions. It usually includes one major release every couple of months which is very time consuming on its own (16-24 hours) even when the release is very simple. Part of the job is reviewing every single line of code used by the framework to ensure it\u0027s reliability and security.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhile the ecosystem as a whole is doing well, with a lot of community members contributing their time and resources, the core module is different. Decision made in core have an oversize impact on the community as well as put the health of the code and the application built on it at risk. I take this very seriously and I believe a big reason why hapi has been successful with high value applications is that people trust it to be both secure and high quality.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to generate steady income which will allow me to cut back on some of my consulting work and focus on maintaining hapi. In full transparency, funds donated will be used directly by me to supplement my consulting work. Unless otherwise stated, these funds will not be shared with other hapi contributors. I don\u0027t want to create the impression that donating is sponsoring community work. The funds will go directly to me to cover my costs of writing open source software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering this effort and for all your support using and contributing to the hapi community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: once you contribute $100 or more (regardless of sponsorship level), you are added to my private email list for critical security updates. People on this list receive the earliest notice when security issues are identified."
