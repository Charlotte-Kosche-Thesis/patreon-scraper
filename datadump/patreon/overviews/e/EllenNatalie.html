For the past decade I have illustrated for games, books, and created a variety of comics both in print and online - including my current ongoing webcomic, \u003ca href=\"http://furryexperience.smackjeeves.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurry Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have loved drawing FE for the past several years, am grateful for the positive responses from its\u0027 readers, and have many more stories planned I\u0027m excited to share! However, some ideas have to be delayed or set aside because they\u0027re too ambitious for the time and resources I have available. This comic will always be free to read online, but enough support will help me be able to afford the time to create all the additional stories I have planned, go towards creating FE books, short stories, and other fun projects both in and outside of the FE universe."
