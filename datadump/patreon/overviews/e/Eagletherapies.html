     "about": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my little corner of the internet. I am Stephanie Seger, a Shamanic Practitioner that lives in the Northern Virginia area. I host drum circles, shamanic journey groups, ancestral healing circles and heart centered sound circles in DC, MD, and the Northern VA area. I also network with a bunch of other people in the area that put on similar events, and I feature them (as well as a calendar of events) on my newsletter. The newsletters go out once a month, and occasionally I will send one in the middle of the month if there\u0027s a special event, but those are rare. If you are interested in the newsletter, you can fee free to take a look at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://eagletherapies.com/2017/06/25/newsletters-archives/\"\u003enewsletter archives\u003c/a\u003e of your can\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/cYtzuP\"\u003esign up\u003c/a\u003e for the newsletter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many can tell, being a community event coordinator, putting together the newsletter and also having a healing practice takes a lot of energy. While I do take on clients and perform Shamanic Healing sessions for people, the struggle that many practitioners run into is a consistency with a stable amount of income coming in per month. Through Patreon, I will be able to gain a stability\u00a0with a predictable amount of income, allowing more ease with less stress. This allows me to be present in a new kind of way, providing the same services with an anchored foundation through supporters like you.\u00a0",
