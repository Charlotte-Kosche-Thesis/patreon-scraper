    "summary": "Hello and welcome. I\u0027m Endless_Roads. I\u0027ve been creating a variety of audio content over the past 5 years. I\u0027ve decided to take another step in this journey with my own Patreon account. Through your support on Patreon I will be able to dedicate myself to creating more content for you to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of my Patrons will be given early access to new releases.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s my way to reward all of you for going above and beyond to support me here on Patreon.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s talk about the tiers.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTier 1 is for those who would like to make a small contribution towards my audio work. Think of it like dropping a buck into a tip jar. Every little bit does in fact help me continue creating content. Early access is the base reward for any Patreon support.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTier 2 is for those who may want to give a little more. In return you will have early access and ability to download my audios. The download link will be provided through Patreon and updated as new audios are released.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTier 3 will also receive early access, the option to download my audios, and provide valuable feedback through Patreon. This will give you the ability to influence the direction of my content. If I need new ideas, then you\u0027re the ones I go to. There are also monthly polls where you can vote for Patreon sponsored audios.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI\u0027m grateful for all of the love and support you have shown me over the years, so I think it\u0027s important to do something good with that beyond just creating audios. A portion of what I earn on Patreon will be donated to my local humane society every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking forward to where this journey will take me and I would have never made it this far without you coming along with me. Thank you for your continued love and support over the years."
