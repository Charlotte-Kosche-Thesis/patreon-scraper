    "summary": "My current project is currently called Namira- it\u0027s a story about a group of youths in their own situations, forced to leave the homes they know and brave the big wide world of Azure\u0027s Breath. A young witch who\u0027s never been far from home, suddenly thrust out on her people\u0027s ritualistic Coming of Age ritual. A half-troll, forced to leave her people\u0027s land because of her nature.  A princess, on the run from an unfriendly court with an unlikely ally. And on the horizon, something truly alien is on its way...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----------\u003cbr\u003eHello, and welcome!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m known in some places as Exabyte. I write things sometimes, and I\u0027ve been writing things in some form or another my entire life- from traditional RPGs, to Interactive Quests, short stories and even a few ill-advised attempts at novels that I continue to stubbornly work on. The only problem is that no matter how prolific I am, I can\u0027t survive and do the things I love at the same time, mostly because surviving involves going to that \u0027outside\u0027 place instead of typing away. This is where you come in. With your help, I\u0027ll be able to run more quests, write more stories, tell more tales without having to squeeze it into my free time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027m not someone who wants to divide content between the people who pay and the people who don\u0027t such as making side-stories or extra material that only certain people can read, so everything I write is going to be released to everybody. In fact, you can think of this patreon page more like a glorified donation jar than anything. I can say that the more support I get, the easier it will be for me, which directly translates to more and better material for you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI admit, most of what I do is just pulpy fantasy and science fiction stuff- both in quests and in stories- because I love creating new and interesting worlds to explore, with intriguing characters and monsters to slay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support, it means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e"
