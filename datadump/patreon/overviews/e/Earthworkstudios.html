    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWonderful Somethings...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDocumenting true moments of emotion and beauty inspires this body of photographic work. Beauty extends beyond the daily encounters that occur with media and advertising. With this body of work I aim to explore the unique qualities within each subject individually. Beauty can be found in dualities; Happiness / Sadness , Joy / Anger, Ecstasy / Sorrow. Through understanding my subjects and collaboration we develop a body of images that represents both their perceived identity as well as their intimate qualities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/35i0inm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Keith-Alan DeFranca. I am a visual artist based in New England, USA. The artwork you will see on this page is part of my fine art portraiture. It will range in content because every person I collaborate with is unique and I never know in what direction the projects with finally end up. Some of the photosets will contain visual expressions of sensuality, vulnerability, self confidence using the naked human form. Nudity and the human form is a beautiful and amazing thing to capture and please respect the ability of these individuals who have the self confidence and bravery to be so vulnerable and exposed. \u00a0I hope you enjoy and appreciate your feedback!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your amazing support and look forward to creating and growing more and more every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my website here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.earthworkstudios.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEarthWorkStudios.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Instagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/earthworkstudios/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@earthworkstudios\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/keithalan.defranca\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKeith-Alan DeFranca\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://earthworkstudios.tumblr.com\"\u003eearthwork studios/tumblr\u003c/a\u003e"

     "about": "Keith-Alan DeFranca \u00a0has been photographing for more than a decade. Starting with a 35mm Nikon film camera in high school taking photographs of his classmates and family. He started his own company at age 18 and photographed anything and everything he could. In 2006 he attended the New Hampshire Institute of Art part-time and later went full-time and graduated with his Bachelors of Fine Arts with a concentration in Photography. Keith-Alan went on to work in a professional equipment rental house where his knowledge of technique and utilizing the tools of his trade grew immensely. Keith-Alan works as a full-time commercial photography as well as a fine art photographer. When he works with a subject he tries to capture the candid and intimate moments we all seem hesitant to show. His innate ability to capture the essence of his subjects is time consuming and hard work but ultimately worth every second. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeith-Alan was the first student to use the photo-process of Wet Plate Collodion at The New Hampshire Institute of Art, and has continued to use the process with his \"The Silver Projects\" series documenting everyone from actors, singers, and other various people of influence as well as all walks of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeith-Alan\u00a0lives in New Hampshire and creates all over",
