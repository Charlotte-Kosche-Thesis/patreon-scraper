    "summary": "To anyone in the audio radiance who doesn\u0027t know me, I am Elizabeth Schechter and I am a romance writer.\u00a0The book that most people seem to know me for is \u003cstrong\u003eHouse of Sable Locks,\u003c/strong\u003e which is steampunk erotic romance, and was my second novel. I write fantasy and science fiction romance, and as of the point where I\u0027m writing this out, I have fifteen novels and novellas that are either in print already, or are in the process of coming to publication. There are other novels in the wings, finished and waiting for their turn in the sun. I\u0027ve been writing professionally since 2009, when I sold my first short story to Circlet Press. That short story, by the way, was \u003cem\u003eThe Succubus\u003c/em\u003e, which grew up to be \u003cstrong\u003eHouse of Sable Locks\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suppose I could say I\u0027m here because all the cool kids are doing it. All the writers and all the creative people I know and love best in the world are doing their thing on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat the heck TOOK me so long?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few ideas about that, but nothing I can pin down and say \"THIS is why I didn\u0027t start my Patreon over a year ago when I created my account!\" Maybe it was that I didn\u0027t want to put out the hat? Maybe it\u0027s now because publishing has gotten really weird lately? Can\u0027t really say. But the time is now. Stop wibbling, Liz.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Wibbling stopping in three...two...one...now)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, now that I\u0027ve gotten over my collywobbles, here I am.\u00a0Why I\u0027m looking at Patreon? Well, I\u0027ve got this new thing in my head, and it\u0027s looking to be a long term epic fantasy adventure. If you read my blog, it\u0027s the elemental project that I\u0027ve been toying with. This is something I really want to develop and start working on. I\u0027m asking you to take this journey with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here\u0027s how it will work: I\u0027m currently in the middle of writing another series. So I\u0027ve set this Patreon up to be pay on content creation. That means that while i might post newsy things or recipes or videos or something, until I post something related to the Elemental project, no one will be paying a dime. At some point in the future, we might change over to pay per month. If and when we do that, I\u0027ll warn everyone ahead of time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything will happen in this Patreon. World-building, character exploration, thrashing out the details and the timeline and all the dirty, nitty-gritty details that no one ever sees unless you are a writer or you live with one. Eventually, this will turn into something, and people who ride the roller-coaster with me will end up with some undetermined number of books at the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf that works for you all, then all aboard. It\u0027s gonna be fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
