    "summary": "Burlesque is what drives me. It is my place in life. It is a passion that I sleep, eat, and breathe. I (quite literally sometimes) pour my blood, sweat, and tears into my projects. Whether creating costume pieces or choreography, I always give great attention to detail and handle everything with great care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince a young age, it has always been important to me to follow my passion and support myself in doing so. About 7 years into the journey that burlesque has lead me on, I have been able to cut back my \"muggle job\" to part time, and I am always extremely aware that I would not be able to do so without my supporters. Those who book me, hire me, commission me, and purchase from me really make this life possible and I am forever grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point along my chosen path, I have also come to realize the sacrifices and dedication required to truly walk it. Everything I do requires immense amounts of time and energy, often sacrificing some stability and balance that exist along other pathways. Income from month to month is never guaranteed and time put in does not = time paid for. These things are the prices required in order to do what I love for a living and, while trying, I am willing to pay them. Crazy, right?! There are times it feels crazy to me too, but that\u0027s following passion for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal in creating this page is two-fold: to assist with stability and balance along my chosen path, making it easier to put in the time I truly feel necessary, and to offer rewards to my supporters who make this possible. It\u0027s really a win-win. Thanks you for taking the time to read this and cheers to your interest in supporting the arts and small businesses!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e - Eva\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*psst!....
