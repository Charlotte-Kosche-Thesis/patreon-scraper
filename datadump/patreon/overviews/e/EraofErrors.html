I\u0027ll continue to so for the foreseeable future, regardless of any donations I receive through Patreon, because I love making the series; at the end of the day, I\u0027m trying to make something entertaining that hopefully you enjoy reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo note though, the previous artist for the series has left to pursue other endeavors, and as such, for an indefinite period of time, the series will continue in written, novel format. I\u0027m still searching for another artist to take up the job of illustrating the series, but haven\u0027t found one yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat unfortunately means that most of the rewards here on the Patreon aren\u0027t going to really be viable until I get a new artist, as almost all of them are art-based; if you do pledge to support me, know that as a caveat, that I have no idea how long it\u0027ll be until I can actually make good on your rewards due to the lack of an artist (for now).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, ANYTHING you can pledge towards the series is extremely appreciated; I\u0027m currently doing practically nothing but freelance work, so I\u0027m living on pretty much a month to month basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I do find an artist, I do eventually plan to publish the first 150 pages or so in a graphic novel format; I definitely want to get this thing printed and in physical form for you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo your support will help me keep going and keep me from being homeless, essentially; it\u0027ll also help give me time to find a new artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the above situation, I\u0027ll be using the pledge money directly for essentials first (food, paying rent, bills) and if I get enough pledges, anything left over will go towards improving the state of the comic (hiring someone to revitalize the website, advertisement/promotion of the comic, so on).\u003cbr\u003e"
