    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho we are\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are are a family of four who enjoys listening to podcasts before going on a trip. When we decided to start exploring the National Parks with our kids, we were surprised that there was not a dedicated podcast. Thus, an idea was born.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we are doing this\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are passionate about the parks. We aim to inspire families to visit the parks and provide a more informed visit. We want to provide a resource that will be useful for other families planning their trips. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat to expect\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEverybody\u0027s National Parks covers a park with a series of episodes, where we dig deep into different aspects of a park that we visit. We start with a trip report where we talk about what we did, our impressions, tips and recommendations. Our kids also talk about what was memorable for them. The trip report is followed by a a number of episodes with experts. We interview interpretive rangers about advice on hikes and activities for families, biologists, scientists, archeologists, historians, and tour guides. We include shownotes with resources on our website. We post an episode every two weeks on Tuesdays.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you are camping in Olympic National Park, you may imagine Native Americans standing in that same spot a millennia ago. When you are hiking in the hollows of Shenandoah, you may see traces of\u00a0pioneers\u0027 hardscrabble homesteads from 150 years ago. While contemplating the multi-hued rock strata of Zion National Park,\u00a0you may be awed by the millions of years of earth\u0027s uplift and erosion it took to form\u00a0the heavenly canyon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are honored that you are interested in our podcast. It takes a lot of time and effort to produce each episode including: research, outreach, scheduling, interview preparation, recording, editing, writing shownotes, publishing, and promoting. With financial support we may do a lot more to help plan your next trip to our National Parks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and sharing our passion for the National Parks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
