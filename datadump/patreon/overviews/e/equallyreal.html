    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to the Patreon page for Single Quantum Event! I\u0027m Melanie, writer of these stories, coming at you live from the center of the multiverse. Thank you so much for considering donating to my work, or for donating if you\u0027re one of my lovely patrons! Your patronage lets me continue doing something I love, and means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new here, you might be asking yourself: exactly what \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Single Quantum Event? What are you doing here? Well, Single Quantum Event is a website centered around three concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Why isn\u0027t the serialized novel as much of a thing anymore?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSerialized storytelling is big these days, from podcasts to webcomics to webseries. But you don\u0027t see as many serialized long form stories. Sure, they probably exist, but I\u0027m of the opinion that more of them should exist. This website is my contribution to bringing back the serialized novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. What if every story was true?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re familiar with comic books, you\u0027re familiar with the idea of parallel worlds--places where some things are the same, but not everything is. The concept of a multiverse is what fuels Single Quantum Event\u0027s stories. Stick around long enough, and you\u0027ll find that each universe has its core players, but those core players might show up in other universes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. What if things could get better?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re like me, you turn on the TV or open a story and wonder when we all got so tired. Pessimism and bleakness seem to seep into every corner of our lives, including the media we consume. I\u0027m not saying you won\u0027t feel things in your time on this website. I\u0027m not saying things won\u0027t get bad on occasion. But I am saying that I\u0027m dedicated to giving you stories where good things can happen, and will happen. Come read my stories, and we\u0027ll be spitefully optimistic in defiance of the world together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the stories on the website, I also offer my opinion on media on the tumblr page. Movie reviews are the day after I see the movie, and TV reviews are every Saturday and cover everything I\u0027ve seen this week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not currently one of my patrons, you might be wondering, \u003cem\u003eWhy should I support this person?\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I am one of the many artists out there who has to juggle low-paying work and writing to get by, and my financial situation often leaves me prioritizing the former over the latter. Every dollar you donate makes me more secure, which gives me time to make more and better art. In addition, I\u0027m committed to using the money I make to support other artists. This means commissions, donations, patronage on this site, whatever. I want other people to create with me. So you\u0027re not just helping me; you\u0027re helping other artists as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot to read and a lot to discuss, and I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve decided to take the journey with me. So strap in, pick a universe to travel through, and let\u0027s get started on Single Quantum Event!\u003cbr\u003e"
