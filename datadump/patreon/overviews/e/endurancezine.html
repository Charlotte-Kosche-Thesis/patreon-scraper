Furthermore, we aspire to voice those who work behind the stage. Our \"Behind The Music\" gives a platform to those behind the stage, including promoters, sound technicians, tour managers but also artists and others involved within the industry. We really want to continue doing this and bring out more than just music reviews. We want to show the lifestyle that goals along with all different kinds of alternative music! Our secondary goal is to promote and expose social awareness, culture, art and other projects involved with or based within the music industry. This comes down to a variety of projects, companies, organizations, etc. with whom we work or collaborate.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the last two years we\u0027ve managed to fulfill (and will keep doing so in the future) that goal by the publication of music reviews and live event reviews. Covering festivals such as Groezrock, Warped Tour, PRH, ... interviewing bands (incl. Less Than Jake, John Coffey...), promoting events (such as BMTH\u0027s That\u0027s The Spirit Release), promoting tattoo artists like Sivanski and Snip Art (Robbin Snip), and shooting shows. Furthermore we also publish articles and opinion pieces on several events and issues within the music scene. We offer a look behind the scenes!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why go digital? Why Readymag?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the time of writing we\u0027re halfway 2016 and yet most media and publications still use old fashioned and outdated websites and layouts. Yes, we\u0027ve gotten embedded music streams and YouTube videos. And yes, most websites do have social media icons and twitter feeds. But they\u0027re almost always just embedded within a boring, plain layout. We want to bring magazines, and especially zine culture back, and not just back, we want to launch it into the 21st century. The possibilities are endless! Why keep the bland white or grey backgrounds when you can get that magazine look in a browser, not just a pdf or mobi file? \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe try to come up with the best possible layout and design with each new zine we publish. We\u0027ve learned a ton during these last two years and still are. In fact, I think we\u0027ll never stop learning or evolving, let alone improving our issues! That\u0027s why we\u0027re making Patreon! To keep improving and evolving as to provide the best possible experience to our readers. To make sure zines can become popular again and create a platform for exposing the music that we all deserve, but don\u0027t often find.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0027s work with animations and gifs, let\u0027s work with icons and slideshows incorporated within the design of our pages, make interactive design possible. You see a review, click or hover on the icon next to it and get the band\u0027s setlist for that night. Click or hover on another one and you\u0027ll get their line-up, with names and instruments popping up just as easy.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe follow a \"less is more\" when it comes to the aesthetic part of our magazines, but don\u0027t be fooled, you\u0027ll be able to find everything you need to know, and if not, give us feedback and who know\u0027s, your idea might be incorporated next! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause it\u0027s not just about the big bands, it\u0027s about the music, and the people behind the music.\u00a0\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe here at Endurance try to go for a diverse approach when covering the alternative music scenes. Putting bands, no matter their following and from all over the world next to each other, giving a platform to the people working behind the scenes as well as mixing things up with lifestyle elements, activism, opinion pieces, columns, etcetera.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eSo how do we do this? -\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, by working together with a variety of bands, PR companies, bookers, promoters, record labels and people with a similar link to the industry. This includes promoting and exposing certain businesses such as record stores, tattoo artists, visual performers, graffiti artists, etc... that fit within the lifestyle element of our zine. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is most emphasised by our \n\u003cem\u003eBehind The Music\u003c/em\u003e part of our publications. With each zine we publish, the list grows longer. Ranging from an open letter to the music scene, a column by an audio engineer on his band\u0027s past experiences with externals, an opinion piece on why \"coding is punk\", and soforth. We provide a platform to voice the thoughts and experiences from the people who work within and behind the (alternative) music scene.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRecently, we\u0027ve added a new feature titled \n\u003cem\u003eGRRRL Talk\u003c/em\u003e. As the name suggests, it\u0027s a rrriot-like column written by \u003cem\u003eJordyn L. Corner\u003c/em\u003e. Jordyn will focus on pointing out, discussing and providing information about various social (justice) issues within the music scene. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFeel free to contact us any time on Facebook and Twitter or by sending us an e-mail at \n\u003cu\u003ejonathan@endurancezine.com\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
