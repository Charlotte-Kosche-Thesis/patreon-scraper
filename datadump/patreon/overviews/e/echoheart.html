    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e We\u2019re just a few kids from suburban Maryland that wanted to make fun and honest rock music. We started barely out of high school, our drummer still in his junior year of high school. We heard the stories about how hard it would get, how expensive it would be, how much doing this would tear into our lives and wallets. We didn\u2019t care. This is what we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u003cbr\u003e\nHere we are two EPs, a single, and a couple tours later. We have a more dedicated fanbase than we ever thought we\u2019d get or deserve, and our lives have been blessed in so many ways because of this project.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut here we are again facing the same dilemma. We want to make great art and tour the country playing it for our supporters, but with minimum wage jobs and making music being as expensive as it is, this is costing us more than we really have.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe ended up doing a GoFundMe campaign to fund our most recent EP,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv_X7TjCHo4\u0026amp;list=PLvOZN1qbAdr1_mGdEEarhVM3CEABSAbQz\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Way We Were Made\u003c/a\u003e. This campaign did so well that we were able to order an entire new line of merchandise and pay for recording costs in full. If only we knew that there\u2019s more that goes into a record than merch and recording costs.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis summer we\u2019re dying to get back on the road and play our new record for you all, but with busted equipment and no van, this is a huge challenge for us. Even the money to rent a uhaul, pay for gas, and re-up on CDs and merch is difficult for us, and we\u2019re all forced to work extra hours to make it happen. Our music video alone costed over $1000 to make, and we\u2019d love to make another at some point this year. But with the rate we\u2019re going at and how much money music streaming/selling platforms take out of our sales, we\u2019ll be in heavy debt by the end of the year.\u003cbr\u003e\nAlright I think we can stop harping on what struggling artists we are. It\u2019s been like that since the beginning and nothing has stopped us from continuing our efforts to make this band thing a full time effort.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are making this a monthly supporting platform. This means that you\u2019ll only pay a certain amount every month to be a part of the Patreon experience with us. We\u2019ll be sharing exclusive behind the scenes pictures and videos, as well as sharing all YouTube videos, tour updates, new merch, new music videos, and of course new music, with all of you first. This way, the pressure is off of us to constantly be pushing new content towards you, and the pressure is off of you to pay for multiple videos or songs a month to be a part of the club.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis year, Echoheart is back and stronger than ever before. We are prepared to go the absolute distance with you guys. But in order to make that happen, we\u2019ll need a little backing support.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile we\u2019re on the road, in the studio, planning and preparing for tour and in the writing process, we will share everything with you. You\u2019re our backbone and the reason we\u2019re able to keep this project alive and thriving. And the less we have to worry about going broke, the more art we can make for all of you amazing people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need you. We love you. We couldn\u0027t do this without you.\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003eEchoheart\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
