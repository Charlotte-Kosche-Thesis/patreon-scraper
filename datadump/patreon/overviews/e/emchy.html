Thanks for considering becoming my Patron.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a queer country musician making songs about good friends and hard times. It\u0027s important to me to tell the stories about love, friends, and how we as humans connect to each other and share experience. I believe that folks in this world are mostly good and want to create art that helps us all come together instead of being divided. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the official story of my music:\u003cbr\u003eThe Secret Emchy Society plays foot stompin\u0027 heart breakin\u0027 cowboy songs about good friends and hard times. Frontwoman Cindy Emch has been recently dubbed \"the First Lady of Queer Country\" by the Huffington Post and listed as one of the \"Ten Queer Country Artists Music Fans Should Know\" from TheBoot.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write music in the tradition of old country and americana. Honoring \nthe work of artists like Johnny Cash, Leadbelly, and Hazel Dickens. It\u0027s\n raw, emotional, honest, and 100% gritty and real. I\u0027ll be using your support to give me some breathing room as an artist to experiment and take more risks. I\u0027ll also be using your support and investment to push me to write more songs with the intention of sharing them with you. I plan to share multiple songs, song drafts, performances, etc. monthly and give you a window into my songwriting process and how my bands take these songs and evolve / arrange them.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Cindy Emch sings old school country music in the tradition of the Carter Family, Hazel Dickens, Pete Seeger, Billy Bragg, and Hank Williams. She uses her unique \u0026amp; nuanced voice to sing dark and haunting footstompers and heartbreakers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a fat, queer, lefty rabble rouser there isn\u0027t a logical place for her in modern country music. With your help we\u0027re gonna put the songs first and make the space ourselves! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer experience growing up far left-of-center in the conservative wilds of fly-over America keeps her rooted in tradition while her stints in New Orleans, San Francisco \u0026amp; Oakland have imbued her material with a sense of adventure \u0026amp; a sympathetic view of the sinners, the gamblers, the rogues, the good-time girls \u0026amp; the losers that populate her songs. It is clear that she inhabits these archetypes \u0026amp; loves the lure of the open road from the way she makes them spring to life in her words. She has the ability to be equally at home playing the part of the leaving lover or the one done wrong because she has lived those roles rather than read about them. She sees both sides but always knows which is which. Songs pour forth in a voice that is 49% heartbreak and 51% fury yet is never devoid of humor \u0026amp; self-awareness.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmch\u0027s music is informed by the musical tradition handed down by Mildred Bailey, Cab Calloway, Louis Jordan, Tex Williams, Merle Haggard, Hazel Dickens, Hank Williams \u0026amp; Patsy Cline but is very much her own. She is descended from this canon but not of it; she has distilled her approach from within rather than infusing it with external influences. Her lyrics are direct but never simplistic, to the point yet subtle. Emchy gives voice to the beauty \u0026amp; danger alive in America.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eShe has been writing songs and founding bands since 2005.  She has recorded albums with Rhubarb Whiskey, Vagabondage, Sinner\u0027s Tonic, Oakl\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003eand Wine Drinkers Union, \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Secret Emchy Society, and Feral.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
