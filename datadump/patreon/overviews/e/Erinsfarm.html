    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\"Erins Farm\"\u00a0 is a Nonprofit (501c3) Animal Rescue \u0026amp; Sanctuary farm for ALL types of animals in need. Erin has been rescuing \u0026amp; educating with animals since 1994. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiving back everything to the animals over 20 years, Erin grew a small animal rescue in a city apartment into a 33 acre privately owned animal sanctuary farm maintaining over 100 happy, loved \u0026amp; adored animals of all shapes \u0026amp; sizes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNamed by the kids that loved to visit ~ \"Erins Farm\"\u00a0 has been a working \u0026amp; functioning rescue FARM since 2011 \u0026amp; now has finally become a an official Nonprofit Animal Rescue in 2017! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFarm animals like horses, cows, sheep, goats, pigs \u0026amp; rabbits that were headed towards slaughter are rescued \u0026amp; instead live out their lives at the farm enjoying life the way that nature intended them to.\u00a0 The Farm also give homes to reptiles, amphibians, parrots \u0026amp; other occasional exotics that found themselves in need of or losing their homes because they might have been inappropriate choices for a pet.\u00a0 Many rabbits \u0026amp; pot bellied pigs were given up by their owners.\u00a0 Sadly in this \"rent a pet\" society animals like this often get dumped a few years later once the novelty of an exotic pet wears off causing them confusion \u0026amp; instability.\u00a0 These \"recycled pets\" \u0026amp; rescued farm animals are now ambassadors for children \u0026amp; adults to learn about how our daily choices have long term affects on other species. If it is a species that someone chooses to eat, or a species that someone keeps as a pet, we teach the consequences of our choices \u0026amp; how those choices affect the animal as well as our environment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e We gently encourage plant based or vegan lifestyle choices and life changes but its not a requirement to visit or support our farm.\u00a0 Our main reasons are to try to make a small dent \u0026amp; ease some of the suffering of millions of factory farm animals annually, as well as try to impact the tax on the environment from that industry. \u003cbr\u003eOur ultimate goal is to sensitize people to all\n animals and nature through exposure, education, interactions \u0026amp; farm experiences.\u00a0 We teach through exposure \u0026amp; experiences that they are sentient beings. We also hope to help the environment in the process of our humane education about animals.\u00a0 After experiencing the magic of our farm \u0026amp; its occupants we hope that guests return home \u0026amp; make compassionate thoughtful lifestyle choices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~\" My name is Erin Yanz \u0026amp; I am the founder \u0026amp; President of Erins Farm.\u00a0 I believe that it \nis important for our next generation to witness, experience and  understand nature \nin all of its true forms to ensure  that we all will become better stewards.\u00a0\u00a0 My farm is the result of over 25 years of \ndedication \u0026amp; service  towards animal awareness. We strive to provide an amazing home for our rescued animals as well as a\n unique opportunity for farm guests to get up close \u0026amp; personal to animals in our \nfood and farm industry as well as reptiles and other exotics.   Inspired\n by Jane Goodall\u0027s message for peace \u0026amp; understanding, I have\nmolded my life \u0026amp; our farm mission statement around rescue, education and exposure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering us as your monthly donor!\u00a0 Our goal at the new larger farm that we just purchased is to expand our rescue mission.\u00a0 We\u0027ve committed to currently leaving 10 of our 33 acres as wildlife so that the current native wildlife will have refuge \u0026amp; a place to live out their lives the way that nature intended. The other 23 acres will be used for free roaming pasture \u0026amp; growing hay for our rescued animals.\u00a0 Our goal is to be as much of a self sustaining sanctuary as possible.\u00a0 We\u0027d like to continue to grow 40% or more of our hay that we currently feed.\u00a0 We\u0027d like to continue to educate \u0026amp; host open farm events to help offset the feed \u0026amp; veterinary costs.\u00a0 But we need your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are always unexpected costs in the maintenance of a farm this size. Farm equipment \u0026amp; vehicles are often breaking down, \u0026amp; animals can often incur unexpected illnesses or accidental injuries.\u00a0 Our current\u00a0 horse \u0026amp; cattle barn came missing an entire East facing wall \u0026amp; with no working water or electric functioning only as a shelter.\u00a0 100% of our current fencing is hanging on by a thread \u0026amp; needing to be replaced. Additional shelters would benefit the animals that would like more space or privacy.\u00a0 Our hay equipment \u0026amp; many farm vehicles \u0026amp; tractors need to be replaced or updated to keep things moving \u0026amp; functioning sufficiently.\u00a0 Many exhibits need to be expanded\u00a0 \u0026amp; updated now that we have the extra space to do so.\u00a0 Many of our recent rescue animals need expensive veterinary care \u0026amp; procedures.\u00a0 These are just a few of many things that are ongoing projects \u0026amp; current needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe currently maintain \u0026amp; care for over 300 animals. \u003cbr\u003eThere are daily requests for us to take animals needing rescue.\u00a0 We cannot take them all, but we want to expand our limits to help more where \u0026amp; when we can. Its hard to commit to rescuing more animals in need that will need veterinary care, more staff \u0026amp; special needs when we are always chipping away at side projects \u0026amp; saving for the unexpected.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your monthly donation will help us budget for \u0026amp; accomplish larger repair \u0026amp; expansion projects \u0026amp; commit to future rescued animals ~ by knowing that we will have the means to support them in the way that they will need.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for becoming a Patreon \u0026amp; a special member of our farm family.\u00a0 Your monthly donation will have a tremendous affect on our growth \u0026amp; help rescue so many more animals in need. It is also tax deductible due to our 501(c)(3) charity status.\u00a0 We are so incredibly grateful \u0026amp; could not do this without your support! You are amazing! \u003cbr\u003eLove you all~\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eErin\u00a0 \"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease follow us: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram :\u00a0 @erinsfarm\u003cbr\u003eYouTube:\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHlShHqPHis\u0026amp;t=191s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHlShHqPHis\u0026amp;t=191...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter:\u00a0 @erins_farm\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebookcom/erinsfarm1\"\u003ehttp://www.facebookcom/erinsfarm1\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOnline:\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://www.erinsfarm.net\"\u003ehttp://www.erinsfarm.net\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003eIn order to \nrescue more animals and educate the public through their stories, we \nneed to fix our horse \u0026amp; cattle barn by adding an east wall \u0026amp; \nstalls.  We need to run electric \u0026amp; water to the barns.  We need to build stalls. We need new \nfencing throughout the property to make the farm safer for the animals as well as our visitors \u0026amp; kid campers.  We also need a consistent flow of \ndonations monthly \njust to allow us to care for all of the animals we have already rescued.\n Any help is greatly appreciated!
