My goal is to someday own a pigeon aviary, chicken coop, possibly some quails, and some species of frog and other geckos. I\u2019d also love to foster animals to give more animals the best home possible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u2019t tell, taking care of and educating people about animals andcproper animal husbandry is my true passion, but due to my illnesses, chronic pain, and frequent hospitalizations, \u00a0I am unable to pursue that past the popular welfare education blog I run (lookatthisbabybird.tumblr.com) so I am trying really hard to make my art the breadwinner; this can be difficult at times because sometimes even just sitting at my computer drains too much energy, and when I\u2019m in the hospital it\u2019s hard to get inspiration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
