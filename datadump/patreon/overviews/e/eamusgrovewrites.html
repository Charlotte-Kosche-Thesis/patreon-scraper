I\u0027m Eleanor Musgrove, the author of \u003cem\u003eSubmerge \u003c/em\u003eand several published short stories (you can find a list\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://eamusgrove.wordpress.com/buy-here/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e on my blog). I\u0027ve been writing stories ever since I learned to write, and telling them since before that. In recent years I\u0027ve been privileged to work with the wonderful Manifold Press, but sadly they\u0027re winding down operations near the beginning of 2018 - which is just the push I needed to have a go at self-publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m out of work at the moment, caring for my Nan, and self-publishing involves several upfront expenses that are usually covered by a publisher. I\u0027m launching this Patreon in the hope that, with your support, I can keep writing and cover my costs. Who knows, maybe I could even make a profit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working on a couple of LGBTQIA+ novels, with ideas for a couple more (why do ideas always come along all at once?) - and I\u0027m also working on building my own \u0027world\u0027 to set some fantasy stories in. I\u0027ll also be writing plenty of short stories of all kinds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, whether you become a patron or simply enjoy my writing. Without you, I would just be telling my stories to myself - and where\u0027s the fun in that?"
