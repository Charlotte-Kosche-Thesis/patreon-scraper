    "summary": "Hail and well met, friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page! This is an incredible platform that will allow you folks who love what I do help support me so that I can keep doing what I love to do. For those of you just joining me, what I love to do is to create Bardic Tales and write music on the Hurdy Gurdy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I will be offering sweet rewards for you fine folks to help give back for your support in helping me afford to create new Tales. My videos will always be free on YouTube, but by supporting me through Patreon, you can experience even more content! The pledges you see over on the right allow you to pick a donation level that suits your budget. Once you pick a pledge level, you will be charged only when I release a \"paid post\", which will typically be one to two times a month. For your comfort, Patreon will also allow you to set a monthly cap. That way you never have to worry about me being too prolific and can ensure that you always stay well within a budget that is comfortable for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to focus more on creating original work, which, as an artist, means the world to me! These donations will help fund the production of future videos: better equipment, new instruments, food so I can continue to live so I can continue to create art! Please donate only what you are comfortable with, and know that any amount at all makes a world of difference!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s all there is to it!\u00a0 Thank you so much, friends, and I hope you\u0027ll join me in this crazy adventure here on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eEarl the Bard\u003cbr\u003e"
