A lot of the content is perfectly usable even if you\u0027re not playing the specific game I designed it for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write quest sets, extra mechanics, and flavor content for CMWGE based on Replay Value (an AU of Homestuck). And characters and fiction for Nobilis and Chuubo\u0027s. And some other things, too. (Like snarky comments on pictures of flowers. But seriously, though, you aren\u0027t paying for those.)
