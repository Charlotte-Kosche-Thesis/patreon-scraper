    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eEarth\u0027s Daughters\u003c/em\u003e is a feminist literary and arts periodical published in Buffalo, N.Y. We believe \u003cem\u003eE.D\u003c/em\u003e. to be the oldest extant feminist arts periodical, having been published continuously since 1971. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe strive to continue our mission of bringing attention to the importance of women\u0027s writing. Unfortunately,\u00a0 as publishing grants have diminished,\u00a0 so has our funding.\u00a0 We have created this Patreon account to allow our supporters to help us to keep publishing this magazine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love and appreciate all of our subscribers and are hopeful that Patreon will allow us to continue serving women writers of the world in the way they deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current collective is a group of the following six women writers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eKastle Brill\u003cbr\u003eJennifer Campbell\u003cbr\u003eJoan Ford\u003cbr\u003eJoyce Kessel\u003cbr\u003eJanna Willoughby-Lohr\u003cbr\u003eRyki Zuckerman\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a bit about the history of \u003cem\u003eEarth\u0027s Daughters\u003c/em\u003e and where we hope to go in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    Although \u003cem\u003eE.D.\u003c/em\u003e does publish work by men, our focus is the experience and creative expression of women, and from all contributors we require technical skill and artistic intensity, as evidenced in the work we have published by Denise Levertov, Lyn Lifshin, Marge Piercy, Diane diPrima, Janine Pommy Vega, Susan Fantl Spivack, and the list goes on. We also publish many \"unknown\" poets, writers and artists, and therefore welcome submissions from new writers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEarth\u0027s Daughters\u003c/em\u003e has lived long enough to have developed a mythos. Part of that mythos is that if Earth\u0027s Daughters has a mother, that mother is Judith Kerman. Kerman gave the magazine its name, inspired by Emma Goldman\u0027s \"Mother Earth.\" This is the root of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eE.D.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003es\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ename hence the tree logo, designed by co-founder Judith Treible. (Among ourselves the mag is really \u003cem\u003eE.D.\u003c/em\u003e - Ee Dee, not Ed.) Both the name and the logo have been problematic from the beginning. \u003cem\u003eE.D.\u003c/em\u003e has gotten hate mail from people who thought we were pagans, and love mail from pagans. We got reports on the status of pigs in Iowa and a lot of bad nature poetry, bad drawings of trees and drawings of women that looked like trees. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    In the beginning there were three; these three editors changed, but stayed three until after issue #5-6. At that point, Judy Kerman, Lillian Robinson, and Elaine Rollwagen had each reached personal crossroads. The magazine was in stasis; none of the three wanted \u003cem\u003eE.D.\u003c/em\u003e to die, but none could maintain it alone. Judy Kerman called a meeting of the female minds: past contributors, women involved in other publications, faculty women, women artists. She proposed that they take over \u003cem\u003eE.D.\u003c/em\u003e, and run it as a collective. They did, and we have maintained our identity as a collective ever since. Although individuals in the collective have changed as much as the magazine\u0027s format, one of the current editors was present at that original meeting. It\u0027s a miracle that a collective has survived this long, and that it functions so beautifully and audaciously.\u00a0We never let our quality be diminished by the collective process.\u003cbr\u003e    Maybe it\u0027s because we\u0027re women, but it seems to us that the writing - and the clich\u00e9s - cycle. Every few years, there\u0027s a flood of manuscripts pertaining to some theme, regardless of the assigned topic. We were buried in thousands of women\u0027s \u003cem\u003eHouses\u003c/em\u003e, most of which had dust motes dancing in the air. \u003cem\u003eMothers and Daughters\u003c/em\u003e brought hordes of \"strong thighs\"; for the \u003cem\u003ePolitical Issue\u003c/em\u003e, we had lots of \"viable candidates\" and even more \"second-rate wannabes.\"\u00a0\u003cem\u003eEye of the Beholder\u003c/em\u003e delivered so many nature poems - and corrupt-nature poems - that we decided to do an \"Ecology\" issue called \u003cem\u003eLost in the Woods\u003c/em\u003e, for which we received too many \"my-love-is-like-a flower\" poems, which was not what we meant at all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    The wonderful thing is, we got great stuff, too. Many of \u003cem\u003eE.D.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003es\u003c/em\u003e unknowns have become known. Many of our glorious writers have not, but deserve fame.\u00a0The magazine celebrates them all, and celebrates our collective efforts to keep it going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are now editing issue #91,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eLines\u003c/em\u003e. Our hope is to collect submissions for issue #92,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eShe Persisted,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ein 2018 and eventually publish until at least issue #100.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThat idea of our persistence is being threatened by funding issues, so as you may suspect, this will be a plea for your help. Grants have dried up, printing prices and postage keep going up and our subscriber list needs new blood.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis is a labor of love for the six of us and we have managed to put out quality work for 46 years and we don\u2019t want to quit yet. This is part of our mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo subscribe without becoming a monthly Patreon backer you can send $28 through Paypal to \u003cstrong\u003eearthsdaughters@gmail.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0($1 goes to cover paypal fees) or send a $27 check payable to \u003cstrong\u003eEarth\u0027s Daughters\u003c/strong\u003e along with your current mailing address to:\u003cbr\u003eEARTH\u0027S DAUGHTERS\u003cbr\u003eP.O.
