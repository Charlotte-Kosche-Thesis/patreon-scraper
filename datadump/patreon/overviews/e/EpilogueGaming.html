Even if you\u0027re just visiting, that means that you find our content enjoyable enough to think about supporting monetarily. We understand that, beyond the time that you choose to spend with my work, every dollar you spend is an indication of your hard work. Thank you for choosing to share your generosity with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why is Epilogue Gaming asking for your support? Good question! For starters, many of us at EG are doing this on top of other jobs or school (or as is the case for a few of us, both). While it would certainly be nice to be able to do this full time, what we really want to do is have an avenue for our work that can service us as creators. This means that things like the cost to maintain a domain, updated editing software and things to write about (namely, video games) aren\u0027t free. On top of this, Epilogue Gaming believes in an ad-free environment, allowing people to read and process our content without any distractions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is also worthy of note that Epilogue Gaming is one of the few websites on the internet focused on delivering high-quality, academic style of writing and research on video games. This includes heavily researched material and topics such as ludonarrative, games as art, and cultural undertones present in games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than anything, however, we want to do more for all of you. By supporting Epilogue Gaming you\u0027ll be given access to a variety of benefits, all of which can be found here on our Patreon page, and a promise for growth. Eventually, Epilogue Gaming would love to be able to cover each and every game that comes out -- in some fashion or another. The more funds Epilogue has to work with, the more content we can create. Here are some of the things you can expect from us:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA weekly podcast led by Ben Vollmer, Marcos Carmona and Dakota Trammell. Gaming news and in-depth discussion on game mechanics and tropes will be discussed. Also, look out for our end-of-show trivia segment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWritten reviews from several Twitch affiliates and partners. Watch their journeys unfold in real time, as they assess the core concepts of video games.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSeveral long-form videos on game mechanics, tropes or hidden details inside of video games.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"How to\" Twitch guides for new and inexperienced casters. Look for these every other week.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSome of video game\u0027s most absurd lists, including \"The Best Butts in Video Games\" or \"The Best Sound Clips in a Zelda Game\".\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA Discord channel filled with the latest thoughts and reactions of our staff and the community.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe best part of all of this? We are still growing. We are more than happy to accept feedback, new ideas and even new members of our crew. If you\u0027ve ever wanted to be a part of a gaming community that\u0027s just a little different, try Epilogue Gaming. It all begins here."
