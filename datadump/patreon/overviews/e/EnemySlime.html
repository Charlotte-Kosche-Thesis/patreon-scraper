In order to maximize profits or in some cases even survive, many sites have resorted to sensationalized news and clickbait. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last year we\u0027ve been fostering memories of a simpler time, when everyone was less concerned about personal conflicts in the industry and more concerned about whether or not the latest games were any good. Our website has a strong focus on product reviews and editorials. We also do a weekly podcast and have recently begun dabbling more and more in video content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of us have a strong love of games and an equally strong desire to change the way they\u0027re being reported on. Any money donated would first go towards our monthly and annual server expenses. After those costs are recouped we\u0027d like to use any remaining cash to help advertise and spread the word about our project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we\u0027re entirely self funded, and although we get the occasional review copy of a game most of the products we purchase are out of pocket, as is all our travel expenses when we cover conventions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to serve as a haven on the internet, a place devs and players can come talk about actual games and not all the other nonsense floating around out there. If that sounds like the place for you then we\u0027d love your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
