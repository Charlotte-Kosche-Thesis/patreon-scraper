For those of you who aren\u0027t familiar with me or my life mission, I hope to change that now! I am a career marine biologist, unwavering animal rights activist, passionate earth defender, fearless animal rescuer and humanitarian. I relentlessly work to make the compassionate and sustainable changes I wish to see in this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI often say, I am a scientist by day and freedom fighter by night, but that\u0027s not entirely true. Typically, I start my morning providing care to rescue animals. I utilize my \"free\" time throughout the day to write fact-driven posts and articles about urgent environmental, human and animal rights issues. I also plan vegan events and advocate on behalf of animals, people and our beautiful planet. By night, I am a fitness enthusiast, defying the wimpy vegan stereotype and debunking the protein myth, followed by more animal rescue initiatives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI provide free meal plan assistance, workout routines and advice to simplify the transition to veganism. I compete in races for a cause to provide financial support to organizations that need it most, coordinate activism events and participate in outreach and education throughout the country. I volunteer with a local animal shelter to provide urgent care to neonatal kittens and independently rescue injured and orphaned cats, dogs, as well as wildlife. On the weekends, I volunteer with a wildlife rehabilitation and rescue center and attend protests, outreach events and vigils. I also support the LGBTQ community, fight for equal rights for people of color, women, and vulnerable human and non-humans. I regularly collect blankets, warm clothes, vegan food, sanitary products and essential items to distribute to America\u0027s growing homeless population. In my spare time, you can find me snuggling my seven rescue cats or rolling in the dirt with pigs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile these things provide a wealth of personal fulfillment, they come at a price. Unfortunately, I am not independently wealthy. Despite working multiple jobs nearly my entire life, I have many financial burdens which limit my potential to pursue activism full time. However, my greatest goal is to pursue street activism, outreach and rescue efforts morning, noon and night.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWith your assistance, I can invest more time and energy into pursuing these vital causes and amp up my efforts to create a compassionate world. Your pledges will allow me to invest in extremely powerful tools to spread the vegan message to thousands, perhaps millions of people around the world. With these funds, I will purchase virtual reality headsets, create unique signage, outreach materials and fund new animal rights campaigns throughout South Florida and beyond. I will utilize my efforts to educate the public about the exploitation of animals, through a variety of successful activism tactics. I find that my online platform and face-to-face interactions are extremely powerful in creating conscious, meaningful change.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAsking for donations has been extremely uncomfortable for me. However, I recognize that there is a wonderful community of generous donors who see the work we are doing and are willing to help.
