My name is Emosh (pronounced M-ish, a lot of people seem to get this wrong 98% of the time but no worries!) You might know me as a content creator on the YouTube platform! I mainly cover Dragon Ball but I would like to expand BEYOND that! I\u0027d like to cover other diverse anime shows I feel people aren\u0027t talking about enough. But most importantly I am and have ALWAYS BEEN about YOU first! (that means the community) I can\u0027t seem to stress enough how important it is to have a solid and intellectual conversation about anything that you have a PASSION for! Basically to summarize who I am \u0026amp; what exactly EmoshIsLIVE STANDS FOR. I\u0027m a fan just LIKE YOU. (but with a platform.) I\u0027m someone who wants this movement to succeed with the help of those who support me. I want to GROW with YOU. I want to help you become BETTER fans and become BETTER at what you do \u0026amp; the way you see things. I\u0027m someone who wants to get you involved in other types of video \u0026amp; entertainment. Pretty simple hmm? :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imageshack.com/i/pmDt6VPjp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s put the obvious \"Supporting the development of the channel \u0026amp; content\" aside for a minute. Bottom line is this : You\u0027re pledging to become a part of a movement. Every cent, every dollar you pledge towards me is 100% going to go towards me being able to achieve A DREAM and A GOAL for ALL OF US. I wan\u0027t to be able to take ALL ADS off of my channel. Let\u0027s face it : YouTube isn\u0027t what it used to be. The value of ADS shown versus what most of us make off of Ad Revenue just isn\u0027t worth WASTING YOUR TIME on some bullshit product you don\u0027t care about. You came to hear ME say what I have to say \u0026amp; because I appreciate that SO freakin\u0027 much. I want to work towards a goal of demonetizing all of my content for all of my loyal and new viewers.\u003cbr\u003eNOW BEFORE YOU GO THINKING \"Oh well F*** this guy he\u0027s trying to make a living off of ME?!\" It\u0027s not like that at all. Me being able to CHOOSE to not have ads shown on my content opens up possibilities for companies to REACH OUT TO ME DIRECTLY and ask to place sponsorship based content on my videos! So essentially I would be advertising a product that I FEEL / I KNOW may interest YOU! It\u0027s a win-win situation \u0026amp; even if we can\u0027t do that completely. I would still like to reduce the amount of pointless Ads shown on my videos. I\u0027d also like to be able to hire a video editor to help me produce more content for you guys. These 2 things are my PRIMARY GOALS. Let\u0027s make it happen.. (I\u0027ve also posted a video explaining this for those who don\u0027t care to read much. Take it as a TLDR.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imageshack.com/i/poNr3q0vp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1 - If you have ANY ideas as to how I could improve my patreon page, whether it be rewards or whatever... PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I\u0027m all ears! I WANT to know what you guys would like to see on here.\u003cbr\u003e2 - I like Pizza. Random I know but in case you\u0027re wondering why my reward tiers are based on pizza. Well.... Now you know! :) Speaking of which you should probably order one right now...\u003cbr\u003e3 - I\u0027m a little crazy. But that\u0027s okay right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
