    "summary": "Thank you so much for partnering with me in bringing a much needed smile, laugh and breath of hope into a heavy world.\u00a0 My goal is to reach as many people as possible, as quickly as possible with positive encouragement through the means of media.\u00a0 As a speaker who has spent the past 25 years traveling, I would be foolish to think that even the largest of venues could compete with the simplicity and immediacy of the internet.\u00a0 That being said, traveling is how I have paid the bills for my starving children, so if I am to minimize that part of what I do to add on the production of media, I must look for those willing to partner with me in funding these positive, inspirational thoughts and stories I have to share.\u00a0 My promise to all partners is to bring my best to the table. As I do so, my hope is that you will be willing to contribute in whatever way you can so that we can make the most impact on people in this season.\u00a0 From homes to phones to prisons, people listen to this podcast and report testimonies of how, in some way, they found a moment of peace and hope during their day.\u00a0 I really appreciate you getting involved and will be sharing these messages (as given permission by the writers) with all partners personally.\u003cbr\u003eGod Bless and Rock On\u003cbr\u003eElijah\u003cbr\u003e"
