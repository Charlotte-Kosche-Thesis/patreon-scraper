    "summary": "I\u0027d like to introduce myself. I am a conceptual and editorial photographer in Columbus, Ohio. However, I produce fine art images aiming at a worldwide prospective audience. My shoots have been published in Vain Girl Magazine, Now It\u0027s Dark Magazine, ZTPMag, Valerie, REALM Magazine, and several others. My goal is to create even more wonderful works of art to share. \u003cbr\u003ePhotography is my passion and I\u0027ve been steadily working hard to make this my career. I have an Associate\u0027s in Digital Photography and also a Bachelor\u0027s of Science in Environmental Education and Communication. Photography has been my art of choice since 2005 when I began shooting bands pro bono as a hobby. It evolved into family photography. However, my real passion lies with conceptual and artistic photography such as ethereal, editorial, and fashion and I\u0027ve been working towards that genre since 2014. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope this page allows me to bring together a community of people who appreciate the entire process of how a photo shoot is brought to fruition. From the concept development through possible publication. Assisting other photographers and models with their artistic ventures is also a strong passion of mine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to share the development process, storyboards, BTS images and any suggestions I or my team might have for anyone interested in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, my team!! That\u0027s right, I couldn\u0027t do ANY of this without a team! I have several close team members who provide the artistic kick in the pants that creatives often need when they are in a rut! I have makeup artists, stylists, wardrobe, location scouts, models and, of course, my own mentors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhenever I can, I will try to share their viewpoints for you guys to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is looking to be a great and wild ride, I hope you all are ready!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and I hope to see you back here soon. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn to who \"elocin\" is:\u003cbr\u003eelocin is everything I am not. Still, elocin is me. She is who I want to be. How I wish others would see me on the outside, how I see myself on the inside. Spontaneous and creative, confident and outgoing. elocin is the frontwoman of my enterprise and also the back end of my desire to be. To be the go to for creative soulmates and round tables of intellectual outpouring. elocin is the embodiment of my potential as an artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe is the be all of my desires for life. To be free to create and provide a creative outlet for those that I work with and for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating has always been an outlet for my anxiety and doubts. Each project renews the confidence I have in myself. elocin is the lens through which I view the artistic possibilities of my surroundings. \u003cbr\u003e"
