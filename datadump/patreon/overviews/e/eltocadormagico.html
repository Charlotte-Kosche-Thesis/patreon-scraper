I always wanted to be an illustrator and comic author, and now I took the chance to try and dedicate as much time as possible working on that. My final objective is to work full time on this... Sadly, soon I won\u0027t have as much time to dedicate on this, as I\u0027m in a bad economical situation and I have to support myself. Because of that it would be a great help if \u00a0anyone would like to support me on patreon so I can work as much as I can on these projects!

One day a friend (check her out on instagram! @justacuteweirdo she does awesome illustrations and art!) and I were playing a game where both had to draw different parts to create a character. One had to draw the head, the second would draw the body, and the first again, would draw the feet or lower part, without letting the other person see... And by that method the main characters Aracnodinodonut and Pizza senpai (and canopy girl too!) were created as the abominations that they are. We loved the characters and I thought it would be funny to make a comic with those weird looking characters...
