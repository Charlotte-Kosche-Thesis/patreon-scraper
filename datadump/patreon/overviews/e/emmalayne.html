I\u0027ve been wanting to get into cosplaying for a while now but the cost has always held me back. Patreon is a great way to share my journey with all of you, give more to people that want to support me, and also cover at least part of the expenses of all the materials and photography equipment I use.\u003cbr\u003eSince cosplaying doesn\u0027t pay the bills I work full time, and Because of this, I can\u0027t currently find time to mail physical rewards out so everything I put out is digital for now. Hopefully in the future, I can make enough to take days off work to mail out rewards, but for now, I appreciate SO MUCH all the help you guys give me while I\u0027m getting started.\u003cbr\u003eI will always post pictures on social media because that\u0027s the only way to grow, so you can always just follow me there, but if you want to help me be able to keep creating new content by pledging I appreciate the support very much! I try to keep a steady stream of new cosplays coming throughout the year for you guys and most of it will not be posted anywhere else!
