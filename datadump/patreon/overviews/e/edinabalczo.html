I am a full-time musician, earning my living mainly from the gigs I do. Although my season is during the summer, Patreon can give me a more reliable income in the music world which can be stressful and can change any moment. YOUR support can give me stability and more time to make more guitar videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith The Spanish Guitar Hub YouTube channel my mission is to\u00a0reach YOU and show YOU how much fun it is to play Spanish guitar, educate YOU about the theory and techniques involved playing this style and hopefully reach YOUR heart through this music. I hope my videos will make YOU start practicing the guitar or even to play more and YOU will see how much fun it will bring YOU in future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou are the elite guitaristas of The Spanish Guitar Hub, your names will be listed under my videos as you are the ones who support the creations of those videos!\u00a0 If you have any questions or some\nrequests I will prioritise you and try to help you as much as I can to be a\nbetter musician. I am trying to produce much better quality lessons now than\nbefore, not even mentioning that if you pledge 10 dollars a month you will get the TABs for my guitar videos posted on YouTube. If you pledge 20 dollars a month you can give me requests for songs or lessons of the things you want to learn!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMany thanks for your support and believing me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI want to support you, but I am not sure if I can afford it. \u003c/strong\u003eYou can set\nyour monthly limit so you will never be charged over what you can afford.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow many videos will you upload per month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI upload every Sunday.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in USA dollars?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo, your currency will automatically be converted as this is an USA based\nwebsite.\u003cbr\u003e"
