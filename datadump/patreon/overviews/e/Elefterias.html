    "summary": "Thank you for exploring my Patreon page and for supporting my creative efforts. I have been writing songs since I was 10 years old. \u003cbr\u003eAt age 13 I attended St Patrick\u0027s Girls High School in the city of Sydney. This is only important because at the time the school, which is no longer in existence, was run by the Sisters of Mercy, a laborite Irish order. They first taught me to play the songs of Joan Baez and Bob Dylan. I learn my first guitar chords from Sister Kathleen. I studied piano with her but for two years she didn\u0027t even pick up the fact that I didn\u0027t have a piano. I used to draw the keyboard on a piece of paper and practise. I got to the end of Third grade this way. She thought I was brilliant. I picked a lot up by ear. Later my sister used her lunch money to buy me an old Bellings piano.\u003cbr\u003eUp until the age of 14 I rejected my Greek background and hated Greek music until 1972 when the exiled composer Mikis Theodorakis came to visit Australia with a number of inspirational singers and musicians. My mother and sister forced me to go to the concert and I am glad they did. That evening changed my life forever. For the first time I heard music that spoke to my soul, the revolutionary 2/4 rhythm, the 9/8 Greek zembekiko, the 7/8 and 6/8. For the first time I heard lyrics I could relate too. Poetry put to music by the greatest poets in Greece, such as Yannis Ritsos and nobel prize winners George Seferis and Odysseas Elytis. That night I realised that Greek music was not only what was played in Clubs and dances. Greek music was also these haunting ballads and songs of social consciousness, political songs, love songs and songs of suffering, even dirges. A whole new world opened up to me. I wanted to learn Greek better to understand the lyrics. I learnt all the Theodorakis songs from the three albums my mother bought for me that night. I learnt the poetry off by heart. Within a couple of weeks I was also creating simple tunes on my guitar with simple Greek lyrics and similar rhythms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 18 I auditioned to do singing at the Conservatorium of Music and I was accepted with a scholarship. I only attended a few lessons before dropping out. A couple of years later I auditioned again. Again I received a scholarship and studied for a while under the tuition of Helen McKinnon. However, I dropped out again as my interest was mainly Greek ballad style rather than classical opera.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI sang with various politicized groups at events and concerts as well as for the compoers Timotheos Arvnotakis and Themos Mexis. In 1975, after the Cyprus coup by Turkey, I sang in front of thousands of people at the then Hordern Pavilion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIN 1983, I was awarded a grant from the Australia Council for the Arts to study music in Greece for a year. I studied some composition and music theory with Timotheos Arvanitakis, had some singing lessons with Poppy Petropoulou and also enrolled in the Skalkottas Conservatorium to study classical guitar. For a a short period I also enrolled at the Kalomiris Conservatorium after an audition for singing and guitar as well.\u003cbr\u003eOf course I never completed formal training in music. Instead I joined up with a Greek composer by the name of Thomas Bakalakos and toured Germany, Austria, the Greek mainland and the island of Crete (twice). I had the experience of a life time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI had many opportunities in Greece to continue my music but, unfortunately for family reasons, I returned to Australia.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOn the one hand my family loved my music but on another side they were worried I would end up singing in Clubs and Tavernas so they discouraged the music.\u003cbr\u003eSince 1977, as young adult, I was involved in the BO\u00ceTE, a multicultural music performance and event coodination group. we performed in Sydney and Melbourne and organised countless concerts and events in Sydney with music and bands and musicians form many different cultures. IN 1998, I started up The Play Space, with my dear friend and talented musician and performer Vivian Gemenis. We staged large and small performances, initially at the Castellorisian Club at Kingsford and tehn at various other venues including the Cyprus Club at Stanmore.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLater still I held Play Space Bo\u00eete nights, which were nights with songs of the NEO KYMA in Greece, the hippy music of the 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s mostly, and songs of social consiousness and love at the cafe /bookshop (bilingualbookshop.com.au) in Hurlstone Park/Dulwich Hill. The La Bo\u00eete Music, Poetry, Books has been revived recently with the help of Singer and musician Sotiris Prokopiou. We hold music nights fortnightly with various singers and musicians of world music and Greek music that you can not hear in any taverna or club in Sydney. It is the alternative music scene.It is not a popular style but it is a cultural beacon of Greek culture in Sydney at the moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, I had studied for a BA Communications (UTS), a BA (Hons) in Modern Greek(USYD) and a Grad Dip Ed. (SIE), I also studied Ethnomucicology and some musicology at UNE. \u003cbr\u003eI currently teach Greek as a casual lecturer at eh USYD within the Dept of Modern Greek. A number of abandoned postgraduate degrees and here I am with all my songs still snuggly tucked away in drawers, having been silenced by life itself and the struggle for survival.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn the year 2000, one of my songs was arranged by conductor George Ellis and sung by the 200 piece Millenium Choir at CONCERT 2000 at the Sydney Town Hall. Later it would be in the running to be sung at the Olympics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eApart from a concert \"IDENTITY IN THE SAND\"\u00a0 in 2012 as part of the Greek Festival of Sydney, where my songs were played and sung by a number of friends of mine in the music industry and kindly arranged by Felicia Harris, most people have not heard my songs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe first recorded song of mine was \"Thelo na matho ellinika\" sung by Marina Thiveos and friends and arranged by Felicia Harris (2016) and then the \"Shadows\" song in 2017 written for my husband who died at a young age in 1996, just months before I ave birth to our son. Most of my songs have tended to be sad ballads or songs of yearning for something more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor some reason as I got to 20 years of age my language f creativity switched from mostly English to all Greek, though I have been translating some more recently into English as well. Possibly because the Greek language is a language very poetic and expressive. It speaks to the heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have not had an easy life and I will not spill all the ugly details on this page however, without financial support the songs can never be recorded or produced or made public in any way. I have but family responsibilities, and preconceptions of what a Greek woman can and should not do, have plagued me my whole life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor this this is a last chance for my songs to see the light of day. Whether I sing them or other younger performers, who seem to be very interested in the songs and the music, I would like to see them recorded and out there on you-tube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTo allow me to have time to spend of them instead of working day and night on other things I am asking for financial aid from supporters such as yourself. However, small or large. It all helps towards making this dream a reality.\u00a0 Thank you for reading this and considering supporting me in this venture."
