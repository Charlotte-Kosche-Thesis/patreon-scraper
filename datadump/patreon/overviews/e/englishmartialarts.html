    "summary": "Hi, how\u0027re you doing?\u00a0 I\u0027m Oz and I run the English Martial Arts channel on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making videos there for years now, but over the last year or so I\u0027ve been making an extra effort to make them not only much more entertaining, but also of a higher quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a number of playlists that are increasingly popular, from my Fight Breakdowns of popular Hollywood movie fights, to \"Stories of Greatness\" - biographical tales of some of the greatest fighters to compete during the bareknuckle era.. \u00a0I\u0027ve recently added \"Smackanory\", which as you might guess is inspired by the children\u0027s television sho Jackanory, and is excerpts of old books about fighting. \u00a0As if that wasn\u0027t enoughI\u0027m about to start \"Katana vs\", a series of tongue in cheek videos looking comparing the most iconic of swords to other things. \u00a0Maybe weapons, maybe not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also sometimes just sit down and discuss things related to HEMA in \"Oz\u0027s Late night rants\". \u00a0So all in all it\u0027s a very busy channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d really appreciate it if you were able to support me on Patreon, every dollar you can donate goes towards helping me improve the quality of my videos. \u00a0Since I\u0027ve been here I have bought a better quality camera to record them with, better quality editing software, and most recently a good quality microphone to improve the audio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe nex improvement I\u0027d like to make is simply to be able to spend more time editing and putting together videos to make them easier on the eye, and more fun to watch. \u00a0But I can\u0027t give much more time as I have to earn enough money to pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do become a supporter you will get access to exclusive videos. \u00a0Every month you will receive links through Patreon to videos that are not available to the general public. \u00a0It\u0027s my way of saying thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs ever I am talking too much, so I\u0027ll stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOz\u003cbr\u003e"
