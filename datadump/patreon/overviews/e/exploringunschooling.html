    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Pam Laricchia, veteran unschooling parent, creator and host of the weekly\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://livingjoyfully.ca/podcast-2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExploring Unschooling Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, founder of the unschooling website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://livingjoyfully.ca/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elivingjoyfully.ca\u003c/a\u003e, and author of five books about unschooling, most recently, \u003cem\u003eThe Unschooling Journey: A Field Guide\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn March 2002, I approached each of my three kids individually and asked if, instead of going to school, they\u2019d rather stay home to learn. The choice to leave school was unanimous. My kids are all in their twenties now, and I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that choosing unschooling was the most pivotal\u2014and valuable\u2014choice I\u2019ve made in my life so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChoosing to live and learn without school isn\u2019t as intimidating as you might imagine.\u003c/strong\u003e Children really do enjoy learning when it\u2019s driven by curiosity rather than curriculum, and the strong and trusting relationships that develop in unschooling families are priceless. Having solid information about unschooling freely available was very helpful to me when I began my unschooling journey all those years ago, and it\u2019s what I strive to share with anyone who\u2019s looking for something beyond the compulsory school system and conventional parenting advice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support at any level means a lot to me and to all the unschooling parents who cannot afford $1 a month.\u003c/strong\u003e You\u0027re doing something very special: helping me keep my podcast and website free and out in the world for anyone who curious to learn more about unschooling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u2019ll Use the Money For ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOut-of-Pocket Expenses\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePodcast hosting. The podcast players, like Apple and Stitcher, are free. However, each time a listener uses one to download an episode, I pay my file hosting service for the data transfer.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePodcast transcription. Having a text version of each episode means I can share unschooling information in the different styles in which people like to learn. I\u2019ve gotten great feedback about the transcripts and my newsletter summaries.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite hosting. Every week I publish a new podcast episode on my website. As my website traffic has grown, so has the cost of a hosting plan to support it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConvertKit. The service I use to email my weekly newsletter to subscribers. This fee grows as the email list grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSoftware subscription. Software for editing the audio and video for each episode so I can produce a high-quality podcast.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond the Expenses, There\u2019s My Time\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eProducing podcast episodes. Each weekly episode typically takes at least ten hours to produce: researching guests, developing the questions, recording the call, organizing the transcription, editing and formatting both the audio and transcript for publication, writing a detailed episode summary for my newsletter, and, of course, sharing the episode on my website and social media.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOngoing website development. My website is home to many years of content: blog posts, magazine articles, conference talks, podcast episodes. And it keeps growing! I have a lot of ideas about how to make it more user-friendly so visitors can quickly find content directly related to the most common questions about unschooling.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYouTube channel. I\u2019m getting more comfortable with video and am excited about taking the time to create more video-based content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, as a small token of my immense gratitude, you\u2019ll find some fun rewards at the different pledge levels! Desktop wallpapers. All my unschooling books. A private forum for patrons. A monthly video chat. Lots of ways for us to connect, engage, and learn. All my favourite things. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePam, xo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE NOTE: Your rewards will be sent to the email address you use for your Patreon account.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
