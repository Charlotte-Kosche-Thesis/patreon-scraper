    "summary": "Hi! My name is Erik Lervold. I make art, actually a lot of art. I make tons of comics and fanarts and random illustrations and sometimes serious paintings. I mostly use watercolors but sometimes use acrylics and sometimes I go digital, depending on the project or what I think would be better for the piece. I do art all the time and I love meeting new people and collaborations and all around the act of creation! This Patreon was created so I could have a better place to ad new pieces, sketches and be able to communicate with new people! Also I plan on making a series of videos and a lot of livestreams to show you how I make what I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut wait!

I plan on updating various times during the week, and any special stuff will be sent to you or posted the 15 of each month, that way you get a boost of cool stuff in the middle of the month, when nothing is really happening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Ooh, that sounds cool!
