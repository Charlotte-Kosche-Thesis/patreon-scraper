I try to put forward informative, fun, and light-hearted videos which encompass the entirety of a game and not just highlights. There are some games that some people may not have the time to complete or immerse themselves in fully. My videos are created in the hope that individuals can still fully experience those games. In addition I would like to think I offer some insight into strategies and solutions to harder fights and puzzles. I generally play all of my games on the hardest difficulties and try my best to find all of the secrets.\u003cbr\u003e"

Gaming has been my hobby since I played Temple of the Wind and Master of Orion when I was 6, and it is my fervent desire to spread the joy of gaming to those who might be hesitant. My channel is focused on complete (and sometimes blind) playthroughs of a variety of games. Primarily I focus on Role-playing Games, but Strategy and First Person Shooters also make appearances.\u00a0",
