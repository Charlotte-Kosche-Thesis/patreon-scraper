I started on stage at 4 years old, became a professional ballerina, then a signed pop artist and then a signed rock artist fronting the trans media project, September Mourning. I am a published fashion model who has been featured in campaigns here and abroad. I developed and successfully published my own on going comic book series through Image/ Top Cow Comics. I\u0027ve toured throughout Europe, Canada and the United States.\u003cbr\u003eBeing signed to record label is an amazing thing. In today\u0027s age though, a lot of artists are reaching out to their fans to help them along in their journeys financially. Patronage to the arts has been something that has existed for a very long time and establishes a connection between fans and artists that is more personal because the fans actually enable the artist directly. They become a direct inspiration for the creation process because of their support.\u003cbr\u003eLately I\u0027ve been wanting to expand into other artistic areas besides music....but in order to achieve these goals I need your patronage. I\u0027m asking for your help here so that I may be able to create more music, conceptual visual and video art, wearable art, etc... some of which may be linked to my current visual/ musical art project, September Mourning, and some of it will be outside of that.... \"Bucket List\" art projects that I have always wanted to create but need a little help in doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a minute to look at the right side of the page and find the support level that you are excited about and pledge ;)\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar really helps me achieve my goals, in and outside of the studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for deciding to come on this journey with me... I\u0027m excited to see what we create together!\u003cbr\u003eXxx\u003cbr\u003e- Emily\u003cbr\u003e"
