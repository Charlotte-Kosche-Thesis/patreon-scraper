Bailey \u0026amp; Sha Cage, interdisciplinary artists working across film, theater, poetry and new media. We do this through our artistic entity; Tru Ruts. We are filmmakers and theatre artists, community activists writing, directing, editing and producing work that speaks to issues facing our communities--from performance theatre to web series to music videos to narrative and documentary films. Basically -we\u0027ve worked our butts off for 20 years creating art that is transformative while holding community at the center. And we\u0027ve not done it alone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur work has been recognized nationally and internationally and \u003cbr\u003ewe\u0027ve been privileged to work with luminaries such as Amiri Baraka, Laurie Carlos, J. Otis Powell!, and Marion McClinton; and have founded leading artistic platforms and entities we are so very proud of including Tru Ruts, the Million Artist Movement, and the MN Spoken Word Association. We are poised and humbly ready to use our art and deep community roots to break new ground. We are at a turning point launching this Patron in recognition of our passion for this work that is not a side job but one that we work at every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"268\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/221085471\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eWHAT WE WILL DO WITH YOUR SUPPORT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been working at a steady momentum for many years and have more energy now than ever alongside innovative projects just waiting for the green light.
