Electronic music that is infused not only with ear catching melodies and sounds but is emotionally charged as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eit is my dream to be able to make the world a better place and make people happy by sharing my music with them, but in order to take it to the level I want and be able to focus on my music full time I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in. Through this page you\u0027re on you can pledge to support any amount of money you want to every time I finish and upload a new song (I am only going to include my original songs, no remixes or mashups). Think of it as a virtual \"tip jar\" that allows you to automatically support me and enable me to create my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only that, but you literally are going to become a part of my career, \u00a0and you will get exclusive opportunities to interact with me, give me feedback or suggestions through my Patreon stream and receive some awesome gifts as a reward :) (see below)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why I need your support through Patreon is that it is very very time consuming to create music... I literally spend months sometimes working on a single song. With a full one job already, I literally don\u0027t have enough time and energy to really take my career to the next level. Not to mention producing music is expensive. So your money will also be going towards me upgrading my sound arsenal, equipment, and home studio setup.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, I promise I will make the best music I possibly can for you!!!\u003cbr\u003egod bless\u003cbr\u003e-Emberz"
