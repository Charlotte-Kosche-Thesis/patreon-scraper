Wherever they go either in a foreign land or within the archipelagos of the Republic of the Philippines, still, they carry with them a name that attracts the attention of and really excites any government - the surname \u2018TAXPAYER.\u2019 Therefore, for their best interests, the name \u2018Kataxpayer\u2019 or Katax, for short, comes in and may mean \u2018a community that helps and assists one another in complying with the laws of the States. To check if a Katax is applying the law correctly and on time, BIR employs the Tax-evasion Assault, Benchmarking, Letter of Authority, Letter Notice, Oplan Kandado, Tax Mapping, Surveillance, Subpoena Duces Tecum and Assessment Notice. These tactics and techniques are not only too detrimental and damaging to many Katax\u2019s livelihood and simply living but also they affect their mental and physical health. Seriously, they cast many doubt as to the policy direction or claim of the BIR that is to establish a harmonious relationship and a continual partnership with the same. Some schools and universities\u2019 personnel as well as some BIR officials are so reluctant to accept that the standards and principles such as the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRS) and Philippine Standards on Auditing (PSA) are inferior to the obligations created by the laws of this Republic and notwithstanding the obligations that a contract brings. Moreover, they are too busy romancing with these standards and principles. By being so entertained therewith, they deliberately failed and still fail to teach and spread the true and correct means in complying with the laws that create unfathomable obligations and protect the ordinary rights of the users thereof. Furthermore, they are too complacent that what they produced and will be producing in their campuses and training rooms would match the requirements and clamour of the taxpaying public. Finally, many Katax have been and will become the victims and preys of misrepresentation/deceitful-advertising that is (1) a CPA can compute the correctly amount of taxes, (2) all lawyers can accurately interpret laws of the State, (3) newly graduates, whether from prestigious or public schools, can immediately deliver the useful reports and recommendations, and (4) BIR officials would have the mental prowess and courage to help and assist first the unfortunate Katax before a civil/criminal penalty shall be slapped. Because of these misconceptions that these misrepresentations bring, the graft and corruption are actively tolerated and the worst of all, they are knowingly encouraged. IGNORANCE OF THE LAW MUST BE TOTALLY ERADICATED BECAUSE IGNORANCE IS THE MOST PAINFUL EXPERIENCE AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE LIFESTYLE. This is a privileged communication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
