But late in the night, I put on a cape, and a pen, and thats when I start drawing up all my ideas... Yes, every little theory, every crazy idea, every new article, it is written 6.30 in the morning when I just woke up, while I am sipping coffee, before I get dressed for work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write during lunchbreaks, and in the evenings. I write with my left hand while the right hand pets my cat Marvel. I write and I think while I sing Disney songs with my girlfriend. My head is always running through scripts and reciting in preparation for the next video or livestream... Is it my hobby, or is it my obsession? All I know is, I love what I do. I love every minute of it. You guys make every minute worth it. I am just a guy who is insatiably curious, helplessly creative, ridiculously ambitious, and perhaps a tad bit eccentric.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI research personality types and psychology. I read up on archetypes and unique characters. I study interesting people and fascinating behaviour. I create theories on relationships and I discuss emotions and struggles of being human. I make videos that make people feel seen and understood. I challenge stereotypes and simplistic and shallow views. I publish it all on my youtube channel or on\u003ca href=\"https://www.erikthor.com\"\u003e my website.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eI help out my community and my friends whenever I can. So if you have got a problem... You know\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:hello@erikthor.com\"\u003ewhere to find me.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I do it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI believe in a different society where everyone is accepted. I believe society should be remade to help people get what they need to be happy and healthy. I believe everyone has a unique flow code and things they need to thrive and to feel good about themselves. If I can help a person discover themselves, or if I can get people to speak out for what they need in relationships, or if I can get you to understand your partner just a little bit better, its all worth it to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love receiving messages from all the people who tune in. Let me know how a video or article made you feel.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/ZByRuXz\"\u003eChat with the community on Discord\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, all my patreons, thank you for being you, and for helping me be me.\u003cbr\u003e"
