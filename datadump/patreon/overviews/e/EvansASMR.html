    "summary": "My name is Evan and I am an ASMRtist on YouTube. I have 12 thousand loyal subscribers on my channel, Evan\u2019s ASMR, and I thought to bring them over here. All the money donated to me will be put into buying new equipment such as a better camera or microphone to make my videos become better for my subscribers. Once you have donated I will thank you from the Patreon messages. The rewards will be given once your transaction has been 100% completed. I will also notify you via Patreon and tell you about your rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT ME:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs you already know, I\u2019m Evan and I am 14 years old. I am in 9th grade or a freshman at high school. I love the subject, Math, as I have two math tutor roleplays on YouTube. I also study French, but for only a year. I have been making ASMR videos for almost 3 months and have grown to a whopping 12K subscribers. Although I make ASMR videos, I mainly watch YouTubers such as jacksfilms, but the ASMRtists I watch usually are Gibi ASMR, Marty Tingles, Lovely Asmr S, and Jacobjacob15 ASMR. If I\u2019m not st school I am either doing homework or watching YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT MY DISCOVERY OF ASMR:\u003cbr\u003eAbout a year ago I stumbled upon a peculiar and interesting set of videos people make. This genre I found was ASMR videos. Well, that didn\u2019t really happen. I used to watch PewDiePie and last year he made a video featuring ASMR and that was when I first found out about it. At first, my reaction was surprising, just like everyone else, and thought these types of videos were just too weird and some videos sexual. Then, I started watching some videos, while discovering that I\u2019d get a tingling sensation in my body. I started watching some more and more and more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT MY CHANNEL:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen I came across asmr game store videos I loved watching them so much. So, all I\u2019d do is only watch different people all over YouTube doing just and asmr game store roleplay. I loved watching these videos so much so that I wanted to start and ASMR channel and make a game store video. One day, I started a channel named Evan\u2019s ASMR thinking if I just do Evan ASMR or ASMR Evan I wouldn\u2019t be the first thing to pop up. I then made a first video talking about me doing ASMR for the first time. Then, what I wanted to do, I made an ASMR game store video. I was so happy making videos that I kept going and I slowly grew an audience.\u003cbr\u003e"

After putting some thought into it I realized I can use the money the patrons donated and spend it on supplies to make my videos better. This is where the story ends. Thanks a lot!",
