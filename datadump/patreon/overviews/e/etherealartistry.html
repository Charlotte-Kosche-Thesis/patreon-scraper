    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am finally starting up a patreon page here after mulling over it for years so I decided there\u0027s no time like the present! Let\u0027s do this!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I never know quite what to write in these sorts of things. So let\u0027s start with an introduction. I\u0027m an artist, self taught. I dabble in both traditional and digital mediums and I am a huge nerd so I love to draw anything cartoon/comic book/ anime/ fantasy related. I\u0027ve been drawing for most of my life but didn\u0027t really take it seriously until a few years ago. My inspiration to start drawing when I was a kid by watching anime like Sailor Moon and Dragonball Z. Those were probably my biggest influences in the beginning. My best friend who I met when I was 11, was already insanely good at drawing at that age so she also kind of inspired me to pick up a pencil and draw because I wanted to be amazing like that too. I\u0027ve been in secret competition with her for almost twenty years. She\u0027s still got me beat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout four years ago, when I worked solely with pencil, ink and copic markers, I decided to start an art page on facebook and put myself out there despite all my insecurities of not being good enough. I was just starting out, having drawn no more than doodles for the decade prior, I was scared that people wouldn\u0027t like what I was putting out there. But thankfully, I started gaining followers, getting compliments and soon I was getting commissions. Which is a huge confidence booster when someone actually wants to buy your art. So from there, I saved up my money I got from commissions to buy myself my Wacom Intuos Pro tablet so I could get into the digital art scene. I\u0027ve always looked up to artists like Sakimichan and Artgerm, they\u0027ve been huge inspirations for me to really focus and work on my skills as an artist and I wanted to dabble in the world of digital paintings because I always found something so beautiful about how they were done. I wanted my work to look like that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo days and months and years of watching tutorials and practicing and practicing, here I am. I\u0027m making my patreon page. I want what most artists want, to be able to make a living off what I love to do. I want to make content that you all can be inspired by. I want to inspire you to pick up that pencil and start drawing like my inspirations have done for me. I want to grow as an artist and I want to share my accomplishments with all of you! Annnddd.. I also need a new computer because mine is not functioning like it should anymore on account that it\u0027s ancient. So any little bit helps.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to all of those who choose to become patrons of my work, thank you. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much. I\u0027ve set up tier rewards to allow you to gain access to the awesome goodies I have to offer. \u003c/strong\u003eSo\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWhatever you want to donate to support me so I am able to draw and create as much as humanly possible and make my dream come true, I appreciate it.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eThank you for joining me on my journey as an artist. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
