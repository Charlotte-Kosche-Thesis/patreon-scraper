     "about": "My name is Evana De Lune and I am a burlesque performer, costume designer, model and massive geek. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have previously studied costume design and went down my journey as Alana Eve Cosplay. I realize that in my life I have a much bigger calling and far more potential than just being a cosplayer. That\u0027s why I have created Evana De Lune. I had previously studied many different types of dance for 15 years and I now know that it was more than just a hobby for me, it\u0027s my passion. I first fell in love with costumes when I was dancing, as any performance could turn into something extravagant and brilliant just by being dressed correctly. I was always creating and making costumes or clothes when I could at home because it\u0027s something that has always brought me joy. I got my first sewing machine for my 12th birthday and have been sewing ever since. I first studied fashion design when I was 11 years old doing short courses during my school holidays, and further studied under costume designer Tim Chappel early 2017. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only was I crafty, I was also an avid gamer. Most of my childhood I spent indoors during summer playing World of Warcraft or any other game I could get my hands on (hence why I\u0027m so white). Therefore, cosplay seemed to be the perfect outlet for me. It made me happy for a while as I got to bring all of my favourite pop culture icons to life and be creative whilst I did it. However I realized that I wanted to be more than just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started modelling at the age of 17 and it\u0027s one of my many passions. One of the reasons I loved cosplaying so much is because I got the opportunities to branch out from just fashion or beauty and become my favourite characters and bring something more creative to the table. I loved being able to be proud of my works of art that I created rather than representing other peoples ideas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am now at 21 years of age and I\u0027m finally working out what I want to do in my life. I want to be able to be myself, be creative, be my standards of beauty and love what I do. Although I don\u0027t always know what I want to do, I do know that I want to continue modelling and start my burlesque journey as Evana De Lune. I will continue incorporating cosplay into what I do, because being able to geek out while I\u0027m creative is always going to be something I enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is me - I hope you can find it in your hearts (and your pockets obviously) to help support me on my journey as this is something that means the world to me.",
