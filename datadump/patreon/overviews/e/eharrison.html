    "summary": "Hello everyone! its me Eddie Harrison.\u003cbr\u003eI am currently 3000 dollars in debt and my dead-end minimum-wage job barely gives me enough to pay rent every month so I have decided to attempt the impossible and make money doing something I love! That thing is music. Do you have a song that you\u0027ve always wondered how it would sound if it was recorded by a sad person with two guitars and a free recording program? Good. Because that is exactly what I offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sickjacket.tumblr.com/post/98771428671/its-a-death-grip-its-just-me-and-a-skip-james\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://sickjacket.tumblr.com/post/90496594981/i-did-a-cover-of-my-own-worst-enemy-by-lit\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eare\u003c/a\u003e a couple of my previous works! If you think they are any good perhaps you would consider donating to me. If you know of a song you\u0027d like me to do a cover I will absolutely do that song for FIVE DOLLARS. I currently have FIVE SPOTS OPEN:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.\u003cbr\u003e2.\u003cbr\u003e3.\u003cbr\u003e4.\u003cbr\u003e5.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce these spots are filled I\u0027m not taking any more requests until I finish at least one of them (this is in order to prevent the panic attacks that eventually caused me to shut down this page in the first place).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTWO FAQ:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I do a one-time donation just to get my song or does it have to be monthly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be a one-time donation! What you need to do is donate five bucks, set your donation limit to five bucks and then cancel your donation. It will still take the five bucks for that month once I release your song and then stop donating for all successive months. If all this seems like too much trouble, you can also simply send me 5 dollars via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/eddieharrison\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy paypal\u003c/a\u003e (it\u0027s...got my ex\u0027s name on there. dont worry about it.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I contact you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you decide how much you want to donate, a little \"contact Eddie\" button will appear under my photo on the side. Click that and let me know which song you\u0027d like. You can also email me at turnipspirit at gmail dot com\u2014just make sure you let me know who you are so I can link up your song and your donation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
