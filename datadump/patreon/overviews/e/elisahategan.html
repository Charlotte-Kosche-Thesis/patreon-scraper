I\u0027m Elisa, a writer, freelance journalist, public speaker and blogger with \u003ca href=\"https://incognitopress.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIncognito Press\u003c/a\u003e, and I really need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe art of creating anything is a collaborative process - I create for a community, and in turn I need the community to sustain my artistic process. Since the moment I first picked up a pen as a child, I never stopped writing or dreaming of a world where the power of the pen is far stronger than the weight of a sword. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the last few years I published several books, some of which include \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.com/B00JA05FYM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRACE TRAITOR\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.com/B0086VWOQS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAlice in Writerland\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01CN2BYEI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDaughters of the Air\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve also published\u00a0poetry, articles and plays that appeared in publications across North America. I have been a\u00a0public speaker, an activist, and\u00a0a social media strategist. I\u00a0started two writing groups, was featured in the mainstream press, and won several prestigious writing grants. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t have done any of it without people who believed in me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patrons are the family I never had - a family that supports and sustains me through the upheavals and joys of creating art that aims to make a difference. I need each and every one of you. Everything that I write is dedicated to you. I could not have gotten this far without the support of people who believed in me even when I didn\u0027t believe in myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour encouragement means the world to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe written word is a powerful manifesto that has the\ncapacity to preserve history, document personal and social revolutions, and\nbecome a voice of self-expression. In my work, I explore the psychological and\nemotional imprints rooted in our history, sense of belonging and identity. I look for the light within the shadows \u2013 the silenced\nvoices of my generation, the common thread that courses through all of us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to open a secret door into an unexplored world, to\nilluminate obscure passageways that lead to an unfamiliar landscape, one where\nwords become an act of defiance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ask only for a $5 monthly sponsorship. For the cost of one Starbucks coffee per month, you can become an integral part of my creative projects. And beyond each new book and each new project, you will know that you made a difference in the life of an artist who needed your help\u00a0in order to make the world a more creative and inspiring place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeside sponsoring my work, one of the most powerful ways to make a difference and help me in my journey is to spread the word about my work. Even a tweet or a Facebook share can\u00a0make a huge difference!\u00a0Dropping a line to say hello, to offer encouragement or ask me about my ongoing or upcoming projects is very welcome. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support,\u003cbr\u003eElisa \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1470/25221752253_6dcbe5264f.jpg\" width=\"375\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
