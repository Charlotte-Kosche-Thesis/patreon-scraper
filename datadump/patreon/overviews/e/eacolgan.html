I also write analysis and reviews of what I lovingly refer to as \u201cgeek media\u201d\u2014 genre movies, books, and TV shows\u2014 with a focus on representation of women, people of color, queer people, disabled people, and other marginalized identities. I write stories about magic and aliens and how they mess up people\u2019s regularly scheduled lives; I write about how horrific experiences make us confront the monsters within ourselves; I write about found families and tough choices and people who take care of each other.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon? \u003cbr\u003eWriting has been my hobby for over ten years, and I want to do more than just dabble at it when I have \"spare time\". I want to have the extra brain-space and the extra time to write, the kind of bandwidth that\u2019s hard to come by when you\u2019re working overtime to pay the bills. Some creators I love and respect speak highly of Patreon and how crucial it is to supporting their creative efforts, so I\u2019m putting myself out there in the hopes of garnering some of the same support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat will you get if you support me? \u003cbr\u003eBesides my undying gratitude, my rewards are mostly structured around sneak previews of my current and upcoming work. Snippets of whatever short story I\u2019m writing, character studies, early access to a review or a blog post, etc\u2014 higher tiers can access Q\u0026amp;As with me, polls, the opportunity to recommend me a book or movie to review, and rights to name a character. I\u2019d also love your feedback on what rewards would be exciting for you!\u003cbr\u003e"
