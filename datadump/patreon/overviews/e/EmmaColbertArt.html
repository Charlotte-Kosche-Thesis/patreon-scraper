    "summary": "Hi and welcome to my channel where I hope to share with you all the tips and techniques I\u2019ve picked up over the years as a professional pastel artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been helping other artists through my blog and Youtube channel for a while, and because there is so much interest in pastel tuition, I thought I\u2019d try to devote more time and energy to these tutorials. This is where you guys come in\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy using Patreon as a forum to share this knowledge, you can contribute with a subscription to help me fund this project. My laptop is broken after a long hard life, I have my eye on a camera that would make filming so much easier, and several other upgrades I need to be able to produce better content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support you\u2019ll gain access to \u003cstrong\u003evideo tutorials, royalty free reference photos, instructional videos, live demos and more. \u003c/strong\u003eAll while in the knowledge that you\u0027re helping me progress down this path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy own background in art starts at an early age with the discovery of pastel and a love for painting animals. I graduated as an Illustrator in 2007 but since then I have produced hundreds of portraits, both pets and people. I also love to paint landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes, interior scenes, whatever inspires me. It\u2019s all about the light for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no better medium to capture it all than pastel. I\u2019ll show you from the basics, right through to capturing the finest detail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have different levels of subscription to suit all budgets. You can see these on the right side of the page. Patreon is really simple\u2026you can subscribe for as long as you want and it\u2019s really easy to cancel or pause at any time.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is all pretty new so please bear with me while I get into a better rhythm. I explain everything a little better in my intro video so be sure to check this out above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m excited by the prospect of being able to create this content and I hope I\u2019ll catch up with you here on my channel."
