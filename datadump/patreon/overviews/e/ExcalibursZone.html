Role-playing games, board games, dice games, video games, you name it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to bring my love of gaming to others through several media formats and am constantly working to create new content, improve my editing skills, work on public speaking, and share what knowledge I have of games with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to make this more than just a late night or weekend hobby. I\u0027m aiming to take all of this and turn it into my full time job and be able to share my love of games with everyone without obstacles getting in the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to peruse my Patreon campaign and to read through my introduction. I hope you enjoy the posts that I put up, find something useful, or are entertained by something I\u0027ve posted here."
