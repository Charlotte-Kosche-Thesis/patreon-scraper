And now it\u2019s become bigger than any one of us who had a hand in making it - it\u2019s become a statement on the way good work starts, and the sweat that goes into making it exceptional. \u003cem\u003eThe Eleventh Hour!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is a celebration of everything that\u2019s fun, good, frustrating, beautiful, and terrible about the DIY art scene.

It celebrates the NB basement scene and DIY music and culture.\u00a0The musical features music, book, and lyrics by David Seamon, direction by Annie Rutherford Lutz, and is produced by Smugbug Productions. The story for the musical was originally created by Seamon, Lutz, and Shimmy Schwartz through a commission by coLAB Arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the end of the world in New Jersey! A burnout basement rocker and his ex-girlfriend, a rising star astrophysicist, may have the key to surviving the black hole bearing down on earth. If they can reconcile their feelings and manage a dangerous journey on the NJ Turnpike, they just may save their music, each other, and the mole people who live beneath them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patreon supporter, you can get access to regular behind-the-scenes content from the production, and exclusive original music from Dave (see: all of the amazing thank you videos Dave did for the IndieGoGo campaign). By giving at a higher level patrons can\u00a0unlock exclusive production merchandise, and original art that celebrates the musical and DIY culture.\u003cbr\u003e",
