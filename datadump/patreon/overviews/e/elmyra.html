    "summary": "We all know about rape culture: how sexual assault and rape are minimised as just \"boys being boys\", victims and survivors are disbelieved or blamed outright, how the powerful prey on the powerless. #metoo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am working towards is a culture of consent: a culture where we respect each other\u0027s bodily autonomy, where we value our own and each other\u0027s sexuality and humanity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we have a long way to go before we get there. We need to fix our laws, our education, and perhaps above all, our culture. And this is where, with your help, I can make a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027ve got this far and are considering supporting me, or are already supporting me, thank you so much! You\u0027re amazing, and you\u0027re helping make the world a better place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you again?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Milena, a queer, non-binary, mouthy, migrant human. I have been a writer, blogger, and activist on a range of issues from digital right to sexual violence and queer issues for nearly a decade, and more recently, I have completed a PhD in consent and popular culture at the Digital Cultures Research Centre, UWE Bristol. Think of me as a molten core of rage wrapped in academic citations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do you actually do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am producing a range of content, from Twitter threads and blog posts, to talks and academic papers. I want to make academic theory and feminist thought on this subject accessible to a wider audience, but also engage with the good, the bad and the ugly of how sexuality is represented in popular culture. So expect me dissecting your favourite TV show, talking about what fan fiction does (and doesn\u0027t) do better than mainstream culture, or delving into some heavy-duty feminist legal theory in ways that are easily digestible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will my money be going towards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour support enables me to carve out time to do this work properly. It means I have enough stability to turn down freelance work in favour of focusing on this project, and to choose future research projects which also directly feed into this work. In the long run, I hope it will enable me to make direct interventions by educating writers and creators of popular culture about consent, and how they can make a difference through their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI can\u0027t afford a monthly contribution but still want to help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s great, and any support is always greatly appreciated. The easiest ways to get money to me as a one-off gesture are to \u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/elmyra\"\u003ebuy me coffee\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://paypal.me/elmyra23\"\u003esend me money via PayPal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
