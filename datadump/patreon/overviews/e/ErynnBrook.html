    "summary": "For those of you who are interested in unearthing and changing the ways that white supremacy affects you as a white person, well, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be working on for the next little while. I do this work while supporting the organizers I learn from through Patreon and other avenues. If you would like to support me as I continue to write, learn, listen and educate, you can do so \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ErynnBrook\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I only ask that you prioritize funds. If you do not currently support any women of colour financially please let me know so that I can divert your Patreon contributions directly to those doing the work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every $10 of patronage I receive I dedicate half to supporting other creators! You can see who is supported by scrolling down the sidebar on the right.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a storyteller.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love media, pop culture, nerd culture, any superhero movie, social justice issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI build bridges. I make connections. I come into contentious spaces and find the discord.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe one of the biggest problems we face as a species is that so few of us know how to listen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am interdisciplinary, and the road to becoming me has been unconventional, to say the least.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI came to Patreon in the hopes of making my work more sustainable for myself and my family. I am drawn to this work and do as much of it as I can through writing and social media, I hope to expand into podcasting. I do this work regardless of who\u0027s paying me, because it\u0027s part of who I am. But the less I have to contend with outside jobs for survival, the more time I can spend doing what I love and what I\u0027m good at - having conversations and creating change.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment one of my biggest projects is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nicewhiteladies.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNice White Ladies\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e- an online community dedicated to bringing white folks up to speed on the racial justice conversation. We are looking to expand our content, support more black women organizers through Safety Pin Box and Black Women Being, as well as individual creators here on Patreon. While some of what I make through Patreon will go towards sustaining me, a portion of it will go towards NWL and growing our ability to support the movement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
