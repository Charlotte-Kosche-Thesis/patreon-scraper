I draw often and I draw fast, typically drawing fanart and/or NSFW illustrations and sketches. I try to keep a good balance of different varieties of NSFW, and have my hands in many fandoms. I\u0027m pretty flexible and easy going about most things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery other week I livestream, where I draw for my patrons dependent upon your reward tier. Requests must be placed before the 15th of every month or your request will be forfeit. New patrons can make a request at the beginning of their pledge, even if pledging after the 15th. Only those in appropriate reward tiers may make requests. Streams will take place on weekends, generally on Saturday afternoons (pacific time).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will be able to participate in monthly polls. Each month, there will be several polls for all patrons to vote on. One poll will be for the monthly illustration(s), which is a fully colored NSFW piece of a character or ship, and that poll will always be at the beginning of the month. The other polls will be bi-weekly, during the first and third weeks of the month; that will be for NSFW sketch pages, which is a single image comprised of several different poses, almost like a very rough and disjointed comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/eemamminy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLivestream link\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf interested in a commission, my information can be found\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://eemamminy.tumblr.com/commissions\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and I can be reached by e-mail at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:eemamminy@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eeemamminy@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/PrintsByEemamminy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e (SFW)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://eemamminy.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e (NSFW and General Content)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/eemamminy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSFW Twitter\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/eemamminy_nsfw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNSFW Twitter\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"

I love creating fanart from my favorite games, shows, and series, and am not at all shy when it comes to creating spicier content. Knowing that my art makes others happy helps inspire me, so that makes your support all the more important!\u003cbr\u003e",
