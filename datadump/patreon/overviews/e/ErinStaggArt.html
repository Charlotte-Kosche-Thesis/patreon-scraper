My name is Erin, I\u0027m a self-taught painter. I create a variety of colourful paintings which can range from surreal to realistic. They tell the story of my life and I can\u0027t wait to share them with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI make\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/erinstaggart\"\u003etimelapse videos\u003c/a\u003e showing how I made the painting and sometimes I teach you how to make art. I also like to tell stories about where the painting came from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I make art, I feel like I bring colour into my life, both literally and figuratively. My goal of making art is to help bring colour to your life as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and why should I pay for content that is already free?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a voluntary subscription service that allows you to help me keep making art. Basically, it allows me to have a more stable income and helps me to get better filming equipment, be able to afford a studio, and go on art trips. Think of yourself as a \u003cstrong\u003epatron of the arts.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a little thank you, I put each Patron\u0027s name (or whatever name you choose) up on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://erinstagg.com/badass\"\u003eBadass People list\u003c/a\u003e. This is a list that lives on my website and will be up there forever, even if you cancel your subscription.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the incredible karma that comes with helping an artist, you get unique access to perks. I\u0027ve tried to put some great perks together for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor instance, every month we have a Patreon Painting of the Month. This is the only place where you can watch the timelapse video showing how I made it. During the monthly livestream I\u0027ll tell you about the meaning behind the painting. \u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also get the opportunity to purchase the original and prints of it a month before anyone else. Plus, if you pledge $10 or more a month you\u0027ll get save 10% off all print merchandise in my store.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also really enjoy closeup pictures of paintings, I\u0027ve included 6 of the painting of the month and you can even get high resolution pictures of the painting of the month. \u003cem\u003eImportant note: you aren\u0027t allowed to make prints of it because you\u0027d be infringing on my copyright, which is illegal and besides that, it\u0027s a pretty douchey thing to do. That\u0027s why I give you a discount and ship it to you!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is Patreon valuable?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is actually changing the internet by allowing creators like me the ability to live outside the influence of advertisers. Making art takes a lot of time and videos take 2-3 days to create. It\u0027s impossible for me to make regular videos while also working part-time. So you help make that happen!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy the personal and private forum that Patreon creates. I\u0027m actually a pretty private person and I hesitate to share things on my social media pages. I like the fact that on Patreon I can share things I\u0027m normally a bit more shy about. For instance, when I\u0027m creating I take work in progress photos, but rarely share them. Being a full-time artist is very different from working a regular job and I\u0027d like to share more about what that is like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got a few short term goals for the future, like getting better equipment for filming, like microphones and camera set ups. It\u0027s hard for me to prioritize spending on these items, but Patreon makes it possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy long term goal is to cover my basic bills and give me stability so that I can be a bit more ballsy with the things that I want to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of those ballsy things is to do more Art Trips. When you go somewhere new, your eyes are opened in an entirely new way as you try and take in the sense of place. I hunt out great spots to sit and paint and I want to share that whole experience with you through vlogs or livestreams. However, Art Trips are expensive so Patreon is one of the ways I want to fund those trips. You\u0027ll get to vote on what things I should paint and I\u0027ll even give some of that art away on Patreon as a huge thank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportant FAQ\u003cbr\u003e1) You can still view all of my videos on\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/erinstaggart\"\u003emy YouTube channel here\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e2) You can easily cancel at any time.\u003cbr\u003e3) You can set monthly maximums so you don\u0027t break your budget.\u003cbr\u003e4) Thank you so much!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
