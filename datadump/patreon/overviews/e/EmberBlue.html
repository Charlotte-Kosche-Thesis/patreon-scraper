You can call me Ember Blue, Em, or Blue.  My life dream is to publish a book one day, as is the wish for many writers. I practice my writing in my ways - ranging from role play in MMOs and short stories.  With a real life that does not afford me much leeway in taking time off to explore this life passion, I come to you with open hand and writing pen.  A few tidbits about me - I enjoy music with a sensual beat, I meditate and consider myself a deeply spiritual person, I am an avid Harry Potter Fan, and I love hot chocolate.\u00a0Updates about my patreon and it\u0027s posts will be on the blogroll to this website, my twitter, and the upcoming discord.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://avenueem.weebly.com/\"\u003ehttps://avenueemafterdark.weebly.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MissEmberBlue\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/MissEmberBlue\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat erotica themes will I write?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I write a wide range of themes and aesthetics, this Patreon will mainly focus on one of my chosen depths - Erotica. A main \u0027feature\u0027 story that includes some of my favorite aesthetics- 1920s culture and dress, steampunk, and underworld creatures will be frequently updated.\u00a0 In addition, I will write for you aesthetics ranging from forbidden romance and sexual interludes, fanfiction, fetish-writing, and BDSM.  Although I will provide stories of my own, I am available by commission to write a story with themes you request as approved by me.  Generally, I am an open person to theme elements as long as they follow State and Federal laws. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf Scarlet Doors is an Alternative Universe chapter-story centered around aesthetics of 1920s, steampunk, and the dark underworld.\u00a0 Think mob meets magick!\u00a0 With the backdrop of a bordello, readers will experience not only the vibrant lore and setting, but sensual interludes between the customers and workers at the bordello.\u00a0 The courtesans working for the brothel range from all different species - succubus, vampire, human, genie, fairy, and more.\u00a0 Things that go bump in the night will bump even more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSensuality, romance, and sex are physiologically and psychologically compelling. All three drive us to places we never thought we would go or we always wished we could venture. Desire, lust, and love all teach us things about ourselves that we never knew before. My passion in writing erotica is providing stories that leave you aching for both the bond between the characters and the exploration of sexuality. I believe sexuality and sensuality should be celebrated as an art - not shunned and seen as shameful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I start a patreon and why should you become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first, simple answer is - I love writing.  I am wishing to one day become an author.  Currently, my real life profession involves me taking care of others in the medical profession as well as educating those new to the profession.  Although I love my job, my student loans have become such a heavy burden.  I started a patreon to start my dream of becoming a writer.  Dreams don\u0027t pay bills, unfortunately.  And every dollar that patrons donate will be lovingly used to help me provide for others and find time to focus on my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you get for donating?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.
