    "summary": "Hello! If you\u0027re here i\u0027m going to presume it\u0027s because you\u0027ve stumbled across my videos and you\u0027ve enjoyed them. I make content about Manchester City football club, their academy teams and football in general. I also make regular vlogs covering City\u0027s games too, and often just chat about nonsense in general, because why the hell not?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to set up Patreon given the overwhelming (not even kidding, it was really nice of you all) support I received when I unfortunately had to leave Blue Moon Rising TV. I found myself out of work and lots of very kind people offered to help fund videos so I could afford to go to some City games again because they missed my matchday vlogs. As you probably know, YouTube doesn\u0027t really pay very well for creators - unless you\u0027re mega big like Casey Neistat or sumat, and I\u0027m not. Given my personal situation I\u0027ve not been able to keep up the content as regularly as I liked because life took over, time shrank and there was more pressing financial matters at hand, so I\u0027m giving this a go. Lots of channels and creators I like do this, and seeing as every little helps why not? Honestly, don\u0027t feel any pressure to contribute. Even just watching the videos means a lot to me. If you can and want to, well that\u0027s amazing. If you can\u0027t, then it doesn\u0027t matter. I appreciate your support all the same, totally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create videos because I enjoy making them for you all. There is no greater thrill for me than uploading a video that I\u0027ve spent several hours editing and seeing the feedback I get from it. The reactions to the vlogs is immensely satisfying - a lot of works goes into them and I\u0027ve found myself sat up at 4am editing away, only to get up for work at 7am the next day. And I\u0027ll no doubt keep doing that. If I could, it\u0027s what I\u0027d do all day. Happily. I love it, I love making videos, I love replying to you all in the comments, I love talking about Manchester City and overall I just love being able to do this in my spare time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes it can be a bit hard, so I\u0027m hoping a little bit of support on here might make life easier so I can produce even better content, do collaborations with other channels and hopefully offer City fans an alternative voice on things that they 100% deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eSteven x"
