Tongue in cheek and all that. Smile :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is... well, just call me Spike, everyone does that. I am a writer living in Austria, that\u0027s in Europe, not the kangaroo one ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may now think: Writer? Says \u0027Videos, Music and Games\u0027 right there, that\u0027s not much writing is it?\u003cbr\u003eWell, I do a bit more than just writing of course. Because videos need scripts, as do games and music needs lyrics. I do that as well. Songwriter, scriptwriter, things like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do I write? Well, name it and I\u0027m pretty sure I could write something. But usually I write comic books, novellas, short stories, song lyrics or scripts for videos, as already mentioned. Which brings me to videos, stuff I do when I am not writing. I also direct, act and produce said videos. And do the soundtrack to said videos and the soundtrack to games I create as a hobby since I , as previously stated, also happen to be a songwriter, which closes the loop.\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am saying is, I write fiction, mostly. Every now and then I write some non fiction on my blog but that is usually gaming related or slightly political crap, haven\u0027t done that in a while, tho. Nothing to write home about (there is this word again... write) but it\u0027s what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does that mean for you? Nothing, really. I write anyway. My comics are updated anyway. My music is available anyway.\u003cbr\u003eSo WHY should you support me? Because it is the right thing to do. Because it would not only make my life easier, it would give my work more purpose and especially would lighten my mood, which is a good thing. And you want to do the right thing, I know you do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you know I\u0027m right ;)"
