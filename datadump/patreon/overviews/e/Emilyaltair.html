My name is Emily Altair, I\u0027m a photographer currently residing in Columbus, Ohio. I graduated from the Columbus College of Art and Design in 2015 with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Photography.\u00a0For the past few years I have had the amazing opportunity to shoot with many professional models in the midwest through Suicide Girls. While shooting for Suicide Girls has been my dream job since I was a teenager I\u0027ve neglected my creative side that got me into photography in the first place. By pushing my own boundaries and expanding my portfolio I know I\u0027ll be able to produce better work for you, SG, and beyond! I would really love to be able to continue pursuing photography as a career and focus on lingerie, sexuality, feminism, and fashion. I\u0027ve dedicated almost all of my days off from my full time job to shooting, editing, and brainstorming ideas to share on here and I\u0027m so excited to finally be able to show off my hard work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to sharing my photography of other models I am starting something new and way more personal. I am going to be blogging bi-weekly and sharing images of myself (shot by me and other photographers!). These blogs and photos will be a documentation of my journey with body positivity and self love. Confidence is something that has come and gone so many times in my life and I\u0027m far from figuring out the secret. I hope that by sharing these things I will inspire others to spread love even more and be more aware of the importance of self care. Topics will include everything from sharing personal stories and opinions to self care themed photosets. (This is a new tier that I have not listed yet but will be available once I have more content to share. I am looking for suggestions and encouragement!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar I make because of your support goes right back into making more content and new gifts to send you! I\u0027d love to be able to achieve huge goals like buying a new camera, or traveling more and every dollar counts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
