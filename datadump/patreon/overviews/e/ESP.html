    "summary": "I am known by many names but my real name is Joshua Kaine Elliott. You can call me Josh! I am a bit of an oddball and have been fortunate to have found an amazing audience that is in tune with me and my somewhat crazy personality and creative mindset! I have a never ending love for motorsports of all kinds. I mean literally anything that can be driven or piloted will grab my attention! As a true lover of offroading and an avid RC collector as a kid, I absolutely lost my mind when I realized that I could replicate real life Jeeps with RC parts! I learned this by watching YouTube videos like so many have and at the time I was living in Hawaii. So naturally I had to get into it myself and after building my first one the next step was taking it out to the rocks on the beach. As I was walking out I grabbed my wife\u0027s cheap little camera that took 15 or 30 second video clips and I made my first video so I could put it on YouTube and show my brother and cousins back in Oregon. Little did I know that my first video would quickly rack up over 20,000+ views in no time! After that it was apparent that I had found myself a new hobby, building RC Jeeps and making videos of them! Fast forward almost 8 years and I am now a full time YouTube creator with a fleet of RC\u0027s for filming, many competitions under my belt with a decent amount of first place finishes, 11 Official sponsors, and a fun, super interactive and loyal audience to share my RC adventures with! Since diving in full time my numbers have started to climb at a much higher pace and unfortunately the pay does not offset those numbers or even begin to cover my bills so I am forced to take on side jobs constantly to cover bills, feed my family and of course cover the cost of creating video content for you, my Subscribers! In doing so I am constantly overworked and not able to give my full attention to my audience and content creation.\u003cbr\u003e So in short, by starting up this new Patreon account I am hoping to be able to offer my truly loyal and dedicated fans an opportunity to see me apply proper funding and attention to Extreme Scale Performance in hopes of not just keeping it alive for years to come but to turn it into the RC Entertainment powerhouse you and I both know it is capable of becoming! My goal is to be able to offer the best RC content on the Internet everyday of the week, every day of the month, every day of the year! Together I believe we can make that a reality! \u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron you are showing your personal dedicated support for the Extreme Scale Performance RC YouTube Channel! That means you are not only helping to ensure a minimum of 3 videos a week for all viewers but you are gaining a whole new level of access that only Patrons will be given! \u00a0By taking this route I can offer Patrons early access to special content, personalized interactions such as private hangouts and livestreams, Q\u0026amp;A videos, How-To videos, discounted ESP merchandise and more! \u00a0More support means not just more content but BETTER content!! Thank you all for taking the time to become a true ESP Patron! Now go enjoy some of the videos you have helped make a reality!! Peace and Chicken grease family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoshua Kaine Elliott\u003cbr\u003eaka Coleman your r/c rasta!\u003cbr\u003e"

As the acting Director you will be getting full credit for your work in the video and video description. To top it all off you also get all the lower tier rewards as well!
