My name is Theo Gibson, producer and co-host of the NZ EV Podcast. Each week, Dee West and I bring you news and commentary on the growing Electric Vehicle industry in New Zealand and around the world. As owners and enthusiasts, we offer helpful advice on getting into an EV for a ride, drive, or as an owner! With many great guests, you will also get to hear about solar and wind power generation, e-bikes, autonomous vehicles, electric planes and boats and clever eco-tech. We love what we do and want to keep doing it, but we need your help if we are going to continue. This podcast is a labour of love, and we think it has a lot of potential to grow. It takes us a lot of time to research stories and connect\u00a0with our guest so please subscribe to our page and your support will give us the time we need to research and produce a top-notch weekly\u00a0podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t heard our podcast, subscribe today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.podcasts.nz/nz-ev-podcast/\"\u003eListen to the NZ EV Podcast Now.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
