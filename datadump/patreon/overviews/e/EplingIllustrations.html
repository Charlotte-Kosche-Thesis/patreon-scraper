    "summary": "Back in 2012, I had an idea for a webcomic. I would call it \"SALT\", after Matthew 5:13. The background to the comic would be autobiographical by nature. My idea was to write, draw, and comment on what it was like to be a Christian (or at least from my perspective) living in today\u0027s world. In today\u0027s culture. All the misconceptions about the Christian faith had almost driven me nuts by then. \"SALT\" would be my way of venting the frustrations that come from those misconceptions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy 2012 I had been working as a professional illustrator and cartoonist for a few years, but a webcomic was something I hadn\u0027t ever tried to do.\u00a0For a long time it went very well. Producing a weekly webcomic doesn\u0027t seem too challenging, but it is (and was). I managed to keep on track for a year and some change. 52 weeks worth of comics went into a small book. A collection of an entire year\u0027s worth of webcomics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, the costs associated with keeping the website and content coming started to become too much. I was finding it very difficult to produce the webcomic on a weekly basis. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve decided to create this page on Patreon. I would love to return to SALT and create again, but with that effort I need supporters. My goal is to completely re-design the website and to create a new webcomic that will be very different than the first few year\u0027s worth. My intentions will be the same; to describe from my perspective what it\u0027s like to live as a Christian in today\u0027s world. The difference will be in the design of the website and the delivery of the comic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA new webcomic will be produced and posted every Sunday. With your help, I will be able to sustain the costs associated with the website and the production of the webcomic. You can see the older version of the website by visiting www.saltwebcomic.com"

His third book, titled \u2018SALT; Year-One Anthology\u2019, is due to be released November 2014. Epling is currently working on a graphic novel, set in Eastern Kentucky, titled \u2018Carbide Bottom\u2019.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEpling\u2019s illustrations can also be found in other author\u0027s titles as well, including two titles for author Mark Mattmiller; \u2019NEIGHBORING\u2019 (June 2013) \u0026amp; \u2019There Shall I Be (2014), author Mary Powell Wagner\u0027s \u0027Simon Salamander (December 2013), and he is currently illustrating a book for \u2018Read-Writer\u2019s Publishing\u2019 titled \u2018Owen Owl\u2019s Wise Words\u2019 (Written by Julia and Melinda Richardson).
