You know how I get, especially if I\u0027ve been shopping for boulder opal. Or imperial jasper. Or ocean jasper. Or sunstones and moonstones and labradorite and... oh, you know how I get!) It\u0027ll be a mix, and a grand surprise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also have access to the shared writing prompts from the $1 level.
