It\u0027s great to see you here!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m creating a new adventure in my life and I want you are to be a part of it. I\u0027m launching a YOUTUBE channel covering my life, and my ideas of living what I call a \u003cstrong\u003eBellelife\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s a SELF-HEALING, FASHION, FITNESS, BEAUTY and TRAVEL vlog. It will be focused on women\u0027s beauty and women\u0027s empowerment. And being a patron will give you the opportunity to have a direct influence on the content you see. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Changing Process-\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a03 years ago, I made the decision to change my life. I was working at the hospital as radiology tech and one day i had the epiphany that telling people to take a deep breath was NOT what i really want to do with my life. So I quit my job, and became an entrepreneur. Since then, my life has never been the same. And I want to share with you what i\u2019ve learned along the way. What I\u2019ve learned about how to live a beautiful life\u2026.\u00a0a Belle Life.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-That\u0027s why I Need You-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSo I am here for one reason. You see this venture, will not be easy or cheap. It will take hours of writing, production, filming, editing, and it will ALL come my own time and pocket. But you can help! You see, you can become a SUBSCRIBER by becoming my PATRON. In essence, you can donate to me money, giving me well needed funds to keep me going. Think of it like kickstarter but for artists such as myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Your Pledge-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eYour donations will be per video. And I will be making 4 to 5 videos a month / So if you pledge 1 dollar per video / you will be paying me 4 to 5 dollars a month. Or if you pledge me 5 dollars per video, you will be pledging me 20 to 25 dollars per month. And so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-What do you get-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNo matter what level you feel comfortable with donating, your support will make this project exponentially more sustainable, at delivering good content, writing, production and editing. Eventually, if my work has been proven valuable, I\u2019ll have more time to focus on public speeches, personal coaching and creating more and more online material. I feel so blessed to start this journey and so excited with where it can lead all with your help. And it\u2019s only limited by how much you give me, so please give with your heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI can\u2019t wait to make a strong community of fans and friends who i can share this journey with and guided the direction along the way. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
