    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\"When you\u2019re speaking in the truest, most intimate voice about your life, you are speaking with the universal voice.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCheryl Strayed\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that I write. I know that I\u0027m a good writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that it\u0027s taken 27 years to get to a place where I can say that and not feel like squirming with massive discomfort and like I\u0027m being an arrogant, grandiose asshole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that I write my best work when it\u0027s personal and intimate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that it\u0027s no longer feeling comfortable or appropriate to put those on facebook anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I also know that the writing of those pieces is driven by a deep desire to connect and find something universal, or at least relateable, and I also know the past couple of years I\u0027ve gotten a lot of really humblingly flattering feedback from unexpected parts of my facebook circle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting to me is about \u003cem\u003econnection\u003c/em\u003e. I don\u0027t write well in a vacuum. Blogging on other platforms has always felt like shouting into the void. Writing on facebook is starting to feel like oversharing to people who don\u0027t get it, appreciate it or care, and has resulted in me pulling back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I want to give those of you who have shown interest and support an opportunity to continue to do that. I want to get intimate. I want to get personal and real and authentic. But I don\u0027t want to spend that investment on people who aren\u0027t on that speed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to write sporadically. This isn\u0027t about making money. It\u0027s about investing in each other. It\u0027s about building a small community of people who want to get vulnerable. Get real. Get intimate and brave the arena, as Brene Brown would say.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know what all I\u0027ll write about. I don\u0027t know what this is going to be. If you\u0027ve liked my serious facebook novels, I think you\u0027ll like this. We\u0027ll figure it out as we go. Send me questions. Let\u0027s do some \"Ask Elyse\" style advice things. Writing prompts. I\u0027ll read books and watch TV and tell you what I think. I\u0027ll live my life and observe things and analyze them like I always do. I\u0027ll use dogs as a metaphor for learning how to human better. I\u0027ll undoubtedly talk about life after divorce and the strength I\u0027ve found since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never know what I\u0027m doing. But I know I\u0027m ready to write. And I\u0027m ready to write for real. And I want some people to write for. I hope you\u0027ll join me. This should be fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and sometimes there will probably be photographs because those are fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuick and dirty on how this works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePick a subscription level. Patreon will charge you once a month depending on your pledge level and how much I posted for that pledge level. You can also cap. So if you only want to spend $1/month here, you can say that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s say you\u0027re a $3 pledge and you cap at $10/month. Let\u0027s say I post 4+ things. You\u0027ll still be able to see all 4+ things. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
