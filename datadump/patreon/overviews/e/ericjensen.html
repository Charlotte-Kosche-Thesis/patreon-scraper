    "summary": "\u00a0There has been a history of patronage as far back as it goes for any artist who has had talent and has made any sort of mark in the art world. For many, many years I have funded myself through trial and error and A LOT of hard work. After all, it\u0027s the only thing I\u2019ve really wanted to do since I was a child. I have finally decided that I deserve a chance to really make a go of it.  Asking for help has always been hard on my ego, but it\u0027s time.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0In order to pay for my studio space, art supplies and materials (which is all incredibly expensive as any artist can attest to), I have been working in the nightlife industry for the past decade. This means that if I work a lot I can (just barely) afford these things. Working this hard means I rarely have time to actually use the space and materials that I pay so much for.  When I do have the time to work on my practice it means I can\u2019t afford what I need to actually make it all happen and the cycle continues.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Aside from negotiating the financial aspect of being a practicing artist on a budget, there is also the issue of working in the nightlife industry itself. I have in the past year decided it is worth my sanity to stop working the club aspect of the business and instead work at a creative restaurant where I feel more fulfilled. Of course, the money is significantly less for the hours I work. I am good at what I do in this industry but  I have never been more ready in my life to take on a full time studio practice. The hours vs. money dilemma is something I need to sort out before another decade of \u201cart I didn\u0027t make\u201d slips away.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0That being said, the majority of the work I\u2019ve done in the past few years has all been done when I get home from those nightlight jobs (often in altered states). I am very proud of the work I have done, but I have been told repeatedly that it can be very dark and disturbing. This adds another hardship to my process as it is not something that the average person wants to hang over their sofas. I could easily start producing photorealistic paintings and drawing that would sell but I would be going backward in what I feel has been a long and unique artistic progression.  I feel it\u0027s necessary for me to continue the evolution of what I have done for so long. I think it\u0027s the artist\u2019s responsibility to follow that wherever it leads. \u003cbr\u003e"
