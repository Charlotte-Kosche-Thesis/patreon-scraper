The cycles of poverty, the destruction of natural resources, lack of\naccess to education and extensive racism and division amongst the people. We\nbelieve and have learned through experience that the best solutions are found\nwhere the biggest problems are. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nEarth Haven is taking on all of these challenges\nby creating a space where environmental and human rehabilitation happen\nhand-in-hand and toward a common goal. By working together to bring back the\nland, producing food for humans and animals, teaching the principles of\ncustodianship and providing opportunities for learning for all ages. Earth\nHaven is a place where people are lifted out of poverty and given a stable\nfoundation of support from which they can stand to live and learn.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRegardless of race, gender, age, religion\nor creed, at Earth Haven we work together, eat together, learn together and\nplay together. With Earth Haven community principles, we teach, learn and live\nby example, showing what is possible, that there is another way for humanity to\nexist, support each other and work together for the benefit of all life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003eThe Vision\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt Earth Haven we hold to the fundamental\nprinciple that each and every human being has the ability to make a profound\npersonal inner change, to heal the schism that divides and separates us from\nourselves, each other and the natural world. Earth Haven is the place that\nprovides the space and support for those that are ready to make the decision to\nwork together to rehabilitate the environment, both internal and external, to\nbring Life back to those places that are capable of so much abundance. At Earth\nHaven, Life is honoured as the only REAL value that exists, and each person\nthat comes to work, visit or live is guided along the path back to self, to\nrealize the gifts each one has to offer, and to nurture the innate potential\neach one is born with. Our work with sustainable solutions and land\nrehabilitation reflects the growth and transformation that Life is capable of\nwhen seeds are planted within an environment of support, demonstrating the\nphysical manifestation of Heaven on Earth that is possible when we work\ntogether as self-willed equals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003ePurpose\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone can Equally participate in change, no special education or knowledge required, no degrees or masters required, simply common sense and self-honesty within unity - The world is in dire need of change. And this change isn\u2019t coming form the top of the pyramid as the world system, as we have seen over and over, and time isn\u2019t on our side. I currently have the position and location to start this mission for change, for the human and the environment. I know and understand that those who sees the same as me aren\u2019t in the same position or location as me, YET have the motivation and will within them to be the change. BUT, each one of us has the power to still play an equal role in starting something for change. This is our pledges, our money concentrated and dedicated to the cause. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an Educational and fun process that will  be shared with everyone that has become a Patron/contributor for the mission (someone contributing) as a sign of who is in this with me for real. I hope each person who knows me or who does not, will after reading this, see the mission and vision and the way that this can go, and take ten minutes to set everything up to become a Patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy creating and making the current Land as the first earth Haven community its utmost potential within self-sustainability, and improving nature and wild life \u2013 a balance will be restored, and so what is produced on the farm and the future farms/communities will be able to support those that currently have a disadvantage within the world system, those in poverty. The receiving will have an equal balance of giving. These communities will also become training grounds for re-educating and introducing a different lifestyle for the human. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is Earth Haven,  this is  OUR mission. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eBecome a Patron, make a Pledge and let us unite under the mission and for the Vision within the Purpose. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsk family members and friends to join in, share and like and spread the news.
