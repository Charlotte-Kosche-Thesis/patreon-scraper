    "summary": "Gifted Apprentice is an Artificially Intelligent animation suite that aims to take the liberating but laborious task of traditional 2D animation, and make it as easy and automatic as modern 3D animation (without all of the work of 3D modeling). Gifted Apprentice will do this without tying you down to that dull cardboard-cutout look which has unfortunately become a new standard in contemporary 2D animation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Gifted Apprentice does isn\u0027t\u00a0quite 2D animation -- but it is as versatile as drawing by hand. And it isn\u0027t quite 3D animation -- but it is as easy as animating by character rig.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe process is simple. Pose a 3D armature into a key-frame, and draw your character over it in 2D. From there, Gifted Apprentice will try to figure out roughly what you character should look like in any other 3D orientations or poses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePose the armature into the next key frame. If Gifted Apprentice isn\u0027t quite on the mark, simply fix the mistakes. Gifted Apprentice will learn from you. Quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePose the next key frame, and you shouldn\u0027t need to make as many corrections this time. \u003cbr\u003eRepeat the process until you\u0027re done animating.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Gifted Apprentice learns more and more, you\u0027ll have to draw less and less. \u00a0Teach it enough, and it will even be able to infer an approximate 3D model. You can\u0027t use it yet, but it\u0027ll be there in its mental model. In future versions, Gifted Apprentice will use that 3D model to automatically provide a basis for 2D lighting and shadowing -- the vector output of which, you can modify in much the same way you draw anything else in the program.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere, I\u0027ll be showcasing features and posting progress updates, -- and I\u0027d certainly appreciate suggestions, feature requests, and eventually alpha testers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ultimate goal is to make animation accessible to hobbyists, amateurs, students, or anyone lacking an army of inbetweeners. Occasionally, I\u0027ll take weeks off here or there to work on other small and neat but unrelated things. Hopefully people appreciate those quick creative endeavors enough on their own that they might like to offer support.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest wishes -- and to those who\u0027ve already been following me for a while: thank you for everything."
