We\u0027re The Elephant Collective.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWe are a non-profit art collective that empowers marginalized communities to imagine, organize, and create artistic projects across a variety of disciplines. We make interactive sculpture, art cars, performance art, costumes, virtual and augmented reality environments. TEC is a group of artists, performers, makers, and curators dedicated to creating large scale multi-format art and immersive or interactive experiences.  By bringing together a multidisciplinary group of marginalized people focused on blurring the lines between imagination and real experiences, TEC is ushering in a new era where art does not imitate life, art is life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did we get our start?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI guess it started some time ago when people told us to put down the crayons and pick up pencils, and told us that growing up meant leaving creativity behind with our imaginary friends. I guess we just prefer friendship and rainbows! \u003cbr\u003eOne magical day in November of 2017, three awesome humans met in New Orleans--these humans (they\u0027re really unicorns with good costumes tbh) are Dylan Butman, Stacey Spectacular, and Mark Shays. All three of us has been to that thing in the desert, Burning Man, and all of us had come out wanting to puke LEDs and paint all over everything. Unfortunately, NOPD wasn\u0027t down with that, so we decided we needed a place to art all over. But, all of our friend wanted to make art too...and suddenly we realized that there was no public art-making space in NOLA. So we decided to create one. We found a dilapidated old 12,000sf warehouse with 11,000sf outside...and The Elephant Collective was born!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e",
