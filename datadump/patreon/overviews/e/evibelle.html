It has been a wild ride so far and I\u0027m excited for you to join me on my journey dancing through the summer!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSecondly, I\u0027ve had this page for a little over a year now and am finding that it has been very stressful to keep up with while in school. I don\u0027t find it fair to not be keeping up with this page as I would ideally like to. So, this page will be for those who would like to support me with monthly donations, I will be posting photos and videos here whenever I can. But, I have also started a Go-Fund-Me for anyone who is interested in a one time donation at \u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/evibelle-summertuition\"\u003ehttps://www.gofundme.com/evibelle-summertuition\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, here is a little about what I\u0027m doing this summer:\u003cbr\u003e-----\u003cbr\u003eCornish College of the Arts is a Seattle based art conservatory school with a \u003cem\u003e100 year history \u003c/em\u003eand alumni that include\u003cem\u003e Merce Cunningham\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eRobert Joffery\u003c/em\u003e. All of their faculty are currently working in the industry and provide personal commitment as well as the connections and networking tools needed to flourish as an artist outside of school. This summer I am taking an Academic and Professional Writing class online that will be teaching me how to write grants, bios, artist statements, and several other art related writing prompts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very grateful Cornish offers this class because although it is wonderful to be able to write papers about books, more often than not I will need to be writing about my art and this class will provide me the tools to do so in a professional manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+++\u003cbr\u003eStrictly Seattle Dance Festival- Film Track\u003cbr\u003e\"Strictly Seattle is a supportive community of open experimentation and camaraderie where dancers form alliances for future collaborations. Hundreds of dancers from across the country come together to study with renowned Seattle choreographers + stellar faculty to create and perform new work, taking their dancing to the next level.\"\u003cbr\u003e (copied from their website:\u003ca href=\"http://velocitydancecenter.org/festivals/strictly-seattle/\"\u003ehttp://velocitydancecenter.org/festivals/strictly-...\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be spending three weeks this July with professional dancers this summer learning how to film, direct, and edit dance-films as well as gain access to workshop classes every morning and evening Monday-Friday.\u003cbr\u003e It is my goal to use these skills to diversify my tools in creating dance works and collaborate with other dancers over the summer months.\u00a0Find films created during this festival at the link below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://velocitydancecenter.org/festivals/strictly-seattle-2018-dance-film-track/\"\u003ehttp://velocitydancecenter.org/festivals/strictly-...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~\u003cbr\u003eStrictly Seattle accepted me into their work study program where I will be helping them in the studios between classes so they can lower my tuition for the festival. I was also granted several merit based scholarships and grants from Cornish that will pretty much cover tuition for most of the year. Unfortunately, Cornish does not offer financial aid during their the summer session and although I have thought about taking classes at a community college near by,\u00a0 I am not able to bring in any more credits from other schools and will instead need to find a way to pay my tuition for the summer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.\u00a0For anywhere from $1 a month to $50+ a month, you can support my endeavor, to feed myself and continue to dance throughout the summer. In turn you will get updates about any new posts on this page and an inside to my summer in Seattle.\u003cbr\u003e This page will serve as the place where you can find photos and videos of what I\u0027m up to all summer as well as chat with me about what I\u0027m up to or share comments with your fellow Patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e======\u003cbr\u003ePlease feel free to share this page with your friends and family and check out my Go-Fund-Me page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/evibelle-summertuition\"\u003ehttps://www.gofundme.com/evibelle-summertuition\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for checking out my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

As an artist is it important to have an idea of what your community is doing. There are dance performances every week here in Seattle with each ticket running anywhere between $15 and $35.

So, living in any city is expensive. We all know this and that is why I spent my summer working two jobs + starting up this Patreon to save up for the school year. This extra $100/mo will allow me to take weekends off at my place of employment for rehearsals, field trips (I hear rumor of a cadaver trip in anatomy), and general rest days without digging into my emergency savings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are giving me the opportunity to focus on my studies without having to worry about balancing a full time school schedule with a part time job.

In last semester alone I wore holes through at least three of my leggings, needed to replace ballet slippers, and just found myself needing new dance clothes frequently enough to make a difference in how I work my budget. Earlier this semester I had a back spasm that really scared me. I wasn\u0027t able to move much without sharp pains going through my body. With an emergency fund I will be able to have a savings specifically for going to see a masseuse, acupuncturist, or any other various body worker I might need to ensure my body continues to function as it should.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are giving me the opportunity to focus on my studies without having to worry about balancing a full time school schedule with a part time job.
