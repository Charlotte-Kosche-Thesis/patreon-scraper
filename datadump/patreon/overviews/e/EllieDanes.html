    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to Patreon and thank you for even showing up.\u00a0 If you\u0027ve stumbled upon this page, well, I hope you stick around and learn a bit more why I\u0027m here. If I invited you through social media or maybe you found a link in the back of one of my books, you\u0027ll get some insight as to why I\u0027m here and some great benefits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I and Why am I here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a writer. I didn\u0027t always start out that way, but it\u0027s where I\u0027ve ended up. I\u0027ve published A LOT of books on Amazon and I still look back and wonder how I got here. I dove headfirst into writing and never looked back. When I sold the first book it was an amazing rush and I\u00a0immediately jumped into the next book and the next book and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver 150 books later, here I am. Being an author isn\u0027t glamorous. For a while, it was actually possible to make a living writing and publishing my own books. Then Amazon, that big monster, decided to change things up. They do that every July. They love to change how they pay indie authors and it\u0027s become a tough business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOut of the many books I\u0027ve written, some I\u0027ve loved, and some, well, not so much. But when you hire editors, and cover designers and people to read and then reread your book it becomes a huge investment in both time and money. So, you try and sell it. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnter Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne thing I\u0027ve found is that the stories I love to write, aren\u0027t always everyone else\u0027s favorites. I\u0027ve had ideas about expanding current books I\u0027ve written or making shorter stories, but those just wouldn\u0027t sell as well on Amazon, so I tend to spend my time, writing longer, more mainstream and tropey books people want.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere, on Patreon, I plan on doing something different and much more interactive.\u00a0 My goal is to write more here, publishing chapters or several chapters at a time, expanding other stories, listening to you, the readers and fans, adapting, changing and writing some more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you get is my work published here, before anyone else sees it. Yes, I\u0027ll still be writing books and publishing them on Amazon, because that\u0027s what is paying the bills, but the stuff you get here won\u0027t be up there until it\u0027s complete and you\u0027ve read it here first. Here, you become part of the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means you get raw, mostly unedited, work as I\u0027m developing it. You\u0027ll see how the story machine works in my head, you\u0027ll get access to Tristan (my man) and his work as he writes his romance and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, there are plenty of levels and things for you to get as part of this process. Pick what makes sense for you and how much or how little you\u0027d like to be involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo buckle up, because this is about to possibly be exciting,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
