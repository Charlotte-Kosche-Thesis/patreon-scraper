Dr. Goodrick-Clarke had just left the\n Uni\u00adver\u00adsity of Wales, Lam\u00adpeter for a Chair at the Uni\u00adver\u00adsity of \nExeter. At Exeter, Dr. Goodrick-Clarke pio\u00adneered the Cen\u00adtre for the \nStudy of Eso\u00adteri\u00adcism (\u003ca href=\"http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/exeseso/\"\u003eEXESESO\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2005, I moved to Ire\u00adland and got wrapped up fur\u00adther in music, \ntravel and espe\u00adcially Irish lan\u00adguage and cul\u00adture. I began writ\u00ading \nsev\u00aderal works of fic\u00adtion a year, never really let\u00adting any\u00adone read \nit. But writ\u00ading just to read the sto\u00adries I wanted to hear dur\u00ading 5 \nyears of essen\u00adtially being \u003cem\u003eon the road\u2026\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the Reces\u00adsion in 2009, I lost any hope of finan\u00adcially \nfin\u00adish\u00ading my Ph.D. and fund\u00ading options for Cana\u00addi\u00adans fell through. \nBy the end of 2009 my health had also come to cri\u00adsis, I weighed over \n400 lbs and did not yet know I had Celiac Dis\u00adease (just thought I was \naddicted to food, despite how lit\u00adtle I ate.) I returned to Canada by \n2010 and began to truly explore my health.\u003cbr\u003e\nBy 2012, my health finally in recov\u00adery, if still a ways off, I had \nthe chance and fund\u00ading to fin\u00adish my doc\u00adtor\u00adate, but sadly on August \n29th Nicholas passed. He was a tremen\u00addous man, great scholar and \nwon\u00adder\u00adful sup\u00adport to my research. I loved his sense of humour and his\n sin\u00adcer\u00adity of heart.\u003cbr\u003e\nI had lost a lot of inter\u00adest in the aca\u00add\u00ade\u00admic sys\u00adtem before \nbegin\u00adning my doc\u00adtor\u00adate. Travel and music seemed more real. Now, \nlook\u00ading back, I am not shocked to see how much of my opin\u00adions about \nmyself were very influ\u00adenced by being a \u201cceliac\u201d. For\u00adtu\u00adnately, as \nwell, my musi\u00adcal skills learned in Ire\u00adland and tour\u00ading the world (I \nhave played over 200 shows a year since 2005) allowed me to scrape by \nwith\u00adout tak\u00ading a cent of gov\u00adern\u00adment money for dis\u00adabil\u00adity or \nany\u00adthing else. This alone I think gave me the self-esteem to work hard \non learn\u00ading to live and even be healthy with such a hor\u00adri\u00adble dis\u00adease\n as \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease\"\u003eC.D.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am pub\u00adlish\u00ading my three com\u00adpleted books on schol\u00adarly sub\u00adjects.
