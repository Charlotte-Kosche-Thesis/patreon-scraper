I\u0027ve been painting miniatures since 2007, and teaching others to paint since 2009.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou may know me from my YouTube videos, or from tutorials I used to produce with MiniWarGaming - or maybe you\u0027re just learning about me for the first time! Whether you know me or not, here\u0027s what you should know:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://epicduck.com/assets/Paint-Better-Minis-510.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPainting minis is a passion of mine, and I love to share that passion. \u00a0That\u0027s why I like teaching other people how to improve their painting. I want you to be able to take pride in your miniatures!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI teach my methods through a combination of YouTube tutorials and Live Streaming on Twitch. The YouTube videos often focus on either completing a specific miniature, or on teaching a certain technique. \u00a0The Twitch streams are more of an open format - while I always have some project of my own on the table during the stream, I spend a lot of the time answering questions from my viewers - even if that means pivoting to a completely different miniature to demonstrate something. \u00a0It\u0027s a great place to pick my brain and get a quick suggestion or feedback!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith occasional exceptions, there\u0027s a Twitch Stream every Sunday evening and Tuesday night. YouTube videos are more sporadic right now - my wife and I just welcomed our firstborn son into the world, and my editing time took a hit. It\u0027s slowly coming around though and I\u0027m hoping to hit a weekly release schedule again very soon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://epicduck.com/assets/Why-Patreon-510.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nProducing videos and live streams every week takes a lot of time! \u00a0I\u0027ve actually cut back significantly on how much commission painting I do so there\u0027s more time for filming and editing. \u00a0It\u0027s a change I\u0027m very happy to make because frankly, I love teaching others to paint well and find pride in their results! \u00a0It is, however, a significant investment of my time. \u00a0I\u0027d honestly love to do more - maybe even do this full-time - and growing beyond what I do now requires some capital. \u00a0Your patronage also means I can buy new miniatures more often, which means I can teach you how to paint new miniatures, armies and game systems as they\u0027re released.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://epicduck.com/assets/For-You-510.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOnce I hit $500 a month in Pledges, I\u0027ll begin raffling off a fully painted miniature every month to every Patron pledging at least $5 a month. \u00a0There may also be occasional unexpected perks to being a $5+ Patron, like discounts from business partners or sneak peeks at other projects I\u0027m working on, but there won\u0027t really be a schedule to these... they\u0027re just free candy when they happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who pledge at least $5 a month also get access to a Patrons-only voice channel on Discord, where I hang out when I\u0027m just painting on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://epicduck.com/assets/Thank-You-510.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nImagine a future where I host daily painting Twitch streams, assembling and painting new Warhammer, Hordes or Infinity releases the same week they hit the shelves! That\u0027s the end goal, and that\u0027s what your patronage will help me do. \u00a0Everything I do is about helping you paint better. \u00a0With your support, we can help rid the world of unpainted miniatures.\u003cbr\u003e"
