    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Emmie Mears, a sometime secret car and full-time authory critter. Not actually a cartoon, but Roselle Lim made me a very nice one for this here profile picture!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write the gamut of science fiction and fantasy -- everything from epic fantasy to magical realism to space opera -- though so far what\u0027s out there skittering around bookshelves is mostly of the urban fantasy persuasion. I\u0027ve written for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/5-reasons-to-write-the-book-you-need-to-write\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWriter\u0027s Digest\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2015/02/12/emmie-mears-five-things-i-learned-writing-storm-in-a-teacup/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTerrible Minds\u003c/a\u003e, and Harlequin.com, and this year unlocked a massive personal achievement when Audible bought the audio rights for my Ayala Storme series and Amber Benson (author, actor, director, producer, all-round deity) came on board to narrate the audiobooks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I am working hard to make ends meet. I work two part time jobs, and I want to keep being able to focus my energies on creating excellent stories for you to sink into and spend time in new worlds. Before July of 2015, I spent six years working 80-100+ hour weeks, which wasn\u0027t really a sustainable way to live, as I haven\u0027t yet figured out a way to remove my sleep or become part cyborg. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI come from a very poor family (I literally lived in a barn! For realsies!), and I went to university in the fledgling new millenium with the crazy helter skelter idea that a degree would mean a Living Wage, so I bought the student loan sales pitch hook, line, and sinker. And well...it\u0027s almost sunk me. Between debt payments and trying to squeeze a month of work into every fortnight, things most see as necessities (health care, grocery shopping) are sparse luxuries I can\u0027t afford.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, I had four books sold to publishers. My debut came out! Things were looking up! And then everything came crashing down. My marriage. My home. Within the space of three months, all four of those contracted books got orphaned, my agent left the business, I watched my debut novel vanish from the shelves just before the holiday season, and I suddenly found myself...well. Kind of marooned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2014, I have written six more novels and heaps of short stories. I have busted my bum to gain back the ground I lost, and there have been some successes! But doing this work full time and then some requires a lot of mental, emotional, and physical energy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge will enable me to bring you more of what you want: a creative, write-a-holic Emmie who is tapping away at the keyboard to lay new universes at your feet. In addition to the warm, sticky glow of knowing you\u0027re supporting my artistic endeavours, the money donated here makes a real, serious difference for me. It helps lift burdens so I can focus on making the best art I can possibly make.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what a month looks like for me:\u003cbr\u003eRent- \u00a3650 (I live with my partner)\u003cbr\u003eHome Office Expenses- \u00a345 (internet, phone, accounting software)\u003cbr\u003eKitties- \u00a340\u003cbr\u003eFood- \u00a3200\u003cbr\u003eUtilities- \u00a380\u003cbr\u003eTotal: \u00a31015\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s quite a lot, even without including the luxuries I cannot pay for at this time, like mental health services (thankfully, our immigration has ensured us access to the most excellent Scottish National Health Service), cobbling together part time income with writing income is a monthly act of gymnastics and anxiety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to be able to bring you 2-4 novel-length works per year (depending on contracts and [boring legalspeak redacted]), but I want to give you more! Exclusive short stories and novelettes, videos of my face saying interesting things, access to exclusive Q\u0026amp;As (also with my face), and the knowledge that if we turn up at the same con, you\u0027ll get to have my in-person face stammer a none-too-graceful shout of \"OH EM GEE THANK YOU\" or something similar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the most direct way for people to support the artists they want to support, and I desperately want to keep making worlds for you to explore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what, you have my sincerest thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
