Out in the human world I am also known as Vincent, with a few friends who help out occasionally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA brief introduction of what our channel does:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you know the feeling of learning to play an instrument?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we know for sure is that there are so many things to grasp when learning to play the - take for example - violin, viola or cello. Among the many worries are balancing the instrument, positioning your neck, using the bow accurately and who could forget - reading musical notations! What we do, is we simplify a huge chunk of it by \u003cstrong\u003etransforming traditional musical notations into an incredibly simple animation\u003c/strong\u003e that anyone can follow easily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur vision is to cover every single song in this world! While that\u0027s technically not possible, we are working towards covering most of the popular songs that people want to play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTL:DR - We create easy to follow violin, viola, cello, recorder, flute, saxophone, trumpet, clarinet, piano and guitar lessons. We aim to create a lesson for every song in this world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat drives us?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour appreciation and satisfaction drives us. Throughout the life of this channel, we have read many interesting comments and many that shook our hearts. Many of you stated that our videos helped you learn to play more efficiently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI remember by heart a few that really touched me. One fan once told me that our channel is his secret tutor which allowed him to play better than his peers. Another fan told me that she was able to play songs on her wedding because of our tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTL:DR - That \"thank you\" comment/pm that you sent - THAT makes us happy and keeps us going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though we have always stated we love making these tutorials, we had many other priorities to attend to. I am currently a university student who is running a startup and working part time to sustain my university fees.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, daily activities that we need to do to survive takes up a large portion of our time. It takes time away from these activities to transcribe the notes, find finger positions, and create animations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy funding the channel, I get to hire my friend and get help from others, so that we can produce high quality animation for your learning and pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTL:DR -\u00a0I have a life (or at least I would like to think I have).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eA Personal Message\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether or not you decide to be a Patreon, we want to assure you that this channel will be accessible by string players from all corners in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have decided to be a Patreon, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA unicorn may visit you in your sleep for you to play better at your instrument.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
