    "summary": "Hi everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a couple who have had a long term dream of sailing the Pacific and if possible to circumnavigate the world. We sail on our beautiful 473 Beneteau called Echo Echo. It has taken us years to get to the point, where we feel comfortable leaving everything we know behind and having the courage to\u00a0pursue this adventure. During that time, we have read all the books, blogs\u00a0and watched as many videos as we could to prepare and inspire\u00a0ourselves and to keep the dream alive, until it was time for us to embark on our own journey. We are very grateful to the people who took the time and effort to produce\u00a0such wonderful inspiring material.\u00a0Now we believe, it is our time to help others who may also wish to follow their dream- either literally or from their armchair. We will endeavor to show you the highs and even the lows of the cruising lifestyle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and support, we hope to be able to purchase better quality videoing and editing\u00a0equipment, to assist with purchasing internet access for the boat to upload videos\u00a0and to be able to continue funding the journey for as long as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankyou to those people who watch our videos and follow our blog. You are now our inspiration to continue making movies. So\u00a0get yourself comfortable, grab\u00a0your favourite drink\u00a0and watch\u00a0the next episode of SV Echo Echo Sailing the World. We hope you enjoy\u00a0it and you too can get to be a part of the dream we are living. \u003cbr\u003e"
