    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSupport Super Easy French on Patreon and make everything possible:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the Super Easy French Patreon page, I\u0027m glad to have you come to this page and I thank you a lot for this. As you can see, many things have changed and this Patreon is not about the street interviews anymore but about Super Easy French! :) You will see that this can be some really good news for you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT IS SUPER EASY FRENCH?\u003cbr\u003eSuper Easy French has been about Anthony (me) and some of my friends going to the streets and speaking slowly about our surroundings. My goal is to help beginners and intermediate learners to learn contextual phrases and sentences French native speakers would use in daily life, which is not always easy to find.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY SUPER EASY FRENCH?\u003cbr\u003eBecause it\u0027s something I love to do. It\u0027s something which allows me to send you these positive vibes I want to share with everybody while teaching you French in a casual way. Super Easy French is like a huge playground and it will allow me a lot of different kinds of contents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT WILL YOU CREATE?\u003cbr\u003eI will make these videos evolve to make them suitable for learning. I want them to have some randomness in them but I also want to train some particular skills in each episode so I will need to write some parts of them to help you acquire the skills I want you to acquire faster. I also want to keep this randomness but you will see how it goes. I don\u0027t want to spoil you the pleasure to discover them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT\u0027S NEW WITH THE NEW PATREON CAMPAIGN? (THESE NEW EXERCISES)\u003cbr\u003eEvery reward has moved, I want as many people to check the exercises I will make on a weekly basis because they will be interesting and should involve a way to make you grow in your French knowledge pretty fast. Some exercises could tease the next video, some can be related to a past one and of course to the current one. Everything is possible but everything will make sense as soon as you will try them. I want them to be very useful for you, I\u0027ll get to that by every means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY SHOULD I SUBSCRIBE ON PATREON?\u003cbr\u003eTo support me as a video creator and because it can really help a lot with your French. I believe that all these rewards can be an interesting way to test your skills: written skills for the exercises, understanding skills with the video commentary of the episode and all of that at once with the Skype conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to see this big community keep increasing and I hope you will like these new coming videos!\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a pleasure to make them for you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay positive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnthony\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are the responses to five of the questions you may be thinking right now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) So does Easy French cost money now?\u003cbr\u003eNo, everything we produce will continue to be free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Why do we need your support? \u003cbr\u003eSo we can dedicate more time to doing what we love: producing Easy French videos for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) On Patreon can I spend more money than I want to without knowing about it?\u003cbr\u003eNo, because you set your maximum amount. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) Can I stop with Patreon at any time?\u003cbr\u003eYes, you can cancel your Patreonsubscription at any time if you no longer have the money nor desire to support Easy French.\u003cbr\u003e"
