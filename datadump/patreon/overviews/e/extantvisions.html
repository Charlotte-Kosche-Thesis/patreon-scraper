Web hosting costs money. Hiring artists and musicians to add colour to this world costs money. Yet as a student in college, money is often in short supply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI intend to keep Lily Ex Machina, Seeking Elysium, as well as any stories that may follow them, completely free of charge. That means no ads.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAds are annoying and often jarring, and run the risk of ruining the immersion for my readers. When I first started the site Extant Visions, I made a promise to myself to never include ads on the site, and I intend to uphold that promise.\u003cstrong\u003e You will never have to worry about ads hogging your bandwidth on Extant Visions. You will never be forced to pay in order to read the story.\u003c/strong\u003e That is my promise to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this promise means that I need to turn to other means to cover the costs of web hosting, and that, dear readers, is where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoyed reading Lily Ex Machina, if you\u0027re enjoying my work on Seeking Elysium, if you think I\u0027ve done a good job, if you find that you want to support my work in some way, please pledge whatever you feel you can. If you don\u0027t want to, that\u0027s fine too; I love you all the same, for being one of my precious readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to enhance this fictive world, a world I find full of potential, and it is my earnest hope that you, my readers, would be willing to help me in achieving this dream.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
