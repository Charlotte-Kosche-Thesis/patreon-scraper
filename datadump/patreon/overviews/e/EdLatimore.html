    "summary": "Thank you to everyone who supports my efforts to reach as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it\u0027s the people on the fringe who can make the greatest difference in the world. I know this because I was once on the fringe. However, I brought myself back from nearly ruining my life. Although my experiences are unique, the lessons I learned from them are universal and can help anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI take what I\u0027ve learned the hard way and break it down so that you can learn it the easy way. I\u0027ve learned:\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eResilience\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eand resourcefulness\u003c/strong\u003e from growing up poor, surrounded by violence and drugs in public housing\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eCompassion and\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eforgiveness\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eof those who hurt me growing up, as well as forgiveness of myself\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eSelf-Control and sobriety\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0from getting through my problems with alcohol\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eDiscipline and strength\u003c/strong\u003e from my heavyweight boxing and time in the military\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eFocus and concentration\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0from studying physics and mathematics in college\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eLeadership and communication\u003c/strong\u003e from my time tutoring and teaching math, science, and boxing\u003cbr\u003e,\u003cbr\u003eI am grateful to have lived a life that has\u00a0not only given me the opportunity to experience these things, but to survive the worst and come back with something to teach. My blog, podcasts, speeches, and books allow me to do this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I create, my goal is to get through to one person on the fringe. Though I may help many more (and I certainly hope to), making a difference to one person has an incredible effect on their world. This one person will hurt fewer people and inspire many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany will read, many will listen, and many will be helped, but I always think of the one person. This focus allows me to craft potent lessons which, counter-intuitively, have a greater effect on all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fringe can be any part of your life where you\u0027re thinking of giving up and just saying \"F*** it!\" This might seem like rock bottom and it might seem like nothing good can come from it, but it\u0027s really where the best material of life is made--IF you survive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to teach you how to survive, thrive, and learn from your mistakes. Most importantly, I want you to learn from my mistakes first--I\u0027ve certainly made enough for the both of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether give a little, a lot, or somewhere in between I am extremely grateful for your support. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart and the depths of my soul."
