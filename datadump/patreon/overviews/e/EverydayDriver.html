Only outside help will allow us to increase our speed without sacrificing the quality of our work. \u00a0We want to create even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat a \"Patron\" does:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a Patron allows you, the most supportive and vocal members of our audience, to have a direct role in the growth of our show. \u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf less than 5% of our audience became patrons, our little show would be revolutionized.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMuch more content.\u003c/strong\u003e The same high quality you\u0027ve come to expect... and even an increase in scale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSelect a support amount. Enjoy your little extras for being a Patron, (such as seeing our reviews before everyone else!) and smile as you see our films come out more frequently. This is a monthly contribution, so as we do more your amount will NOT increase.\u00a0Our videos will remain free to everyone on YouTube - but you will be a vital part in helping \"Everyday Driver\" do much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
