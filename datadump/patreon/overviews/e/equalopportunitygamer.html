I\u0027ve been doing this for a little while with the goal of reaching out to gamers of all stripes who want to hear about issues that affect the gaming community...and some that impact all kinds of communities. As a content creator I\u0027ve recently branched out into live streaming as well. I enjoy entertaining, informing and having discussions with people through my blog and through my streaming. I want this to grow and become bigger, because I think this content matters and I\u0027d like to see it enjoyed by a larger audience. And I think Patreon can help me do that. Your donations will help a young up-start build even more content and reach more people and hope to create an environment where gaming is an equal opportunity for all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"

My goal with this blog is to simply shed some light on certain topics that effect today\u0027s Gaming Industry. Topics that discuss and show the darker side to gaming companies, and how far they may go to make a quick buck off you. These topics will hopefully help you in saving money in the future. Maybe allow you, the consumer, make better choices when purchasing games. Either way, I wish this blog to be a learning experience for everyone. You and I. I\u0027d like to learn how I\u0027m right or wrong on certain topics. If I make a mistake, do not hesitate to correct me. This is my first time doing something like this so by all means, help me help you, and above all, enjoy your time here.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for the support.\u003cbr\u003e",
