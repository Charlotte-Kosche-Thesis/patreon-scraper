    "summary": "Greetings! As a lifelong artist, I draw continuously, for work and for fun. These endeavors span comics, children\u0027s book art, fashion design, animation, novel writing, and sketching live events in New York City and around the country. Every day contains a new adventure, whether it be portrait painting, tabling at a convention, or teaching workshops for kids. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work often focuses on community and interactive elements. \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgcHj-Pdbsg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThis video\u003c/a\u003e includes a few seconds of me sketching the musicians during a theater fundraiser. (Look closely, it goes by fast!) The one above shows how to unfold \u0026amp; refold a small comic/art book. My big project for the fall was writing a novel that I then used as the basis for an illustration installation, part of a group gallery show where I also helped facilitate as assistant curator. Even here on Patreon, my goal is to involve supporters in the creative process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd there\u0027s so much more to come! So please contribute as you can, and watch the artwork evolve via my \u003ca href=\"http://ellesaurarts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://ellesaur.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, and here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003eMany of my smaller projects are made to be given away or shared freely - like bitty books for Free Comic Book Day, or the coloring pages used for public art workshops. Many of my larger projects will eventually become published books, but in the meantime, nobody pays me to make them yet. If you like what you see so far, and the upcoming ideas you\u0027re hearing about, this is a great way to fund them into reality! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat happens then?\u003cbr\u003eThe funds I receive each month will be used in several ways. There are basic supplies that need to be maintained steadily, like sketch cards and brush markers, or printer cartridges, used on a regular basis. There are crises, when my computer or printer needs to be replaced entirely. I now have an art studio that requires monthly rent. The more I can earn here with Patreon, the more I can focus on drawing/writing... and less on running around to a hundred other jobs. Essentially, you\u0027re buying out my time for a bigger more awesome purpose. Also, I believe it\u0027s important to support my fellow artists, and always give something towards furthering the careers and livelihoods my peers, along with encouraging artists of the future. \u003cbr\u003e"
