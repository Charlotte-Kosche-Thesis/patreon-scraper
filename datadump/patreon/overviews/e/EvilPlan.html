Like Kickstarter, you toss money at us, and get some nice perks for your trouble. But unlike Kickstarter, you pay every month, instead of all at once. This way, you can pick a pledge that won\u0027t hurt your wallet too much, and Megan \u0026amp; I can draw a steady income. There\u0027s pledge levels from $1 to $100, since we know that everyone has different levels of dedication, and you can always raise or lower your pledge if you\u0027re feeling generous or if money\u0027s tight. You\u0027ll be charged at the beginning of each month for last month\u0027s updates, and you\u0027ll never be charged more than once a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry, Evil Plan is not being put behind a pay wall. I want everyone to be able to read it for free, forever. If you don\u0027t want to or can\u0027t pledge money, that\u0027s totally fine! You just enjoying what we make has kept us going for eight years. However, Patreon is a way for Megan and I to make a living wage off of Evil Plan. And the more money we make, the more pages of comic we can make, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo whether you want more comics, more perks, or just plain like the idea of helping out Megan and I, thanks for stopping by our Patreon page. And if you\u0027re new to Evil Plan, welcome! You can read over \u003ca href=\"http://www.evilplan.thewebcomic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e500 pages for free right here.\u003c/a\u003e Let\u0027s get chummy.

But we have overhead to consider. Minions need health insurance. Computer needs a bit of an upgrade. At $150 a week, we can bribe the minions to disintegrate anyone asking for health insurance, and we can toss some used parts on Computer. It\u2019ll never know the difference. With these financial considerations out of the way, we can step up production, and deliver two pages of Evil Plan every week.",
