I depict colorful fantasy landscapes and other whimsical scenes inspired nature, magic, and fairytales.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027ve been an artist my whole life, it\u0027s my own personal stress relief system. I have always turned to drawing or painting to express myself. But as an adult, I have become a stay at home mom of two boys (3 and 1 years old), and making art, running an Etsy shop, creating social media content, and making sure my boys have the attention and upbringing they deserve, is a big responsibility. Being a Mom is the most rewarding thing I\u0027ve ever done, and being a painter is second. So I need art to be worth my time, to generate a little income from it in order to justify spending money on art supplies, and taking time out of my busy evenings (and late nights), to paint as a great way to relieve stress and express my true self. I created my Etsy store in Fall 2017, started marketing myself on social media, and now I have a Patreon page. All of these outlets make it possible for me to continue making art, by making a small profit for selling original paintings of all sizes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI would like to be clear, and say that this is not a cry for help, but rather an invitation for you to become a part of all the art that I create, and to encourage me to continue the path that I have chosen as an artist and a full time mother. I will never stop painting, it is who I am at the core and it feels so powerful and freeing to create wonderful, satisfying scenes in my paintings, and to also be able to stay home with my young boys and cherish the time I have with them before they start school and have less time to be young and carefree \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u2665 By becoming a patron you will have my sincere gratitude, as well access to rewards that include, coloring pages, behind the scenes sketches, first looks at new paintings, and more.
