    "summary": "Hello, fellow dungeon delvers and advantageous adventuring-types. It is I, your most beautifully beneficent bard, Ed; hopeless geek and Game Master extraordinaire! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s that? Never heard of me? Well, perhaps you can change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a writer of tales, a teller of stories, and\u00a0a frequent giver of advice. I publish a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsUl3CEuDAbcpUherGwzJ0g\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e blog \u003c/a\u003eabout the delicate art and simple science of running and playing in a tabletop role-playing game, such as Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, Pathfinder RPG, and countless others. I have also started a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsUl3CEuDAbcpUherGwzJ0g\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e YouTube\u003c/a\u003e channel to help spread the word to the hungry masses, but alas, I can only do so much due to time constraints. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I would love to commit more time doing the thing I love, and make it bigger and better than it is. That is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn olden times, we bards often worked on the road, traveling from tavern to tavern, playing for little more than a warm bed and a cold meal. Every bard eventually came to the point where they tired of this lifestyle and sought out a patron to help fund our endeavors. To those patrons, the bards would swear absolute fealty. No one else could buy the bard, sway the bard, or influence the bard.\u003cbr\u003eThey belonged to the patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you to be my patron. Basically what I am saying is, I want to be owned by you. I want you to have say in what I am producing. I want you to see what is coming down the pipeline before anyone else. For pennies a day, you can turn a noble pursuit into something beyond reckoning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does that mean for those who don\u0027t want to become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNadda. I will still produce the same level of content on my blog and YouTube channel for everyone. My goal has been, and always will be to give aspiring players and Game Masters a resource to help them develop their own games, characters, and otherwise improve their overall experience at the table. That won\u0027t end anytime soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mean for those who DO want to become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get perks galore, including live streaming games, Q\u0026amp;A sessions, first looks at all upcoming content, personalized adventures, and of course, my eternal thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy initial goal is $3,000/month. That money will be enough to keep Ed The Bard going for the foreseeable future. But what are the costs? I am glad you asked!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting. \u003c/strong\u003eOne of the goals is to find and maintain a suitable host for the website that can handle the traffic of my loyal Bard-Hards.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOngoing Web Development.\u003c/strong\u003e Websites are like working with magic; sure I know a few cantrips, but I am no wizard. The kind of website my readers deserve requires a technical understanding I do not possess. I could attempt it, but I would rather pay someone that actually knows what they\u0027re doing rather than post a bunch of animated .gifs of dancing hamsters.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003epost \"boosts\". \u003c/strong\u003eWhen a new article or video drops, this ensures that 1/3 to 1/2 of our loyal readers see my smiling face in their News Feeds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMe.\u003c/strong\u003e\n Alas, I am but a simple mortal (though I will never admit it), and I am burdened by simple mortal needs, like eating, clothing (according to a grand jury), and keeping the lights on. Also, I have a wee bardling of my own who likewise needs these things. With enough patrons, I can focus my attentions more on distributing advice and entertainment... and also wearing clothes... for now. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you want to take the journey down this long and twisty rabbit hole with me, become a patron today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRoll well, my friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEd The Bard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
