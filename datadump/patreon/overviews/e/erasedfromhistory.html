I am producing documentaries\nand podcasts of inspirational and little known stories - histories buried, purposely hidden, changed or manipulated. \u00a0I\u0027ve always been in love with telling stories, of learning something new and being inspired by those who make change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eErased \u003c/strong\u003ewill shine a light on the stories of inspiring women, social justice champions, union organizers, environmental warriors and all those who have taken a stand on issues that matter and\u00a0strived to make positive change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a membership platform that makes it easy for creators to get paid- a way for you as a subscriber allow me bring these stories to light. You\u0027ll also join an incredible community of creators, friends, and fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy first project is a personal one. It\u2019s an inspiring\nstory of taking a stand for democracy. My great uncle was one of forty thousand volunteers from over 70\ncountries who made up the International Brigades. The Brigades were formed in 1936 to help the democratically elected Spanish government resist a military coup led by General Franco and supported by Hitler and Mussolini.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e400 volunteers from British\nColumbia\u00a0recognized the threat of fascism and gave up everything -\u00a0\u00a0families, homes and country\nto fight in a war half a world away - \u00a0and they went against Canada\u0027s wishes. \u00a0Canada, along with England, the US, France and many other countries signed a non-intervention treaty prohibiting sending supplies or allowing volunteers to travel to Spain. \u00a0Later, when the flow of volunteers could not be slowed, \u00a0Canada introduced\u00a0the Foreign Enlistment Act making it illegal to volunteer to fight in the war.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon after the Spanish Civil War ended, the Second World War broke out. \u00a0When the International Brigade volunteers returned to Canada instead of being celebrated as\u00a0pre-anti-fascist fighters who recognized the threat of leaders like Hitler, they were ostracized and kept under RCMP surveillance for most of their lives.\u00a0Survivors did not receive government pensions, the dead are not included in Veterans Affairs Canada\u2019s Book of Remembrance,\u00a0and the volunteers are not explicitly mentioned in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn learning about the volunteers stories and journeys it became clear that the documentary and podcast are also a largely a British Columbia labour history\nstory. \u00a0Many of the volunteers were union organizers and participants in BC\u2019s\nturbulent 30\u0027s labour protests including the On to Ottawa Trek, the Ballantyne Pier Riot and the Relief Camp Strike. But above all this is a story of men and women taking a\nstand for what they believed in and uniting in solidarity to support democracy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou are history. You are legend.

But instead of funding a specific project with one lump sum, Patreon allows \"patrons\" to donate small amounts of money on a monthly basis to support the work of people they enjoy and believe in. Those who donate are usually rewarded with Patreon Rewards as a gesture of thanks for their contribution. See the Patreon Reward sidebar at right, \u003cem\u003eand Canadians remember your pledges will be made in American dollars.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e(If you are interested in donating directly please go to the funding page at themacpaps.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
