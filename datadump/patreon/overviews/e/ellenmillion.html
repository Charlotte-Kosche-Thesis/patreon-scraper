    "summary": "I\u0027m pretty much an unstoppable creative force. \u00a0Even as full-time mother of a two-year-old, I manage to blog nearly daily with fun stories about being a mom in Alaska, building my own house, camping and creating. In any given month, I might share a few short stories and poems, sketches, and a finished piece of artwork - whether a simple character study, a complex coloring book page, or a big painting. I write non-fiction for other artists and writers, I manage fun projects like Torn World (a shared science fantasy world), Sketch Fest (a monthly creative jam for visual artists), and Portrait Adoption (an artwork service for people seeking character portraits). I share photographs most days - usually of my (incredibly adorable) daughter, but also of the beautiful places where I live and travel to. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://hotlink.ellenmilliongraphics.com/ellen/examplepages.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron of my work, you\u0027re helping me spend more time on these things. \u00a0Funds will allow me to hire a babysitter for dedicated (non-child-distracted) time. \u00a0You\u0027re giving me gas money to take trips up into the mountains for photographs, and art supplies to keep creating. \u00a0Given the choice between (uncreative) paid freelance projects and things I \u003cem\u003ewant \u003c/em\u003eto create - I\u0027ll be able to pick the latter, without feeling like I\u0027m taking away from my household input.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to express how deeply I appreciate that kind of patronage. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of what I do, I release freely - blog posts, fiction, non-fiction. As a patron, you\u0027re assuring that more of that gets made... and you\u0027ll get a few extra perks! \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also deliver every patron ($1+) something patron-only every calendar month - a poem or story that is otherwise restricted to supporters, a sketch that no one else gets to see, a desktop or wallpaper, a digital stamp to print and color or make cards out of, a walk-through of a piece of artwork, a highly-detailed coloring page, the opportunity to request a piece of artwork - or something else entirely! You can ogle at a complete list of previous perks\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ellenmillion.dreamwidth.org/1569169.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral of the reward tiers also include a discount on all physical publications and original artwork. Shipping is additional, and not subject to the discount. Please contact me to redeem this discount. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn March and September, I will send patrons at $5 a month or more special surprise packages! These packages could have anything - ACEO prints, loose coloring pages, full coloring books, original artwork, cards, bookmarks, magnets, art supplies, stickers... your package will include random gifts and selected goodies. International supporters will receive one package with twice the goodies in September, in order to accommodate the difference in shipping cost.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a fun way to get a wonderful surprise in your mailbox periodically!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also give everyone who follows a monthly round-up of everything else I\u0027ve been doing, with links to my public work and notable blog entries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are lots of other ways to support my work - even if you don\u0027t feel compelled to be a patron, feel free to use the follow button (in the upper right above the title graphic next to the social media buttons) to add my public activity to your feed and keep tabs on what I\u0027m doing!"

At this goal, I will scan one each month (not the whole thing, but definitely a dozen or so key pieces), update my webpage with some of the major missing pieces, and start a spreadsheet to keep tabs one which piece of artwork is where. When we get to this goal, I will also give every patron paying $5+/month an ACEO print of any page of their choice from that month\u0027s sketchbook.",
