I tend to be vocal against harmful tropes especially related to queer representation, such as the \"tragic queers\" or \"bury your gays\" tropes. This however, doesn\u0027t mean that no queer person ever dies or goes through hard and trying times in my stories (we are neither immortal nor immune to harm) - but I try to tell these narratives in a genuine and mindful way, and usually with a light that doesn\u0027t honk at the end of the tunnel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1OzXPWq.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funds raised here go towards supporting other creators, commissioning sensitivity readers, and eventually con costs (for printing, the table, transport, or just travelling to the far away ones in the UK or Canada etc.). So, if you like what I do, and are curious about where I\u0027m going, and you wanna help me get there by supporting me financially, I\u0027ll be eternally grateful and will offer you some content in return! Pledging $1 will get you access to my entire Patreon feed, but of course you are welcome to adjust your pledge to any amount you feel you\u0027d want to throw my way each month - every tiny bit counts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether or not you decide to become a patron, thank you for reading and enjoying my work enough to land you here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WBHPkW9.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
