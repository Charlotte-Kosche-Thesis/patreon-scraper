While I am no professional writer I am confident that my stories could be of interest to a few people online, and this has motivated me to come to Patreon - to be able to work on these projects more and actually finish them. What you can expect from me is a diverse cast of characters, minor fluff and major bummers, straight forward stories and also abstract ones.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI previously made\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hiOi0DgoUw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNach Innen - KF\u003c/a\u003e, wich is my first real animated short film.

It\u0027s a four-part full length movie series in the works with most of the story planned out, but with very little things that could be properly used to actually create these films. More storyboards, re-writing aspects of the story and changing some concepts up is a necessity for these films to work. So the plan is to work on those through the support on Patreon.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut what is Nach Innen about?\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn short, the main character Amy has been an orphan since birth. What happened to her family remains unexplained for unknown reasons, and she just won\u0027t accept this. She\u0027s told that her family is all dead, but that\u0027s all she gets for some reason. But with absolutely zero support around her, she\u0027s grown apathetic and gravely depressed over the years. However one day, she receives\u00a0a letter that goes into such personal topics that it simply has to be from someone that knows Amy, and at the bottom of the letter is the sender - her own mother. This kickstarts Amy\u0027s motivation to go and search for her, starting at a school she was directed to in the letter.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhile this is the \"main\" story arc of Nach Innen, there is another one that you follow alongside it. In the world Amy lives in, a city not far from where she lives was one day suddenly, for the lack of a better word, erased. It was flattened to the ground as if nothing was ever there before but dust. Nobody from the outside is officially allowed to explore this area anymore, except for a almost pathetically small group of scientists called Syringe - a group that won\u0027t stop fighting until they know what actually happened to their old home.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOver the four films, Amy ages from 15 to 19 years old. It\u0027s a story where you see her grow and eventually fall. It goes all over the place and then back again. The intent is to confuse but intrigue, and to be personal. While it won\u0027t be any explicit 18+ content, the themes tend to be more mature and heavily leans on digging into some of the\u00a0darker aspects of love, identity, friendship/relationships, sex and obsession. The more the films develop, the more horror-esqu\u00e9\u00a0themes will be introduced. I would definitely not call this a 100% bummer story though. While some of the humor is kind of...special, there is definitely more heart to it than just depressing themes, even though those would outweigh the more positive aspects of the story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNach Innen Prolouge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn 2012 I made a kinda bad kinetic novel called Nach Innen Prolouge, that would act as just that, a prolouge. It introduced the main character, Amy, and some plot that worked pretty well to introduce viewers into the world she lives in. The things that happen in Prolouge would only be resolved in a much later point in the series, but I love that shit so I will keep that in.\u003cbr\u003eProlouge is split into two sections - the first is where we follow a character that sets out to find out what actually happened in a destroyed city that for some reason nobody is allowed to research to find out what actually happened to it. The second section introduces the main plot of the Nach Innen series, and at the end connects the two sections so the viewer can think about how these two seemingly unrelated parts of the story are actually part of a much bigger plot.\u003cbr\u003eThe short is planned to be between 10-15 minutes long.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eR\u00e9ad\u00fa\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cem\u003eModern day Scandinavia, in a world where the arts of magic and spirits are merely seen as fairy tales and myths, lives a young girl named Thea. Born with the ability of a form of Quantokinesis, she keeps her practices of this power hidden. Then one day, just weeks before her 18th birthday, her best friend is found brutally murdered in his room. The next day, nobody knows of his existence anymore. Desperate for answers, she relies on a homeless man, who seems to know more about her and her powers than he lets on. He takes her to a woman, where she finds out that her friend might not be dead after all, but has been taken by a dark spirit that the woman herself is after. And so, Thea starts her journey to find her friend, and as well, find out what mysteries the world she lives in holds for her, and how she is connected to the Great Spirit - R\u00e9ad\u00fa.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis story takes place in the same universe as Sugar \u0026amp; Massacre and connects the two stories in a few ways. This would be a three-part Visual Novel that is much bigger than S\u0026amp;M, with no adult content but much more elements of magic and mystery that\u0027s not part of our history.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon you\u0027ll be able to see all my WIPS and other things I might post, regardless of when you become a patreon.
