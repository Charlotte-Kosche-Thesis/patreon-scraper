Most of us DO know what we want to do with our lives but don\u0027t believe we can do it, are too scared, or think others don\u0027t believe in us enough and that we are silly to have such dreams so we hide them away to not embarrass ourselves or experience failure, and we say goodbye to our dreams.\u003cbr\u003eI am not ready to do that, and I do not believe I will ever be ready.\u003cbr\u003e This is the first year of my life that I am grabbing my dreams and running with them instead of hiding my magic and talent away as something to be ashamed of, and acting as a girl who doesn\u0027t believe in or deserve dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing songs since I was 6 years old. I have notebooks upon notebooks of heartbreaks and growth twisted into lyrics and melodies and songs that have not only gotten me through the hardest times of my life, but that I hope will help others through the hardest times in theirs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAddressing mental health, trauma, and abuse in my music is something that I have taken on head on so I can be the voice that I needed growing up when I felt I had nobody, to so many other people who are going through their own trials in life and feel alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this moment in time I am writing and recording demos for my first 6 song EP which will be released on iTunes, Spotify and Google Music in the Winter of 2019 but this goal of mine requires support for production and that is where you come in to join me on this journey of making my dreams come true and getting my music out into the world!\u003cbr\u003e"
