    "summary": "We create a weekly podcast sampling some of the best, and occasionally, some of the worst, tabletop RPGs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe felt we could fill the niche of narrative-centric, edited live-play RPG sessions of a variety of different game systems. And also give our opinions, tips and tricks, in the hopes of helping our listeners find a system they love, and help them start their own games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd doing all of that brings us so much joy, and we love doing it. We love doing it so much that we want to bring our listeners more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we\u0027ve reached a threshold of sorts, with podcast hosting, website costs, owning our domain name, equipment, advertising, stuff for give aways, and the time that we dedicate every week to bringing our listeners high value content, we\u0027ve spent all the cash that we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo when a few of our loyal listeners reached out and asked how they could support us (by more than tuning in every week), we found Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough you (our listeners) support and \u003cem\u003epatronage, \u003c/em\u003ewe will be able to bring more and better quality entertainment. And we\u0027re so excited at the prospect of being able to do just that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you already listen and love us, please consider becoming one of our patrons, and if you haven\u0027t checked us out, please do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re able to give or not, know that we love and appreciate you guys so much. And no matter what you\u0027ll hear from us every Tuesday, bringing you the best we have to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3 Addie \u0026amp; Tommy\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
