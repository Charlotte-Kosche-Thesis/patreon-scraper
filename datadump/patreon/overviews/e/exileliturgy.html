There were so many ideas that I had that I knew could not function under the heading of LFDG and so Exile Liturgy was born. The days are still early and this work is just learning to crawl, but my hope is that it will come to be a valuable resource for those wandering whether aimlessly through the wilderness or on some old forgotten path left by a saint, sinner, heretic, or mystic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

He hails from the backwoods of Alabama, and is married to the most wonderful human being he has ever met. Together they have two wild little boys named Judah and Silas, along with their one-hundred pound lap dog named Pugsley (who is afraid of his own shadow). They are currently in the initial stages of launching an ethically sourced lifestyle brand with a concentrated focus on sustainability and activism. In their free time, they are enjoying building a new house for their growing family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eRyan served on the pastoral staff at a local Assembly of God church plant for right at half a decade. He spent a long time thinking he had all the answers, until the day his tiny little evangelical biblical literalist bubble imploded in his face, and left him with more questions than answers. Since then he has been on the slow journey down the ancient paths left by the saints, sinners, heretics, and mystics that make up this wild thing we call The Church. His faith is intact, and he has learned enough to know that He does not know that much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
