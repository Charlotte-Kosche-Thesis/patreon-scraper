    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Jung but most of you will know me as Elyonbeats. I am a musician who produces new age classical to jazzy hiphop beats. I am a starving artist who is also a college student pursuing to become a pharmacist. I have started a Patreon page to ultimately bring better contents and merchandise for my fans. I am unemployed, and to be more clear, I\u0027ve quit my job to work part time musician and a full time student (if that makes any sense). There\u0027s one thing that you cannot expect from being an independent musician: regular income. Some days, my music sales will be up, whereas some days, they\u0027ll be really low. Income I earn from making and selling music always fluctuates and that can be scary, considering I have no idea how well I can sustain myself in the future doing what I love. I found couple of jobs in the past to support myself financially, but I quickly came to realize how miserable I was and how draining \"working\" was. Of course, if music wasn\u0027t a huge part of my life, I would have continued to work (that is part of living, after all). However, considering that I am a full time student, working part time left me with no time for music. I would go to school from morning to early evening, then rush straight to work and come home at night. By this point, I was too exhausted and the only thing I wanted to do was eat and relax / sleep. Music, just like any other art, requires time, emotions, and energy. Juggling school, work, and other life obligations left me with no time and energy to do anything. No energy equated to no emotion, and no emotion led to me being uninspired. So, one day, I\u0027ve decided to do something bold: quit my job and just do music -- having faith and trust in God that He\u0027ll provide. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I am unemployed, it\u0027s hard to support myself. We encourage each other to do something that we love and enjoy, yet when we actually begin to live to that motto, we quickly come to realize how hard that lifestyle really is. That\u0027s where you guys come in. Just by donating $1 per video, you guys will be helping me out by a lot. More funding means more quality contents! I will be able to continue my education and creating music for you guys without having to stress over finance. I value and cherish every one of my supporters. When you support me financially, I no longer see you as fans, but rather, friends (that was super corny). But on the real, it\u0027s really hard for me to associate someone who supports me financially a \"fan.\" I consider you guys as my friends and feel free to talk to me and keep in touch!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support me, there are some awesome perks that comes with it! Donating just $1 per video can unlock you a free download to the beat featured in that specific video. All the information you need regarding perks are provided on the right side. Check them out and become my super awesome patron today!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne love and God bless!\u003cbr\u003eBelow are some FAQ!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eI make beats! :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZRvKwcISxM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What is this Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is a crowd-funding online platform, similar to Kickstarter. However, instead of donating a massive sum of money for one huge project, people can support artists by becoming a patron and donating a dollar or two per video created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Why should I become a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e There\u0027s really no reason for you to become my patron except that you believe in my music, it has helped you in some way, you enjoy my music and want to show your appreciation, financially. Please don\u0027t feel pressured to become my patron. If you can afford to become my patron, please consider it. However, if you are not in any position to become my patron, no worries!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What is your favorite food?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e I enjoy Sushi and any Italian pasta dishes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Where is my money going?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Excellent question.

VIDEOS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOfficial music videos, live acoustic videos, vlogs, tutorials, you name it--I want to make them all for you!

GEARS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGear upgrades such as monitors, mics, interface, instruments, and many more. All these play a big role in bringing you guys quality contents. Not only that, it opens up more opportunities for me to try doing new things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. SCHOOL\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes, I am a college student who has to work to pay my tuition, books, and supplies like every other college students. I am currently unemployed to work on music while being a full time student. Because consistent, regular income, is a luxury that not many artists can afford, it\u0027ll mean a lot to me if I knew you are supporting me financially. With your support, I can mainly focus on creating music and bringing more merchandise for you guys (CDs, Shirts, Vinyls, etc.).\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. MERCHANDISE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI know many have been wondering about my merchandise for awhile now. Producing merchandise can cost a lot of money, so I am in need of you guys\u0027 help. Your money will go into producing merchandise.

You guys have always been there supporting me. It\u0027s amazing how far I\u0027ve come with music. None of this would have been possible without you guys. With that being said, I wish to emphasize on one small thing: please give what you can, and if you cannot give, that is absolutely fine with me. Continue to enjoy my music and share them with people around you. Sharing my music and telling me that you really enjoy them helps me more than you can imagine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
