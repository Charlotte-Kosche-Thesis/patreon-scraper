Together with my partner Noelia Justiniano, we are working on creating a more compassionate community for animals and humans in Tanzania.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Every Living Thing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery Living Thing (ELT) works to improve the lives of animals in Tanzania. Our aim is to work together with local governments to help enforce the current Animal Welfare Act (2008) while educating the communities, including rural communities, on the rights and welfare of all animals. The \"ELT Center\" is the base of our rescue, rehabilitation and rehoming programs, education, community outreach and population control initiatives. Our expert team includes animal behaviourists, international and local veterinarians, trainers and dedicated community members.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThe Powerful Bond Between Humans And Animals\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIn this developing country, there is sometimes little to no empathy left to spare for animals. Teaching kids to have compassion and empathy for furry, feathered, and finned friends is vital for preventing cruelty to animals as well as in raising them to respect and treat those who are different from them with kindness. Children trained to extend justice, kindness, and mercy to animals become more just, kind, and considerate in their relations to each other. Teaching our kids to respect and protect even the smallest and most despised among us (in Tanzania dogs and cats are seen as dirty and diseased) is one of the most important life lessons that we can pass along to them. It helps them learn to value one another\u2014and it prevents violence. Animals as pets can also help children who are experiencing hardship and act as a form of therapy. Sometimes an animal may be the only source of unqualified, unearned affection that some children ever have.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWe believe in creating positive opportunities between humans and animals, especially in children. The ripple effect that occurs when you teach a child compassion is sometimes greater than we can imagine. Education is the most powerful tool we have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eThe Need\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEGLECT AND ABUSE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. In Tanzania, the loving dog or cat culture is largely absent. Animals are often fated to a cruel, if not short, life. Abandoned and left to fend for themselves, animals are mistreated by some who don\u2019t realize that animals, like humans, are sentient beings.We believe in creating positive interactions between humans and animals in an effort to eliminate fear-based cruelty.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGUARD DOGS\u003c/strong\u003e.

On average, we rescue anywhere between 25-40 new animals a month.

ELT supports humane efforts to deter wildlife from entering villages, disrupting farming and preying on livestock. For example, erecting chilli pepper fences or installing behives in an attempt to protect crops against elephants and also help save the lives of elephants, who are on occasion killed due to human-elephant conflict. Cattle can fall a prey to lions and other wildlife, causing villagers or Maasai to attack and kill. Monkey\u0027s are also often targeted by people as they are seen as pests who can get into their homes, eat their food and even steal. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eILLEGALLY TRAFFICKED WILDLIFE.\u003c/strong\u003e Dar es Salaam is a major transport hub of illegally traficked wildlife.

Every animal in our care is seen by the wonderful vets who ensure we are heading medically in the right direction for the animal. Every animal in our care is also dewormed, vaccinated, spayed and neutered.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe don\u0027t believe in keeping dogs in kennels (only for sleeping) and therefore when we have upwards of 40 to 50 dogs in our care, we need to get creative with our space. We need to build spaces at our center that not only ensures their safety but also keeps their activity level up. We focus on training and the rehabilitation of every dog. Raising well balanced and social dogs who can be easily adopted by families.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebuy food for 60+ animals in our care is quite expensive. We live in Tanzania, Africa, where everything is imported and thus prices are sometimes 2 or three times the normal price. We also make our own dog food daily.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTrap-Neuter- Release program. We are on the streets each day with a very active T-N-R program which reduces the amount of animals born on the streets of Dar.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay for transport for baby monkeys in our care to get up to our partner wildlife sanctuary in Kilimanjaro.
