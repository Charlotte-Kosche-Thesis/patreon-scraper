    "summary": "Hello fellow art-lovers, my name is Elizabeth Blue and I am an artist and educator living and working in Eugene-Springfield, Oregon. I have been working towards being a full-time artist since... well, really, my whole life... but I took the leap to say farewell to day-jobs that were sucking the life out of my art practice and fully commit myself to my craft and to making this crazy \"starving artist\" trope a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eActually, I don\u0027t believe in that. I know, through experience and by the pioneering spirit of intrepid artist before me, that there are a myriad of ways that creatives like myself make a living for themselves and that it why I am fully immersed not only in my own art and business but also in my teaching (Mark Makers Club) where one of my main goals is helping kids learn that being an artist full-time is not just a crazy dream but can be a viable business and important part of living fully.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis concept of \u003cem\u003eliving fully\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0extends beyond the message I wish to pass on to my students in regard to their own art. Within my art, there are common threads of the stickier, darker aspects of living. Many of these themes are drawn from archetype, especially the myriad forms of the Wild Woman,\u00a0\u00a0and fairy tales (particularly Grimms, of course). I believe that the bold confrontation and even embrace of the darker aspects of life, especially a relationship with Death, grief, struggle, shadow, make\u0027s one\u0027s experience of life richer and more gorgeous... not simply more \"morbid\" as you might expect! I refer to this philosophy, which is so integral to my art, as\u00a0\u003cem\u003edark optimism\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo where does Patreon come in? Well, being an artist- not to mention running a teaching outfit all by myself, has expenses and (hence starving artist trope) can be actually really challenging to carry on. For me, I regularly cover my studio space rent, workshop space upkeep and supplies, multiple websites, childcare (yep, I have a kid who\u0027s mama is an artist... and that actually feels really important to me), so much freakin paper, pens, ink, paints, framing costs, and more. \u003cbr\u003eBy pledging even the smallest amount per month, you are being a true patron to the arts and I thank you for taking the time to check out my page. As this page grows, I will be regularly posting new exclusive content, for patrons eyes only, which will invite you right in to my studio and day to day process.\u00a0"
