     "about": "Hi everyone. \n\nMy name is Dan G. I stream PC games daily from the East Coast of Canada in a small town outside of Halifax. \n\nI stream nightly during the week and during the day on weekends. I don\u2019t have a fixed schedule so come by and take a peek anytime. I am currently streaming  games that I enjoy and I am open to new ideas. If there is a game you would like me to play leave a comment below.\n\nMy intent is to provide original, fun, family friendly content that is interesting and professional. I strive to improve my live streams and to provide my viewers with the best quality content possible. If you like my channel or would like to support me as a creator please check out the links in video descriptions for ways to show your support.\n\nI\u2019m beginning to develop my brand EastCoastThing. We\u2019re all about light heated fun, but we\u2019re also focused on giving back to the local community through fundraising and collecting food and clothes for charities.",
