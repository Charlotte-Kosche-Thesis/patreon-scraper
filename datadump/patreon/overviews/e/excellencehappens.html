We have gone on to successfully produce more staged readings, all to raise money for nonprofits in our area that are here to make whole what has been broken. After our five year anniversary, we rebranded our organization as an Entertainment Arts company, setting a new five-year plan in motion with a new look, new ideas, and new goals to achieve. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur mission is Excellence.
