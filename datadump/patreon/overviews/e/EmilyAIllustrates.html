Story-telling has always been at\nthe center of my work and writing became the natural next step for me in order\nto begin sharing all the stories I want to tell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOf course being an art teacher and an artist often does not\nproduce a livable budget and this Patreon is to help me fund my basic necessities\nwhile I write. (Things like food, rent, the ability to sleep at night)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCurrently I have two big book projects I\u2019m working on both\nof which are nearing completion.
