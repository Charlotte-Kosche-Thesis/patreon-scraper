We started this podcast a year and a half ago and we absolutely love getting together, having fun with each other and interacting with you guys, our listeners (aka Headites) and we will continue to do so for as long as we can! Our shows run a lot longer than most podcasts do and usually clock in over three hours. We spend money buying and renting a lot of movies for review and are also planning on shooting our movie as soon as we can come up with the funds for travel, equipment and everything associated with it, Our show has always been free and it always will be but we can definitely use any financial help that we can get. We noticed a lot of other podcasts in this field are doing the same and we hesitated at first but ultimately decided that you guys wouldn\u0027t think any less of us if we asked for some support from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon gives us that chance and we sincerely hope you guys can understand our reasons and we appreciate anything you can pledge on a monthly basis. I think we\u0027ve come up with some good perks for now and if we can build this thing we have even bigger plans in the future that we\u0027re sure you will all love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading through this and we really love you all!"

We would love to be able to give away shirts, mugs, stickers, and other horror swag to you guys! This is hopefully just the beginning and we have a lot of cool and fun stuff planned in the future. If this takes off we can also start having certain content on this page that is exclusive for subscribers. Right now we are all new at this but whatever we do will be stuff you guys love an appreciate.\u003cbr\u003eThanks again from all of us!",
