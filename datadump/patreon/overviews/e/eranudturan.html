Eran ud Turan is the world\u0027s only living history group reconstructing the culture of the Sogdians, Sasanians, Bactrians, and surrounding cultures on the Silk Road. What started off as an exploration of his own past turned into a fully fledged living history society, complete with arms and armour, food, language and writing, and much more. We bring world history to life in a spectacular and colourful way, allowing visitors to get a real idea of life in ancient and early medieval Central Asia and Iran.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy these particular cultures? Many of our members have ancestry going back to the greater Iranian world, which really took shape in late antiquity as a cultural unit and exported aspects of its art, ritual, and culture across the globe. We seek to recreate that old culture. We fell in love with the murals at Panjakent, Afrasiab, Varakhsha, among others, as soon as we saw them, as well as the wonderfully preserved silk brocades from across the Silk Road. Also, the food.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOUR DISPLAYS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/dy7suw/patreon_sword_banner.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eReplica Sasanian sword, decorated with embossed feather motif, 6th - 7th Centuries\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe have had the priviledge of working across the UK and Europe, from stately homes and castles, to museums, to university events.
