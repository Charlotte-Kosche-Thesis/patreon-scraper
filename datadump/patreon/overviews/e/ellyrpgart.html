As you can see, I am an artist, and also an avid gamer. I often make portraits, maps, or other drawings for my GMs, and I\u0027ve been sharing some of these to other gamers in case they\u0027re of use to anyone in their own games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe purpose of this Patreon is two-fold:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I want\u003c/strong\u003e: To practice my art skills and improve as an artist while enriching the role-playing community. Also, money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you want\u003c/strong\u003e: RPG resources and art that you don\u0027t have the time, energy, overly expensive software, or years of drawing classes required to create.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nThe Artwork\u003c/h2\u003eEverything done for the Patreon is free, under the \u003ca href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAttribution/Non-Commercial Creative Commons license\u003c/a\u003e. You don\u0027t have to become a patron to have access to it. None of this is dependent on whether you patronize my work. Patronage simply exists as a way to support my efforts, which makes it easier for me to keep producing art. This also means you can feel free to pledge whatever amount you want, and not be restricted by the pledge levels listed. You can donate half a cent per artwork, and I will be grateful, although the accountants at Patreon will probably get pretty cross.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cq9nTDixiQI/U0bHnufBUEI/AAAAAAAAVjM/xErc4QWo_Fg/w472-h587-no/hezrou1.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Patronage\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe goal is to produce 2-3 pieces of artwork per week, with more or less depending on how busy I am and other factors. You only get charged when I release a map or piece of artwork, so even if I wind up producing nothing one month, your wallet will be none the worse off for your patronage. You can also cap how much you\u0027re willing to spend on your patronage per month, so even if I go overboard in a burst of artistic excess, you won\u0027t bankrupt your budget. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also intend to have a request list polled from my patrons. Those who give at least one dollar per artwork get to make a request every month, and every additional dollar allows for an additional request. I want to stress that this is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e a commission (which are much more expensive), and there is no guarantee that the picture will be exactly what you wanted, or that I\u0027ll even get to it at all. But I do intend to try to draw from the request list as often as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you pledge under $1 in a month, it will accumulate month-to-month until it reaches $1, at which point you will be charged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-woFD64hFLdk/UnL1BL2G-ZI/AAAAAAAAKuQ/NMNjJck4tkQ/w443-h587-no/first+map1+copy.jpg\"\u003e"
