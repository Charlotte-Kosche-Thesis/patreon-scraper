I\u0027m so excited\nto use this platform to connect with you on a deeper level! This place is for\nthose of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to support what you love to do, be outdoors!

I truly appreciate that in itself. But if\nyou feel like contributing more, it\u0027ll all go back into video production and\nthe costs that go with that.  Also, it will go into creating training\nproducts for my community and my new book which I\u0027m working on right now.  \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n Your contribution allows me to bring more value to you.

     "about": "Les Johnson has been on a quest since childhood, a quest that has honed his skills as an outdoorsman and given him a rich life pursuing his true passion predator hunting. Hunting for me is not just shooting predators or other animals. It\u0027s about getting away from the stresses of life and away from my everyday schedule and being able to be out in God\u0027s country. It\u0027s about being in the serenity and quiet of the outdoors by myself or with my buddies. No hunting experience is the same and it\u0027s challenging. It recharges my batteries. \u003cbr\u003eI love sharing my hunting and fishing knowledge with you.  I am best known for coyote hunting and predator calling but I enjoy all kinds of hunting and fishing. Welcome to my Patreon page, now... Let\u0027s Get Outdoors!  \u003cbr\u003e",
