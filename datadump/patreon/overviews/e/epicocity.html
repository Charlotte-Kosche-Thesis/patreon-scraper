    "summary": "My goal as a writer is to create engaging stories from many genres that many people can enjoy, from action to mystery to romance. I\u0027ve started with writing fanfiction\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2121590/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e I also plan on writing original fiction, which I have a strong idea on, but have yet to have put down to paper, as it were. I also really like nurturing and helping new writers that have a gift and great potential!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy use Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m really trying to be a professional, well-known writer. For the foreseeable future, though...well, that hasn\u0027t worked out. I\u0027d like to use Patreon to support me, not only for less worries on my plate but to help interact with my fans even more and help push me further into the role of a better writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s your general schedule? Why should I support you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI work very hard to have a consistent update schedule. With my current Ancienverse, I post three times a week (Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday). With original fiction, my writing process will likely slow. But I really love writing and crafting these worlds or building them. It\u0027s great fun, especially to weave a theme into every one of my works. I\u0027d love support to keep up this pace and give me encouragement for my future works, ensuring a consistent level of quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else to share?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor my patrons I\u0027d love to provide lots of little things, from conceptual ideas for my stories, to outlines, summaries, even early (if unedited) chapters! On top of that, I\u0027d like to share some blog posts that I may not quite make public right away, or even writing tips and little lessons for those who want them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope I can prove myself a writer worthy of your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDare to Be Silly,\u003cbr\u003eEpicocity"
