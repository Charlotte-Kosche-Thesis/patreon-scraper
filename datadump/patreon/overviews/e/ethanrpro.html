Youtube has quickly become the solution to that \u0027void\u0027 I\u0027ve always had and given me a way to communicate with the world! This is where I draw my passion and dedication from and continue to even after 2 years of being a content creator, I suppose I can just proudly say \"Ill be here for a long time\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make Youtube my full time job and I\u0027m well on my way now, Patron will be a bonus towards that goal but used exclusively to upgrade equipment and fund several content endeavours I have planned.\u003cbr\u003e"

If everyone thinks \"I\u0027m only 1 view it won\u0027t matter\" then we won\u0027t get anything in return for our work and if your currently on Patreon then I know you believe we should receive something for our work. I personally don\u0027t run adblock on Youtube but I also totally understand people who just want to watch, without long non-skippable ads getting in the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently release 1-2 videos a day, meaning if I was to release my maximum amount of vids everyday and you watched them all, it would only be 60 views. Donating $1 a month to me here on Patreon is actually giving me more money a month then viewing all my content would! which is honestly abit crazy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you for all your support!",
