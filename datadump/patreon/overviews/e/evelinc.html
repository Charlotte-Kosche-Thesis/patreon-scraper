    "summary": "Greetings, and thank you so much for considering to support me. My name is Nick, I\u0027m a 26 year old content creator, with a passion for giantesses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of this, I\u0027ve been working on giantess related renders for the longest time, many of which you can find on my\u00a0Deviant Art\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3D art is a hobby, that i have been very passionate about for years. Although I have my ups and downs, it\u0027s something that I always return to, and take pleasure from making. I love the art, the community for which i make it, and I would like to continue giving as much as I possibly can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also why I want to keep my art as free as possible. However, I do also wish to grow as an artist. I think that the ideal middle ground for that, is to start on patreon. I do not wish to keep my content behind a paywall. However, if you are willing to give a small amount each month, that would help me out so much, that I want to give something in return. Please keep in mind that this is not a promise to create more content on a steady basis; Unfortunately, due to real life obligations, I am not able to spend as much time on 3D as I once could. However, I will try my absolute best to release as much content as I possibly can, and with as much interaction as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, Thank you so much for your interest in supporting my creativity. I hope, and promise, that I will do my best not to disappoint! :D"
