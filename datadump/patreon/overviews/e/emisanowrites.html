    "summary": "Hi everyone! My name is Emi Sano and I\u0027m a writer for screenplays and short stories. I have been writing since I was a young girl with a huge imagination. I went to college for film and graduated from the screenwriting track program. Since then, a couple of my scripts reached finals in a few screenwriting competitions and I\u0027ve been freelancing as a screenwriter and production work. Recently, I\u0027m going back to my roots by writing short stories and novellas. I am\u00a0blogging about my writing journey and posting excerpts of my stories and scripts on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I will become a full-time writer and be able to pay for submissions, productions, and self-publishing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you will receive first access to my blog posts, sneak previews to what I\u0027m currently working on, and full access to the rest of my short stories and novellas. I will work hard every day to make sure you receive your content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommission: I\u0027m trying something new and can\u0027t wait to work with you!
