For example, the first episode might be you loading in last and finding that they\u0027ve picked 3 hard carries and a mid, and you have to decide to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA.) Pick a support.\u003cbr\u003eB.) Pick another carry.\u003cbr\u003eC.) Pick another mid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd each decision creates 3 new videos that end with 3 more decisions that etc etc and so on and so forth. You can see how this project could get really big. Let\u0027s see it made.",
