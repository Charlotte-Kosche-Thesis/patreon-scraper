It\u0027s you.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently make Youtube videos with snatches of my time in between working and my other hobbies which include: working, managing a Mexican drug empire, and working. The second one arguably counts as work also, but what can I say; work you love is a hobby, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would prefer to make Youtube videos with not just my free time but my working time. As in, I\u0027d like to do it as a job. With more time, I can put out better, more depressing, and hopefully slightly - though not very - funny content. This will include: more dick jokes, more dick jokes, and a great deal of exposition about my opinions on Faye Reagan. Which are numerous. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in Eastern Europe and currently own: one pair of trousers, a shoe, and a snapped pencil called Tim. I saved up for some time to buy Tim and I\u0027m quite worried about using him too often as he will wear down and I will be forced to invest my life savings in some kind of obscure new technology such as a pen. That is, if I\u0027m going to do this full-time, I need almost nothing to live on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere are some things I would like to do, with investment from you, a kind Patreon donater and person with literally no taste whatsoever:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA video about British mating strategies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA video about the life-extending benefits of taking cocaine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnboxing videos of small nuclear warheads.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA tour of Queen Elizabeth II\u0027s bedroom, while she reclines in bed and I drink her tea and touch her stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA cover version of Total Eclipse of the Heart played entirely on the Belgian noseflute.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s the long and short of it, homeboy.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was young I wanted to be a musician, but I\u0027m terrible at piano. So I decided to be a writer. I was atrocious at writing. I got a little older. Youtubing seems to be going all right. And by all right I mean mediocre content and angst.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI would like to do more of it, and better.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best and thanks for letting me waste your time,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith undying love and a little passive-aggressive resentment,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEx\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
