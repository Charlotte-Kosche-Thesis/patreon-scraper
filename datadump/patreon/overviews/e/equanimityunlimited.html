    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Kirsten Carroll and I am the mindfulness coach behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.equanimityunlimited.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEquanimity Unlimited\u003c/a\u003e. Thanks for coming and checking out the Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Equanimity Unlimited?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027m so glad you asked! Equanimity Unlimited (e/u) is the vehicle by which I provide mindfulness teachings. As a mindfulness coach, I teach meditation, breath work, and other practices that can help you decrease stress, increase compassion, and improve your life. I specialize in helping beginners start their practice, but I also am happy to help those with experience to dig deeper. Please see more on my\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.equanimityunlimted.com/faq/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebpage FAQ\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat is Patreon? How are you using it?\u003c/h4\u003e\nPatreon is kind of like Kickstarter except that instead of funding one big project, you can provide monthly ongoing funding. \u00a0In the case of e/u, your monthly contribution gets you access to certain things based on the evel and as long as you continue to contribute, I will continue to provide! In fact, I am looking forward to providing more in the future as this grows. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis platform also allows for plenty of interaction. I hope that you\u0027ll find it opens up a bit of community to each of us through comments, virtual meditation sessions, and more. By contributing on an ongoing basis, you receive not only the rewards listed, but you also help make it possible for new resources to be produced and for me to focus more of my time toward that end.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePatron Level FAQs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHow do the virtual sits work and what\u0027s the benefit?\u003c/h4\u003eFor now, the virtual sits will be held privately on Periscope (so please send your username when you pledge). I will lead you through a meditation practice, sometimes with a particular focus or breath practice included. Virtual sits are great because you can receive a lot of the benefits of community practice (space holding, support, etc) as well as a regular sit that holds you to some accountability and hopefully also inspires you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow are recorded meditations delivered? Do I get to keep them forever?\u003cbr\u003eRecorded meditations are housed on Soundcloud. Every week, a new private URL will be sent out. The URL will expire each week when a new meditation comes out, but you\u0027ll have the option with each one to download or stream it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat do individual sessions include?\u00a0If I live in Columbus, can my individual session be in-person? \u003c/h4\u003eThe individual sessions are up to you These can include personal guided meditation, breath work, reiki, yoga, or any combination. We\u0027ll make it fit your needs.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you live in Columbus, it is possible to have these as in-person rather than virtual sessions. This is dependent on scheduling. You can\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://equanimityunlimited.com/contact/\"\u003econtact me\u003c/a\u003e for more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWill you add different reward levels? Can I still work with you outside of Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI very much want feedback from the community and people as to what they need to help them start meditation and mindfulness practices, continue them, and dig into them. I will create new reward levels or adjust them as needed based on this feedback. If there is something that you want to do outside of what Patreon has listed (especially more individual instruction), please\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.equanimityunlimited.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econtact me\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat if I can\u0027t afford to contribute but still want access to offerings?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI continue to be dedicated to the idea that these practices should be accessible to everyone.\u00a0If you are interested in any offerings, but your situation prohibits contribution, please\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.equanimityunlimited.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003econtact me\u003c/a\u003e.\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e"
