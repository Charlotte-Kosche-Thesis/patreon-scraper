    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElwood City Limits is the episodic Arthur podcast, taking a look at the classic 1990s PBS Kid\u0027s series on a weekly(ish) basis, since 2016. Will Young and Lucas Mancini are your hosts on the journey through one of their favorite shows, with lots of stops along the way to wax nostalgic, quote rap lyrics, and bust each other up laughing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to thank our listeners for helping to make the production of the podcast so much fun, and giving us a tremendous reason to continue on this journey through your support and love. A few of our listeners have asked if we would ever get a Patreon, and for a long time, the answer was no. Here\u0027s why we\u0027ve decided to change our minds, and what this Patreon is looking to do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a way for our listeners to give back to us, if they feel they want to. There is no minimum amount required, we want to emulate a pay-what-you-want model, for what you personally feel we deserve. A donation is in no way required to be a listener or fan of our podcast; \u003cstrong\u003eELWOOD CITY LIMITS WILL ALWAYS BE FREE\u003c/strong\u003e. A donation to us will get you a weekly on-air shout-out for your generosity, and a fond place in our hearts. Unfortunately, we are not able to offer any additional content or merchandise at this time, due to our individual schedules and work commitments; however, if you can think of any additional rewards you would like to see us give out to patrons, please contact us and let us know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever wanted to give us something for the work we do (and yes, ECL does involve quite a bit of work), then this is the page for you!"
