At the same time, the community of players has become a group I consider friends, and their participation in the development of the game is important to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though the development work is basically free, there are a number of expenses that I have been paying out of my own pocket: Hosting fees, domain registration costs, computer hardware and software, and the occasional game conference attendance all add up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2014, I have invested more heavily into Eressea to create more games for more players. Please help me with that, and take a moment to become a patron of the game by agreeing to make a small monthly donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
