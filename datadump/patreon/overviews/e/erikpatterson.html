    "summary": "THANK YOU for visiting my Patreon page! I\u0027m a screenwriter \u0026amp; playwright. I\u0027ve created this Patreon page to help support my plays. I\u0027ve loved theater since I was first introduced to it as a child. There\u0027s something about sitting in a dark theater with a group of strangers, watching actors bring a play to life, that\u0027s thrilling, dangerous, exciting, and inspiring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been an \"emerging\" playwright for awhile now. I\u0027ve had eight plays produced in Los Angeles, and have grown a loyal following out here. The Los Angeles Times calls me a \"veteran theater provocateur,\" but I haven\u0027t yet had my New York theater debut. It\u0027s time to change that. I\u0027m ready for my work to be seen on a larger national stage, and I\u0027m working hard to make that happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s my cue for the \"here\u0027s where you come in\" bit: I\u0027m here on Patreon to ask for your help commissioning my next play. (Here are some stats from American Theatre Magazine on playwriting commissions:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.americantheatre.org/2014/12/10/paying-playwrights-more-than-play-money/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePaying Playwrights More Than Play Money\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0recently produced a reading of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erikpatterson.org/press\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy critically-acclaimed play\u003c/a\u003e ONE OF THE NICE ONES in New York City, and it went very well. I\u0027d like to schedule several more trips to continue introducing the NYC theater community to my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write dark and twisty plays that explore the human condition with humor and pathos. In\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erikpatterson.org/plays/tonseisha\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTonseisha\u003c/a\u003e, a woman falls in love over and over again, as she tries to make sense of her father\u0027s suicide. In\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erikpatterson.org/plays/yellow_flesh__alabaster_rose\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYellow Flesh/Alabaster Rose\u003c/a\u003e, a family fractured by abuse finally comes back together to heal. In\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erikpatterson.org/plays/sick\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSick\u003c/a\u003e, a mother crippled by hypochondria must let go of her imagined illnesses when her child is diagnosed with leukemia. In\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erikpatterson.org/plays/i_wanna_hold_your_hand\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI Wanna Hold Your Hand\u003c/a\u003e, strangers who meet in a hospital waiting room make immediate bonds as they help their loved ones recover from traumatic brain injuries. In\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erikpatterson.org/plays/he_asked_for_it\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHe Asked For It\u003c/a\u003e, a man chooses to infect himself with a disease in an irrational attempt to get closer to the man he loves. In\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erikpatterson.org/plays/sex_lives_of_strangers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Sex Lives of Strangers\u003c/a\u003e, an agoraphobic woman befriends an online escort, with devastating consequences for her entire family. In\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erikpatterson.org/plays/one_of_the_nice_ones\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOne of the Nice Ones\u003c/a\u003e, a paraplegic woman plays outrageous power games with her boss to get the money for an operation she desperately wants. The common thread throughout my work is characters in crisis who take extreme measures to get what they need.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support would help me write my next play and it would help me get my work seen by those important theaters and producers in New York.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo find out more about my work, you can go to my playwriting website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.erikpatterson.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e. If you\u0027d like to be an ANGEL BACKER and back an entire production of a play, feel free to contact me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\u00a0please watch the video above to hear some actors talking about The Echo Theater production of ONE OF THE NICE ONES, which won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Playwriting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. I have a patron who\u0027s willing to make a matching donation with the first backer who signs on for the \"Broadway production\" level of patronage."
