    "summary": "With much encouragement from my own two (extremely supportive) teens, I am looking to make more time and space to do my art. \u00a0Among many of my jobs and passions I studied marine biology from an early age through college, but alas, no formal degree as I got sidetracked with a career path in architectural drafting for about a decade, and then on to other pursuits. However, marine biology has always remained a steadfast obsession!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy focus with this current project is to continue my journey of painting and documenting all species of dolphins and whales on our sweet planet, interspersed with few other magical sea creatures (especially turtles/tortoises \u0026amp; cephalopods), in the hope of continuing to educate and enlighten others to these beautiful beings. \u00a0As a single income, self-employed mom... I gladly and gratefully work as a painting contractor by day. \u00a0Yes, I paint houses, interior and exterior, for a living! \u00a0My training and artistic abilities mainly come from observations that were developed from my earliest memories as I watched and learned from my own artist father. Classes throughout high school, college and beyond influenced my personal direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is to spend my quieter winter work months focused on doing small and large scale paintings focusing on the more unusual and unknown species. \u00a0I am constantly asked if I have prints of my work and I want to make sure some of the funds are funneled to my being able to make cards and prints, which are much more affordable, and thus have the ability to reach a much broader audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am terribly camera shy, but will be posting in-progress videos of my process and background of why I chose a particular subject matter. \u00a0You, my wonderful patrons, will be first in line to receive signed prints, giclees (if I go that route, depending on demand) and one of my main goals as a HUGE THANK YOU for your support is to have a drawing for one or more of my original paintings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be predominately focused on creating my works in oils, and will be exploring smaller pieces in encaustics (which is painting with heated beeswax mixture vs. painting with any other type of medium). \u00a0During this journey, I will be posting in-progress videos of how I create an encaustic painting because it is such a beautiful medium to work in and is a mystery to most people on how it is done!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and I hope you will walk this journey with me!"
