    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome! If this is your first time here I recommend you read the \"core concept\" posts in order, starting with the first question. These posts define many expressions and ideas used in other posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreetings friends! Thank you for taking the time to check out this site and find ways to better your life. Few people actually take the time to do anything about their situation and instead remain victims to the random chaos of life. Just by being here you are already taking a step toward moving out of that into a life that can be rich and fulfilling where you can reach your goals!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Joshua, former counselor with a master\u0027s degree and over a decade of experiencing helping people just like you. For a long time, even with everything I had learned from Psychology, I still struggled with many things I wanted to do in life. School has a way of giving us knowledge, but never showing us how to apply it. When I first started I couldn\u0027t help but notice that many of these \"self-help\" books and programs mostly do the same thing, give you \"Our way to do one thing\".\u00a0 Your mind is not something so simple that a single tweak is going to fix everything and make your whole life better. That would be like saying if I gave you a wrench you could fix anything under the hood of a car. This site is about meta-cognition (thinking about thinking) and explores how your mind works. The goal is to give you all the meta-cognitive tools to help you find success and to even help you learn how to build your own custom tools that work best for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this site and it\u0027s contents are valuable to you or someone you know please consider joining our work here. Even if you only share this page with your friends on social media you could make a big difference in someone\u0027s life. I can write and create all day, everyday, but if what I write doesn\u0027t reach someone that it can help then it doesn\u0027t mean a thing. So whether you can contribute financially or through sharing these tools with people who need them I am grateful to you and your support of this project!\u003cbr\u003eFor a dollar a month you can get access to bonus articles that I have spent hours researching and condensing the information down into something easy to use. Most of my articles are either written from material in college text books and the latest published research to other self-help books. Every week I give you articles that are summations of much larger amounts of information minus all the anecdotal evidence that makes reading take such a long time.\u003cbr\u003eYour financial contributions will go toward improving content on this site as well as reducing the time I spend each month picking up extra work so I can create even more content, including writing e-books(that get to the point and don\u0027t spend half the time selling you their system) and creating apps to help manage your life. It will also go to help pay for the books I read to stay on top of the latest studies in the field of human psychology. Half of my work time for this project every week is just reading books and new studies. The more materials I can get and the more time I have to process it equals more condensed material for you so you can get the life you want now. So again, thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePost descriptions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBelow is a list of post types and what they offer so you know what tier of support (if any) best suits you and your needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eShifting Gears\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA bimonthly post encouraging observation of various aspects in life to help you notice things you either want to incorporate into your life or avoid. These are essentially like the assignments and challenges at the end of a normal post without the two pages of exposition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003ePsych Ex\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA monthly post on the 20th giving you an advanced tool from psychology to help manage your focus or state. These also avoid excessive exposition and will include a few examples of application.\u003cbr\u003e"
