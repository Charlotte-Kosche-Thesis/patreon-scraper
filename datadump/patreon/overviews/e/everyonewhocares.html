    "summary": "Fancy seeing you here. Let\u0027s get right to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Hubert and this is Everyone Who Cares on Patreon. If you\u0027re familiar with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.everyonewhocares.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEveryone Who Cares\u003c/a\u003e or me (Hubert) and thinking \"This website (or handsome gentleman) is something I would like to see more of,\" this webpage is exactly how to make that happen. I\u0027m on Patreon because I believe it\u0027s the best way I can combine my dreams of writing about games and being an entrepreneur. As a bonus, this is also a great way for me to keep viewers like you aware of EWC\u0027s progress and evolution over time. Questions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Everyone Who Cares?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e...this?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, I mean what is the website, everyonewhocares.com?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eOh! EWC is a website about video games and everything else. It has reviews, news, and opinion pieces all related to video games. It also has a special section for things that aren\u0027t video games, because I have a combination of really strong opinions and a very wide range of interests. I\u0027ve found that when I like a person for one specific reason, I tend to care what they think about other topics, too. That\u0027s why we watch TV shows starring stand-up comics, or read books written by singers, right? It\u0027s why I read The Rock, Stone Cold, Mankind, and Triple H\u0027s autobiographies as a kid. Perfectly normal.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should I go there for my video game news when there are so many other sites and YouTube channels?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI\u0027m the creator, graphic designer, editor, engineer, web designer, marketing lead, social media correspondent, and R\u0026amp;D for Everyone Who Cares. What that means is I have some amount of control over everything that happens with the site, which isn\u0027t the case with other game news sites. Those writers have deadlines, quotas, etc. to live up to. I answer to you directly, and produce as much content as this community demands. Thanks to the wonders of technology, EWC is funded by you directly, and that means you\u0027re a part of its development. You get the satisfaction of knowing your money as well as your ideas and suggestions are going directly toward improving this crazy thing. I made the foundation, but where it goes from here is up to you. The royal you, I mean.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is, of course, a small operation, so I won\u0027t be able to cast as wide a net as somewhere like IGN.com. But in exchange for missing out on the Sam\u0027s Club of media information that they are, I give you authenticity, honesty, and the unique perspective of someone who doesn\u0027t live in California surrounded by game journalists. EWC gives you that sexy hipster/indie cred we all want but don\u0027t like to admit to. Yeah, YouTube channels offer a similar style of independent game coverage, but they don\u0027t give you the journalistic side of things. You get to see the game be played, and then they\u0027re on to the next hot Steam indie game. My goal is to give you both the in-the-moment entertainment the kids are into these days, but also the nerdy walls of text we craved in the magazine era.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat sounds like a lot of work. How do you plan to keep up with everything that goes on and have time to write and record?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t sleep much. I\u0027m a morning person. I also really like writing.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it true that you\u0027ve never had a pet?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIt used to be. I have a pet rabbit.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kinds of things do you have planned for the future of EWC?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAside from a regular podcast and much more video (check out the Goals tab!) I will also continue updating the design of Everyone Who Cares. The site will absolutely keep evolving, and this is just the start. With your support, I hope to have a regular podcast, several video series, and lots of live streams by the end of this summer. EWC will also some day have a presence at conventions like PAX and E3.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes the bunny get a carrot when he\u0027s a good boy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eShe doesn\u0027t. Turns out, carrots are actually really bad for rabbits. Ain\u0027t that just the saddest thing ever? She\u0027s way into bananas.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are you? Who, who? Who, who? I really wanna know.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eCute. I\u0027m just a city boy, born and raised in north Detroit, who took the midnight train going \u003cdel\u003eanywhere\u003c/del\u003e to Michigan State University, where I studied Journalism, Media Arts, and Game Design. At some point, I came across a man who\u0027d made $10 million in a year and asked him how he did it. That sparked my entrepreneurial spirit, but also killed my desire to move out to California and pursue a game journalism career. Since then, I\u0027ve worked random jobs here and there while honing my writing and web design chops. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sincerely enjoy talking to people, and I nerd over the connections that bring people together. I over-analyze things because I took Socrates way too seriously when he said \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" I truly believe that with enough passion and enough effort, anything is possible.\u00a0In short, I\u0027m just a dude with big dreams. You\u0027re now a part of making them a reality.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t stop believin\u0027!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHold on to that feeleeeeyeeeehehing.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you plan to do with the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003ePledges will cover things like hosting, equipment, and licensing for software. I will do my best to document milestone purchases in video form (when possible) because keeping this whole thing transparent is important to me. If I was giving money to some dude on the internet, I\u0027d want to know what he did with it as well. I don\u0027t know how crowd-sourcing works, and I\u0027ve always been skeptical of Kickstarters. It just makes sense to me that if you want people to trust you with their money, you should be open. Your subscription will also keep me alive with stuff like food and shelter, so I can keep creating content for you and not... die...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a commitment and I will treat it as such, 24/7, 365, 366 on a leap year.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou gonna post some of them rabbit pics?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eOf course. This is the internet.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJokes aside, I cannot properly express how thankful I am that you\u0027re even looking at this page, let alone considering helping fund this idea, so I won\u0027t. I appreciate the crap out of you. Thanks."
