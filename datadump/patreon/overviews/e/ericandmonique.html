We are inviting you to be a part of this mission through joining the Eric \u0026amp; Monique Patreon family. Patreon is a membership platform that exists to help artists like us create sustainably. In return, the patrons get rewards, such as new music, for their patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are on Patreon for four reasons.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSustainability.\u003c/strong\u003e Since adding our baby Ezra to the family, we just can not do as many concerts as we used to every year.

But we need to reserve concerts because the majority of our income comes only from when we are on the road touring.\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunity\u003c/strong\u003e. We believe that music can speak to the heart and mind in a profound way when Jesus is at the centre, and to us, the ministry is done best in a community.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWant to know more? Read below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWHAT WE DO\u003c/h4\u003eWe are singer-songwriters and musicianaries who write biblical, piano-driven music. We\u2019ve been spreading the gospel through word and song to many people around the world for the past 8 years. When we first started singing together 8 years ago, we couldn\u0027t imagine the doors that God would lead us through. Between now and then, there has been over 400 concerts around the world and countless providential moments. For the past 5 1/2 years, we have been doing full-time music ministry in a faith-driven model. For us, this means that the free-will offerings, donations, and album sales that occur when we are on tour is what funds our music ministry and living expenses. When we aren\u0027t on tour, we live off what we made on the last tour.\u00a0Through the years we have chosen to keep the financial commitment for host churches to a love offering and an optional free-will donation amount. We want any and every church to be able to host us, so we don\u2019t set a fixed amount as every church has different budget constraints. This is something we prayed a lot about at the beginning and haven\u2019t changed that model, even though (to be honest) we\u2019ve sometimes REALLY wanted to. We\u2019ve been tempted more than once to want to charge specific amounts or charge for travelling expenses to create security. Holding on to what we\u2019ve dubbed a faith-driven model is difficult because it is so unknown and there is a certain level of financial uncertainty, but we just trust that God will provide. Sometimes it feels like we are just willing ourselves to believe that God will provide, but He has and does every time. We can see this in how God has led us in the past and how He continues to lead us now. We know that we are following God in doing music ministry during this season of our life until God calls us elsewhere. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this means that we have been able to continue to do music ministry full-time because of people like you. There have been innumerable generous people, or patrons, who have invested in this ministry, into us. We can never thank each person enough who have given their money or time to help us continue to spread the gospel through word and song. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWHAT IS PATREON?\u003c/h4\u003ePatreon is a platform that enables artists to create in a sustainable way and works from the patronage model where each patron supports us through monthly contributions and receives something of value, rewards, in return. By directly supporting our Patreon, you are not only becoming a part of the continuation of our ministry, but you are also allowing us to have the space to be more creative so that you can have more regular music content. For every patron here, this gives us the opportunity to funnel the time ordinarily spent in booking and management towards songwriting, recording, and creative evangelism. You can take a look at the levels of patronage and rewards on the right of this page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWHY ARE WE ON PATREON?\u003c/h4\u003eWe heard about Patreon last year when someone at one of our concerts told us about the platform and suggested that it could benefit our music ministry. Ever since we have been thinking and praying about it and for us, the Patreon model gives the opportunity for sustainability, creativity, time, and community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSustainability\u003c/h4\u003eLast year we welcomed our baby Ezra into our family. Since then our method of a packed touring schedule has changed so that it is a safe, healthy and balanced lifestyle for Ezra. While we still go on tour, this means that we just can\u2019t do as many concerts on a tour as we did before. This has significantly affected how much money we have made to cover our ministry and living expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCreativity\u003c/h4\u003eWe\u2019ve been desiring for awhile to have the time to record and distribute our Gospel through Word and Song concerts. On Patreon, we plan to record these in a mini-version that we have named Word and Song Bytes.\u00a0These are mini-versions of what we perform in a concert or a church service, which is a spoken evangelistic message melded with music to create a powerful worship experience. We\u2019ve also wanted to write and record more original music to use for this creative means of evangelism and for you.\u2028\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eTime\u003c/h4\u003eTo write more songs and record the Word \u0026amp; Song Bytes, we need time and time is something that we currently don\u2019t have. We manage and do all the administrative, management and booking work for our full-time music ministry. This work takes up most of our time when we are at home from touring and leaves very little to no time for the creative side of music ministry; writing and recording music, as well as other creative evangelistic projects we\u2019ve been dreaming of for years. Now with our baby, Ezra, even more time is absorbed.\u00a0The majority of our time at home when we aren\u0027t on tour is used booking concerts for the next tour. So to have more time, we\u2019d need to have fewer concerts to book and perform. But the vast majority of our income comes from touring, and when we\u2019re at home, we are living off the last tour\u2019s love offerings, donations and album sales while we plan for the next tour. Now with little Ezra being added to the mix, it\u2019s becoming more and more difficult to have a creative space within this booking \u0026gt; touring cycle for any songwriting. Patreon offers the opportunity to provide us time freed from booking and management to work on songwriting and creative evangelistic projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCommunity\u003c/h4\u003eWe believe that music can speak to the heart and mind in a profound way when Jesus is at the centre. We\u2019ve heard testimonies from all over the world of how God has used our music in people\u2019s lives. We want to invite you to be a part of that by joining the Eric \u0026amp; Monique Patreon family.\u2028 If you\u0027ve read this far, that is so amazingly awesome! Thank you for considering being a part of our Patreon family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFAQs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a \u0027Word \u0026amp; Song Byte\u0027?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThis is a term we coined up to describe a short 5-10 minute recording of spoken word and original music, which together creates a devotional worship experience. It\u0027s basically a shortened version of what we do in one of our concerts or church services, which we call the gospel through word \u0026amp; song. We plan to record multiple \u0027Word \u0026amp; Song Bytes\u0027 and put them together to create one longer \u0027Gospel through word \u0026amp; song\u0027 album.\u003cbr\u003e"
