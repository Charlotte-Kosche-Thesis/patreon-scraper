My name is Elizabeth Beck (call me Elly!) and I am an entirely self-taught freelance illustrator.

Some of you may happen to know of them as the author of the Dragonoak series of high-fantasy novels, for which I have done a ton of fan-work.\u00a0 When I\u0027ve moved and we\u0027ve started sharing things like living space and names, we are hoping to continue producing LGBT-centered works, and hopefully collaborate as much as possible on these!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, as a result of this life change, I both have to set aside my personal work to focus on freelance, but also am in need of support as much as ever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, my Patreon will be changed to show what work I can, and I will continue to post Patreon-exclusive content as it is possible for me to do so!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome things have changed, including my production of my first webcomic,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eTotal Party Kiss! \u003c/strong\u003e(drawn by me and written by me and Kat Forster),\u00a0which is currently on hiatus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon also helps support my growth as an artist while I teach myself necessary skills to make illustrations and tell stories that will blow people away. \u00a0This includes more technical studies that are posted exclusively to Patreon, and sneak peeks into my work on future, larger projects!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eALL Patrons\u003c/strong\u003e will receive daily updates on the Patron-only feed from me, so you can watch for yourself how I grow with your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is my life and my dream, and I\u2019d love nothing more than to share it with as many people as I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you all SO MUCH!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eElly"
