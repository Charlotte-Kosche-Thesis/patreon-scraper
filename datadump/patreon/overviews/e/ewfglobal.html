We are sending a volunteer teacher to the borders of Burma and Thailand to assist a Children\u0027s Home and their school. They will help provide vital classes to approximately 140 students of various ages and levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial aim is to send the teacher there from May to the end of September, 2018. Depending on how much sponsorship we can raise, will decide if they can remain there for 12 months plus. Obviously the longer the better to provide effective aid and provide the educational needs to the students.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur secondary aim is to set up a computer room, with computers and headsets, where the students can receive online one-to-one English classes with volunteer teachers. This will mean the students can practise and sustain the language they have learned in a practical environment. We will link a teacher volunteer with one of the orphans at the children\u0027s home, and that teacher then adopts (virtually) that student, assisting them with part or all of their extra curriculum academic development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe cannot stress enough that ever little bit will contribute to the success of this humanitarian project. Just $1 / \u00a31 / or 50\u0e3f helps. If you have no money, then you could also help us raise awareness and assist in fundraising by sharing this with everyone you can think of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your valued assistance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
