I do this podcast as a way to spread and share what I\u0027ve learned professionally and personally in the realm of healing and the human condition, because healing is the most courageous, brave thing we can do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t pull this show off alone! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s taken 2+ years of focused brainstorming, conceptualization, practice \u0027on the mic\u0027, research, false starts, branding, web-sites, tech stuff, and general hilarity, to get where we are today, and find where moxie meets mindful. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m 13 years into this healing career and here I am, with a show!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes an incredible amount of work to release a high quality show. By becoming a supporter you will be helping fund the production, creation, editing, research, management, scheduling, and other costs associated with creating quality, weekly, digital content. We hope to branch out into livestreams, interviews, and videos and can only do that with your help and support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m humbled you\u0027re here. I\u0027m humbled you listen.\u00a0Every single dollar helps and we appreciate every little bit! Support at any level means you\u0027re helping the show reach those who really need it........and that\u0027s priceless. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had a vision about 6 years ago of a young woman sitting at her computer, googling about her depression and anxiety. Before recording each episode, I think of her, and others who are lost and seeking. Thank you for seeking in your own life; and thank you for supporting the seeking of others. To become FOUND in this life is TREMENDOUS, is EMOTIONAL BADASS.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely in Love and Light and Infinite Gratitude,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNikki\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10% of all monthly donations will be paid forward\u003c/strong\u003e, donated from Emotional Badasses to Emotional Badasses, as directly as possible. Each donation will be different and discussed on the show, honoring confidentiality. \u0027Scholarship\u0027 opportunities to be announced as we grow! There are so many creative ways to support each other as human beings via tech! I hope this grows into a fun and celebratory segment of \u003cstrong\u003egratitude and giving!\u003c/strong\u003e"

I believe facing ourselves in our fears to create positive change is the most courageous thing we can do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we each step up to do our individual healing, through the butterfly effect, we change the world. I believe in the power of my personal healing and I believe in your power to find what you need to live with fullness, peace, connection, and light. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe those of us who are called to do this work--we are powerful, we are Emotional Badasses.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
