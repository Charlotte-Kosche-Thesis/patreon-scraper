    "summary": "Hello, it\u0027s Ephemeral Rift, and I hope you\u0027re doing well. Welcome to my Patreon page, where you can consider joining my other Patrons and helping to contribute in keeping my YouTube channel and podcast running and growing, along with any other current or future projects, such as potentially a second gaming channel or Twitch stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully you are already familiar with what I do, but in the event that you\u0027re not, I create a wide variety of videos on YouTube under the channel Ephemeral Rift, that are as varied as my own interests, perhaps just like yours, in the arts, comedy, nature, philosophy and gaming, just to name a few (okay, 5 to be exact). My videos range anywhere from calming natural woodland scenes that feature the sights and sounds of trickling streams and bird sounds, to the more experimental and theatrical where I dress up in costume and portray a fictional character that wants to help the viewer relax, fall asleep, make them laugh, or a combination of all three, as well as to try and help them experience and enjoy ASMR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you aren\u0027t familiar with the acronym ASMR, it stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, and is the non-scientific, layperson\u0027s name given to the feeling that many people experience, with perhaps you being one of them. The feeling is described as a pleasant tingling sensation felt in various parts of the body, such as the scalp, shoulders and arms, in response to various stimuli, such as personal attention like getting a haircut, to watching someone perform a detailed task, or hearing certain sounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also run the EphemRadio podcast, where I shed the ASMR and relaxing aspects of my channel, and talk in my normal voice on a variety of real life topics and issues. Then there is the Arkham Sanitarium podcast, which is theatrical, and based on some of the characters I\u0027ve created on my YouTube channel, but is on a temporary hiatus until I can figure out how to manage my time better with all the projects I have planned and want to run. Rome wasn\u0027t built in a day, or so they say. And this is all a one-man show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what\u0027s in it for you, if you decide to become my Patron:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a pledge of $1, you receive my sincerest thanks, and I do mean that. Every little bit helps and it\u0027s greatly appreciated. You will receive basic access to my feed here on Patreon, where I keep everyone updated with my latest works and post occasional teaser screenshots and such from upcoming videos. For a pledge of $3 you receive the benefits of the $1 tier, plus you will have your name listed in the credits at the end of a video that is usually published around the beginning of each month. For $5, you receive the benefits of the $1 and $3 tiers, along with a link that will allow you to download the original audio in MP3 format from a select video for your personal use. You can of course also opt to not receive any rewards but still become a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and/or watch the video and consider becoming a Patron. Take care for now and I wish you all my best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- E.R."
