After getting my first smart phone (the iPhone4s), I used it to capture expressive nude self-portraits of my body that were faceless. \u00a0In this way, I used self-portraiture as therapy and after a year and a half of these self-portraits, I was finally able to \"face\" the world again. \u00a0I met others along the way with similar stories, and I am here because of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYour contribution helps me continue to grow as an artist, \u003c/em\u003eand in turn \u003cem\u003eshare more with\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eyou,\u003c/em\u003e so that you can also flourish. \u00a0I have rewards for artists and also art admirers. \u00a0You\u0027ll get access to unique tutorials, galleries, and more by subscribing to my exclusive community here on Patreon. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease read through the levels to see which Reward you would most benefit from. \u00a0There are \u003cem\u003e*many*\u003c/em\u003e affordable options that are geared towards learning because I truly want you to be able to continue to grow your craft and expression! \u00a0\u003cem\u003eAlso, please remember that contributing to\u00a0me allows me to continue to support artists and models I mentor locally.\u003c/em\u003e Therefore, the more I receive truly translates to the more I can give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
