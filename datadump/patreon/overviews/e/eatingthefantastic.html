    "summary": "I\u2019ve been going to science fiction, fantasy, horror, and comic book conventions since I was 15, and I\u2019ve found that while the cons are always fun, the cons away from the cons\u2014which take place when I wander off-site with friends for a meal\u2014can often be \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e fun. In fact, my love of tracking down good food while traveling the world attending conventions has become so well known one blogger even dubbed me \"science fiction\u2019s Anthony Bourdain.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/eating-the-fantastic/id1083737796?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEating the Fantastic\u003c/a\u003e to replicate in podcast form one of my favorite parts of any convention\u2014good conversation with good friends over good food. During each episode, I share a meal with someone whose opinions I think you\u2019ll want to hear, and we talk about science fiction, fantasy, horror, writing, comics, movies, fandom \u2026 whatever happens to come to mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDozens of episodes are already live with the likes of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.scottedelman.com/2016/12/23/brunch-with-nalo-hopkinson-on-the-25th-episode-of-eating-the-fantastic/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNalo Hopkinson\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.scottedelman.com/2016/07/25/welcome-to-a-bifurcated-balticon-episode-of-eating-the-fantastic-with-guest-fran-wilde/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFran Wilde\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.scottedelman.com/2016/04/15/episode-6-of-eating-the-fantastic-with-andy-duncan-is-now-live/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAndy Duncan\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.scottedelman.com/2016/10/28/join-alyssa-wong-and-faceless-ghost-grandma-for-bbq-in-episode-21-of-eating-the-fantastic/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAlyssa Wong\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.scottedelman.com/2016/09/02/chow-down-on-a-full-irish-breakfast-with-jeffrey-ford-in-episode-17-of-eating-the-fantastic/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJeffrey Ford\u003c/a\u003e, and more, but there are\u00a0so many amazing people out there, so many more voices I want to bring to you, that I need \u00a0your help in capturing them all. In order to make Eating the Fantastic even better, I\u2019d like to pick up the pace, post episodes more often than biweekly, make day trips to capture writers whom I never get a chance to see on the con circuit, and maybe even upgrade to more advanced recording equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCheck out all the levels of support and accompanying rewards\u2014starting at $1\u2014which will allow you to help subsidize Eating the Fantastic.
