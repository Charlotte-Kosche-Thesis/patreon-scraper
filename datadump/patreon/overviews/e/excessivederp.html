    "summary": "Right off the top, I will address one thing. Yes, I am another \"Let\u0027s Play\" kind of Youtuber. I do make other varieties of content, but that\u0027s definitely the staple of this channel. I understand by that, you may be thinking \"why should I donate to that?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnderstand, I am not a big channel at all, I\u0027m one of the little guys. I love the content I make, and am always looking to do more. I have a variety of shows and content on my channel, such as \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLet\u0027s Do This, No Games Barred, Big Screen Fissures, Vlogs, Ask Derp, \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eand of course a bunch of live streams. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s Do This (LDT) \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eis a comedic, cut edit style of \"Let\u0027s Play\". I generally take games from Nintendo, up to the Playstation 2, and pretty much just butcher my way through them. The episodes are of a decent length, have plenty of photoshop to accompany the jokes, and can be basically mayhem. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo Games Barred (NGB) \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eis a longer, full play, minimal cut version of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLet\u0027s Do This\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. This show covers games that fall outside of the retro category that \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLDT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e would cover, so it\u0027s pretty much anything I feel like playing outside of those limitations. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBig Screen Fissures (BSF) \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eis a comedic, podcast type show that involves my sister and myself watching movies and television shows we find nostalgic, and finding any excuse to poke and tear at them (regardless of our actual opinions regarding the source material). \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAsk Derp \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eis an AMA style show where I answer questions from both my ask.fm account, and from viewers. Patrons get their questions questions answered as top priority, so it works as a great interactive experience in this community. Finally with the \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVlogs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, it\u0027s more or less self explanatory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the way things are right now with my set up, all of my hard/software, all the other equipment and props used, I\u0027m only able to do so much. I\u0027m always looking to make many improvements to the entire channel as a whole, so that there can be many more ways of keeping you all thoroughly entertained and satisfied. There\u0027s a lot fo work to be done, and for one person to take on has been a gigantic task. I\u0027ve always been a fairly quiet and reserved guy in my own personal life, Excessive Derp has been a way for me to really break out of this. As introverted as I can be, I\u0027ve still always wanted be able to reach a vast audience and offer them quality entertainment. With your help, I can finally achieve something I\u0027ve only ever dreamed about for a very long time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith enough support, it\u0027s possible that there could be more content coming from me in the future (in the way of possible new shows, new set, new experience, extra editors). So if you feel like you want to help me out a little in making the best possible content I can, I will be forever thankful and grateful for your contributions, and it will not be forgotten.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(The video posted is a show case of the best of episodes 50 - 99 of Let\u0027s Do This! Hopefully you\u0027ll like what you see and either subscribe or consider a donation!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne last note, the reward system will be added to, updated and upgraded as postive changes happen to the channel!\u003cbr\u003e"
