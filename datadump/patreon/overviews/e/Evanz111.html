However, due to a recent illness that has caused me to be withdrawn from university, I am no longer able to maintain the promises I made, and after consulting my existing patrons we decided to no longer advertise my page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will come back. I don\u0027t know when, but it will be bigger and better than ever when it does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey! I\u0027ve been making videos for YouTube since 2010, seeing as I loved both playing games and making films, so I decided to combine the two! I\u0027ve uploaded daily for years now, but it\u0027s been getting difficult since I moved out due to lack of time and disposable income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy do I want your money?\u003c/h3\u003eOne answer: because I\u0027m a greedy prick!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously - When I started making videos, I had nothing but the in-game video editor on Skate 3. No computer, no editing software and no money to afford any of those things. As soon as I started earning from my content, every penny has gone straight back into it and everything I do now wouldn\u0027t have been possible without it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat would your support enable me to do?\u003c/h3\u003eI want to expand. My computer was stolen along with all my recording gear back in April, and through generous donations, I was able to get back on my feet. This made me realise that people actually want content from me, and I\u0027ve only really scratched the surface. If people support me as a creator, I\u0027ll be able to broaden my horizons, making not only more content, but content with a higher quality and a greater range of variety - all made possible because of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat would \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003eget?\u003c/h3\u003eBefore I started making videos, I used to watch them all the time, so I know exactly what kind of incentives would appeal to me and I\u0027ll make sure to offer them to you! For those with the means to support me, I\u0027ll make sure I show my appreciation and, trust me, it won\u0027t just be a one-time thing! For a rough idea of the things you\u0027ll get, have a look at the offers below!"
