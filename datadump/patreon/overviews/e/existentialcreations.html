    "summary": "My story begins with my passion for photography that lead me to get an Art degree at San Jose State and sent me on a path to create more than just photographs.\u003cbr\u003eI have been taking photos since I was very young and got serious about it 7 years ago through a photography class at my former high school. I have always worked with digital but started film in 2013 when my first automatic 35mm camera was donated to me. From then on, I have been experimenting with all types of film including but not limited to 35mm, 120mm, and all type of polaroid formats. My work is inspired by the love I have for spontaneity, my life experiences, and my heart\u0027s eye view. Since attending San Jose State University, I have learned many other skills that can be applied to my art including metalworking, woodworking, crafting, drawing, and painting. With these skills, I have been able to start creating embroideries, illustrated designs, and other fun/ small crafts like crystal jewelry and pin-back buttons. Embroidery has become a powerhouse of my work and I create more of it than anything else and hope to be able to support myself off of it one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this page, I hope to inspire artists and other to keep creating while supporting others who do. I have many goals for the year of 2018 and I would like to create as much as possible. With your support, I hope to be able to afford better equipment, and more supplies to create different and unique work. I want to reward my patreons with small gifts every month like buttons or mini prints of illustrations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy supporting me you are helping me create art and do what truly makes me the most happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFind me and more of my work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/taytaylfc/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/existentialcreations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
