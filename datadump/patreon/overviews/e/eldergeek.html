    "summary": "I\u2019m Randy Yasenchak, owner of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://elder-geek.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eElder-Geek.com\u003c/a\u003e. Since 2009, my site Elder Geek has delivered some of the best video game content on YouTube. Concise, well-written and balanced video reviews are my bread and butter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt one point or another, you\u2019ve probably seen my work, whether it was my video review for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYeCwtksTgU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAmnesia: The Dark Descent\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, or one of my video features like the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6580QPV76U\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGet Off My Lawn \u003c/em\u003eabout the importance of \u003cem\u003ePortal 2\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, or maybe you\u2019ve even seen a few episodes of the series\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZZvtaROg-8\u0026amp;index=7\u0026amp;list=PL708CFACD2824B7DE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwenty-Five Games for My Son\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e where I tie important events in my life to whichever video game I happen to have been playing at the time. Or maybe you caught some of our old\u00a0E3 footage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe content created for this channel doesn\u2019t pander to either developers, publishers, or pitchfork carrying angry mobs. I simply create high quality video content as often as possible for people who also enjoy my favorite hobby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the best fans on the internet. I am proud of the amount of subscribers this channel has earned. But despite the numbers, Google ads pay a laughably small amount so I\u0027m no longer monetizing videos on YouTube!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why I\u2019m coming to the public and opening up EG\u2019s Patreon page. I\u2019ve often thought of doing a Kickstarter in one form or another for smaller projects like \u003cem\u003e25 Games\u003c/em\u003e, but the reality is, the site needs regular funding for even the most basic stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor people who don\u0027t know what Patreon is, Patreon is sort of like a tip jar. With it, you can directly help turn EG into an even better channel.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m charging for video content.\u00a0It\u2019s just a place for generous people who want to give a little extra. \u00a0If you can\u2019t give anything at all, that is 100% OK. I\u2019m grateful for the following that Elder Geek has and simply being a fan is more than enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you give $1 per video, that is outstanding. If 100 people only give $1 per video, it would help offset the costs of running the channel and make it even easier to provide quality content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut at $5 per video, I\u2019ll grant patrons the temporary ability to download the raw video file I created for YouTube to enjoy the video and audio in the absolute best quality possible without YouTube\u0027s vicious compression. Many viewers may be surprised how much YouTube compression degrades video and audio quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create this content for people who absolutely love games, and if that\u2019s you, and you love the work you see here on this channel, then you should very seriously consider pledging to the Patreon page. Thank you very much for stopping by!"
