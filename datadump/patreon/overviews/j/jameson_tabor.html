Yet, despite all of my obvious passion for music, the narrative I always told myself was that I was going to be an actor. I think my fear of the unknown professional music world blinded me. \u00a0I felt like I didn\u2019t know where to start. \u00a0So, I talked myself out of it and chose the path that I was already on. \u00a0But after a friend encouraged me to look deeper at my life, I realized that it was actually music driving me all along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least, that\u0027s my goal\u2014to dream big, follow my passion, and conquer my fears. \u00a0Because I believe that true happiness comes from doing what you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What are you making?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create Dance music that gives people hope and brings meaning to their lives. \u00a0My background in theater has really inspired me to share stories through my music that people can relate to, but that can still take them to another world. \u00a0Everything I create is coming from the realest moments of my life and my wildest visions of what is possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s important that I always push the limits. \u00a0My own limits, and whatever society is telling me to be that I\u0027m not. \u00a0Hopefully that opens more doors for more people in the future to live freely and happily,\u00a0and raises the bar for what the human race is capable of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, I did just go there... lol.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat that really means is, I want to bring more depth, and humor, and creativity to people\u0027s minds; to hopefully inspire them to view the world like it\u0027s their own; to keep dreaming of all it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic for me is life. \u00a0It is the answer to all of the world\u0027s questions, and it\u0027s the question to all the world\u0027s answers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_fill,w_695/v1469767941/12507396_891691980949461_287776672025593347_n_ugqfdm.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Okay, so... what does that even sound like Jameson?
