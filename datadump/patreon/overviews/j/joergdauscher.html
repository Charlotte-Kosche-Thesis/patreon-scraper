J\u00f6rg Dauscher here, german travelwriter, who is about to publish a book on Albania and bound for Georgia this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to my contributers, i can allow myself for the most important thing there is in order to comprehend and understand my subjects: time! I believe, that in order to write high quality content about other countries, customs and cultures you do need time. You should expose\u00a0 yourself, gather experiences, visit places twice - only then you can write in depth. This is what time allows for.\u00a0 So what i am asking you for is to grant me time - the most valuable thing on earth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy book on Albania is due end of October, the release of a book on Georgia is aimed for early spring 2018, both published by Berlin Klak Verlag. Besides bookwriting i am running a travelblog, which will be translated into English as soon as there are enough contributors to do so.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
