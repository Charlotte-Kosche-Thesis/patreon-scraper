    "summary": "During the middle ages, there was a tradition of arts patronage that helped the visual arts and written word to thrive. The importance of patronage was that both patron and artist received heightened social status and immortality through the works produced by the artist(s) that they supported. In that tradition, I am asking for your generous patronage to continue my work as a Food Historian and Blogger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been an independent Food History researcher for the last 15 years and have been blogging on and off (at medievalcooking.org (2001-2011) and \u003ca href=\"http://www.jennstrobel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ejennstrobel.com\u003c/a\u003e starting in 2011) about food history, modern food, and other food-related topics. My output has been directly related to the amount of time I can give to it and the amount of money I have to purchase ingredients (to create standardized recipes based on medieval sources). I want to change that, but I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have several research subjects in mind that I want to have the time to dig into:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Translate more of \u003cem\u003eEenen seer schoonen ende excellenten Cocboeck\u003c/em\u003e, a project that I\u0027ve had to all but abandon after losing 4 years of translation work in a computer crash and being sidelined by other things. Here is a feast that was done using my translations -- \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;cd=2\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhrf7c6KvRAhUj0IMKHbciADEQFggkMAE\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.godecookery.com%2Flatest%2Fccmenu04.doc\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNHd3-HFYQ_RyQPtaLsTuPUSt2b16g\u0026amp;sig2=1Bte8w84Org6f3tfxjhiwQ\u0026amp;cad=rja\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCook\u0027s Collegium Menu\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Focus more on the foodways of the Spanish Netherlands, tracking the cultural influence of the Spanish (if any) on the culture of medieval Flanders.\u003cbr\u003e3. Engage in more research into the influence of the French Court on the food and traditions of the Court of Richard II.\u003cbr\u003e4. Research the civilization of the Fryske (Frisians) and find out more about their foodways. I started on this path probably 13 years ago and now there is much more information available to me.\u003cbr\u003e5. Develop a couple of new classes that I can share online as a video. The above topics are the most likely candidates for this.\u003cbr\u003e6. Re-start the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/520839491402946/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePerfectly Period Feast\u003c/a\u003e and give it the attention it deserves so it can be successful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat your support means is the ability for me to do this research and share it with you. Donors will receive exclusive content, including recipes, as a thank you for their patronage. I have some ideas for providing online educational content (that patrons would get first crack at) and I want to be able to do this these to the benefit of the food history and food research community at large. The more donations I receive, the greater the possibilities. Financial stability means that I have more capital to work with so that I can travel, acquire materials (books, ingredients, etc), and focus on providing the kind of content that you want to see and share rather than providing what I can when I can how I can. \u003cbr\u003e"
