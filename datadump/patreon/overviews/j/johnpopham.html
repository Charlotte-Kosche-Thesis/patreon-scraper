    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon Page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a number of years now I have been working in whatever ways I can to help people realise the benefits of new technology to improve lives and society. I work as a Digital Storyteller helping people to tell their stories of the work they do in the public and non-profit sectors, and of the benefits they bring to people\u0027s lives. \u00a0I have also been a pioneer in community development approaches to Digital Inclusion and of low-cost live video streaming, as well as budget production videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the work I do, and it brings me particular satisfaction to see how people\u0027s lives can be transformed for the better either by telling their story to the world, or by getting online for the first time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, the problem is that it is not always easy to find clients who want to do all of the things that are important to me. And that is particularly true of some of the more innovative, cutting-edge, and perhaps more difficult to measure, things that I passionately want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, I am launching what I think is a first. I am using Patreon to enable my network to commission me to do interesting, innovative and risky things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are one of the people who follow what I do on social media or watch my videos, or maybe have attended a workshop or seen a conference presentation I have done, and enjoyed it, or thought what I was doing was important, then please consider making a regular contribution that will enable me to take what I do to the next level. I want to prove the power of Digital Storytelling to make a difference to the world; that older people\u0027s lives are enriched by new technologies, and that public services can be transformed by introduction of tech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf my nearly 12,000 Twitter followers contributed \u00a31 a month each that would be far more than is needed. So anything you can afford will help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is, once a critical mass of Patrons has been built to take a monthly vote on what projects contributors want to see me undertake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I prioritise with the resources generated through Patreon will change over time, and will be guided by you, the Contributors.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxTnJU0s2mg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have ideas, please get in touch."
