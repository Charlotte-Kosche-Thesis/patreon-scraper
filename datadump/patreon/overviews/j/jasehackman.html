     "about": "One of my personal goals and deepest desires is to make a point to genuinely hear and see people. Everyone craves being known whether they realize it on a conscious level or not. One of my favorite things to do is sit down with people and have intentional, honest, and vulnerable conversations. That\u2019s such a gift. So often we go through life thinking we\u2019re the only ones experiencing heartache or longing or fear or confusion, when in reality, we\u2019re all walking around feeling the same things. There are core threads of the human experience that are the same across the board and I want my music to linger in those threads. I want people to see themselves in the lyrics or hear their heartbeats in the notes and realize someone else in the world has felt or lived or questioned the same things they have. The nature of life makes it impossible to have one-on-one conversations with everyone, but music provides an avenue to break through barriers and reach a multitude of people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist, I\u2019m pouring my soul into my music. It\u2019s my lifeblood. You\u2019ll hear my passions, my fears, my questions, my struggles \u2013 and my joy. All of it shows up, either in the lyrics or the emotion of the instruments. It becomes difficult to separate myself from my music, and that\u2019s okay. When we let down our guard, we invite other people in. We invite them to experience us and bond over common ground. It\u2019s my hope that in experiencing my music, you feel invited in to the most real and raw parts of my story. Because at the end of the day, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about: all of our stories and how they weave together to write the greatest story of all.\u003cbr\u003e",
