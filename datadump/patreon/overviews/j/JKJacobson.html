    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who are new to this sight, Patreon is a place where you can support the artists and other creative people you love with a flexible, monthly donation. Like a magazine that says \u2018thank you\u2019 and answers your questions. Easy as that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs for me, My name is Jake Jacobson and I am a writer of fiction. I write whenever I have the time and energy to do so. I have loved stories and storytelling my whole life and I hope to make it my life and living.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not the best at talking about my self, so here\u0027s an example of my work!\u003cbr\u003e_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003eA vengeful wave broke over my head, colder than a Greenland winter. Mother always told me to wear more, thicker coats, bigger hats, heavier boots. I never did; the cold never bothered me much. The rigging tore at my hands, threatening to pull loose, and take my skin with it. Seven years on the hammer will give you calluses like nothing else can, or so I thought. A month on this damn ship has thickened my palms twice again and widened my arms the same. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, the storm passed and the sun bright, I stare at the darkening bandages wrapping my hands and the ugly, woolen quilt over my body. I\u2019ll get it someday, I\u2019ll be a sailor yet.\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003eThe angry sea is lashing at my feet. The ship is still afloat, if only just. Samuel\u0027s mushrooms are wearing off; I can tell by the screams. The sails are in tatters. I\u2019m not worried though, we\u0027ve already struck the beach. If only I knew which one it was. If only we still had a ship.\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003eI lament you, oh Sweet Mercy. Your wood scattered across the sand like the scars you laced across my hands; pervasive yet hidden beneath the chaos. Of your rigging and deck have I built my home, as much a cannibal as a structure can be. But lo, I see your soul, your yearning heart, burning to set sail once more. Rest my friend. We must all be dashed upon the shores some day, and now you need not fear your end. Tell the reaper, if you see him, that I am coming and that I will not be so easy a crop to reap.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working on a novel at the moment. Here\u0027s a little excerpt from the first chapter.\u003cbr\u003e_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003eThe sand in my shoes grinds against my skin, probably shredding my thin silk socks, as I skitter and slide across the windblown parking lot on the smooth soles of my loafers. The helmet vendor (I assume that\u2019s what he would be called down here) looks like someone straight out of an american biker gang, beerbelly, black bandana, leather Harley Davidson jacket and all. His tent has flaps covering the sides, blocking the wind and, by association, the sand, from ruining his merch. \u201cGood evening, sir.\u201d His accent is distinctly local and clashes with his appearance rather unsettlingly. \u201cMight I interest you in some of my fine wares?\u201d Ya, he\u2019s definitely making fun of me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe helmets are all fire and skulls as far as I can see. None of them even the slightest bit my style. \u201cI was hoping for something a little more\u2026\u201d I know this is going to sound lame, but I\u2019m an idiot when I\u2019m talking to people about anything but accounting. \u201c...righteous.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHe laughs. He\u2019s definitely laughing at me, it\u2019s not hard to tell. \u201cDo you want righteous because you wanna pretend to be the hero, or are you afraid of what your boring friends might think?\u201d His voice goes from mocking to downright sinister. If this punk wants a fight he\u2019ll get a fight.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy whole face flexes and I can\u0027t quite keep from raising my voice. \u201cI want righteous because I am righteous and I don\u2019t give a fuck what you think!\u201d And this is probably the part where I get mobbed, robbed and murdered. Curse my short fuse.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHe just stares at me for a while with a big, dumb smirk on his face, then he pulls a black curtain at the back of the stall aside. The curtain was concealing an artist\u2019s workshop: racks of plain white helmets hang from the walls and several sit on a table in varying states of customization and painting. He takes a nearly finished helmet from his workstation and makes a show of examining it. Its a Suzuki-Samsung model with a top quality AMOLED vizor, it\u2019s a similar model to mine but designed for racing rather than conference calls. It has a gold mirrored visor and the paintjob is royal purple under an artistic rendition of Joan of Arc with clockwork angel wings, and of course, she\u2019s mostly naked. \u201cThis was a commission for someone else, but, if you have the money, maybe we can make a deal.\u201d He grins a predatory grin as he looks at me and turns the helmet slightly so Joan\u2019s exposed breasts are pointed directly at me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u2019s the game then. Fine by me. \u201cHow much?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHe puts the helmet on the counter and all the mirth drains from his face. It\u2019s business time. \u201cTen thousand; it is state of the art and custom painted.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cBut it\u2019s unfinished.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cFifteen minutes, I will finish.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOkay, but I can\u2019t display it anywhere, I would get fired, so it loses all value as a display piece.\u201d Okay that was a lie, nobody can actually fire me. It would probably hurt my reputation though.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cFair, but if you planned to display it you wouldn\u0027t be buying it last minute, racer eighty seven.\u201d Of course the clipboard is linked to his stand.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThe vulgarity still lowers its value, and I don\u2019t have time to have you change it.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFrom the betting tent I can hear someone with a thick french accent arguing with the girls, asking who the hell number eighty seven is and why he\u2019s riding the bike the guy apparently stole for himself. That\u0027ll be fun in a moment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOkay, eight.\u201d Oh right, still haggling.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSix.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHe smirks and leans against the counter. I don\u2019t like it. \u201cI tell you what. If you win tonight the helmet is yours, free.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIf I lose?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOne thousand for each bike in front of you.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn all honesty it\u2019s probably the prettiest helmet I\u0027ve ever seen, and if this guy had a name it would likely go for fifty to a collector, but he doesn\u0027t, so it won\u0027t\u2026 unless I get it for \u2018cheap\u2019, make a name for him and then sell it for quadruple or more as a pre-fame piece. \u201cDeal.\u201d I offer my hand and we shake on it. The deal is made.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI will find you when it is done.\u201d He takes the helmet back to the table and plops down into a raggedy office chair, picking up one of the many air brushes, each with a different color, that surround him.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI can hear angry footsteps behind me, stomping on the cement and grinding across the sand. I pretend to examine one of the helmets, all skulls and flames, taking it off the hook. \u201cHay, suit!\u201d A little bit closer please. \u201cWhat the fuck you doin drivin my rig, huh?\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI spin on my heels and bash him across the face with the helmet. There\u0027s a wet crunch, not just from the impact, and he goes down hard. I place the helmet gently on the counter and take two steps to loom above him. His jaw is broken, very broken, but he\u0027s still conscious. \u201cMaybe don\u0027t steal the next one!\u201d He\u2019s clearly terrified. He probably didn\u0027t expect a thirty five year old white guy in an unreasonably expensive business suit to fight back at all, let alone drop him in one hit. Too bad for him I\u2019m actually a closet badass. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI turn back to the helmet vendor, he\u2019s staring at me with my helmet in one hand and an airbrush in the other, a shocked expression on his face. I turn the helmet so the bloody side is facing him. \u201cSorry, I didn\u0027t wanna get punk blood on my suit.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoyed those little examples of my work. I also do fan fiction from time to time when the mood strikes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re feeling generous, I would be extatic to have you as a patron. If not, tell a friend! \u003cbr\u003e"
