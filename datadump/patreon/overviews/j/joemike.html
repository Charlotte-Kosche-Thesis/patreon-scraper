    "summary": "I\u0027m not an engineer, nor a teacher. I\u0027m just a guy that loves 3D Printing technology and loves to geek out on/explain it even more. I\u0027ve always found that I learn best visually, and by \u003cem\u003edoing\u003c/em\u003e. YouTube has always come through in this regard, setting me on a good path to start whatever adventure I was embarking upon. I\u0027ve drawn upon this more time than I can count and it is a resource to be charished.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love that through YouTube I have found a place where I can give back to the community, what I\u0027ve been so fortunate to take advantage of myself: Knowledge. In the world of 3D Printing, knowledge is key for taking a printer kit worth $200, and getting it to print like it\u0027s worth quadruple that. At times, things get hazy and even overwhelming messing with these things. I hope to continue demystifying this science, allowing people to grow in the craft and just have fun doing it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support me on Patreon you will be directly supporting my efforts. The income generated on here will feed directly back into my channel, allowing me to purchase more tech to review and do tutorials on. This isn\u0027t my full time job, and I don\u0027t envision it ever being so. That\u0027s why this account is dedicated to the channel and not my personal finances. I\u0027ll still pay the rent with my \u0027real\u0027 job, and everything from here will go towards printers, filament, upgrades, and anything else I can do a tutorial/review on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for consideration, and I hope to offer the best content I can with your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoe Mike"
