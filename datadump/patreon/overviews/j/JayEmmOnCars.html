    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eJayEmm on Cars\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a YouTube channel dedicated to creating entertaining, informative and honest automotive content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarted in 2016 by James Martin, it was started because of his frustrations with YouTube\u0027s then car related output.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, there was a near total lack of good Lotus related content. Being a new Lotus owner and with the factory being only 90 minutes away from James, he saw this as a good opportunity to produce material that he knew would have worldwide appeal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, he saw a number of the larger YouTube channels which had inspired him becoming increasingly commercialised and lifestyle orientated. James promises never to tell you what to have for his breakfast (unless you ask) - it isn\u0027t what you\u0027ve come to the channel for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, with best friend and mad petrolhead Lawrie Rose, James is attempting to create the best channel on YouTube for lovers of all things automotive. There is a dedicated fanbase already following the channel, which has grown four fold in the last six months - but to bring the channel to the next level requires financial support and presently the ad revenue from YouTube is not enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will the money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery video we create costs us roughly \u00a350 - \u00a3150 to create. It can take a whole day just to shoot the content for one video, plus edit time. Our major expenditures are on fuel, food and camera equipment. Unfortunately, YouTube currently rewards clickbait-style content and does not encourage higher-quality but less frequently produced content. So, we\u0027re here to ask for your help to allow us to continue doing that better than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll money earned from Patreon will go directly to things seen on the channel - helping us film more videos, going to more interesting places and doing different features.\u003cbr\u003e"
