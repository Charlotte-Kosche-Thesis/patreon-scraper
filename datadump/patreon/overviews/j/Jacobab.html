I\u0027m a creative person full of imagination ready, and willing to express it out to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI take photos wherever i go, looking for interesting shots of nature, and buildings around. Natural photos are my favorite, but i still love editing photos. Right now one of my goals here on Patreon is to get better software here on my computer, as well as better equipment for my camera. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs said before, i am writer. Not a published one, it\u0027s mainly just a hobby of mine that i really like. I have around two short stories that i have written, and\u00a0I\u0027ve created a large number of characters for future stories. In the end, i\u0027m working on publishing my writings someday in a book of my creation. I\u0027m hoping to get support for that project here on Patreon."
