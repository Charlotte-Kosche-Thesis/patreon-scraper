I have been active since about 2010, but have always had a profound love for photography, and anything of a creative nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of my Patreon is to have a a platform to share my work, where you will actually see it! Unfortunately, other platforms such as Facebook \u0026amp; Instagram are making it harder and harder for creatives to have anywhere to be seen, without you having to pay them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike other Patreon\u0027s where there are reward tiers, I won\u0027t really be doing that. It has something I had tried before, but I due to my full time work commitments, I would worry that I just would not have the time to put into as much as I would like to. So all of my content will remain free, as it currently does across social media. I will however, be adding a tier that is simple referred to as a \u0027Tip Jar\u0027 for if you wish to contribute towards the creation of my work, then you are free to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I hope you enjoy my content, and look forward to meeting you all :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJustine x\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
