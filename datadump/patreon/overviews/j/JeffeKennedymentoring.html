    "summary": "Heya folks! If you\u2019re here, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve already read something\nI\u2019ve written. Or maybe you\u2019ve taken one of my workshops, either online or at a\nconference. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read my work, you can find All The Books, excerpts,\nreviews, etc., at JeffeKennedy.com. I write female-driven fantasy, contemporary\nromance, erotic fiction, and a smattering of other things. I\u2019m a hybrid author,\nwhich means I have both traditional publishing contracts and I also do some\nself-publishing. My books have won awards and people say nice things about them.\nI\u2019m truly blessed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut I am at a scary place in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy day job left me in October. After eighteen great years together, we\nbroke up. It was an amicable divorce, with much sorrow on both sides. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s one of those disaster/opportunity things for me. Yay, I have a lot\nmore time to write! Ack, I have no steady income and have to pay my own health\ninsurance! It\u2019s exciting and stressful all at once. Don\u2019t get me started on the\ncat\u2019s concerns about where their kibble will come from...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve also been toying with ways of offering more direct help to\naspiring writers. The online workshops are good, but they last for finite\nperiods of time. That window might not work with your schedule or writing pace.\nSometimes students tell me they start with the best of intentions, then life\ninterferes. Once the class is over, they lose access to my help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBlog posts work well for giving my thoughts on craft and the industry,\nand I\u2019ll absolutely continue to do those, but they don\u2019t allow me to give\ninteractive help so much. Also, I think people hesitate to ask specific\nquestions related to THEM. After all, most of us really want to talk about our\nfavorite topic: our own work. J\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve done that\u2019s been fun and helpful is donating\nmanuscript critiques to auctions like Brenda Novak\u2019s and Worldbuilders. I feel\nlike I can be of direct benefit there, but that\u2019s only one person at a time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, to find a better way to help aspiring writers AND keep the cats in\nkibble, I\u2019m trying out this Patreon. (I also have one for readers here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/JeffeKennedy?ty=h.)\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/JeffeKennedy?ty=h.)\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe way this works is you can pledge to support me a certain amount of\nmoney per Thing, which in this case means various lectures on craft,\npublishing, etc. As part of my exclusive patron community here, you\u2019ll get to\nhelp decide what I talk about. And you\u2019ll be able to either receive direct\nmentorship from me or observe what I work on with others. All depends on your\nbudget. And don\u2019t worry, you can limit how much you sponsor per month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, check out the below and see if you want to join in. If I\u2019m not\noffering something you want, let me know and I\u2019ll see if I can set it up. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, check out the below and see if you want to join in. \u003cbr\u003e"
