    "summary": "Hi everyone, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it here to my Patreon page then I\u0027m going to assume you\u0027re either infected with the DSM sickness just as I am and I can totally understand why you\u0027re flat broke just as I am LOL. Just kidding. I am not asking anyone to help me out, I\u0027ve made this journey with this car 10 years now by myself and I can always keep going myself. I was suggested to create the page for those who have found interest in my content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not the most creative or informative person in the DSM community by far but what I can share with you is what I\u0027ve learned over 10 years of bringing my car from a completely stock 1997 Eclipse GST into a 10 second AWD street car. I\u0027ve made a lot of mistakes and stupid purchases along the way like any other young person trying to have a good time but my goal here is to simply share some of my learned experience in what does and what doesn\u0027t work with these cars. While I\u0027m at I\u0027d like to throw a few projects and fun in along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started out as an industrial mechanic out of high school working on machinery, knowing only basic automotive tasks, oil changes, brakes etc. The 9 years I spent at this job, while not being directly related does share a lot of similar skills from reading and following instructions, understanding how tools work, fabrication, metal working, welding and basic electrical. It gave me a very good understanding of how things work and not to fear taking something apart and repairing it. A very intelligent fellow YouTuber AvE, once said, \"If it\u0027s already fucked, you can\u0027t fuck it anymore\", crude but direct to the point. I take that as don\u0027t be afraid to dig into something and try. A lot of people spend their hard earned cash to let someone else build their dream, what fun is that? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d never rebuilt a motor before, I\u0027d never rebuilt transmissions before, I\u0027d never welded before(well not very well anyway). I sat my butt down in front of the computer, did some googling, got distracted along the way, found that weird part of YouTube but eventually found my way back and got the info I needed to do something for myself. There are tons of people out there with potential who just need a little courage to try themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s be honest, all of our beloved DSM\u0027s are getting on to 20+ years old, pretty much everything that can be done with these cars HAS indeed been done and the info is there at your finger tips. It may take a little work to find it and some has been lost, big fuck you to Photobucket, but someone, somewhere has posted it and discussed it. These cars work like pretty much every other car, suck, bang, blow and eventually the wheels spin. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is my final goal with this car? To have fun. That\u0027s it. What is fun to me? Learning new things, challenging myself and meeting new friends along the way to share these experiences with. The car has become fairly recognized in the community over the years and I love meeting the people who are inspired by it and my work. It\u0027s not the fastest, I don\u0027t have unlimited funds to throw at it, it\u0027s got scrapes and chips and battle scars. It\u0027s not a showroom car by any means but that\u0027s ok. It gives me something to work on and improve a little here and a little there. If it was ever completed then it would no longer be a project and would simply be another car. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I hope you\u0027ll stick around with me and my videos and if you ever see me out there, introduce yourself, I love meeting everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything generated through Patreon will go towards new filming gear. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also follow my progress on Instagram;\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jdxnc/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/jdxnc/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
