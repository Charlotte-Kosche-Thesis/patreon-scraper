I have\nbeen published by Hosted Games and Choice of Games and am currently writing for\ntheir new label, Heart\u2019s Choice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love writing choice games as well as other forms of\nfiction and am working on pursuing this full-time. While I make money from publishing my games, it is nowhere near a full-time salary or enough to\ncover my monthly expenses. In fact, the royalties are sporadic. Therefore, like most people, I work a normal 9-5\njob. I am hoping Patreon may help change that (at least one day).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is a Choice Game?\u003c/h2\u003e\nIn this style of game, you are the main character and select\nfrom periodic choices to direct the plot. You may have read\nchoose-your-own-type games as a kid or played video games where you make a\nchoice to advance the story. The games I create are similar\u2014you read a few\nparagraphs and then select from a list of choices to advance the story. All of\nyour choices are tracked, and the game builds a story based on your decisions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt takes a lot of time, energy, editing, and testing to make\nthese games, and my games are usually fairly complex.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\nI have always said I would never use Patreon. My games are\nsold and paid for by my readers. They already support my writing, so I felt\nlike asking them for more was unfair. I was looking at it all wrong.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen \n\u003cem\u003eZombie Exodus:\nSafe Haven \n\u003c/em\u003ewas initially released, I started seeing much more interest in\nmy work. Readers wanted to donate or support me outside of paying for my games.\nThey wanted to be a part of my game-making process and to help support the\ndevelopment of my interactive stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFans of my work also want to see me focusing on my games.\nThey want to see me consistently publishing new content on a faster schedule\nwith an even higher quality in each release.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFunding Creates Possibilities\u003c/h2\u003e\nPatrons of my work will support several endeavors:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst, I hope to one day work full-time as a writer. If I\ncan make enough to cover my salary, then I can devote my efforts into writing.\nThis goal seems like a complete dream right now, like winning the lottery. I am\nstill working toward it, and support of my patrons will contribute to that\ngoal.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, having extra funds will help augment game development.\nFrom artwork to hiring editors or even paying for contributors, I plan to set\naside a heavy chunk of the money coming in to expand my games. It\u2019s hard to\neven fathom what I could build with a staff. Maybe, one day I\u2019ll find out.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen Part 2 of Safe Haven came out, I\u2019ll admit there were\nsome readers who felt it was too short and was less immersive than Part 1. Lots\nof people are really enjoying the game but many still wish it matched Part 1\u2019s\nbreadth. One thing I have agreed to do is produce added content for Part 2. (By\nthe way, I decided to do this before Part 2 came out). I will be producing this\nextra free content at my own expense. That means I\u2019m paying for copyediting,\npaying if I want to add new graphics, and taking up my time without any\nguarantees people will continue to buy it. So, my hope is that my readers will\nsupport me, so I can continue to add free content to existing Parts.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also hoping to work with other writers, coders, and artists to contribute to my games or even produce new collaborative games. Many made from Patreon will help fund those activities, and my patrons will have access to private development details or even take part in designing scenes and characters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRewards\u003c/h2\u003e\nPatrons will receive news and updates on my games,\nnever-before-seen stories, and opportunities to influence my games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of my readers may want to support me at a low level or\ndon\u2019t have a lot of extra funds to donate. That\u2019s completely understandable.\nSome readers will be willing and able to contribute more. I don\u2019t want there to\nbe a huge gap in what one patron gets over another, but I do want to show my\nthanks in a variety of ways, so my supporters feel they are getting something\nmeaningful for their contributions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt all levels, patrons will receive dedicated posts with latest\nupdates on my games. While I am already actively answering questions on social\nmedia and the Choice of Games forums, I will make it a point to address all questions\nfrom my Patreon backers. All of my patrons will also get access to my\ndevelopment newsletter one week ahead of time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt higher levels of support, here is what I can offer:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCredit listed in my next game.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly access to beta tests.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eShort stories based on characters from \u003cem\u003eZombie Exodus (\u003c/em\u003efor example, Tom, Mindy, Carl), \u003cem\u003eZombie Exodus: Safe Haven\u003c/em\u003e (for example,\nSifer, Rachel, Madison and Brody), and other games as I work on them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTest or draft chapters from my Zombie Exodus novel.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eVoting in monthly polls to help direct the current game.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eVoting on new characters and premade\ncharacters.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eNaming of characters, locations, and pre-mades.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eIdeas for commissioned art based on characters and\nscenarios.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTop-level patrons may even be able to inspire a permanent\ncharacter for a future game and work directly with me to weave that character\ninto the story.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e"
