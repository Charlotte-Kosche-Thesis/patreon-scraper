My work will most of the time featuring bright colors and lighting, and im constantly experimenting and doing practices as well. I guarantee that my lighting and camera lens study and works will be very interesting since it took my life and time to study it and it will be available in PSD file. Most of the time i made something original rather than fanart to power up my creative points (lol) but I do made fanart once in a while. I also like to draw mecha here and there so expect a full load of shits from me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will become a very good motivation for me to continue creating work that i like. I will do my best to give you guys the most suitable works of mine as a return.Peace YO!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do my Patreon work?\u003cbr\u003eOk this is pretty easy to explain. My Patreon run by payment per month. Like example 1USD per month as a support for me. So you also can get all my related works first-hand, not second-hand. Just in case, my PSD file will be deleted every three months after I had posted to prevent any discomfort for other new patreon to keep it fair. But other things will be keep just as it is so just grab any as you like!!\u00a0"
