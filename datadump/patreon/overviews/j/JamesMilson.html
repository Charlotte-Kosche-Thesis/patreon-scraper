    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eGoing\u00a0by \u2018Jim\u2019 mostly, I spend my time writing and creating things. With four grown children, being a sole empty nester now and an Eagle Scout from years ago, I have always enjoyed a love of conservation and the outdoors. Having lived with a physical disability and overcoming inherent limitations all my life, I have developed a deep empathy for children going thru illness and disabilities, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople sometimes ask me \u2013 \u003cem\u003e\u201cWhy do I write?\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe answer is twofold, with the first part being because somehow, without being able to explain it, I feel called to this purpose, with my whole life to this point in the preparation of bringing messages of Kindness, Positivity, and Encouragement to others, while also helping to reconnect readers to the natural world around us. Taking care of our world today, so there is a better tomorrow for our children. \u00a0I sit down, and the words flow. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the second reason, equally important, is \u2013 \u003cem\u003e\u201cbecause of you!\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0We are all in this together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAll of my writing is done with the purposeful intention of being Entertaining, Educational, and Informational, and is \u2018G\u2019 rated making it suitable for all ages and audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jamesmilson.com \" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWriting \u0026amp; Creativity Blog\u003c/a\u003e is devoted solely to the subjects of Children, Family, Kindness, Positivity, Mother Nature, and Conservation, and features many Short Works and Free Reads available to everyone, including pieces of original poetry and short stories.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI spend a great deal of time writing about an imaginary bear who resides in my head whose name is Little Red Bear. Together we tell of Red\u2019s and his friends\u2019 ongoing adventures in the Ozarks Mountain Country where he lives in his log cabin on Honey Hill, overlooking Hoppers Holler below, in an area where the humans and animals communicate and live side-by-side as friends and neighbors, interacting as equals. Little Red Bear is an uncommonly special bear.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePublished as standalone, single-subject books or as short story collections with several stories included,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/41bu9u \" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"The Adventures of Little Red Bear\"\u003c/a\u003e stories are family-friendly and told in an old-fashioned, by-the-fireside storytelling manner, featuring themes of Kindness, Positivity, Helping Others, and learning more about and to appreciate Mother Nature. With a little humor tossed in here and there for fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories have been enjoyed and well-received by all ages, from the young to seniors and the young-at-heart, and\u00a0compared by reviewers to\u00a0Beatrix Potter\u0027s \"Tales of Peter Rabbit\" and Kenneth Grahame\u0027s \"Wind in the Willows\". Exciting new projects are underway to bring Little Red Bear and his neighborhood friends to beginning and pre-readers in picture book format in the coming months, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEducational research has shown that making a personal connection often results in increased interest and stimulates greater learning about a topic. Years ago, people were intimately connected and involved with the natural world around them. In today\u2019s modern world, not so much. It is difficult for most of us to get \u201cup close and personal\u201d with wildlife and the ever-diminishing natural world today. With the environment and so many species under threat, Mother Nature needs our help now more than ever. By humanizing the characters, the \u201cLittle Red Bear\u201d stories attempt to bridge the gap, working to stimulate interest and to create that personal caring connection to wildlife and the natural world thru the stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to writing, I have been creating vintage style teddy bears and raggedy dolls for adult collectors for many years, along with artisan style jewelry sold in my \u003ca href=\"http://stores.ebay.com/oldglorybearsandraggedydolls\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Old Glory Bears \u0026amp; Raggedy Dolls Store\u003c/a\u003e on eBay and in my \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/JamesMilsonCreations?ref=search_shop_redirect\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Etsy Shoppe\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I will continue doing that, my goal is to devote less time to creating collector-quality bears and dolls for adults in the future, and more time and effort to making child-safe and huggable teddy bears and dolls to freely distribute to hospitalized children, along with free Little Red Bear books for older children and the coming picture books for beginning and pre-readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have steadfastly refused to monetize my writing and creativity blog by incorporating advertisers and will continue to do so, to never distract from positive messages and to avoid conflicting, contradictory, and questionably tasteless or offensive ad messages appearing, over which I would have no control, so receive no offsetting ad revenues or incomes from my site.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThru small monthly pledges and encouragement, Patrons allow me to keep it all going by helping to offset my writing blog and book production costs and to provide materials for producing the dolls and teddy bears for children.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I have never refused a request for a free copy of a Little Red Bear book when someone could not afford it for themselves or their family. Patron support allows me to continue doing that for folks and families in need, in addition to being able to further expand the effort by offering print copies of the books to senior centers and to school and public libraries, helping to encourage Children\u0027s Literacy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery pledge is helpful and means so much, reassuring that there are still folks who care about wholesome and beneficial reading entertainment and spreading kindness. A small pledge of $1, $3, or $5 a month can help my friend Little Red Bear and me to reach out to greater numbers of readers and children, and to possibly make a big or even life-changing difference for someone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You for visiting!\u00a0 I look forward to your support by joining our Patron Community to help spread a bit more Kindness in the world. -- Jim (and Red!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you prefer, you are welcome to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/JamesMilsonWriter\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emake a one-time donation\u003c/a\u003e to support my writing and work. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
