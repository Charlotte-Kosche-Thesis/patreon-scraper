More educational printouts and behind the scenes videos!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Become a patron to get access to all the patron-only worksheets and miniature books you can download and print yourself. Each month I release a special video just for patrons where I go through the month by numbers, telling you exactly how many books I sold, the number of views the channel had, how much I earned on Patreon, and what we spent that money on. It\u0027s an intimate and honest look at the challenges and opportunities of being a creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.

Space travel is expensive, so this one\u0027s only possible with a lot of support from patrons like you. But I hope we\u0027ll get there! Science Warrior has an interesting perspective on the social issues facing humanity today.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://jennyballif.com/images/Goal4.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Patrons also get cool rewards\u003c/strong\u003e like being on the Periodic Table of Patrons, or being a Pen Pal and receiving a personal note from me (and usually a cool miniature book) in the mail each month. Check out the options by looking to the bar on your right (if you\u0027re on a desktop computer) or scrolling all the way down (if you\u0027re on a cell phone).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT ABOUT A ONE TIME DONATION?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would prefer to give a one time donation, you can do so via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/ScienceMom\"\u003ehttps://www.paypal.me/ScienceMom.\u003c/a\u003e It might be helpful to you to know that if you ever have a month where the budget is tight, you can freeze your support on Patreon so that no funds are withdrawn during that month. You can also cancel your patronage at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you aren\u0027t in a position to contribute a monthly pledge to Patreon, you can still be a champion of science by sharing my videos and guides. Every time you share, tweet, or post about my videos or the foldable books, it makes a difference!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you do have the means to contribute a few dollars a month, you\u0027ll have my enduring gratitude. $5 a month might not make a noticeable difference to your monthly budget, but don\u0027t let that trick you into thinking it won\u0027t make a difference to me. It does! Every pledge is a huge help. Not only because you\u2019re bringing me closer to the security of knowing I\u0027ll be able to keep the best job ever, but because I\u0027m so happy to know that you value these school visits and videos. I dance for joy each time someone joins us here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn gratitude for your support,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScience Mom"
