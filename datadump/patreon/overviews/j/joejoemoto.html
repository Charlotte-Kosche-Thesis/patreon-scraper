Ever. I want my stuff to always be free and accessible to everyone, and as long as I can help it, it always will be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Come Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to YouTube\u0027s glorious \"adpocalypse\", it has become increasingly difficult to get by month-to-month, despite the consistent, regular uploads that have been able to pay for what I do up until now. Despite my current situation, I would rather continue to create the videos I want to create and not have enough to pay my bills, over the alternative of turning into a commercial for other companies and products. BUT, it doesn\u0027t have to be that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou and Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u003c/strong\u003e are the reason I make these videos. \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u003c/strong\u003e are the reason why my YouTube channel exists, and it\u0027s only because of \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e that I have the opportunity to make these videos and to help you look forward to Mondays. Whether or not you\u0027re a patron, I love ya. If you enjoy my videos, that makes me happy and that\u0027s all I want. But to keep doing it, I can use your help, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e \u2764\ufe0f\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge $1 per upload, you\u0027ll be a \u003cstrong\u003eHUGE\u003c/strong\u003e help! Seriously, I know it sounds like nothing, but one dollar per upload per person is WAY more than I get on YouTube. You\u0027ll also get access to basic Patreon stuff like private posts and polls. You\u0027re welcome to pledge as much (or as little) as you like and as I get more support, I\u0027ll start doing more things like live Q\u0026amp;As, videos and giveaways!"
