    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAbout Me\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jordan Dowling, I\u0027m 21 years old and I\u0027m a passionate games developer and graphics designer. I work really hard to please my audience, I am here today to give you why you should subscribe to my patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you subscribe?\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to create a game where people have a say on what happens in the game such as features and one thing I have promised to my audience is that I will always listen and respect the community. A lot of game developers these days allow money to blind them. Yes, it\u0027s an overwhelming amount of money but that should not block your vision on creating a game that is enjoyable to play. My aim is to create a game that everyone enjoys and loves. To get that from you I need to listen which I have been doing throughout my development of PatientX.\u003cbr\u003eI started a Patreon to help with funds for myself (living costs) and the game development throughout the continuous years. I\u0027m not saying you must, but it will help me massively. You can donate as little as \u00a31. There are rewards for donating and roles in the PatientX: Survivalist discord.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Game Information\u003cbr\u003ePatientX: Survivalist is an online, open-world, post-apocalyptic, survival game proudly powered by Unreal Engine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo one could\u2019ve seen this coming. The crash or the horrific aftermath that ensued. It all started with Hanger 07, the military base in Lochdell. Hanger 07 was a mysterious place, no knew what actually went on in there. That day had started like any other, until the plane crash. People started getting sick, bed-ridden for days until their hearts just stopped. This illness became very common in the first few days after the crash.\u003cbr\u003eThe government had come and told everyone to evacuate but it was already too late. Those that hearts had stopped were up and moving again, but they were no longer people. These things were grotesque and deformed, no one knew what had happened to them. These monsters were extremely hostile and showed no scrap of humanity as they ripped into their victims. The people attacked by the monsters then became the monsters.\u003cbr\u003eThe government tried to stop them but there were too many and were eventually overrun. A year after the event, there are still survivors living in Lochdell, somehow immune to the virus. Don\u2019t be quick to trust them, they are bandits and murderers. This is a man eat man world. To make it, you must forge your own path."

Our aim is to produce a survival game that is ideal for everyone, so what we do is listen to your feedback, work upon it and make changes.
