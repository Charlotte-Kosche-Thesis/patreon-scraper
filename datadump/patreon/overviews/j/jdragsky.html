    "summary": "Hi everyone, my name is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jdragsky.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJay Dragon\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027m a young queer game designer. I write Tabletop RPGs, LARPs, and even a Text-Based RPG system, with a perspective on building communities, engaging in ritual, and immersing oneself in a shared fiction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho I Am\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 21 years old, and have spent much of my life growing up in the Hudson Valley, in upstate New York. The area is equal parts financially impoverished and intensely beautiful, and has served to give me an aesthetic appreciation for both the majesty of nature and the authenticity of the broken-down. I\u0027ve spent the past eight years working at the Wayfinder Experience, a LARP summer camp for teenagers in my home area. I also attend Bennington College in Vermont, where I study art history, aesthetic philosophy, and basically \"how we see the world and how we can teach that to others\". I\u0027m queer, intensely so, and bring that queerness into my writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Write\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs mentioned, I\u0027m a writer of Tabletop RPGs (role-playing games) and LARPs (Live Action Roleplaying Games). I tell stories about friendship, queerness, apocalypse, and transformation. My games are about what it\u0027s like to discover yourself in the face of certain doom. I\u0027ve written games like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/238946\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQueer Messes\u003c/a\u003e, which are about a group of queer teenagers learning what it\u0027s like to be alive in the face of a collapsing friend group. I\u0027ve also been writing games for the Wayfinder Experience for eight years, and have run more than 25 games, each for 50-70 people. To me, game design is about curating and exploring an experience that offers the ability to transform you and enter a new space.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat This Is\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis Patreon is the opportunity for me to share my games with the world. I\u0027m still new to the larger gamewriting scene, but this Patreon gives me both the ability to focus on my games as a career (instead of as a pastime) and to help me go to conventions and conferences to help learn and teach. Much of the focus of this Patreon is to help develop the concept of games into a mechanism for real, interpersonal change.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a backer of this Patreon, you will get access to all of the following:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst access to weekly blog posts and discussion pages where I go into detail about a particular aspect of game design.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll unfinished games I have posted or will post here, with my thoughts on their design and support in running them.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePolls to help guide my creative process and my focuses.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Current Projects\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the moment, I\u0027m posting about the following things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eEsoteric, \u003c/em\u003ea LARP that you can\u0027t talk about, and how that relates to the Magic Circle Theory.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003ePromethean: The Unborn, \u003c/em\u003ea Powered by the Apocalypse hack of White Wolf\u0027s \u003cem\u003ePromethean, \u003c/em\u003ewhich turns the game into a radical allegory for transness and rage in a cruel and senseless world.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Last Days of Solomon, \u003c/em\u003ea totally new, incredibly ambitious text-based roleplaying game system about nobles plotting to survive in a dying city.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eMotherlode, \u003c/em\u003ea Wayfinder LARP about miners learning how to unionize.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"

     "about": "Jay Dragon is a LARP (live-action roleplay) writer, both freelance and for the Wayfinder Experience, for the past half a decade. They were born in 1997 in Upstate New York, and from a young age was involved in imaginative roleplay. In 2009 they began attending \u003ca href=\"https://www.wayfinderexperience.com/\"\u003ethe Wayfinder Experience\u003c/a\u003e, an improvisational roleplay summer camp, and began working for the company in one capacity or another in 2012. They wrote their first adventure game in 2011 for an audience of over fifty participants, and have run at least one game a summer since then. In 2011, they also founded Independent Productions, a independent group of roleplayers who engaged in amateur story-telling in their back yards. In 2014, Jay Dragon co-founded Frontier Adventures with Wayfinder, a fundraising program and an opportunity to introduce Wayfinder\u2019s particular model of live-action roleplay to young adults who can\u2019t access it otherwise. Collectively, they\u2019re run more than 25 adventure games, to a wide and diverse audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJay Dragon connects their writing style to traditional and quasi-druidic traditions of ritual and community storytelling. They believe heavily in the power of ritualized storytelling, and the power of LARP and Tabletop Roleplaying as a tool for connecting with other people and engaging in the spiritual. They focus on immersive, emotional, and complex stories, that encourage emotions one doesn\u2019t normally have an opportunity to experience. They enjoy experimenting with new modes of communication (including limiting speech or movement), creating immersive mechanics that alter how you engage in the fiction, and focusing on the natural beauty of the play space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJay Dragon is currently attending school at Bennington College for an undergraduate degree in Art History and Curatorial Studies, and they tend to find themself scattered across the Hudson Valley and Vermont.\u003cbr\u003e",
