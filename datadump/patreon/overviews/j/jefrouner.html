    "summary": "Hi,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is Jef\nRouner. They used to call me Jef With One F, and I am a freelance blogger and\nauthor of short stories. If you\u2019re watching this it\u2019s probably because you\u2019ve\ncome across my work at some point.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI wrote a pretty\nfamous piece about the difference between fact and opinion that was\ninternationally viral, lauded by a scientist who was decorated with a\npresidential medal, and is now taught as part of several college courses.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOr you may\nknow me from my examination of Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker as the hero of The Dark\nKnight. Or from my many, many, MANY articles about Doctor Who. Or from my\nfeminist writings against dress code shaming, online harassment,\nrepresentations in media, and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese works\nare things I am super proud of\u2026 but if you want to make a living as a writer\nthen you have to make a lot of them. Sometimes a truly mind-numbing amount just\nto keep the lights on. It leaves little time for quality when you\u2019re constantly\nworried about quantity, and nearly all of my best pieces were written in the\nquiet space following some sort of small financial windfall that allowed that\nquiet. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am also a\nfiction writer, mostly of horror short stories. The majority of these appear in\nmy ongoing series, The Rook Circle. Subjects range from vampires to drive-thru\nchurches to the Krampus. Though they tend to be scary, the stories have found\na remarkable amount of near-universal praise on Amazon, partially because they\ntend to deal with the same social justice themes I champion in my blogging. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFinding time\nto write fiction instead of blogs as well as marketing is the most daunting\nobstacle I currently have as an author. With monthly donations providing a\nsmall cushion it\u2019s something I can more easily pull off.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is not\nasking something for free. Each patron will receive free eBooks of everything I\never publish, no matter how small. In addition, patrons will get sneak peaks at\nnew stories as I finish them. I am also offering secret second editions of my popular short Word of the Day series. That\u0027s two humorous, bizarre short tales in your inbox every day!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the last\nseven years I have been working hard to build myself as a writer, and in doing\nso hopefully bring a voice for change and a bit of whimsy into the world. With\nyour help, I can continue to do so. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

You can usually find him talking about feminism, goth music, Doctor Who, and video games over at the Houston Press art blog. He pens bizarre short stories because no one tells him not to, and currently resides in Houston with his wife and daughter.",
