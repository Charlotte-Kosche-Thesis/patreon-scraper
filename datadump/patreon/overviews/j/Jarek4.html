    "summary": "Hey every one! Thanks for finding your way to my patreon. I am very blessed to have a job as enjoyable as I do. That said this is a full time job, and I do use the income from my channels to survive. (Rent, bills, etc) Over the last year, large companies have been boycotting youtube, and pulling their ads from the site. This has majorly hurt my revenue and put me in a position where I need to ask for help. I don\u0027t expect any one to contribute any thing more than simply watching my videos. The community that has grown around my channel is awesome enough, and I love being around it. But if you feel like contributing further, it would be a tremendous help to the growth of my channels and simply paying rent. With more income comes bigger and greater projects. I am always looking to push the quality of the content I produce, and I am never content with my content!"
