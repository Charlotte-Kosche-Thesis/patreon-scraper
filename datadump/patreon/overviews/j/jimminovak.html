My dream is to become a full-time writer and author and sharing my thoughts with the world that way.\u003cbr\u003eBecause of supernatural\u00a0and it\u0027s wonderful loving fans (you), I have discovered how important it is for me to write. I\u0027ve grown more than I could ever have thought in the years I\u0027ve been writing and have been given the courage to continue and always keep fighting for my (sometimes impossible, but inspiring) dreams.\u00a0 Without my readers and supporters and \u003cem\u003efriends\u003c/em\u003e, I would be nowhere close to where I am now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://jimminovak.tumblr.com/tagged/my-fic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy writing\u003c/a\u003e is almost always about the greatest love story ever told, a profound bond, the man afraid of flying and the angel afraid of falling, meeting in the middle. The ideas and plans I have for upcoming stories give me so much excitement for what I\u0027ll be able to make in the future, long (\u003cem\u003elong\u003c/em\u003e) stories as well as small drabbles I create, hoping to make someone\u0027s day better (:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m a student I\u0027m unable to have a full-time job I get paid for but there are things I\u0027ll have to pay either way. I\u0027m currently struggling through life with mental abuse, anxiety, and depression and needless to say, this increases the difficulties in my\u00a0current situation. This simply means that \u003cstrong\u003eany kind of support \u003c/strong\u003ewould mean the world to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAll things I have written thus far are free for you to read on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jimminovak.tumblr.com/tagged/my-fic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/hungrydean\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e ao3 \u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Anything I write will stay free, but there will be some extra goodies for you if you become my patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become my patron, you will give a minimum of $1 each month. You can give as much or as little as you want/can, \u003cstrong\u003eI love every single donation regardless\u003c/strong\u003e. You\u0027ll pay by credit card or Paypal each month. This way, you don\u0027t have to pay for a fic specifically, but can support me for writing anything in general, long stories and short ones all the same.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course I understand if you\u0027re not able to support me financially right now.\u003cstrong\u003e Liking, reblogging, leaving a kudo, a comment, telling me and others if you enjoyed my work\u003c/strong\u003e helps me enormously as well! It gives me a huge boost to continue writing, knowing what I do is enjoyed by you, the reader!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDisclaimer: I do not own Supernatural or any of its characters, original works, etc. I write for it because I know how much it can help and mean to people and this is simply a way for you to show me you enjoy me being able to live my life and write at the same time. Once, hopefully, my original work will be able to be shared as well.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e"
