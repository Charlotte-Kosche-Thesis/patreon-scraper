    "summary": "Hello everyone! \u003cbr\u003eMy name is Joann and I have a YouTube channel, \"JoAnn\u0027s School\".\u00a0 I\u0027m counting on your kindness and generosity to keep it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in the Midwest, spending most of my life in the Chicago area.\u00a0 I\u0027ve always loved dogs and have had many furry best friends throughout my life. (I lost my Barley in May of 2016 after he gave me 16 years of unconditional love...maybe you\u0027ve seen the video I made on \"Male dog diaper trick for old dogs\" on YouTube?\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d70f7fNcFg4\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d70f7fNcFg4\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the decades, I have proudly helped students receive awards for \nmost improved, skip grades, avoid summer school, and pass their GED.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve watched them start their own businesses, enter and graduate college. Each of their accomplishments has warmed my heart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI married, had 4 children (3 sons and 1 daughter), and lived in Chicago proper. I Home schooled my children for grade school for a year. They returned to the school system when their grandmother moved in to have hospice care (She passed away 7 months later).\u00a0 After my two youngest sons had a horrible first year of public high school, we realized homeschooling was the solution. One Algebra teacher told me that he \"loved\" my son attending his class, though he gave him an F, because my son sat in the back of the room and never bothered him. This teacher had almost 40 students in his classroom. My youngest son, who had always been an \"A\" and \"B\" student, began to receive failing grades that first semester. We pulled them out, then took their education into our own hands.\u00a0 Both sons were able to complete their high school requirements within 18 months. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn \nthe fall of 2015, I started making YouTube Math videos for my \ngrandchildren. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I realized that I can STILL make a contribution to \nsociety, teach, and help students reach their goals. Thank goodness for the YouTube platform! I plan to make as \nmany useful videos as possible. Then, go back and remake the ones that \nneed to be more clear and concise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Math videos range in levels from 1st grade to Algebra II and Geometry. I\u0027m constantly making new videos and updating the old ones. My \ngoal is to help anyone with math that needs it.\nWhether trying to stay ahead of the class, keep up with the class or \npass the GED, my math videos are there to help you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe we need to keep our sense of humor when confronted with difficulties. Most of my students have had a hard time with the vocabulary, terminology\n used in mathematics. So, I created cartoon characters, \nsuch as the \"Sad Variable\", who reminds the coefficient that it\u0027s \"just a\n number without him\" (he\u0027s sad because he doesn\u0027t know his own \nidentity). I have \"2D Bob\", who upon turning sideways becomes a thin line, and\n his cousin \"3D Dave\". There is the mother \nBluebird feeding her babies in a parentheses nest, to show the concept \nof the Distributive Property. I also have \"Cross-eyed Irrational Pi\" and\n his buddy \"Square of 2\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s\n nothing more annoying than to be frustrated by a math concept and \nseeking a quick answer...then not having the resources to get help. Not only does it scramble the minds\n of those with ADD and ADHD, it annoys students who \"just want an answer\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to keep my YouTube videos available to the world. I can\u0027t do this \nwithout you. I am asking for your kindness to help with any amount you \ncan. Though a great platform for sharing knowledge, YouTube is not a way\n to sustain a living unless you have numerous viral videos (Math just doesn\u0027t go viral). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s\n where Pateon comes to the rescue! If I can earn enough each month from \nPatreon...I\u0027ll be able to make ends meet, buy teaching supplies, completely support myself, pay for veterinary visits and \nfeed my dogs, maintain my home, and live without fear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy math videos are seen WORLDWIDE. One-third of my viewers are from disadvantage areas where the possibility of going to school, attending a Math class or hiring a tutor is impossible (especially for females). Through the wonder of technology, a cell phone, a tablet, my lessons are available to them. This is an HONORABLE CAUSE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, generously support my efforts! \u003cbr\u003eHelp support Joann\u0027s School on YouTube! \u003cbr\u003eHelp support my dogs Lola and Bitsy.\u003cbr\u003eEven a dollar or two will help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting this site!\u003cbr\u003eWe can do this together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoann\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf my videos have helped you...please, please help me in return. Thank you!"

I never healed properly, and it forced me\n from my loved career and left me disabled. I missed my students, \nteaching and helping others. It has always been my goal to help any \nstudent possible.
