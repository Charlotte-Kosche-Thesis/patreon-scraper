    "summary": "I am really excited to finally begin creating\u00a0my own music, and it all becomes possible because of YOU! I will\u00a0draw upon the past 35 years of education, experience in performance, various instruments\u00a0and musical influences, and personal quirks\u00a0to bring you an original and varied expression of myself. You will be part of a musical and blogging\u00a0journey where you will see unfinished and finished music, giving you\u00a0intimate\u00a0insight into\u00a0my creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had no formal training in composition, but have had formal training in Medieval, Baroque, and modern music with and without electronics as a recorder player; I have had education in Classical and Romantic music as a clarinettist, and have had experience playing in a progressive jazz band on recorders, clarinet and percussion; I have played in orchestras and chamber ensembles, performed in churches, concert halls, and in the Opera House. I have also run workshops for advanced and beginner recorder players and I currently teach recorder and clarinet lessons as well as conduct primary and high school concert bands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a Bachelor of Music with First Class Honours from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music as well as a Masters in Music from the same institution. My honours thesis and performance was on the acoustical interactions of recorders and the human voice, and my Masters\u00a0focused on modern music for recorders and electronics. Lots of fun things to play with there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a different note, I have also been interested in the healing capabilities of the human body, and on vibrational healing therapies. I did most of a dual Diploma in Kinesiology and Mind/Body Medicine, during which I learned about many relationships between certain frequencies and certain systems in the body (organs, meridians, etc.), and I will be using some of these ideas as inspiration or grounds for composition too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be drawing inspiration from almost anything I can think of, but I am told the music you listen to influences you in strange ways as well... I love listening to Bjork, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Tom Waits, Prince,\u00a0Rachmaninov, Bach, Chopin, almost any baroque chamber music (nerdy, I know)...... you may hear these influences in the music I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have collected random objects over the years because I like their sound (random sound object hoarder!),\u00a0and I own real instruments aplenty. I have many recorders of different sizes (yes, recorders... the world\u0027s most underrated instruments!), a clarinet in Bb, some drums and percussion-type things, a guitar and\u00a0a violin (both of which I mess around with but don\u0027t play at any kind of professional level... yet!), a collection of bells (mostly purchased from garage sales and markets), and other bits and pieces.\u00a0Since my brother\u00a0has a pretty neat setup in the shed and I am now his roommate,\u00a0I have access to recording equipment and software and am keen\u00a0to move away from playing other people\u0027s music and make some music of my own!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know what type of music it will be, in fact, there will most likely be many different types of mixing genres and rhythmic and melodic influences everywhere from Bach to Bjork. And I am not interested in always having a \u0027finished product\u0027 before sharing either. I want this to be raw. I want it to be messy. I want you to be part of my journey... to see the unfinished pieces and thought processes which go on behind\u00a0the scenes. You will be able to comment throughout the creative process and therefore be part of the discovery of where my knowledge and training will lead me creatively!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound good? Want to be part of a creative musical journey\u00a0limited only by\u00a0our combined imaginations? Then sign up for as a beloved patron and let\u0027s get going!!!\u003cbr\u003e(please note: all $ amounts are in US$)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
