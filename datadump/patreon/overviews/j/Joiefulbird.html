    "summary": "Hey guys, thanks for considering supporting me as I create Plushies and Fursuits. By supporting me, you are making it possible for me to continue to create My Little Pony fanart in my own way, and helping me keep the prices of my commissions as low as possible. Don\u0027t feel obligated to read the rest of the about, it\u0027s a bit long and rambling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was inspired to begin making plushies at age 17 by the convention \"Ponyville Ciderfest 2016\" in Milwaukee, WI where I walked the vendor hall surrounded by beautiful artwork and fantastic artists interacting with their fans. While prints, charms, games, and ribbons were abundant however, I was disappointed to find a lack of stuffed animal ponies. The ones I did see were amazing, but cost at the least $50 to $80, and I couldn\u0027t afford them. I then decided that I wanted to learn how to make plushies, so when I got home, I got to work. I found a free pattern online (made by Voodoo-Tiki, highly reccomended) and created my first pony plush: an 18 inch replica of my friend\u0027s OC. It took me about 6 months, but I was delighted with how it came out! (of course now I look back and cringe at my ineptitude XD). Ever since I have been creating, teaching my young friends the skill of hand-sewing, and continuously improving, refining, and learning new techniques as I continue to bring characters from my favorite TV show to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet, it could not last. I am now an adult. I have a job, responsibilities, etc. I\u0027ve moved to a different state, so my contact with my young friends and my brony friends is limited to text and online chat platforms. I\u0027ve tried to keep up, commissioning plushies from strangers on twitter, but it just isn\u0027t enough anymore. I got the idea from Nazgoreng, a fellow plushie creator, to start a Patreon page. Hopefully if this works, I\u0027ll be able to continue creating and learning without having to raise my commission prices to a point that I would be charging more than I would pay for something, because that is my goal. I would LOVE to be able to keep my prices low enough that the average person could have a plushie, whether it be of their OC or their favorite MLP character.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eORIGINAL PATTERN RULES:\u003cbr\u003eWhenever I pattern something new (Mostly Manes/Tails) those in my $20 tier at the time will be sent an image of the pattern and basic written instructions on how to assemble it. I ask that by signing up for this tier you agree to the following rules:\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eDo not share the image or the instructions\u003c/strong\u003e that I send you, on any form of social media or with any other creators\u003cbr\u003e-You \u003cstrong\u003eARE ALLOWED TO SELL THINGS MADE WITH MY PATTERNS, but please CREDIT me\u003c/strong\u003e"
