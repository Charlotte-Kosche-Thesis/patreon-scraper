    "summary": "Juliana\u2019s Animal Sanctuary is literally\nthe only hope for farmed animals in\u003cbr\u003e\nColombia and the only project to provide help by rescuing them from\u003cbr\u003e\nsuffering or providing emergency medical care.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are the first sanctuary established\nin South America\u003cbr\u003e\nand is currently the only one in Colombia. We have also established strong\u003cbr\u003e\neducational programs, including vegan cooking workshops, vegan comics, vegan\u003cbr\u003e\nfood relief and strong social media activism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nJuliana\u2019s Animal Sanctuary was founded in 2008 in Colombia. However, the\u003cbr\u003e\nproject has its roots in Juliana\u2019s initial desire to save all the world\u2019s\nanimals when\u003cbr\u003e\nshe learned about the suffering of animals as a 5-year old girl. At age 11 she\u003cbr\u003e\nbegan saving money to build her project and by age 26 she purchased her first\u003cbr\u003e\nproperty. However, in pursuing her dream, Juliana faced numerous challenges,\u003cbr\u003e\nincluding a public that did not even understand the meaning of a sanctuary,\nlegal\u003cbr\u003e\nbattles for her land, lack of funds and an overwhelming demand of animals in\u003cbr\u003e\nneed. In 2015, the project was registered as a 501c3 charity in Maryland, USA\u003cbr\u003e\nand with this brought a new source of funds and support from overseas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eToday, the project cares for 93 animals on a new 10,000 sqm property in\nColombia.\u003cbr\u003e49 dogs, 18 chickens, 6 rabbits, 4 cows, 3 pigs, 2 turkeys, 1 turtle, 1 horse, and 2 rats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have an annual budget of $150,000 to\ncover the expenses for providing first-\u003cbr\u003e\nclass food, shelter and medical care for the animals under our care, as well\nas\u003cbr\u003e\nanimals in need outside of the sanctuary, and our amazing strong educational\nprograms.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDonations made to Juliana\u2019s Animal\nSanctuary enable us to provide the absolute\u003cbr\u003e\nthe best life for the animals under our care, as well as empower our\nvegan advocacy\u003cbr\u003e\nprojects for the Colombia population and most importantly, to address the\nroot\u003cbr\u003e\ncause of animal abuse \u2013 inequality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOur Mission and Objectives\u003c/h2\u003eTo teach through example and precept that all animals deserve respect and protection and to teach Equality for all Beings.
