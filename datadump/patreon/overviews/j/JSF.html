    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u003c/strong\u003e My name is Jaylen Smith-Fry, the owner of JSF Motorsports, and welcome to our Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn December 2017, it was announced that on September 22-23rd,\n2018 the race track I work at (Baer Field Motorsports Park) will run an unprecedented\nevent for a United States short oval track, a 24-hour endurance race! This race\nis for street cars, with a few modifications for safety, with a 500-car maximum\namount of entries. So, there\u2019ll be a lot of entries, and will be a very affordable\nway to enter racing!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs soon as it was announced I posted it all over and a lot\nof my sim-racing friends saw it\u2026and got seriously interested, and I was equally\ninterested. Not just in the event itself, but *racing* in it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, once all the details we needed came out, we decided that\nwe are going to do just that. Buy a car, get it ready, and go out and run in a\n24-hour race!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe team currently consists of 5 drivers:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJaylen Smith-Fry, \u201cJMSF32\u201d of Columbia City,\nIndiana, USA.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTyler Powers, \u201cpowers2440\u201d of Bangor,\nPennsylvania, USA.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNiall Geoghegan, \"NCWG4\" of Limerick,\nIreland.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlex Linnie, \"Alexnessie\" of Highlands,\nScotland.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJan Magne Tjensvold, \"MagnetOS\" of Stavanger,\nNorway.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\nYes, you are reading that correctly, we are an international\nteam! The five of us were first brought together a couple years ago via online\nsim-racing leagues. Since then a community has formed around that, and a\nmajority of the racers from the league are still around in the group today.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTHE CAR:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/noQf8We.jpg\" style=\"width: 320px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BCbtQ06.jpg\" style=\"width: 321px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYep, we already have the car! This is a 1994 Honda Accord EX\n(which I\u2019ve decided to name \u201cVicky\u201d), and you are looking at what will be the\n#07 JSF Motorsports entry to the Grocery Getter Classic! While cosmetically it\nisn\u2019t the best, mechanically it is in immaculate shape\u2026just what we need to\nmake it to the end of the race. So far so very good in my time testing it out,\nand this purchase sealed the deal. We are going racing!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eNow for the nitty\ngritty, why this page exists at all. We created this page not to say \u201cWe need\nmoney to be able to race\u201d, no, no, no. This page is simply so we can make this\nevent even better. Regardless of any amount, we WILL be running this race! In\nother words, this page is putting it out there that our group is looking to go\nout there and have some fun racing a car for 24-hours, and, if anyone would\nlike to, you can support us in doing just that!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat will your patronage go to?

We have a lot of ideas swirling on what we can do with\nthis!\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eSpare parts (tires, parts, repair tools, and the\nlike. 24-hours is a long time, we\u2019ll need to plan and prep for anything!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eTravel costs, i.e. the drivers getting to the\ntrack, getting the car to the track, and the like.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWE ARE ALSO OPEN FOR SPONSORSHIPS!\u003c/strong\u003e There\u2019s plenty of\nroom to put your logo.
