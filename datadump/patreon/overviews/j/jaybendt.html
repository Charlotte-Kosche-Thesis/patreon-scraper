Welcome to my patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit about me: \u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Jay, and I am a freelance illustrator mostly working in editorial and book illustration. A few years ago I created this patreon\u00a0to try and help raise funds so that I could find the time between all that career stuff to dedicate to more personal projects, be it sketchbooks, illustrations, or painting, and indulge in what I love most: mythology and girls sprinkled with a dash of anime goodness, because sometimes a girl just wants to draw mermaids and witchy girls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e So what would you be funding?\u003c/strong\u003e Right now, your support would allow me to be able to dedicate a bit of time to this endeavor daily, and even though I am still trying to figure out how to do this well (suggestions are always highly encouraged!), here are some of the things your hard earned $$ a month would help me create:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTraditional Paintings!\u003c/strong\u003e I want to work more in my sketchbook with watercolor, and show you guys the process as I go along, as well as give you all a copy of the lineart to play with monthly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital paintings \u0026amp; Illustrations! \u003c/strong\u003eThis is my bread and butter, but I don\u0027t want to always just draw and paint for work. I\u0027d like to do this more for fun, and you guys would get to see a monthly roundup of those things, as well as step by steps for the higher tiers.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Prompt Sketchbook! \u003c/strong\u003eRight now I have prompted myself to make art around the Zodiac, so each month loosely follows the zodiac sign for it. My sketchbook is where all my ideation happens, so there\u0027ll be fun, finished sketches sometimes, and then some days there\u0027ll be a lot of small bits of my process like thumbnails and roughs that help me figure out how to approach the subject. In essence, you guys get to see a side of my process I show nobody else online.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideos and streams! \u003c/strong\u003eI am hoping to start streaming and creating videos more consistently while I work! this is the big one and the one that is hardest to achieve while I am spending most of my free time freelancing, because it eats up the time to spend streaming! currently streams are for higher tiers only, but with enough support, my hope is to make streams available to all patrons.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA monthly illustration! \u003c/strong\u003ethis is based on the prompt sketchbook, since my hope is to create more fantasy work based on those drawings and ideas that come to life there.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get in return?\u003c/strong\u003e Check out the tiers on the side! I always aim to try and provide as much great content as I can within the limitations of my time, so your support right now would be buying me more of said time to continue proving you guys with more. And if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at \u003cstrong\u003ehello@jaybendt.com\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to help a gal out but can\u0027t commit to a monthly pledge, then consider tossing a few bucks into my coffee fund over at\u003ca href=\"http://ko-fi.com/jaybendt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e ko-fi.com/jaybendt\u003c/a\u003e and thank you for checking out my patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
