    "summary": "I am a content creator on YouTube that has strayed away from monetizing my videos since the beginning (my first uploads were in early 2009). I wholeheartedly believe in the meritocracy and freedom that is YouTube--you only watch the stuff you like and you watch it when you want to. And while I now monetize some of my content, I never want the number of views (and therefore ad revenue) to impact my content. I have always made exactly what I want to and what I am proud of... I don\u0027t plan on changing that anytime soon. That being said, I put a lot of time in to my channel and am a full-time college student studying Computer Science and Engineering. I also recently quit my job to put more effort into my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is what brings me to Patreon. \u003cstrong\u003eBy pledging any amount per month, you are first and foremost supporting \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e--as a creator, as a student, and as a human. \u003c/strong\u003eThe money I receive from Patreon will go directly to making better videos for you, whether that be through buying production equipment, licensing dope music, or going on more adventures!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to think of Patreon\u00a0as a tipping service. With some of my favorite creators I\u0027ve found myself thinking, \"I like their content, but I also like this guy/girl as a person and think they deserve a little something more from me\". That\u0027s just my take on it, though, and you may choose to donate for a different reason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel so fortunate to have the amazing fans that I do! Please know that any amount that you donate per month means so much to me. YouTube has been my passion for a long time now, but more than that, I simply want to impact others in a positive way by doing something I love. And by supporting me on here you are helping me realize that dream! The different levels of rewards are a way for me to start to show my gratitude (I hope to update them in the future to make them even better!) But more than that,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003eare the reason I love doing what I do--and for that I am so grateful. Thank you!"
