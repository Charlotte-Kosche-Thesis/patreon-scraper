Many of the Big companies that YouTube relies on have \npulled out from funding YouTube and has, therefore, affected me and my \nchannel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompanies like PepsiCo, Walmart, Dish, Starbucks, GM \nand Coca-Cola and many more have all pulled funding and advertisement \nads on YouTube! this means less money to go around for creators (like \nmyself) who put many hours of their lives into YouTube to bring you all \ngreat, quality, passionate content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel has been growing \nin all aspects for the last year up until this recent fiasco started. \nNow the content I have been creating has become more of a grind than \npure enjoyment due to the dark cloud of uncertainty looming over me and \nmy future with YouTube. Its a scary place to be in as a creator and I am\n making this effort in order to continue to push through this dark time \nthat YouTube is in to continue to bring you all the quality content I \nknow you all deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy family and school has been put on the \nback-burner, and that was a sacrifice I was willing to make to become \nsuccessful for them in the long run, but now, my priorities have \nchanged. YouTube has been taking almost half of the donations that my \nsubscribers have made to me on YouTube and that is NOT RIGHT! Thats why \nim here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no pressure, comments and likes, and shares are\n perfectly fine for me from the ones who cant afford to donate.... but \nfor the potential Patrons that can afford to throw a little $ at Jody\u0027s \nCorner will be greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIm not looking for a hand-out. Im looking for believers who want to support the content that I provide to many on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You for Reading this!!"
