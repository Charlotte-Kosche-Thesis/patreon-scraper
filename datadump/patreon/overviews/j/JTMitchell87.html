    "summary": "You like toys? I like toys too! Even more than that I enjoy talking about and sharing my love of toys with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhy hello there, I\u0027m Tyler. I review toys on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack when the first live action Transformers movie came out in 2007 I, as well as many others, got back into the toy game we seemed to have drifted out of. I suddenly found a bunch of new neat looking Transformers at my local stores and upon seeing that people were actually reviewing them online, decided to try my hand at that as well. Of course all I had was a cheap digital camera, but we all have to start somewhere, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCut to almost ten years later and I still enjoy sharing my thoughts with you fine people on whether I think a toy is worth getting or not. Along with that, I get to demonstrate how to do what them tiny toys do when played with. Of course as other creators will tell you, over time the revenue generated from Youtube and other platforms has dropped significantly. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s your money going to be used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorld domination of course! With your pledges, I hope to not only continue getting newer toys at a quicker rate, but I also want to improve my equipment whether it\u0027s something as simple as purchasing additional studio lights or maybe one day a better camera than what I currently have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne more thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne thing I want to make clear right off the bat; I will \u003cstrong\u003enever\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0post exclusive reviews to Patreon. I don\u0027t feel that would be fair for those who enjoy my videos but won\u0027t pledge for whatever reason. The only videos that will be shared on here are behind the scene looks that the majority of my viewers wouldn\u0027t care about. Maybe an unedited review, screen sharing of my editing process, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s it. That\u0027s me. I thank you for taking the time to read this regardless of whether or not you wish to pledge any money to my Patreon. I completely understand that some can\u0027t or simply don\u0027t want to use their money on a platform like this and that\u0027s perfectly fine! It still means a lot that you cared enough to make it this far and (hopefully) watch my silly little videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo,\u003cbr\u003eTyler\u003cbr\u003e"
