I decided to start a Patreon purely because I believe that I provide quality content, and I want to be able to keep doing so. Life tends to discourage long hours in front of a computer screen, but gaming is one of my passions. I truly enjoy exploring new worlds and discovering what other people have created. I saw a phrase on a shirt that really struck a chord with me: \"I am a gamer not because I don\u0027t have a life, but because I choose to have many.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am starting with some small special Patreon-only features, and I will likely look to YOU to help me decide what would be a suitable bonus for being a member of those that support the channel directly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  You decide for yourself. If you enjoy the content, if you find yourself waiting for the next video, or returning to the channel frequently, *and* you have the means to financially support it, please consider doing so. Thanks for hearing me out, and whether you decide to support me on Patreon or not, I am very glad to have you as a part of the audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all want to do what we love - why can\u0027t we make what we love our career?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting JinaweeTV and helping me continue to make videos for the internet."
