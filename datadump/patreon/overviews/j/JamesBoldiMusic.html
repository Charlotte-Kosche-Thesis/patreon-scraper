    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWELCOME TO MY PATREON PAGE/MUSICAL JOURNEY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really don\u0027t expect anyone to support my ugly faces and videos. If you just watch and share I\u0027ll still be grateful because that\u0027s pretty awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there\u0027s one thing that I absolutely love doing, it\u0027s creating music and content. For as long as I can remember, all I\u0027ve ever wanted was to make people happy and create music. And I\u0027m a very firm believer that music influences certain moods. I\u0027ve been playing for quite awhile. But it wasn\u0027t until freshman year of band that I swan dived head first into music and guitar. After high school I unfortunately did NOT go to college, but I had the opportunity to teach guitar at the middle school and high school as a weird job...... thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new to my page and you want to get a better understanding, here\u0027s what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzdQ3_R9HVU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, my content may not be amazing. But I\u0027m looking to get better and with help and feed back from people like you, I can very well make music/content creating a career. Now I\u0027m not saying I\u0027m amazing or fantastic. Cause to be honest, I\u0027m not that good at recording or mixing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack when I did the Legend of Zelda EP I made this page because I messed up with pricing on retail stores so all the prices were messed up. This was a way that I could put the music up for grabs without it costing so much and I\u0027ve just kept it up since.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you donate $1.00 or more per video (and set a monthly maximum if you\u0027d like.) I take that $1.00 or more per video and invest it into better music and video equipment to create better content. In return for your love and support I\u0027ve created rewards and patreon access only to certain posts you won\u0027t find on twitter, instagram or facebook.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do you post?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery two weeks. The reason I do every two weeks is because it\u0027s easier to do with having a job. If I could switch to making money creating music I would, but for now, that isn\u0027t going to happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDON\u0027T FEEL PRESSURED OR OBLIGATED TO DONATE MONEY!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have bills to pay or anything else and can\u0027t afford it, don\u0027t worry. Just share my music and interact within the comments section of my videos. That would still be amazing and I would still think you\u0027re an awesome human regardless.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time out of your day to watch my videos and support me in some way. It really means a lot if you do! Until next time, stay awesome!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
