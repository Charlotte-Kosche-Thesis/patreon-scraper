John J here!\u00a0 Reporting to you from my hermit cave somewhere in the hills of the Mojave Desert.\u00a0 How are you coping with the climate crisis? Are you a heart-core activist or just curious about where to start? Thank you so much for checking out Friends of the Climate Marchers and this Patreon project to find out.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet me fill you in\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a semi-retired high school \u0026amp; college prep math and science teacher turned free-lance, inter-sectional, climate-peace-species activist. Now there\u0027s a mouthful!\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor over 20 years I worked with at-risk teens, helping them get into higher education with their math and science skills. With my own training in biology and teaching environmental science I came to realize that ALL of our teens are at risk in a rapidly changing climate with ecological collapse a distinct possibility.\u003cbr\u003eWell, something had to be done about that. So I left teaching in the classroom for teaching out in the world and on the road. I have been on two cross country marches and continue to actively talk to people, go to meetings, and more. Read my posts and follow my YouTube channel for more. I rely on the support of my friends and a meager tutor\u0027s income to carry on what is a herculean task. But I have fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where you come in\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAnd this Patreon project can help us both. For as little as a $1 a month you can be hiring an experienced educator and activist to get out there and \u003cstrong\u003eeducate\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003edemonstrate\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eagitate\u003c/strong\u003e for change. You would also be helping to promote a diverse community of people who are engaged in peace, climate, and social justice work. You will be learning, at the same time, how to be an effective change maker yourself. I\u0027ll do everything I can to make it worthwhile, inspiring, and fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon got to do with it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is like a crowd-funding and subscription site rolled into one. It matches creators with patrons so they can pursue their passion and creativity and allow other people to participate in an intimate way. It creates a community instead of an organization.

It\u0027s that simple.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat do patrons get in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1st Tier Patrons ($1 per month)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0With only a dollar you are contributing to personalized activism and helping bring more of it where it counts!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou get my utmost gratitude and priority consideration of your comments \u0026amp; ideas\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTell me what you would like to see!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2nd Tier Patrons ($3 per month)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll the above, plus\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will give you or your group a shout out on social media (FB or Twitter) on a regular basis\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3rd Tier and above ($5/ $10 per month)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll the above, plus\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI plant a tree in your honor (or a loved one\u0027s)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt $20 make that 2 trees!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eYou can give any amount you like.

You can also stop any time you like but just know that the promise of steady income helps me keep at this work and muster even more energy and creativity in serving my community and telling this story.
