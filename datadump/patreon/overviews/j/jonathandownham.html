I have regularly reviewed current items of research to both keep myself and my audience up to date. I have had chats with clinicians from the UK\u0027s Intensive Care Society State of the Art conference for the last two years and produced these as podcasts. So far I have used a mix of interviews and personal views and have the episodes in the iTunes store and on Stitcher.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI LOVE creating these podcasts!
