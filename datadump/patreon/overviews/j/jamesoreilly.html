    "summary": "Like so many artists on Patreon, I want to work on art that I love\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://james-oreilly.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJames-Oreilly.com\u003c/a\u003e, but need the support of a community to make it viable. What perhaps makes me different is that I have no fixed home, I am travelling as I create, and I want to make my art and my existence a more charitable one for the people I have met, and will meet along the way. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live a simple life, I meditate, try to be present, and I only own what I can carry on my back. Sometimes I am living and volunteering in a local village, sometimes living on a beach, sometimes in a city, sometimes I stay a long time (a few months) sometimes a short time. Often on a very low budget and, where I can, on the bed/couch of those who have one spare. I am building new relationships with the locals and letting it influence the direction of my art and my life, moment by moment. I am not just drawing or painting or sculpting, I am also\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jamesoreillyblog.wordpress.com/\"\u003ewriting about this adventure\u003c/a\u003e and sharing my experiences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img922/7913/7qu8lY.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://james-oreilly.com/\"\u003eJames-Oreilly.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, in South East Asia, I have lived with and grown very close to a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jamesoreillyblog.wordpress.com/2016/09/23/travel-tales-ii-village-living-and-other-tales/\"\u003efamily in a\u00a0Cambodian village\u003c/a\u003e, who are running an English school for the local kids. These people are very poor by western standards. The children are beautiful and I have spend many days playing and adventuring with them and helping teach them English. Also supporting them financially when I can afford it, and rustling up donations from my family. I have come to the conclusion that I should create a passion project out of my artistic endeavor, one that satisfies me as an artist and helps these guys out, whilst producing good stories and content I can share with you.\u00a0My current goal is to make an illustrated book about them to raise money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img923/996/83d1fB.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the first step, but I suspect as I continue to make art and explore new places my ideas will evolve. With your support, my ability to donate and the ways in which I can help folk that I encounter along the way, will continue to grow. By accepting your support I am giving myself the moral obligation to pay it forward with my own abilities. I want to share my adventures with you through art and writing, videos and pictures. I hope to make my art and my current lifestyle financially viable, thereby growing as an artist in a way that benefits others. You, me, and the people we help will all be touched positively by our involvement in this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love you all to help me improve. So if you want to see any additions or changes to my patreon page and project, or have any suggestions about different rewards you would like to recieve as Patreon Supporters, or anything else, I wholeheartedly welcome them."
