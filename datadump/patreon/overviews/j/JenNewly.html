Pottery became my passion and after moving back to Anchorage I was determined to keep creating.\u00a0 I am inspired by nature, textures, and other art forms like origami.\u003cbr\u003eNewly: I have been working with clay for about 3 years and enjoy every opportunity I have to work with clay. I enjoy making functional pieces, experimenting with clay, glazes and the many facets involved.\u003cbr\u003eWe had to put pottery on hold after moving from Alaska to Washington until we could find a permanent home and put our studio together, but we are up and running once again after a long couple of years.\u00a0 To celebrate, we are posting our first glaze fire unveiling for all who follow us or visit our page.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt is a dream of ours to someday attend an educational ceramics conference like NCECA (National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts), which would cost about $250 per person for registration plus travel costs.\u00a0 In the meantime, we plan on taking workshops and most importantly, creating! Once we have enough pots, we\u0027ll start vending at events!"
