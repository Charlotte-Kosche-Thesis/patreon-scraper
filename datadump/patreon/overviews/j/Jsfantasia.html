And would like to entertain and inspire others with my creations: like others have inspired me. But that takes time and money, which does not mean I have to become famous. And tho becoming another Walt Disney would be OK with me. I don\u0027t need that future to be happy. I just need to earn enough money to make being an artist my primary income. And what kind of an artist? One to all of the following: 3D, animation, art education, cartoons, comic book, music, photography, single frame art (sketches, inks, digital paintings, etc.), sound effects. \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhy Am I On Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e (updated 2018 Apr 13) \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to be a full time artist. That means, you get entertained, inspired, feel good, etc. From being able to buy art from me. And if I can have a large enough paying audience. I can tell my employer bye, bye. I don\u0027t need your money any more. I\u0027m more valuable to others than I am to you. And I\u0027m leaving. Not, that I don\u0027t like my employer. I just would like to be a self-employed artist. And not just because I feel good making art; but, art can affect people in such a positive way; and I like that too.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nPlans, Goals and Status\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e (updated 2018 Mar 30) \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n1) new Lightwave 3D and other animation software.\u003cbr\u003e\n2) new audio software (edit, sound effects, music)\u003cbr\u003e\n3) new camera(s) (photo and video?)\u003cbr\u003e\n4) reorganize my flash drives and backup disks (close enough to say done)\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat\u0027s In It For You.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e (updated 2018 Apr 13) \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs my patron, you will get access to new original art from me before it appears any place else. Putting my patrons in the position of giving me the green light to post items to other sites for sale as posters, comics, DVD\u0027s, CD\u0027s, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nWell, as I\u0027m just getting started here. I\u0027m sorry to say that I\u0027m still getting organized. So I don\u0027t have different levels of support. And thus, I\u0027m open to your ideas as to what I could offer for different levels of support. \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor now, I\u0027m going threw backups to see what items still need to be digitized. And I\u0027m removing much of my non-fan art from other sites. To post some of the removed and still posted items here. Even though some items that will be posted here have appeared at other places for free. I want to get input from my patrons about those items: like, can they or should they be offered as products or dropped? \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nMade Into A Product For Sale -\u003c/strong\u003e my patrons will be first to tell me what they think about a posted item. Including how viable as a product you think items are. Also, as I can\u0027t know everything. Suggestions as to sites I may wish to check out. As an online store for one, some or all of my potential products. \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhy Am I On Other Sites?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e (updated 2018 Mar 1) \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOther sites offer the possibility of providing products for purchase. Patreon gives you the option to be a patron of the arts by supporting artists, hopefully me. Which means, for my art, you can see it here before it appears other places for money. If I think my patrons like an item enough; will I make it available as a product for sale. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://j-s-fantasia.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttps://j-s-fantasia.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/jsfantasia\"\u003ehttp://www.lulu.com/spotlight/jsfantasia\u003c/a\u003e (no products yet) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/j-s-fantasia/\"\u003ehttps://www.furaffinity.net/user/j-s-fantasia/\u003c/a\u003e  (no products yet) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/fantasia0kent\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/fantasia0kent\u003c/a\u003e (no products yet)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
