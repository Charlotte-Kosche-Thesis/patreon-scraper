Well, I didn\u0027t exactly plan to be the parent of four kiddos that included one on the autism spectrum, one with dyslexia, or three with asthma.  Yet, I am still the Ringmaster.  I am still in charge of helping grow these little performers into the best actors they can be.  So, Reluctant Yes.  Never ever regretful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will take the time to come join our circus.  Here you will find resources, tools, and support that you might not otherwise have found.  You see, I am a mother of 4, but also a 20+ year healthcare IT software leader, and I have a pile of caregiving certifications that I gathered while trying to figure out how to really manage my life.  My unique background allows me to see things just a little differently - and in this case - different is good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo.  Ladies and Gentlemen.  Boys and Girls.  Prepare to be amazed!  Prepare to be Entertained.  Prepare to be Astounded.  Get yourself some popcorn from the concession stand (in your kitchen) and try not to spill your 64 oz soda on your neighbor as you are entertained by what is nothing other than The Greatest Show on Earth - your caregiving journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUj_smJWIgo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI am Jackie Schwabe, your Ringmaster for this evening - and many many more evenings to come.
