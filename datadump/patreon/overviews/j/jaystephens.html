Hidden by it\u0027s creator after Prime Minister Diefenbaker\u0027s legendary cancellation of the CF-105 ARROW Project, it is discovered decades later by bullied Brampton teenager Cody Meekis, who shares the suit with his best friend Del Dixon. The suit is thermal insulated, made from a nearly bulletproof para-aramid synthetic fibre, and uses the Earth\u0027s magnetic field as a source of propulsion allowing a limited type of VTOL flight up to 100 metres off the ground. This field of geo-magnetism can also be extended outwards to propel external objects. The reappearance of the Arrowhead suit has attracted the unwanted attention of secret Canadian Government agencies and other interested parties, forcing Cody and Del to keep their grass-roots heroics to a minimum\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u00a0The second project I wish I had more time to devote to is a long-form graphic novel called \u003cstrong\u003eREUNION JACK: MOUND OF THE BARROWGHAST\u003c/strong\u003e, an \u003cem\u003eat-least\u003c/em\u003e 200 page story that will take a few more years to complete, and that is currently on hold.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eREUNION JACK is a historical fiction set in Upper Canada during the early days of\nConfederation in 1867.
