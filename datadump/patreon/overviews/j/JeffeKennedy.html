    "summary": "Heya folks! If you\u2019re here, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve already read something\nI\u2019ve written. That\u2019s what this page is for \u2013 readers who love my work and want\nto go that extra mile to support me, beyond buying my books. Because really, I\u2019m\nthrilled you love my books enough to buy them. You rock!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read my work, you can find All The Books, excerpts,\nreviews, etc., at JeffeKennedy.com. I write female-driven fantasy, contemporary\nromance, erotic fiction, and a smattering of other things. I\u2019m a hybrid author,\nwhich means I have both traditional publishing contracts and I also do some\nself-publishing. My books have won awards and people say nice things about them.\nI\u2019m truly blessed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut I am at a scary place in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy day job left me in October. After eighteen great years together, we\nbroke up. It was an amicable divorce, with much sorrow on both sides. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s one of those disaster/opportunity things for me. Yay, I have a lot\nmore time to write! Ack, I have no steady income and have to pay my own health\ninsurance! It\u2019s exciting and stressful all at once. Don\u2019t get me started on the\ncats\u0027 concerns about where their kibble will come from...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou all have been wonderfully supportive, offering me everything from\nchocolate bars to lemon-drop martinis to your cabins to write in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd let me be clear right now \u2013 these are all awesome things and I\nnever turn down chocolate bars or lemon-drop martinis. I really \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to do the cabin, too. Maybe\nsomeday!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt any rate, since we haven\u2019t figured out how to send chocolate,\nmartinis or cabins through the Internet, here\u2019s something we can try. You can\npledge to support me a certain amount of money per Thing, which for me means\nstories. (I also have a page to provide focused mentoring for aspiring writers, too, here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/JeffeKennedymentoring?ty=h)\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/JeffeKennedymentoring?ty=h)\u003c/a\u003e For readers, you can be part of my exclusive patron community here, where we\u2019ll\nhave just-us-chickens chats, you can get exclusive stories from me, and maybe\neven get to have something written just for you. All depends on your budget.\nAnd don\u2019t worry, you can limit how many stories you sponsor per month - and I won\u0027t ever do more than one story per month, because I\u2019ll still be writing All The Other\nThings, too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, check out the possibilities and see if you want to join in. \u003cbr\u003e"
