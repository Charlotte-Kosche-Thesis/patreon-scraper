I am 26 years old and currently live in south Florida. In 2012 I fell in love with hiking, it gave me something to really put my mind to, and I can honestly say it saved my life when I had been going down some negative paths. It has since been an incredible blessing, and has taught me to love life and share that love with all those who wish to follow along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have hiked more than 8,000 miles on long distance trails up to this point, and very much so love to share the journey with you. Most notably in 2016 hiking the 4,800 mile Eastern Continental Trail from Quebec Canada, to Key West Florida, setting a speed record of the 1,100 mile Florida National Scenic Trail in the process averaging more than 39 miles a day for 29 days straight, by foot travel only!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis year I\u0027m attempting to walk 5,300 miles,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ea round trip of the Pacific Crest Trail (also known as a yoyo.) An incredible journey from the Mexican border in California all the way up to Canada, then back down the way I came to Mexico again. Crossing this beautiful country twice. The feat has only been done by 3 people before, and I aim to be the fastest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love to do these trips, and push what is possible, and share my story.\u003c/strong\u003e I would like to go further and share more of these trips. In the past I\u0027ve made videos on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/jupiterhikes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emy youtube channel\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003edocumenting my 2016 hike thoroughly.
