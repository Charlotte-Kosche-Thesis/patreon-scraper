    "summary": "Thanks for stopping by! My name is Jeanette Wallis. 15 years ago, I consciously decided to devote my life to the service of humanity, starting with a 4,000-mile walk from Seattle to the White House. I called it \"The Walk for Democracy\", and the premise was to meet as many Americans as I could, and ask them to write letters (\"grievances\") to then-President Bush. I collected more than 750 of these heartfelt, sincere, and inspiring notes, and 18 months later, me and my Super-Dog Sherpa (rest her soul!) arrived to our destination. I tried to deliver my notes to the White House, but all I got was a bizarre interview with Secret Service, and instructions to mail my package of letters instead. I made some copies and delivered them via U.S. Postal Service, but shockingly I never did hear back from ol\u0027 George! This was, of course, what I expected. What \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e mattered to me were the words I carried, and the hope that maybe I inspired a few people to take courageous action of their own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast-forward to today! I became disabled from my railroad after 13 years of service from an old on-the-job injury which finally did me in. I was a whistleblower, too - and I met the same fate as every other whistleblower in America. They fought me tooth and nail to ensure that not only would I \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e be compensated, but that I would be so emotionally drained and beaten down,\u00a0I\u0027d never dare to speak out again. They spent over a million dollars fighting me over the years, and they finally succeeded in getting rid of me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m \u003cem\u003eJen Wallis\u003c/em\u003e, damn it! I don\u0027t give up so easily. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to return the college after dropping out in 1993, and hope to graduate with my BA next May, then keep going until I earn a PhD in Sociology. I can\u0027t walk more than mile these days, but I \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e tackle the many social problems we face, and help find real solutions to the massive inequality in America which ensures that people like me have nothing. I look forward to holding Corporate America accountable for their role in hurting families like mine, and I want all of you to join me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cem\u003epersonal\u003c/em\u003e future, however, is in grave jeopardy. My union-offered disability insurance - which I thought I\u0027d have until age 64 - decided to drop me in the middle of the semester. This happens to a lot of folks, and now it\u0027s my story. I do not come from a family of wealth, and amazingly no one wants to hire a 47-year old disabled single mom and full-time college student! I did my share of freaking out for a week or so, but then I remembered my walking days, and how I used to believe that losing everything can also be your greatest gift. It\u0027s time to try something new. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been thinking about this podcast idea for a while, and now life is gently nudging me with a bulldozer to let me that \u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e is the time to make it happen.\u00a0We\u0027re a skeleton crew at the moment, but my goal is to acquire the funding and mentoring necessary to produce a weekly motivational podcast of stories designed to encourage, inspire, and offer tips to our youth on how to get involved in activism, from wherever they\u0027re coming from. I\u0027m also hoping to produce a monthly call-in show to hear from \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e. I know there\u0027s some rad folks out there doing amazing things to better our society and planet, and I want to help you spread the word about your projects! I know how hard it is to get help. Let\u0027s help each other, shall we?\u00a0"
