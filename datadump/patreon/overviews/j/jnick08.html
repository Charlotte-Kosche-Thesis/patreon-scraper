I try to create paintings and drawings where everyone sees something different in them. When I\u0027m making art I\u0027m trying to create another world. One that focuses on all the possibilities of aesthetics. One where the auidience can experience a moment of joy in an otherwise mostly dreary world. I hope you enjoy my work.\u00a0"
