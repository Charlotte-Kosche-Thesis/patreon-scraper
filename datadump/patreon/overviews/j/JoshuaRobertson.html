Little did I know that those early musings would expand into the Thrice Nine Legends Saga, gripping readers worldwide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI\u0027m Joshua Robertson, an award-winning author in epic and dark fantasy.\u00a0You may recognize me as the dude whose dragons were said to destroy George R.R.

Your interest in my storytelling has given me the opportunity to do what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write for a living. In 2018, I plan to attend almost 40 conventions to speak on panels, engage with fans, and sell books. I jumped into the convention scene last year, and I honestly love it! Traveling around and meeting fans rocks, but the cost is pretty great. Even small cons cost around $300, not including hotel stay or fuel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page is to support my attendance at conventions, help pay for quality book covers,\u00a0 fan art, and editing services. This year I will be going to Steel City Con, Cincinnati Comic Con, Heroes Con, SuperCon, Marble City, and so forth. I know several readers want me to make it as far as Texas, New York, or even Utah. Your patron dollars go directly into paying for the hotel, gas, and food to get me to these different places. I want to come to your town! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo look around and see if you like my work. You can get access to exclusive Patron-only content for as little as $2 each month, and starting at the $5 level you\u0027ll really get some cool rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you fund me or not, thank you for taking the time to read through my ramblings. If you want to learn more about me, you can check out my website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.robertsonwrites.com/\"\u003ewww.robertsonwrites.com\u003c/a\u003e.
