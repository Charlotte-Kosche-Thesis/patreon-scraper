    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nuO9EfQ.png\" style=\"width: 633px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, everyone! Thanks to every single one of you who\u0027s watched one of my shorts on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/jamesrfarr\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0027m able to create fun new animated content every day! Everything from fast-paced pop-culture mashups like \u003cstrong\u003eSuper Mario Busters\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eTrains-Formers\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eThe Triforce Awakens\u003c/strong\u003e to more original pieces like \u003cstrong\u003eXombie: Dead Ahead\u003c/strong\u003e. Every single like and share helps spread the love. For those of you who might want a way to get more involved, and contribute directly to helping me make more awesome stuff, now you can do that, too! Think of it like a cool stuff \"accelerator.\" Every dollar pledged on this page goes directly to things like: \u003cstrong\u003escript-writing, sound effects, voice actors\u0027 studio time, the beautiful musical stylings of Joshua D. Peterson\u003c/strong\u003e, and all the other various resources needed to bring awesome (and weird) things to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, all\u00a0writing, animation and sound-designs are produced by me, by myself, right here in my home studio. Whether its mining old NES video games to capture an elusive but accurate sound effect reference, or painstakingly diagraming the causality chains for every potential mash-up casting choice ... \u003cstrong\u003egetting weird \u003cem\u003eright\u003c/em\u003e takes time and energy.\u003c/strong\u003e The energy I can maintain on my own. As for the time, its pledges like these that can help me unlock more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for those of you who hate waiting for cool things, I\u0027ve created a couple low pledge tiers to help you speed things up. And also to \u003cstrong\u003egive you some additional access\u003c/strong\u003e into what\u0027s going on here at the home studio. If you\u0027re like me ... and if you\u0027re here, I think you might be ... you understand the amount of love and care that goes into these types of animations. Maybe you\u0027re a fellow Nintendo nerd who wants to know what new mashups are coming. Or maybe you\u0027re just getting started in animation, and want a peek at how the sausage gets made. Either way, you\u0027re in the right place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve \u003cstrong\u003ekept my pledge tiers pretty low\u003c/strong\u003e for the moment as I refine my Patreon-Fu. I may enhance certain tiers and add some bigger, fancier rewards in the future (like a Xombie cameo perhaps), but for right now, please just think of these donations as a quick way to let me know you\u0027re enjoying my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading. Be excellent to each other. And I hope to see you all in the Patrons area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR; \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I make cool videos! About one or two per month.\u003cbr\u003e- All your pledges go toward animated content creation!\u003cbr\u003e- Every little bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e"
