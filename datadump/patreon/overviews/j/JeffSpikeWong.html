    "summary": "I was born and raised in Taipei Taiwan until the age of 9.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy biological grandmother raised me with a grandfather that\nwas an actor in Taiwan television and films. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 1974, I moved to Houston Texas USA to live with my biological\nmother and step-father.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight after High School, I worked as a music instructor\nduring the day while pursuing a career in the record industry by packing in\nclubs as a performer at night. In 1984, Label offers began to pour in from Southern California and Europe\nfor my band. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUpon relocation in 1987 to Los Angeles, I went to work for\none of the largest Christian record company in the country, Sparrow Records.\nThis is where I first learned about the record business with hands on\nexperience. In 1988, Warner/Electra/Atlantic offered me a position in\ndistribution; one of my many responsibilities was organization new release for\naward winning artists such as Madonna, Prince, Eric Clapton and many others.\nWith world-class artist producing music that changed the face of popular music,\nI was very fortunate to learn from some of the best in the business. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter many years of performing sold out shows in Southern\nCalifornia, I appeared in many music magazines such as Hitparader, Kerrang as well\nas newspaper Los Angeles Times while performing with the heavy metal band\n\u201cAmbush\u201d.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy interests in guitar has always been more than a just a\nplayer\u2019s perspective.  I was involved in\nbuilding a first web page presence for Kahler International and build guitars\nfor Rickenbacker International Corporation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI got deep into recording and engineering during this time,\nso I got an apprenticeship in a professional recording studio in Hollywood and\nsoon I found myself working recording sessions with artist such as Peter Tork\nof the Monkeys, Shelly Berg, and USC Jazz band. This engineering opportunity helped\nme tremendously in my recording projects and allowed me to pick the brains of\nsome of the best engineers in the business.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter several decades of service in the music/entertainment\nindustry, I moved back to Texas to build a multi-media company and produced a\ndebut CD for James Guest, a local Texas artist that charted top40 Adult\nContemporary at number 38 in the winter of 2003.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAround 2004, My wife started work with home builders in the area\nand I was brought in to shoot photos for homes that were completed so we may\nmarket it these online. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen we noticed a lot of home buyers were coming from\nCalifornia, I started to shoot videos of the model homes and surrounding\ncommunities to help buyers to see the values of moving to Texas.  That is how I became a professional photo/videographer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy Wife \u0026amp; I started\nGolden Westwinds TV \u0026amp; Films in 2013. Our vision was to develop stories with\ngoodness and positive messages.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the meantime, I started to\nmake music videos for my band Guitar Clone Odyssey using existing footages available\nfrom library of congress. When a local musician was doing a benefit for medical\nbills, I joined forces and shot the event and created a documentary to assist\nthe fundraising.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2017, Kawai Pianos hosted the\nfirst ever Blues Festival in Houston Texas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a first for the Japanese\npiano manufacturer doing something away from the traditional classical piano\ncompetitions. I took the opportunity and filmed the event in hoping to preserve\nthis momentous occasion with a documentary.  I am about 60% from completing this film and I\nneed your help to contribute and fund the project so I can do additional\nfootages, editing and post production work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI look to make films and\nshows with a positive message and historical significance. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your help, we can move\nthe world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA participation from each and everyone of you will assist me\nin traveling to locations for documentary filming. the bigger the support team,\nthe bigger our wings will spread.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you and Patreon for this opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtCdcmnB0a0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
