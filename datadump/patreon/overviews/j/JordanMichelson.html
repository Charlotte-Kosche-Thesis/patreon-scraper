    "summary": "Before you take out your credit card, punch some\nnumbers into a prompt field, and transfer a portion of digital code from one place to another, you will\nhave questions. Actually, just one question repeated: Why? At first it will just be \"Why Jordan?\" but then you may ask \"Why Me?\" and eventually, if you keep on asking questions, you will find yourself in a cold sweat shouting \"Why Anything?\" while contemplating the dark, vast, eternal galaxy of your\nsoul. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConveniently, you will find all the answers below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Why Jordan?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBecause I\u0027m here. On Patreon. Telling you about a dream I\u0027ve had for the better part of two decades. One where the words that ricochet around my head are given direction and purpose, allowed to form sharp sentences that progress into noble paragraphs, then witty chapters, and eventually into a bestselling trilogy and a movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Jennifer Lawrence, with Ice-T in there somewhere for good measure. Because what movie wouldn\u0027t be improved by an Ice-T cameo?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, it doesn\u0027t really work like that. Having spent the better part of two years cranking out the better part of four unfinished novellas, I can assure you that it doesn\u0027t work anything like \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e. The way it works is this: you sit down in a chair at a desk (or a table), unhinge your mind the way a snake unhinges his jaw, and you let the dark, vast, eternal galaxy of your soul babble out of you until it fills a college-ruled yellow pad or three-ring binder. Then you cut out the gems of genius for later, type up the sparknotes version of what remains, and drink a lot of gin tonics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney will be spent on gin tonics. It will be spent on bad coffee. It will be spent on Tango Mango burritos and Sichuan dry-rub bowls and ingredients for cheese and tomato sandwiches. It will be spent on 1\" binders and college-ruled paper and Pilot G-2 pens (.7 and 1.0 preferably). It will be spent on prescriptions and copays and physical therapy, mostly for my ACL-deficient knee, which don\u0027t worry is on track to a hundred percent recovery. By next September. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly, the money will be spent on health insurance. That\u0027s why my first benchmark goal is $479 a month, which is what health insurance costs me. Crazy, right? As a reasonably healthy 26-year-old, albeit with the questionable knee and occasional cubital tunnel syndrome in my writing arm. Still... $479. Absurd but true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, anything preceded by a dollar sign is just a number. The real metric is how many people are aboard the ship. The real dream is engagement. A buzzword, sure - but like most buzzwords, it rests upon something real. Something human. We are building something human here; you and I, we and you. Something like a community, something like a study group, something like a team. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause together we can build something. Create something. Something like a pantheon: a temple built upon the moral matrices of modern living. Yes: we are building here a pantheon. A pantheon to what, you ask? What deities or heroes, idols or philosophies, will inhabit the halls of our new world? But of course, there is only one way to know. We will build it first, then wait and see who shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Why You? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause you can. You have the capacity. You have the spare dollar and the thirty spare seconds to punch numbers into a prompt field. You have the willpower to overcome that inertial sense of dread, the one that resists you the way a fidget spinner resists description, the wispy voice that insists upon a default option of \"do nothing, it will all work out.\" You have the agency to act, to think, to do. You are able.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause you believe. You believe that writing is art, and that art is beautiful, and that beauty is magic; that it can change the human condition. You believe literature is more than long clickbait and that libraries inoculate us against something unsavory; and that said inoculation is always ticking toward expiration. You believe, furthermore, that \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e writing has a spark of magic; or at least the potential for it. You believe in me. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause you want to. You want sneak peeks and previews. You want short stories and poems. You want to see the farcical \u003cem\u003eThe Ultimately Insignificant Adventures of Dorjan the Swordsman and Joe the Life Insurance Sales Rep\u003c/em\u003e come to fruition; or the slipstream \u003cem\u003eChasing Silver Butterflies \u003c/em\u003eabout the only unhappy citizen in Paradise; or the Lennon-and-Lenin-inspired u/dystopia \u003cem\u003eNothing to Kill or Die For\u003c/em\u003e. You want to turn on HBO to see the latest happenings in the post-U.S. America of sci-fi fantasy epic \u003cem\u003eThe Shepherd and The Wolf\u003c/em\u003e. You want words. You want warm and deft and beautiful words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause it will make you happy. Only do this if it will make you happy. If you anticipate, after you finish filling out the entry fields, a little tingly feeling all up and down your spine - especially at the top of your neck, where all the important things connect. That tingly feeling, which is so often described as warm and fuzzy, but is really more of an electric thrill: the sensation of being effectual, of being a part of something, of playing the butterfly effect on the stage of human history. If it will make you happy, do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Why Anything?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause. Now sign up, already.\u003cbr\u003e"
