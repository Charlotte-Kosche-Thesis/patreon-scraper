    "summary": "I started out in 2005 writing porn - by now, well over 750,000 words of it so far, and growing. The vast majority of it is online, free, at \u003ca href=\"http://www.storiesonline.com,\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.storiesonline.com,\u003c/a\u003e under my nom de plume, \"Fillmore\". But as you might guess, posting porn for free doesn\u0027t make me any money, so I\u0027ve branched out into other genres... because really, porn/erotica can, after a while, seem like an endless stream of of \"insert tab a into slot b, repeat as necessary, lubricate as required\u0027.\u003cbr\u003eThis page began for monthly pledges, encouraging me to finish Book Two of my Porn Soap Opera From Hell, \"Oil of Roses\". The second book, \"Behind the Wall of Thorns\" will also be posted online, because like the silly man I am, I said I\u0027d post the story through the characters\u0027 marriage and reception for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOnce that point is reached, Book Three will appear here, chapter-by-chapter, as a work-in-progress. Pledge levels let you know what you\u0027ll see for how much.\u003cbr\u003eThis site has evolved, however, into a general site for supporting my writing in any (and pretty much every) genre.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy writing - it\u0027s not just porn anymore.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, working on the following (in addition to the Porn Soap Opera):\u003cbr\u003eFalling Angels - a detective novel about the murder of a mob boss\u0027s wife.\u003cbr\u003eNo Good Title Yet - a steampunk novel about a desperate mission to transport an evil artifact to Rome.\u003cbr\u003eWhite-Girl-Messiah Blues - pretty self-explanatory, the next Messiah is born a white girl in Central Texas.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I was born in a small Central Texas town in \u201960 and drifted around a lot after my first marriage. I\u2019m currently on my third marriage (10+ years and counting!). I have a daughter (born in \u201981) from my first marriage. I\u2019m a happy househusband who writes dang near anything, rides herd on the dawgs and tries not to go crazy due to the state of my country.\u003cbr\u003eYou could say I\u2019m extremely left-wing liberal (except where I\u2019m not), anti-organized religion (except where I\u2019m not), yellow-dawg Democrat (except where I\u2019m not), Proud Texan (except where I\u2019m not), member of the ACLU \u0026amp; Amnesty International. Anti-Death Penalty and Pro-Punishment, Pro-Choice, in favor of the legalization of marijuana and a firm believer in the Constitution of the United States of America\u2026 as it\u2019s written, not as it\u2019s sometimes interpreted.\u003cbr\u003eAs you might guess, I\u2019m also more than a little weird.\u003cbr\u003eI discovered my love of writing at a young age, wrote a story for my high school newspaper that won an Interscholastic League Press Conference Award. Then after high school (and a year in college as a theology/philosphy major) moved from the small town that had spawned me (and the other small town I\u2019d gone to college in) to Dallas, Texas, where I wrote (and even worse, read aloud) a lot of really angsty free-form prose/poetry garbage, most of which I\u2019m heartily ashamed of. Produced a lot of venom-filled rants, only some of which I\u2019m ashamed of.\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I quit writing for somewhere between ten and fifteen years (dates are kind of hazy as this was a very unsettled time in my life and I was doing a lot of drugs). I was convinced that the only reason anyone ever said I had talent was out of pity or out of bias as friends of mine. Then in early 2005, I was corresponding with an erotica author whose work I admired and she encouraged me to give it a try, selling me with the line \u201cAll you need to write erotica is a fantasy\u2026 everyone has a fantasy.\u201d\u003cbr\u003eSure enough, found out I was pretty good at it, although as time has gone on the erotic content of my work has shrunk. I\u2019m slowly but surely writing my way out of the Erotica Ghetto (because it seems that we\u2019re at the bottom of the literary barrel, no matter how many people actually read the stuff) and am working hard to get a career going in science-fiction, fantasy and paranormal fiction.\u003cbr\u003e",
