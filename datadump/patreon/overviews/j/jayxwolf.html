    "summary": "Hey all! I\u0027m a non-binary author, editor, and illustrator based in the Jersey City area. I\u0027ve got a bunch of projects in various publishing pipelines coming up in 2018 and beyond, so it feels like an ideal time to start putting some work out, and Patreon feels like an ideal place to start sharing it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been experimenting with a weekly writing project roundup I\u0027ve dubbed Alpha Club, because I\u0027m unoriginal and love aptronyms. Currently, Alpha Club is receiving the first draft of my work in progress, a queer dark fantasy adventure novel under the working title \u003cem\u003eAn Obsidian Heart\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of the wonky relationship between publishing and Patreon, I don\u0027t want to release Alpha Club materials \u003cem\u003ehere\u003c/em\u003e yet, BUT: Alpha Club has allowed me to experiment with weekly content distribution, and so I am hoping to bring my Alpha Club \u003cem\u003eethos\u003c/em\u003e to Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what am I doing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt a minimum, I will be creating a once-a-week run-down of my work in progress. I won\u0027t be sharing anything that\u0027s expressly NDA, but I will be sharing some stuff that might be too behind-the-scenes for Twitter and other social media. I\u0027m aiming to keep this Patreon from becoming make-work while still making slightly better use of stuff that I\u0027m doing anyways. This could be as widely disparate as: writing, drawing, painting, sculpture, language construction, discussions of my thought process as an editor or curator... I have a lot of projects in progress and sometimes it can be hard to see that I\u0027m making progress at all. I\u0027m hoping the act of documenting progress will help me to quantify my goals and stay on track!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goals for this Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want\u00a0to become a stronger and more self-directed illustrator and to build better work habits for my publishing life in general. I have a lot of work I effectively keep private because of various going concerns with publication or other reasons I may not want to post that work on my public Twitter account, but still want to collate and show the work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel like using Patreon as a nominal paywall for those items allows me to do more independent work and hopefully develop a few of the projects I have underway, and will also allow me to offer some behind-the-scenes observations\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledging me here is just one way to say you like what I do and want to see more of it! Thank you for being here. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
