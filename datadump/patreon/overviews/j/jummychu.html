    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE: Re-worked goals\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo I felt incredibly bad as I have so many of you supporting me and I am unable to keep up with many things. Through heavy consideration I\u0027ve decided that a good starting point for \"tiers/goals\" is to have a montage video done every $250 (each video requires a lot more playtime for more clips)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example\u003cbr\u003e$250 -1 montage/month\u003cbr\u003e$500 -2 montages\u003cbr\u003e$750 -3 montages\u003cbr\u003eetc etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! I\u0027m Jummychu, a twitch streamer that\u0027s in a situation that I\u0027m sure many other streamers suffer from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll try to be as concise as possible:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy past and my current situation/problem\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started out streaming a year and a half ago I had almost no worries (no bills/medical issues/etc) and could devote all my time into making content and entertaining an audience without the pressure of doing it for money or \"selling out.\" I did it only because I loved to, and I still do, but as more bills came along I had more pressure to make content solely to try and make money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe financial instability and uncertain incomes from being a \"streamer\" makes it difficult for me to be more consistent which creates a domino effect with viewership, energy levels and stress. The pressure of making content to make money took away from the genuine passion I once had of entertaining myself and an audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m making a patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply put: money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing more specific: a stable minimum \"wage.\" I think by giving myself a minimum wage to work with that it will remove a lot of aspects of the stress and pressure that builds each month. I am by no means a saint, but I finally realized that the negative stigma of doing things for money was something that\u0027s always been holding me back from succeeding and progressing further in my goals. Hopefully I\u0027m not asking for much but I believe that $10/hour (less than $9/hour after cuts) is understandable. As for the negative domino effect before with having an unstable income I hope that this reverses that into a much more positive one; being in a happier and more stable state of mind and therefore making more enjoyable content for everyone to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll still be making money from twitch subscribers/donations but I would like to have that as a reward or \"tip\" system and be added as unexpected income (opposite of unexpected expenses) and I believe they will balance out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is just a trial and I\u0027m still trying to make it better\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy no means do I expect this to go as smoothly in action than it is in paper; I am aware I might even lose support from some of my audience for trying to go a route like this but I really want to improve on my own content. I would rather stop on my own terms than having to because of outside influences. That being said if the feedback from this is severely negative then I will try and find a different solution but I would like to try this for at least a couple of months starting January.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way I hope I have your continued support and I really do appreciate you even taking the time to read this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
