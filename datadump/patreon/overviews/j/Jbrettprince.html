With a  college level education in Sciences, Arts, Religion, and Philosophy, I justified a life of sin in the name of scientism, naturalism, and new age thinking.  I embraced an amoral life and walked it out more than most I have encountered.  A successful 15 year tattoo career, renowned tattoo shop, and limitless income led to a never ending descent in the flesh.  Realizing the human cost of instant gratification through a hard fall that would make Icarus wince, I was lifted up through the grace and love of Jesus Christ over a transformative period that has resulted in an iron clad, well earned faith.  My life is now devoted to letting God work through me and enjoying the ride.  It has been rewarding beyond my wildest dreams.  I posted my testimony on YouTube in April 2017, knowing it would be the best platform for the widest audience.  I did not anticipate the reception. All glory to God, it has gone viral.  I have since felt a pulling into ministry that I have reluctantly seen become an undeniable calling.  I feel God speaking to my heart, and I experience confirmation exponentially as time goes on.   Since the exposure of the video, I have gained an audience of almost 5000 subscribers.  I feel the Lord is going to grow that number quickly.  It would be my extreme pleasure to the work of the Lord all day every day. Beyond enjoyment, I feel an obligation when considering the unfolding of events.  By supporting my channel, you are helping what I see as a YouTube ministry that has the potential of reaching millions.  I have no cares to return to a world of material worship, therefore all support will go to funding the spread of Gospel through this channel and any means beyond.  Thank you for all consideration, time, and support.  God bless.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can learn where your support goes in the post below, and you can see the production of this channel by visiting the website and/or YouTube channel."
