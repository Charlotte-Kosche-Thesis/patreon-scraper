    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWho Is James Bov?\u003c/h3\u003e\nMy name is James and I write fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been doing it for many years, trying to make the very best work that I can. So far it\u0027s gone pretty well if I do say so myself. You can read it all, right now, TOTALLY FREE by heading to the Posts tab.\u003cbr\u003eI made everything free because putting it where nobody can see it goes against every reason I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo read! Please let me know what you think.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI mainly write science-fiction, usually twenty-minutes-into-the-future and usually not so cheery in its themes; dystopia; oppressive governments; misused technology; those sorts of things are pretty prevalent in my work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSometimes however I\u0027ll try my hand at something totally different. Magical Realism, Fantasy or plain old Modern Fiction. (More often than not I can\u0027t help but throw in something less serious too. Comedy is a part of me that I can\u0027t ignore). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I work on long projects I tend to have a ton of ideas and create lots of short stories and Flash-Fiction that branches from it. Small snapshots of the worlds in my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI appreciate you taking the time to visit, and I\u0027d like to extend the invitation for you to help me finish my first full novel; \u003cstrong\u003eThe Ciphers\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSo Why Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003eMy ultimate aim is to get The Ciphers finished and in front of as many publishers as possible. To that end an agent seems to be a necessity after the writing is done. Contract negotiations, or indeed finding the correct people with whom to have them, are sadly not things in which I am particularly well-versed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis place had a purpose but that purpose has changed, now it is more to showcase things and maybe act as a sort of... tip jar I suppose? \u003cbr\u003eBy pushing myself to create great pieces of work that I know people are waiting for I\u0027m much more likely to fight my more... languorous tendencies. \u003cbr\u003eNot to mention a lack of any real deadlines has made me complacent when it comes to starting, and more importantly \u003cem\u003efinishing\u003c/em\u003e, new projects. Not having to worry about what to do with every new short piece is going to free up more time for me to work on The Ciphers, as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn that note I intend to deliver short stories as often as I can,\u00a0alongside excerpts and sneak peaks from larger works or indeed just ideas that I\u0027m formulating. Hopefully I can bring much more than that to you. \u003cbr\u003e\nI welcome your input too, and hope you offer as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo thank you again for joining me, hopefully you enjoy some of the things I make. I look forward to sharing them with you.\u003cbr\u003e"
