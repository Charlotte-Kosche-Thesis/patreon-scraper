Solo got somewhat lonesome though, and yearning for collaboration, I made the 2013 record \u003cem\u003eIdiot Songs\u003c/em\u003e with singer Pearse McGloughlin. I then began to delve into a world of shared projects with other artists; musicians, film-makers, dancers and groups of young musicians in my community!

Since the label I was on in Australia went bust, I have been releasing records on my own, gathering resources ahead of each album to record, produce and tour. \u00a0I have been travelling with my violin, laptop and suitcase full of records, playing my solo shows far and wide. \u003cstrong\u003eIn the last few years however, my ideas of creating have grown and changed beyond simply making albums\u003c/strong\u003e. I have been composing music for larger ensembles, string orchestras, choirs, and even the beginnings of a large scale operatic work for community music groups to engage with. I have been writing for bigger than the limits of just what I could play with my violin and loop pedals, and dreaming of making these works actually happen to become performances and recordings and films that my wider community can enjoy, and hopefully engage with deeply. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause these projects involve more people, the costs involved are higher - \u00a0recording, mixing, editing, and the costs of bringing performances to live audiences, as well as via youtube and Facebook live. The costs of recording and performing chamber music is often more than my own pocketbook allows, so it is often the case that I compose works and dream up projects which then sit silent in my notebooks due to the lack of resources to make them happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaving a community of patrons to engage with on these projects will not only provide the finances to bring them to life, but also the ideas and conversation that I love and need to help the work engage, evolve\u00a0and be meaningful to the entire community. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe creation and experience of music and art should never be confined the edges of society, (the \u0027professional classes\u0027) but should be something in the centre of a community, engaging everybody and helping create positive connection and meaning - so let\u0027s get going!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW IT WORKS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy joining my community of patrons, you can choose to pledge a dollar amount for every \u0027thing\u0027 I create (be it a\u00a0composition,\u00a0collaboration or performance). \u003c/strong\u003eRather than a \u0027monthly\u0027 subscription (like Netflix or Spotify), you will only pay when I am offering something to engage with.

By becoming my patron you will become co-creators in the whole thing. And if, like myself, you wish you could interact more with artists, unlike the traditional model of waiting years between new records with no insights....then lets change the model! Having your support means that new music can be realized and released whenever the inspiration and ideas come together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e I am really excited about exploring Patreon as a new platform for releasing my music and embarking on a series of exciting musical projects with you - more than anything I\u0027m excited about getting your ideas, passions, insights and input as we produce music together.
