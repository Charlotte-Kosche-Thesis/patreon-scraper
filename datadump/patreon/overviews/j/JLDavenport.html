    "summary": "Simple. To make sure that the works I put out are released in as timely a manner as possible while still maintaining the level of quality and depth I\u0027ve been aiming for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off for anyone unfamiliar with my writing, you can find it all here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/JLDavenport/pseuds/JLDavenport\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://archiveofourown.org/users/JLDavenport/pseud...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m primarily working on two stories\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Change of Tactics: A manipulation based Robin/All Female Shepherds harem story with a serious plot and considerable character analysis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Twist of Fate: A more light hearted Corrin/All Females harem story, that follows the Fates plot and hopefully makes it a little more fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty much ever since I first started writing one thing I\u0027ve heard, over and over, was how much people wish I could get my chapters out faster, that they enjoy the stories, they want to know where they\u0027re going, but hate having to wait weeks or months for chapters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t compromise on my quality and I doubt anyone would want me to anyway. I\u0027ve already made my stories pretty much the focus of my free-time, I\u0027m almost always working on them in one way or another, even plotting out details or answering PM\u0027s while at work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, the only way I can get them out faster is to have more time to write them. And, with a full time job, the only way I can have more time to write them is to spend less time working.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also a great way for anyone interested to have their say on upcoming plot points, themes or pairings they\u0027d like to see! Really want to see Robin with Lucina and Cynthia at the same time? Want to see him smothered by Tharja and Tiki\u0027s glorious assets? Or perhaps you\u0027d rather see Corrin convincing Azura she needs to play nice with Camilla? Whatever you want, this lets you have your say!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe major plot details and decisions are already decided, but there\u0027s plenty of room for things to be added in or for the order of some things to be moved around depending on what people want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all, it\u0027s fairly straight-forward: If you like my works, and want to support them, then this is how you can make sure you get to see them faster. The more I can raise like this, the less I have to work and the more time I have to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll stand up to my word that, you\u0027ll receive constant updates about my progress as well as the ability to help influence or vote on the flexible elements of my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all support is absolutely and incredibly appreciated."
