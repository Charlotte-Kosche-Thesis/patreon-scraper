    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey there! I\u0027m Jaiden :) You\u0027ve stumbled upon my Patreon page, and before you scroll any further I would like to make an update regarding this page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI opened this Patreon account back when I was just getting ready to head off to start my first year in college. The channel was not considered \"big\" back then (even though it still had a decent following) and I couldn\u0027t consider Youtube a \u0027full-time job\u0027 yet. I was very concerned about not being able to balance college and youtube since it was my only source of income, so I decided that creating a Patreon would help me out just a bit extra with not having to search for a second job. This would allow me to use what spare time I had to focus completely on creating animations and doing what I loved!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, the channel has grown far bigger (and faster) than I could have ever imagined. My family and I even decided that it would be ideal to take a year or two off from college to focus solely\u00a0on taking this once in a lifetime opportunity and seeing where it leads (might seem scary, but before you say I \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a degree I will inform that I am not opposed to the idea of finishing college sometime later in the future. Just when the time is right! Shoving this whole youtube thing to the back burner\u00a0when it\u0027s doing so well right now is a bit of a shot to the foot.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel like informing before you decide to pledge that I do not need money or have a financial situation. I\u0027ve considered closing the account, but there are still many many people who enjoy the rewards and behind the scenes looks at videos, and if they are willing to pay for them then just shutting everything down might make them disappointed. If you are looking into pledging money only because you believe I need it, I suggest you save it for yourself or something\u00a0else special :) But I really appreciate the thought, and willingness to help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for visiting! Have a great rest of your day!\u003cbr\u003e----------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e[Previous Greeting Message]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome, friends!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178,162,199);\"\u003eYou\u0027ve stumbled onto the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/jaidenanimations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJaidenAnimations\u003c/a\u003e Patreon page!

Sounds good? Well, the particular course I\u0027m going into (Graphic Design) is known to be excruciatingly time consuming... And seeing as animation is also a very long process, I won\u0027t be able to produce content as often as I wish I could. Also, being devoted to two channels (JaidenAnimations and iHasCupquake) can spread me pretty thin.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95,73,122);\"\u003e\"Yeah, but how does donating help you?\"\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178,162,199);\"\u003eIf you were to support me on Patreon I can start saving towards better tools and supplies to help me work faster, thus getting more content pumping out.
