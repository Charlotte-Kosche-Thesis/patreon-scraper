Two or three days a week I work with primary school pupils and teachers supporting the teaching of science, particularly biology, through workshops and training. Since 2010 I have worked with more than 400 schools across the UK and worked face-to-face with more than 150,000 pupils. \u00a0I\u0027m really proud to be a UK Ambassador for Science.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT AM I SEEKING HELP FOR? \u003c/strong\u003eI work with many schools that can no longer afford the cost of field-trips and, well, I think this is a terrible thing. I believe that, without field-trips, we limit the potential of young people considering a life in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths). Without early experience, what kind of scientists will we encourage? And how will we encourage them? It worries me. I also work with many pupils, particularly in hospital schools, whose field-trip opportunities may be limited. What chance might they have?  I believe that, without field-trips, we limit the potential of young people considering a life in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHELP ME MAKE MORE VR EDUCATIONAL FIELDTRIPS!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eTo remedy this and because I want to do something about this and can\u0027t afford to take school groups out for free (wish I could!) I have been making field-trip videos with a VR/360 camera to offer to interested schools (and those pupils seeking extra-curricular stimulation) an opportunity for pupils to visit jaw-dropping places and learn some amazing science.\u00a0With a simple Google Cardboard headset and a mobile phone, pupils can now explore field-trip locations like The Natural History Museum, The Jurassic Coast and Cheddar Gorge, whilst learning about curriculum concepts that include life-cycles, foodchains and classification. This has all been produced so far for free, but it cannot last, sadly... hence my seeking sponsorship on Patreon (a first for me!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would really love your support and will pay backers / pledgers back with GORGEOUS personalised monthly hand-collected fossils and personalised letters. Your children / family / friends can build a fossil collection off the back of your help for this project!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSPECIFICALLY, WHO WILL BENEFIT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s quite a long list. Maybe as many as 20,000 young people in the first year of launch (and this is a conservative estimate). I hope to reach far more. Those that I will be sending the app to include primary schools, teachers, home tutors and pupils seeking extra-curricular learning, as well as hospital schools including Great Ormond Street Hospital School, all of whom I have worked with previously. I hope this is a safe bet, and I hope to keep you posted as I move along on this journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI would love your support. And I am willing to send you all sorts of amazing fossils from my collection, and personalised letters, to say a big thank you! (Did I say this?). Please do make contact if you have further questions or enquiries. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers and all best, Jules\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eP.S.\u00a0Another way of helping is simply to tell your friends and colleagues via Facebook or Twitter, or by giving the 360SCIENCEtutor app a good rating on Google Play. Basically, it all helps! THANKS!\u003cbr\u003e"
