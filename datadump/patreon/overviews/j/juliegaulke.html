    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! I\u0027m Julie, and I make music videos.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I have a Youtube channel with over 300 videos. I am a \"multitracker,\" which means I record myself singing all the parts of a song, then I layer the tracks together to make my own \"virtual choir\" of sorts! My passion is vocal harmonies, so I really like to sing lots and lots of harmony. I do a lot of a cappella music (which means without instruments). For some songs I do add accompaniment. I play the piano, but using MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) I am able to add lots of other instruments that I wouldn\u0027t normally be able to play myself, like guitar and drums. I also have a few videos that are just piano solos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic is my passion.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve loved multitracking, even since I was a kid in the \u002770s. I used to multitrack using two tape recorders side by side LOL! I\u0027ve come a long way since then. Today I use Pro Tools and Final Cut Pro in my own little home studio (in other words, my bedroom computer desk). I don\u0027t ever ask for anything in return for my videos. I do this all for free. I hate advertising and I refuse to slap any ads on my videos if I can avoid it. I do make a few bucks here and there by selling my original scores and arrangements on my website \u003ca href=\"http://pianomomsheetmusic.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://pianomomsheetmusic.com.\u003c/a\u003e I also offer my audio tracks on Bandcamp - for free - though fans can make a donation if they wish. \u003ca href=\"https://juliegaulke.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://juliegaulke.bandcamp.com/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, a friend recently told me that it\u0027s not about \"asking\" fans for support, but rather \"allowing\" them to. This is an outlet for you, my supporters, to put a little something in my tip jar, if you will. In return, I offer you \"rewards\" based on your level of support. I consider my fans to be friends - seriously! I love how this age of Internet has brought us together, no matter how far apart we live in this world. I\u0027m happy to share my gift of music with you, and I am so so very grateful to those of you who are willing to give a little back. Thank you so much for your support!"
