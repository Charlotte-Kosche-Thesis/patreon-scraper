The Listener\nEffect \u2013 a docu-reality show where I interview people, write songs\nabout them, and explore the effects of music in people (Actively in\nrelease on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh4ccoReZZnATUFL3-AD-3w\"\u003eListener\nEffect YouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://thelistenereffect.com/\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\n2. The Songwriter\u2019s\nGrooves Project \u2013 an ongoing study of all the ways one can sing and\nplay guitar at the same time. If you\u2019ve stumbled on any of my\nguitar serials...they are a part of this. (I continue to add to this\non the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl3qioziZ88h_o50p5rW3nw\"\u003eJon\nMichael Swift main channel\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca href=\"https://songwritersgrooves.wordpress.com/\"\u003eSongwriter\u2019s\nGrooves Blog\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/The_Speedway_League_School/The_Songwriter%27s_Grooves_Project_-_A_Guide_to_Singing_and_Playing_Guitar\"\u003eSWG\nWiki\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\n3. The Swift\nEquation \u2013 a show about discovering the value of learning. Explores\nthe 10,000 Hour Theory, my experiments in song improvisation,\nperformance psychology, and how to create a better future for\nhumanity through a Culture of Knowledge. (In development, hopefully\nto begin release in mid 2018)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat I\u2019ve\nAccomplished So Far\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs of January 1st\n2018, my main YouTube Channel had over a million views, 9,000\nsubscribers, and over 8 years of watch time. It also delivered, on\naverage, 2.5-3 days worth of guitar lessons every 24 hours. I\u2019ve\nfocused my releases on what I think of as innovative approaches to\nteaching and playing the guitar. Seeing the Blues as if it\u2019s a\nRaga, learning to improvise on a simple song like \u201cLandslide\u201d or\n\u201cRomanza\u201d for an hour, and how to learn techniques like \u201cPluck\nand Chuck\u201d through a series of popular songs, are some examples of\nways I\u2019ve done this. While I\u2019ve got ideas like these in spades\nand I continue to develop my past projects, my recent releases are\nshifting towards developing a holistic understanding of Music and how\nwe use it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI place a great\nimportance on understanding the effects of Music on people. While I\nhave a pretty serious passion for Music, I\u2019ve learned that it\ndoesn\u2019t have much value when it\u2019s separated from other parts of\nour lives. Using Music as a vehicle to learn about ourselves and the\nworld around us is the focus of my newer projects like \u201cThe Swift\nEquation\u201d and \u201cThe Listener Effect.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eLet me briefly\nbreak down this idea of \u201cMusic to Save the World.\u201d\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYes, I am implying\nby this statement that the world needs to be saved. I don\u2019t expect\nI\u2019ll be its sole savior, but if I accomplish anything in the way of\nhelping humanity, I think it\u2019s gonna be through the power of Music.\nI love a lot of other art forms as well, and I know it takes a lot\nmore than just a pretty song to bring peace to the Middle East, but I\norganize all my knowledge and wisdom and efforts around the idea that\nthe inherent properties of Music are the guide by which I walk my\npath in life and help other human beings to walk theirs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m in the camp\nthat believes that humanity is currently in a sort of \u2018Fall of\nRome\u2019 extinction phase. That being said, I also see an era of\nincredible hope and prosperity, and a time when human minds are\ncoming together in a way that is unprecedented and exciting. I\u2019ve\nalso experienced profound personal transformation through the power\nof music. It is my belief that studying music can show us the way to\norganize our civilization in a way that will help us weather the bad\ntimes, enjoy good times to their fullest, and transform our lives to\nexperience the world as never before.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis attitude is\ncausing me to give my entire life a makeover. I\u2019ve been working\ntowards developing myself as an adult that lives these values and who\nproves their value to others through the work I do. My hope is to\ncontinue to learn and share a creative process with the people who\nfollow my channel, so that we can discover, together, how to grow and\nuse this gift of Music in our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has been\nsuch a tremendous gift to me in terms of supporting my work, and if\nyou feel you want to support my work and/or participate in my\ncreative process, I encourage you to understand what it is and how\nyou can participate in my community through it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eW\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003ehat\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\nI\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003es\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e P\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003eatreon\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a\ncrowd-sourcing website that helps creators like myself connect with\nindividuals interested in supporting our various projects so that we\ncan keep \u0027em coming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy campaign is \u201cper month,\u201d\nmeaning if you decide to make a pledge it will be processed on a\nmonthly basis.

Please don\u0027t feel\ncompelled to donate unless you\u0027re interested in working together to\nbetter our understanding of music and the many ways to use it.
