    "summary": "For those that already know who I am, Hi. For those who don\u0027t, I\u0027m Jyncks. Pronounced like Jinx. A little over three years ago now I started a broadcast on Twitch.tv/Jyncks where I attempted to beat 100 Games in a Year Live. In the process, I tried to build a channel successful enough to pay for a degree in Broadcast Journalism. While that may have been naive, it did lead to three semesters of study at my local Junior College, and I\u0027m not done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need to come back to creating content but want to be different. That is where this Patreon comes in. Only with the help of a community can I create an active society of people interested in critically unbiased viewpoints into today\u0027s tech and entertainment. Now that I\u0027ve taken a few classes in writing, arts, and business, I\u0027m ready to start my first website where I will personally write reviews and blog daily news in everything from new and retro games, tech products, movies, TV, and more. I do this under my name JJ David.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all starts with the written reviews and goes from there. Since I\u0027m a novice at video editing and production on Adobe, I will be paying for videos created utilizing my published reviews. Once I get used to doing this weekly, I will be launching this Patreon for $1 in an effort to gauge interest in a Podcast I want to create. Deliberation is a program I will broadcast Live on Twitch that will feature content creators, speed runners, streamers, and gamers like you who both love and hate different games, tv, movies, tech, and more. We will deliberate each week to reach a LIVE Meta-Review. This will then cut into a weekly podcast/youtube video series that will launch my new entertainment brand. More on that later."
