World Setting) maps in a variety of styles, map tiles (custom map tiles for your game, setting, campaign, or if you just want a castle floor map with your name on the royal crest), concept art (such as drawings of relics from your original campaign), and sometimes patrons can even request work from me helping to make their own games a reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I need: I need money to buy food, buy art supplies, better equipment, and more reference material to learn from so I can improve my work. If I can make 500 or so dollars a month making the art that I love, I will be able to support myself and set the stage to actually attend an art school on my own terms. The secondary benefit to this will be that I can maintain my sanity and maybe eat food.\u003cbr\u003e"

I devote at least 2 to 3 hours each night to working on sketches, studying old art books, and increasing my knowledge of classic and contemporary art in the hopes of getting good enough to make it as a \u0027real\u0027 artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI, like everyone else, have a lot of responsibilities. Me to my wife and my family, but I am struggling, as many artists do. I am recovering from a series of depressive episodes that have drained me physically and mentally. I recently lost my day job after accumulated stress, anxiety and depression left me nearly unable to function, causing real issues with my health. And so, I am trying as best I can to improve my art, and learning as much as I can about the industry to make a living for me and my wife. My goal is to eventually make art on my own terms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am trying to get some funding so that I can simply survive, and devote more time to the art I love. I hope to someday attend an art school to improve my work. I have this fantasy of paying my way through art school with the work I do here and now. For the moment, I can only hope that the work I present here can convince you that the time you spend reading this isn\u0027t wasted, that the hours I have invested sketching, drawing, and studying isn\u0027t wasted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take some time to see what I have made and decide if I\u0027m worth an investment of your time and maybe a few dollars.
