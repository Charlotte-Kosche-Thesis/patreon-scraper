I have a lot of fandoms I enjoy, but my favourites are Gravity Falls, Osomatsu-san, Mystery Skulls, Professor Layron, Ace Attorney, and many others. I love to paint and my proudest works are the canvas portraits I do on a large scale. Eventually, I hope to find enough of a following to have some sort of official release of my original work.",

Initially, I imagined it as an animated series, but I would be more than happy to release the first full length story of these community college spirit busters as a graphic novel!

The volume will be in greyscale with a colour cover, but there are future goals to push toward a colour release, as well as additional volumes!",

I also plan to make generic ones for conventions and to donate copies to hospitals.\u003cbr\u003eNurse Squeeze is also willing to provide a visit to more mature audiences.
