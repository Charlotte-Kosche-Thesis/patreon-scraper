During an average week I\u0027ll record and/or edit at least one piece of media which will finally create a video, I\u0027ll interact with people who contact me with questions or in search of community and I\u0027ll get involved with online and \u0027real time\u0027 debate and conversation. All of these actions result from the choice I made many years ago to share the Torah with anyone who wants to learn from it. It\u0027s been my personal choice to try and help others help themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a website that allows YOU the chance to get in on the act and support me in the work I do. Patreon gives you the option to donate a monthly amount towards the tools, resources and simply put, the time that I need to do what I do and to improve what I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron of mine YOU help get that next video out, you give me the means to help that new member to our community and you allow me to upgrade my content and help pay for the software and hardware I need to continue. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow does this work?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you choose to donate monthly and help me do what I do then you can sign up and choose to support me with as little as $5 a month or if you want to then you have the freedom to give more. This rolling amount, this community donation, gives me the room to breath and confidence to continue with projects that might require hosting, licenses or subscription charges as well as improving my content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour donations help ME help others.

     "about": "Hi! My name is Jason and I run a website and YouTube channel that is centered about the Hebrew Bible. I use videos, artwork and posts to share my journey and the wisdom of my many amazing guest speakers. Why? Because after learning more about the \u0027Old Testament\u0027 I decided to put the Christian faith to the test and found it lacking. Now I spend my time sharing the awesome content of the Hebrew bible, \u0027the Tanakh\u0027, as well as helping others who are seeking some truth regarding the Bible, God and what comes after we leave the \u0027New Testament\u0027. I have over 2000 Subscribers on Youtube and over 40000 monthly visitors as well as a vibrant and friendly Facebook family! So why not come and visit, say \u0027hi\u0027 and see what\u0027s going on today!\u003cbr\u003e",
