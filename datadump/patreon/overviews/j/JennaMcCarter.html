    "summary": "Hi!!!  Thank you for visiting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a creator, an imaginative, whimsical, and adventurous soul.  My heart and work are in creative arts.  I paint, draw, work with fiber, work with things found in nature, take old things that are no longer used and turn them into new things.  I try to create things that are colorful, unique, and inspire imagination and joy in others.  The world can sometimes be a dark and murky place, and it\u0027s all too easy to get sucked down into the darkness.  And that is why I create what I create.  There is so much beauty, curiosity, and wonder in our world, and if I can add a little bit of that joy to someone else\u0027s life through my creative work, then I consider myself successful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I love to create art? I love making the world more colorful, more joyful, more relaxed, more happy, more child-like, more curious.  I love bringing innocent joy and love, and peace, and authenticity to the world and the people who interact with my art.   To as many people as possible.   A friend of a friend purchased one of my paintings a couple of years ago after seeing it in a coffee shop on her birthday.  She loved it and bought it for herself as a birthday gift.  I saw her a year later and she told me how it hangs on her wall in her bedroom and she sees it everyday and she loves it.  How cool is that?  How cool is it that I bring joy to someone every day because I was brave enough to put my creativity out on a canvas and then put it out in the world for others to see?  That\u0027s why I love to create. I am an Artist.  I am a Happiness Maker. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI am completely dedicated to my mission, and work daily to bring my creativity to the world and to make it a brighter, more colorful, more joyful and innocent place.  I am able to do this right now because of the love, support, and encouragement of my soulmate John, without him I would not have nearly so much time or confidence to pursue my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in what I am doing and want to offer support, then you can help me continue on my path by becoming a patron of mine.  You can do this by pledging as little as $1.00 a month, and by doing so, will help me make ends meet, as I get my art business going.  Thank you for supporting me in spreading my light to the world on my creative and unique journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of Love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJenna\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
