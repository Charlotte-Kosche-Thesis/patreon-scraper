    "summary": "Hello Everyone!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 Thank you for checking out my Patreon page! My name is Jamie Beeman, I am 20 years old and I am a recording artist, musician, \u0026amp; writer currently going to school for Music Business. I am here to help finance my dream in the Music Industry. Every donation helps and it will be going towards studio time, rehearsal, video and photo costs. My fans mean everything to me and I wish I could give you all more but having low funds at the moment has stopped me from doing so. I have been hoping to get back in the studio to record another album but it has been impossible due to no funding. Rehearsing with my band to get our shows perfect is not an easy or cheap task.. sometimes I spend more in Rehearsal time than we make at the show! Video and photos are something my fans want WEEKLY but it is impossible with my budget to do something like that but I would LOVE TO. I am not asking for huge donations, this is just to help out so I can do more for my fans. If you cannot donate I would appreciate if you would even just take the time to watch my videos or maybe come check out a live performance to show your support in my career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exo, \u003cbr\u003eJamie\u003cbr\u003e"
