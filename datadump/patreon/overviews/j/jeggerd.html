Through my Twitch channel and travels for work and through college, I have met and helped many people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish to move what I am doing into a bigger area of my career and phase out of my current IRL career. This will blend gaming, with a variety of video content, along with life coaching/counseling. I have a bachelor\u0027s degree in Psych, a master\u0027s degree in Education, and am a certified life coach. I have helped people for 10+ years with situations of all kinds (business, fitness, mental health, etc) and it is something I relish because I feel all deserve to have the happiness they desire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo many of you have supported me this far and I appreciate that. I hope you all and others will join me in my journey! I plan to shape this in a way that we all benefit, not just me. You will have chances to create something for yourself and maybe even find a passion or make your current one come to fruition! Let\u0027s get it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Shoutouts to YosukeisloveYosukeislife for all of the work he\u0027s done in creating page layouts, Twitch emotes, Chibi designs, and everything else he\u0027s done! Dothewhatnow for my cover image here that was made in Minecraft. And to Redmoon for making the OG Jeggerd logo!**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you want your Patreon pledge to show in my twitch chat, go to \u003ca href=\"http://twitch.center/patreon/jeggerd\"\u003ehttp://twitch.center/patreon/jeggerd\u003c/a\u003e to set it up. Be aware it will show your real name unless you change it, so make sure to change the name to what you prefer it to show on the stream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your support!\u003c/em\u003e"
