Set in an alternate history WW2 with dragons instead of airplanes, who are ridden by frequently topless female aviators, the series has been hella fun and gotten a great reception.

Their sexual escapades lead them across the path of all sorts of unsavory-yet-savory characters, and Patreon supporters will have a say in which character she encounters next.\u003cbr\u003eLastly, in addition to exclusive Bombshells pics, exclusive Jackanapes comics in color, Patreon supporters get to help choose which fan art characters get drawn all sexy like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fav.me/dc3e5x5\"\u003ehttp://fav.me/dc3e5x5\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/b447e2c685c27c6bad55228f99d365d9/tumblr_ocunn5ekTc1vveofwo1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I have been drawing naughty stuff for a considerably shorter period, though I\u0027ve tried to make up for lost time. I appreciate you stopping by my page, and I hope you stay a while...\u003cbr\u003eIf you do, you\u0027ll be helping an artist with a raging case of ADD, who only seems to actually improve when he\u0027s drawing what he\u0027s interested in drawing. So, if this whole Patreon thing works out, I won\u0027t have to rely as much on commissions, and I\u0027ll have more freedom to follow my muse. More growth for me means better art for everybody, so it\u0027s a win-win for everyone but your accountant (who really thinks spending money on naughty art is the height of fiscal irresponsibility).",
