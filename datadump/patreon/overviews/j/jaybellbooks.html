    "summary": "The short version: I\u2019m Jay Bell. If you\u2019re\nheard of me, it\u2019s probably because of \u003cem\u003eSomething\nLike Summer\u003c/em\u003e, which is the first book in a series of gay romance novels, a\nweb comic, and also a movie. As an indie artist, it\u2019s a struggle to keep my\ncreative enterprises going.

Awesome! Pledge options are on the\nright, and a current list of the goodies you\u0027ll gain instant access to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/master-list-of-4407110\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eis right here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u2019s the long story: The truth is, I\u2019m doing\nokay for an author in my genre. That doesn\u2019t mean I have an assistant, or a\nmansion, or a luxurious life. It means I don\u2019t have a day job. I\u2019m not forced to\nsqueeze my writing into the wee hours of the night. I\u2019m able to focus on the comics\nand books that I write so I can make them the best they can be. The problem is\nthat the market has become very cutthroat. The big retailers pressure authors\nto sign an exclusivity deal which limits books to their site only. Not playing\nalong means decreased visibility and less sales, which I\u2019ve definitely seen. Another\ntricky thing about working in a niche genre is that there are only so many\nreaders. Hitting the number one spot on the gay romance charts won\u2019t make you\nrich. I\u2019ve been there before. It was okay. Hitting number one in a mainstream\ngenre? I\u2019ve seen the numbers, and it\u2019s beautiful. The stuff of dreams! I don\u2019t\nwant to stop writing gay fiction though. I love it too much.  Some of you love my writing. Maybe we can work\nsomething out!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor those of you who enjoy the worlds I\u2019ve\ncreated and want more, I can give that to you. In addition to writing my\nfull-length releases, we have a new weekly\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSomething\nLike...\u003c/em\u003eweb\ncomic. You may already know Ben and Tim\u2019s story from the book series, but this\nisn\u2019t a simple adaptation. It\u2019s a new start, a retelling with fresh twists and surprises.\nThese characters have burst into a colorful life of their own, thanks to the\nimpressive artistic talents of Cassy Fallon. By supporting us both, you\u2019ll get access to new pages of the comic, weeks before they debut on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gaywebcomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egaywebcomics.com\u003c/a\u003e. You\u2019ll also\nget to see the rough pencils for each page, and the unobscured art without all\nthe pesky text in the way. Not enough? You\u2019ll also receive a monthly couples\nillustration where Cassy draws your favorite characters in romantic (and often\nsexy) scenarios, and I write accompanying mini-stories. Want to see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/rendered-01-ben-7941010\"\u003eBen kissing Tim\u003c/a\u003e? Jace loving on Victor? No problem\nbecause those contributing five dollars or more will be able to vote on who is\nfeatured each month. If you prefer written prose, we\u2019ll be starting a new\ninteractive story called \u003cem\u003eBlank Slate\u003c/em\u003e when\nwe reach our milestone goal. Readers will get to vote on what happens at the\nend of each installment and steer the story. In other words, we get to collaborate! We did this last year and ended up writing an entire book together! That was\ntremendous fun and I\u2019m sure it will be again. Fans of the \u003cem\u003eSomething Like\u2026\u003c/em\u003e books will also enjoy regular texting sessions\nbetween two characters. \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/something-like-3870413\"\u003eYou can see the first one here.\u003c/a\u003e And finally, joining\ngives you instant access to many stories, including the entire Loka Legends series, which is a lighthearted fantasy romp with a twist of gay romance. Those contributing eight bucks or\nmore per month will also receive a free eBook copy of my future releases \u003cstrong\u003ebefore\u003c/strong\u003e\nthey are made available to the masses.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you can\u2019t\ncontribute financially, that\u2019s okay, I totally understand. Please consider\nspreading the news about what I\u2019m doing here, or better yet, about my books in\ngeneral, to anyone you think would be interested. That\u2019s more helpful than you\nmight imagine. If you can join us, please check out the different pledge levels\nand choose the one most suited to your needs. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
