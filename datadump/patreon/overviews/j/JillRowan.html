    "summary": "Hi, thank you so much for your interest, and welcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m a writer with three novels and three short stories published who made the move from\ntraditional publishing to self-publishing and hasn\u0027t regretted it since. All my works are available on Amazon. I love writing and other creative pursuits such as photography and making podcasts and  videos and I\u0027d like to share all of these with my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife as a writer while helping to care for my elderly mother is usually a bit low on one essential: money. I\u0027ve been lucky to earn enough to pay the rent via Amazon, but that still leaves a big shortfall for living expenses. It also reduces my options in employing editors and cover artists and means I\u0027m limited in the scope of what I can do with my creative interests outside writing, despite having all sorts of ideas (videos and podcasts, plus photography in general).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHence, here I am on Patreon, and looking forward to engaging with my patrons and sharing exclusive content with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to join my community of patrons you will have access to exclusive blog entries and podcasts, a first look at my works in progress, as well as news and snippets of what is to come. I will also be working on regular draft instalments of one of my stories, especially for my patrons (until completion), in both written and podcast forms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m fizzing with plans and ideas for content (video especially is planned for later) and want to make it all as good as possible, so anyone who wants to climb aboard, go on, it\u0027ll be fun!\u003cbr\u003e"
