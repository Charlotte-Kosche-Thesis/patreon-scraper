You can find the currently-released episodes over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://knives-the-novel.net,\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://knives-the-novel.net\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0If you like what you read, you can help fund the next episodes. Whee!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons also get access to super-special content (for a very loose definition of \"super\") that is unlocked when you pledge to support the effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings you should know about \u003cem\u003eKnives\u003c/em\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere is blood.

Sound familiar? In this format, \u003cem\u003esomething has to happen\u003c/em\u003e every damn time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI chose to ask people to pledge to support the story in 10-chapter blocks, so that people could enjoy the story and feel good about it without paying far more than an average novel costs. So in fact you can give me encouragement for practically nothing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRough drafts of the first chapters can be found elsewhere on the Web, if you\u0027re enterprising enough to find them, but the versions at the above address are spruced up and retrofitted with ideas I came up with later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProjects like this are about community \u2014 about a bunch of people like you finding something fun to share. So tell your friends, and please be sure to join in the discussions."
