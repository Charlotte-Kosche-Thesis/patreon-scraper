    "summary": "I am a writer and creator of theater/performance/art. These things take time. Time not only to do but conceive, create, let sit, return to, revisit, revise, and then the rather time consuming process of finding the publishers, venues and places these projects want to live. In order to keep creating, I could use your help. As a Patron, you will have first dibs on seeing what I\u0027m up to - whether it\u0027s finished writing, theater, art, or thoughts about the process of creating said writing, theater, art. I will invite you to engage at various steps along the way of these processes. I am also happy to give you a shout out on my social media platforms about your own project/s or fine self. But mostly, what you will be doing is giving this writer, artist, thinking human time and space to do her work. This would be you being a good human being. And me being incredibly grateful to you for that. I\u0027m fairly sure there will be a place in heaven for you. If not, I don\u0027t know what the point of heaven is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe video above is an introduction to the kind of art I make, which are short meditations on the life in front of me. This is the wetland where the Harlem and Hudson Rivers meet in Inwood Hill Park, taken in March 2015, after I had been editing my book at Indian Road Cafe. I like to do these handheld shots, 30 second to one minute meditations. I will post these kinds of videos periodically. Below I have posted a link to another video of accidental beauty outside the cafe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information about me and access to links to my writing and other work, check out my blog \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSomewhere in Transition\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://julialeebarclay.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHere is a link to another moment of \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/175289788\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAccidental Beauty\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am an award-winning writer and director, with\nwork (primarily stage texts) published and produced internationally. I was\ninducted into the Indie Theater Hall of Fame in NYC in 2014 and was founding\nArtistic Director of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.flyingoutofsequence.org\"\u003eApocryphal Theatre\u003c/a\u003e in\nLondon (where I lived from 2003-11). I let go of the theater company and moved\nback to New York in order to focus on writing \u003cem\u003eThe Amazing True Imaginary Autobiography of Dick \u0026amp; Jani\u003c/em\u003e, which I felt impelled\nto do after my father died, and I found pictures of my most difficult\ngrandmother, Dick, as a young woman and girl. I had always wanted to write\nabout my glamorous, rabble-rousing grandmother, Jani, but Dick\u2019s story - until\nI saw those photos showing her as a happy young person and not the bitter woman\nI knew - remained opaque. I have written more about what motivated this book\nabout both of them in a post I was invited to write in relation to\nmicro-history (a term I learned from Jill Lepore when corresponding with\nher):\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://booksbywomen.org/grandmothers-selves-micro-history/\"\u003eOur Grandmothers, Our Selves\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0The\nOther Stories has recently released a podcast in which I read excerpts from the\nbook followed by an interview with Ilana Masad:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theotherstories.org/episodes/episode-57-excerpts-from-the-amazing-true-imaginary-autobiography-of-dick-jani-by-julia-lee-barclay-morton/\"\u003eEpisode 57 - The Other Stories - excerpts from THE AMAZING TRUE IMAGINARY AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF DICK \u0026amp; JANI\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy writing has been published, in printed\nanthologies and online, including Ohio Edit, Prentice-Hall, Indie Theater\nNow and Stockholm Review (which journal nominated my story for the\nSundress Publications Best of the Net 2015 anthology). I was a finalist in\n2014 for a Non-Fiction Short Works award at Burlington Book Festival (judge:\nLeslie Jamison). \u003cem\u003eDick and Jani\u003c/em\u003e was long-listed for the Mslexia\nPrize in the UK. I was accepted for a residency at Vermont Studio Center\nin May 2015, where I revised a large chunk of the book, completing the edit at\nWisdom House in Connecticut in August. I have been invited to\nnumerous academic conferences to present my work, most notably in 2010 as\na guest speaker at the 21st Century Literature conference at University of\nLincoln, where I presented alongside authors such as Will Self, Iain\nSinclair and Carol Ann Duffy. Aside from Fordham (where I am an adjunct\nprofessor), I have taught at a many universities in New York and London, both\nas a professor and guest artist. I was awarded a practice-as-research PhD\narguing that theater can be an act of philosophy in 2009 at University of\nNorthampton, UK (for which I was awarded a full fellowship - an unusual honor\nfor an American in the UK). I received a BA with High Honors in Theater from\nWesleyan University in 1986. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently looking for a publisher for my book, beginning new writing projects, keeping up my blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://julialeebarclay.blogspot.com\"\u003eSomewhere in Transition\u003c/a\u003e and getting back into some new theater and performance making, along with making short videos and photo sets of still lives in line with an idea I am developing of auto-siteography. I will make all of these various projects available in process and product stages to my Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e",

This monetary goal represents an amount that would aid me in doing so, by paying a good chunk of my expenses each month - whether it\u0027s for writing or rehearsal space or time to complete projects. This in concert with payment for any work and/or grants could make this possible. Thank you for any contribution towards this goal. Knowing you are out there supporting me means the world.",
