I am a polymorphic kryptomagna engine expressing the sublime. I paint and draw with oil, charcoal, ink, acrylic/latex. I sculpt costumes and express myth and parable through solo and group dance performances and performance art, collaborating with other musicians and dancers in Baltimore. I am also a professional model, muse, and poet. I am currently working on my creative directorial debut of a music video and am planning future video productions. I curate, produce, and teach. I am a prolific artist that is engaged and well-loved within the Baltimore community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is my life-long passion, the source of my soul purpose, and its growth is the motivation of my decisions. Hailing from West Virginia, I am inspired by nature, my dreams, and the worlds in which I create. In addition, I love to garden and previously served 2 years in the US army.",
