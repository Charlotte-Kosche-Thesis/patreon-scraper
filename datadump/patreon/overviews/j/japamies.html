I have titled this cycle \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoundations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, as it is based on foundational texts of political theorists whose ideas have had an impact on my political education. The third project in the works is a \u003cstrong\u003elarge-scale piece for contrabass clarinet and choir\u003c/strong\u003e, commissioned by the Portuguese clarinetist Carlos Cordeiro and the vocal ensemble Ekmeles. Finally, I will also be writing \u003cstrong\u003ea new piece for Nima Janmohammadi\u003c/strong\u003e, a setar performer of Persian classical music and composer.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComposing requires significant time and energy. It is a demanding form of intellectual and emotional labor. However, most composers do not make enough money from their own music in order to have a healthy lifestyle\u2014\u003cem\u003erent is expensive, bills add up\u003c/em\u003e. In fact, it is very common for composers to supplement their income through other activities, including teaching, performing, or even pursuing day jobs unrelated to music. I am no exception to that, and so I have to pursue other types of labor in order to make a living. By contributing to this Patreon account, you are helping me to explore music as an art form in depth\u2014you are contributing to my having the time to focus on what is meaningful to me: \u003cstrong\u003ethe development of new musical forms and ideas\u003c/strong\u003e. I deeply appreciate your support, and I can only thank you for believing in my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all honesty, I am not happy about having to launch a Patreon account to support my work as a composer. I believe that platforms like this one are the ultimate outcome of a political economy that has brought exceeding precariousness to many types of labor, including the domains of music and artistic expression. There is little I can do to change this reality in the short term, so I apologize in advance if this contradiction bothers you\u2014it certainly bothers me.\u003cbr\u003e"
