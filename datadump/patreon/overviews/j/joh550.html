    "summary": "Hello to the person reading this! I am a nineteen-year-old guy from the Faroe Islands. My everyday life consists of working as a salesman, bartender,\u00a0and waiter.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 One of my biggest dreams is to be able to help provide people who, through birth or injury find themselves without a limb, a cheap and reusable alternative to traditionally expensive prosthetics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Unfortunately, most people who are either born without or lose a limb in some form of accident, typically can\u0027t afford to buy a prosthetic with a four-five figure price tag. My goal is to be able to design and 3D print functional prosthetics at home. This way I will be able to help people in need of a cheap alternative. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Besides this, I\u0027d like to get good enough to be able to make custom prints for people in need of anything from spare parts to home decor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0To anyone interested in helping me achieve this goal, which will henceforth be known as \"The Cause\", your contribution would be invaluable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
