    "summary": "Hello, Wonderous Human Beings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are reading this, then you have stumbled upon the magical world of Jesse Powers Music. This is an ongoing fundraising platform that helps create a sustainable income for artists. Your contributions are per creation, and while I aim to make lots of content, I\u0027ll only be posting 2 or 3 so named \"creations\" a month! You can put a cap on how many creations a month you\u0027d like to contribute for as well, so no worries!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere, I aim to create a space where souls of all expressions can come and get lost (or found) in the power and presence of meaningful music. I am poet and a storyteller. I create content carefully crafted by consciousness and communion with the Universe. I write and sing from a place of passion and reverie, and I love waking up every day and helping others (and myself!) love Being Human.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re looking for a way to create change in the world but don\u0027t know where to start--start here! The power of this community reaches far beyond funding original music. This family of humans is wielding the power of togetherness to give voice and velocity to a movement: The movement of profound authenticity and deep self-love. I am honored to be the representative of this community, and it\u0027s my job to create and perform art that sparks and fuels that movement toward conscious, full, living.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is where I get to do what I love and do best: make music and create community. I aim to release two high-quality creations per month. That could be a new music video, new song from an upcoming album, or any number of beautiful things that happen to overflow out into my world. I\u0027ll also be releasing bonuses (think footage from my childhood, extra cover songs, songs-in-progress, live recordings, etc.) for certain tiers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you want to be a part of this big, happy family and contribute to our vision of infusing the world with groovy, conscious, profound pop music, come on in! Check out the tiers over to the right to decide in what ways you\u0027d like to contribute and be sure to scan the left side to watch the goals for our community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, the Jesse Powers Music Family is creating inspiring music that moves people to seek truth and love within themselves and rediscover a reverie and appreciation for life and humanness. We are changing the face of pop music by going deep and celebrating the complexities, joys, and pains of being a Human Being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWanna help us keep making this magic? Embody the change you want to see. Join us!"
