My name is Josh Hardie and I\u2019ve been making a living as a full time artist since 2014. I sculpt, mold, cast, and paint-- but most of all I love to share everything that I\u0027ve taught myself over the years. You can see more of my work on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.joshhardie.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e and my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshhardie9/\"\u003eInstagram page\u003c/a\u003e @joshhardie9.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI often receive questions about my work, process, and materials.  Being an artist means I need to keep busy in order to eat, so I don\u0027t have time to respond to everyone on social media.  Patreon gives me an opportunity to interact with you, answer questions, and hopefully continue to inspire you to pursue -your- artistic goals!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/j402/JoshHardie9/EarlyWork.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003eEarly Sculpture Works\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2014 I took a leap of faith and quit my day job, intent on making a living as a full time artist. At that time, I was fully enamored with the resin kit world. \u00a0Since I was a bit shy about my personal work, the only logical way to try to make money seemed to be monster kits. \u00a0Thus, my side project CreatureKits was born. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from attending art school to learn to draw and paint,\u00a0I\u0027m a primarily self taught sculptor. \u00a0Through resources on the internet I learned to sculpt, mold and cast by producing creature resin kits, sharing my progress on Instagram and selling my creations online and at conventions.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI neglected to fully express myself however. \u00a0Since I was a kid I have had a love for the dark and surreal.  The first time I saw anything like that was when I was five years old and I stumbled across an HR Giger book.  It was love at first sight.  Well\u2026more like obsession.  His work scared the living shit out of me, but the imagery struck a cord deep inside.  Ever since then I\u2019ve been inspired to draw, doodle, sculpt, and paint, specifically the imagery I experience in my dreams. \u00a0Growing up in a Christian environment, however, didn\u0027t exactly nurture my artistic endeavors. \u00a0I was extremely self conscious about this type of work and it wasn\u2019t until recently that I began sharing this intensely personal work with others. \u00a0I\u0027ve grown a lot, not only as a person but as an artist as well, and now I\u0027m ready to fully explore the Shadow Side. \u00a0CreatureKits is being put on the back burner and a new chapter is opening up.  This new chapter, funny enough, is where my artistic journey began.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/j402/JoshHardie9/EarlyPaintings.jpg\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eEarly Paintings -- Based on Frequent Nightmares\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreatureKits will live on in its own way. \u00a0I still love sculpting monsters and teaching aspiring artists what I\u0027ve learned. \u00a0Kits will be released in the future, but my main focus will be exploring the Shadow Side and of course-- giving back to my patrons. \u00a0Through Patreon, I can focus on accomplishing the goals that mean most to me: \u00a0Expressing myself artistically, sharing knowledge with others, giving back to those that support my work, and hopefully inspiring someone to pursue their own dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/j402/JoshHardie9/newwork.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eOpening the Next Chapter\u00a0 -- Work from Late 2016 and Early 2017\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m incredibly grateful for all of the support I have received and I can\u2019t wait to share more with you in the future.  Helping and inspiring others to reach their artistic goals means a great deal to me.  Being an artist isn\u0027t easy\u2014 especially if you don\u0027t have the means to attend an art school that\u2019s worth a damn.  I should know, I taught myself to sculpt with only the internet at my disposal.  I\u2019m here to spread whatever knowledge I can. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
