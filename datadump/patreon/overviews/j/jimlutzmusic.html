    "summary": "Hi there! I\u2019m Jim, and I make music and videos, mostly using trombones. I grew up in central Michigan and am now based in New York. I\u2019m so happy and honored to share my creations with you, and I hope they make you happy too!\u00a0Thank you for checking out my Patreon page, and for considering becoming my patron! My patrons give me sustainable revenue from my creations, and I can\u2019t thank them enough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re new to Patreon, here\u2019s how it works: Patrons (that\u2019s you, hopefully!) pledge to pay me any amount they choose when I make new creations. I plan to post 2-3 finished projects each month. In return, paying patrons will get a first-class membership experience, including exclusive rewards like patron-only bonus content, behind-the-scenes access, insights into (and influence on)\u00a0my creative process, early access to new works, free downloads, and acknowledgement in the credits. (I\u0027m open to other ideas for rewards, too!) Note that patrons can also set a monthly maximum total for their pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA final thought: I create original content and post it freely on sites like YouTube, and/or offer it for sale on Bandcamp, iTunes, and other platforms. I want to continue doing that, because I deeply enjoy both the process and the finished products, and because I know that my work is enjoyed and appreciated by all kinds of folks around the world! Each video I make generally involves thousands of dollars worth of instruments and gear, decades of training and experience, and\u00a0at least 20-30 hours/several days of hard work to get from an idea in my head to the finished product you see on your screen. People (myself included!) have gotten used to enjoying online content for free, and we often can\u2019t fathom the time, energy, resources, and passion that go into creating that content. We see, we \u201clike,\u201d we share, and we move on. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it truly makes my heart happy when people show their appreciation for what I do! But as much as I enjoy the likes, shares, subscriptions, praise, and other warm fuzzies, they don\u2019t pay the bills... :) The good news is that people are starting to consider both the value and the cost of the content we all enjoy online, and to look for ways to support creators. And guess what? You have just found a fantastic way to do support a creator! I hope that you get enjoyment and value from my music and videos, and that you\u2019ll consider joining me on this journey. I find Patreon exciting because it allows you as a patron to get some really cool stuff and be a part of my story (and make me part of yours!), while enabling me to make sustainable income from creating music, videos, and other content. Cool, right?! Thanks again for stopping by and for considering becoming a patron. See you soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
