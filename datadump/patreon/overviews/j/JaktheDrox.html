     "about": "\"Broca was a humanist of the nineteenth century, but unable to shake the consuming prejudices, the human social diseases, of his time. He thought men superior to women, and whites superior to blacks. Even his conclusion that German brains were not significantly different from french ones was in rebuttal to a Teutonic claim of Gallic inferiority. But he concluded that there were deep connections in brain physiology between gorillas and men. Broca, the founder of a society of free thinkers in his youth, believed in the importance of untrammeled inquiry and had lived his life in pursuit of that aim. His falling short of these ideals shows that someone as unstinting in the free pursuit of knowledge as Broca could still be deflected by endemic and respectable bigotry. Society corrupts the best of us. It is a little unfair, I think, to criticize a person for not sharing the enlightenment of a latter epoch, but it is also profoundly saddening that such prejudices were so extremely pervasive. The question raises nagging uncertainties about which of the conventional truths of our own age will be considered unforgivable bigotry by the next. \"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"One way to repay Paul Broca for this lesson which he has inadvertently provided us is to challenge, deeply and seriously, our own most strongly held beliefs.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarl Sagen -Broca\u0027s Brain\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003eHello\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is Drox\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have reached my Patreon! welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an Intersexed male of the Pacific SW USA\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eINTP-T\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~\u2665 I am partnered \u2665~\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/robotface\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://a.facdn.net/20170725/robotface.gif\" title=\"robotface\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/jakthedrox\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://a.facdn.net/20170725/jakthedrox.gif\" title=\"jakthedrox\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~\u2665 happy and content \u2665~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a man of art and science \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is my life\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t Sass me\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are coming here with intent to color my work by request of a commissioner of mine, you are more than welcome to! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e!Discord Channel for streams!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/8F7E73w\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/8F7E73w\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyou can also find me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/jakthedrox/\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/jakthedrox/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://jak-the-drox.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttp://jak-the-drox.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.weasyl.com/~jakthedrox\"\u003ehttps://www.weasyl.com/~jakthedrox\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://beta.furrynetwork.com/jakthedrox/\"\u003ehttps://beta.furrynetwork.com/jakthedrox/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/Jakkal\"\u003ehttps://picarto.tv/Jakkal\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ejakkalope on Telegram\u003cbr\u003ejakthedrox@gmail.com",
