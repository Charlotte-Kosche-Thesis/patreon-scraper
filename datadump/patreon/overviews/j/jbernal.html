    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is JB?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHI, I\u0027m Jeremy Bernal (aka JB) and I\u0027ve been illustrating professionally since the 90s, with a background in traditional animation and airbrush. I\u0027m going to keep doing what I do best --drawing pinup stuff of hot bunny chicks in compromising adult situations, usually while partially dressed in killer lingerie. Maybe I\u0027ll draw some hot not-furry chicks as well. My normal production is 3-4 full illustrations per month. You can get it here, or at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sexyfur.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSexyFur.com\u003c/a\u003e, or both, if you really like the art that much. Here, I\u0027ll add extra stuff you can\u0027t get there, like layered PSD files, special sketches, etc. Be sure to check out the different reward levels and find one that you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ipic.su/img/img7/fs/barsamples.1432323248.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll use the revenues from this here gallery to help fund side projects like my GunBunny game --check out \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/gunbunny\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.patreon.com/gunbunny\u003c/a\u003e -- and whatever else I can come up with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get for your patronage?\u003c/strong\u003e Here\u0027s the deal:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePledges are processed instantly here; this means you will have instant access to the latest batch of stuff. I post web-resolution stuff and sketches here in the Patron posts, and all the larger files like videos and PSDs can be accessed by monthly dropbox links (check posts near the beginning of the month for these links).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecause most of the art packs end up being around 2GB in size (large, layer-heavy PSD files), I only have so much room on dropbox so I must clear it out every couple of months. So the high-res stuff is up for a limited-time only. If you would like to purchase past-months\u0027 art packs, please inquire if they are still available and we can work something out. If you want access to 15+ years of my past stuff, please check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sexyfur.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSexyFur.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHigh-resolution and higher tiers get to vote on which sketches I will complete in full color.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor the latest dropbox links (they expire) you can do a search for the keyword dropbox.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEveryone, even the $1 tier Patrons, get access to the Discord server (directions\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-How-do-I-get-my-Discord-Rewards-\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e) which is a good place to see sketches, works-in-progress, make comments and suggestions, chat with other folks, get stream notifications, share ideas, and generally conspire.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the WHEEL:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI do my brainstorming with help from the fans, by streaming my sketch sessions at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/EvilArtChannel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePicarto.TV\u003c/a\u003e. The public shouts out ideas which go on the WHEEL, and it spins, and I draw what it commands.

At the start of the sketch session, a Patron-only spin is made. This ensures that at least one Patron sketch is made per sketch session.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEach of the Conspiracy Room Patrons gets two permanent WHEEL picks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou may choose the same thing twice, or choose another person\u0027s suggestion if you like it, to increase the odds that that idea is drawn.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRules on OCs: You can add an OC to the WHEEL provided that it (a) is not a commercial character derivative (ie: Ponies, Starfox, etc), (b) appears with one of my characters, and (c) you are ok with it if it goes on to become a full illustration for use here and on my other sites.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscord:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo please check out the Discord chat, as it is a fun place to chat and bounce ideas around for art stuff.
