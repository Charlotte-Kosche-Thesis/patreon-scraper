I have been modeling for over 6 years and have been a YouTube creator for over 3 years. Recently I have gotten into self portraiture and I love sharing my pictures with you guys! I have also slowly been getting more and more sponsors noticing me as someone they would like to help push their products, which is always fun! It\u0027s been a great journey meeting so many people and finding myself in the process. I love intertwining my passions and my amazing Patrons have made it all possible. There are so many talented people you could be supporting and the fact that you chose to believe in ME is so special! I truly appreciate all of my supporters :) I am a shy girl with severe ADHD and have been told for many years that my passions were worthless to pursue, because I wasn\u0027t pretty enough, wasn\u0027t able to stay on task and just wasn\u0027t unique enough to be noticed. But I didn\u0027t give up hope because I felt like there was a place in this world for me, and I feel like I have found it! And to know that I have brightened people\u0027s days, people who felt like I did, fans with the same struggles as me, gives me a happy heart! I truly feel as though my passions have saved me \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eMy Steel Knights!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI lovingly refer to my fans as my Steel Knights, and it\u0027s not just a quirky play on my name! My Knights are strong, capable and intelligent; the perfect guys (and girls!)! I\u0027ve seen the fans of other models and entertainers and I swear MINE are the absolute BEST. I\u0027ve created solid connections and friendships with them that I wouldn\u0027t trade for the world. They are the ones who will make sure I don\u0027t fade away. I\u0027ve researched Patreon and decided this was the best avenue to embark on our journey for world domination (hehe!). Not only will I NOT fade away into the ether, but my KNIGHTS get exclusive perks and access that NO ONE ELSE will ever be able to see: my NSFW pro photos that I don\u0027t post anywhere, behind-the-scenes selfies, videos that may be a little too risque for YouTube, and more, it\u0027ll all be here just for you. It\u0027s a win-win! Showing support in not just appreciative words, but actual dollar amounts, is making a statement! Every little dollar gets me closer to creating the quality content I dream of. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eNSFW Content!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon is not a paysite or store, it is a Reward Platform; for the people who wish to show their support in dollar amounts, I give them special perks that aren\u0027t available to anyone else! Regarding the NSFW (Not Safe For Work) videos, I personally do not consider them pornographic in nature, but sometimes the things that I create are open to interpretation! I have posted behind-the-scenes nude photoshoot content, new outfit try-ons which feature full nudity and more. I am not a Cam Girl or porn star, I am a model who enjoys being nude :) All NSFW content I post for my Patrons is stuff that I am comfortable sharing with them, so if you are looking for something a little more \"sexual\" I might suggest trying somewhere else. For longtime (and new!) fans of mine, my Patreon videos are greatly enjoyed, and I love being able to share this side of me with the people who care about me most!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eGoals (of Steel!)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3 quality YouTube videos uploaded weekly and several fun and spicy photoshoots a month is my initial goal, with room for expansion! Yes sometimes we will have slow months but I try very hard to release as much content as I can make, as soon as I can make it! :) I\u0027d like be able to travel to shoot in fun locations and ranges (maybe to a city near you!), support small businesses and veterans by buying from them and showcasing their companies on my channel, and grow relationships with potential sponsors. I\u0027m open to ideas and I want to hear from YOU, my most supportive fans! As we reach our goals I may tweak the milestones and the rewards a bit, but I will try my best to never take anything away from a level! The possibilities are endless and it all starts with a tiny little dollar. A dollar to make a difference? What a deal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end it\u0027s about making a difference in a creative\u0027s life so they can do the things you appreciate so much without having to stop for anything or anyone. So cheers to my Steel Knights, let\u0027s do this!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
