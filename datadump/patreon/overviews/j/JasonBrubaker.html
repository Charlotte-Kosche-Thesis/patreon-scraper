     "description": "Once I reach $2500 per month, my bills will be completely covered through patron support! This will be HUGE for me! Currently I am teaching, freelancing and using Kickstarter to make sure my bills get paid but this fractures my time and makes it hard to really focus on starting the next BIG graphic novel. When I get to $2500 a month I will be able to drop many of these smaller side projects in order to focusing solely on my upcoming graphic novel project. This also means I will not have to worry about pitching it to a publisher or webtoons before it\u0027s ready.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give you an idea of 2018\u0027s planning, I made a video called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx69sYwMl1E\"\u003eFlawless Options\u003c/a\u003e where I tried to break down my plans and strategy for funding the year. So far it\u0027s been quite different than my plans but it still gives you an idea of how complicated it can be without a steady paycheck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, with $2500 of steady income from Patreon, I will be able to focus on really starting my next BIG book. :) I can\u0027t wait.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
