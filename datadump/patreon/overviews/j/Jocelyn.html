My work is in helping you transform your life to the most authentic expression of yourself so that together we can start creating heaven on Earth!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m most known for my writing on Spirit Science! My most popular piece was on how to cut energy cords from previous lovers to help heal past relationship trauma, it was so well recieved it got around 500K shares! After that article, people from all over the world started flooding my inbox with letters of gratitude and also requests to work with me one on one! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was so amazing to see that what I had always swept under the rug in my personality was not only cherished but people could really relate to my story and my extrasensory abilities! I started making a career out of helping fellow empaths or super sensitive people step out into the world as their true selves embodied! For me this is just the beginning of what and how I would like to help the shift of humanity! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo What is Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon works sort of like Kickstarter or Indiegogo - but instead of backing one large project, like a Novel or YouTube video, here on Patreon, you help support a bunch of smaller projects or donate monthly (like I have chosen!)  By joining the Patreon family, you pledge per month -- and in return, receive some pretty awesome rewards! You can choose to pledge any amount you\u0027d like ($1, $5, $200 etc)! It is like a monthly subscription to receive behind the scenes gifts! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are my Plans?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for Spirit Science since July of 2014 and the amount of love and support I\u0027ve received since then has been overwhelming! Since 2015,  I have had my first one on one clients and guided meditations. Just this year, I have been able to have my first online course!  I see myself writing a book, an instructional guide for anyone who has felt the world so deeply in such times of incredible change! As well as travelling around the United States offering live workshops (by the end of 2017 hopefully)! I am also excited to start a podcast!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I would love to expand my work so much further to help in the ascension of humanity! No matter the amount you decide to give, every dollar will go back into the creation of more conscious content for the collective. But if you don\u0027t enjoy any of the rewards, don\u2019t fret my friend! The fact that you enjoy my work enough to come check this out was enough! I wouldn\u0027t be where I am today without you, so regardless of whether or not you decide to support me here on Patreon -- Thank you so much! My heart is forever grateful for you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSending you loving presence,\u003cbr\u003eJocelyn\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
