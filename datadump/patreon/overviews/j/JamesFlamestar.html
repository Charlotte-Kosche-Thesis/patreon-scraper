    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m James Flamestar. I\u0027ve been playing music since the tender age of 4, and I started composing when I was 13. I\u0027ve produced, written and released a myriad of music over the years, including two albums (Stargazers and Boomdock). I live, eat, sleep and breathe music. I love to create. I love to talk. I have a deep passion for what I do, and it\u0027s something I\u0027m excited to get the opportunity to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of business models out there to hawk my wares, whether via the traditional sense or by the new waves of opportunity the internet is offering. Patreon is perfect for what I have to offer you - it gives the freedom for you and I to interact directly with each other. Rather than you throwing money at a faceless middleman in order to consume a limited portion of my work, \u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e we have the ability to take a really cool journey \u003cem\u003etogether\u003c/em\u003e. You get to see, read and hear it all. It\u0027s an exciting prospect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to make my living by writing music. It\u0027s been something I\u0027ve wanted to do for years but never had the opportunity or the means to make it happen. Recently that has all changed. This time around, I\u0027m creating content in multiple mediums. In addition to music I\u0027ll be writing about the journey and my life, and creating videos detailing my process, my gear, my general insanity and the life I lead in a giant melting pot of wit, imagination and fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to bring you into my world so you can follow the quest of someone with a dream making it happen. You\u0027ll get to see the highs, the (sometimes) lows, but never the mundane. Every moment is excitement. Come explore the possibilities with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I offering?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe Jimmy Flamb\u00e9 streams\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegular streaming via my twitch channel - music being made LIVE. While there\u0027s no set in stone schedule (due to current workload), we\u0027re aiming for around 2-3 streams a week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eMost important of all... \u003cstrong\u003eThe music\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the thing we\u0027re all here for. The sounds, the songs, the tracks and the albums. I\u0027ll be tackling both small and large projects, albums and EPs. And you\u0027ll get to hear it all here - first, before anyone else. There\u0027s a galaxy of music I\u0027ve written to this point, and a universe of music to come - all in my wonderfully eclectic style spanning multiple genres and sounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m keeping it simple on the reward front, and keeping it cheap. You\u0027re welcome to contribute more if you love what I do - and regardless of how much you choose to contribute, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for supporting my work and keeping the music coming. I want my body of work to be accessible to as many people as possible in order to share the joy of what I do. Every dollar of your support helps me to do this - it keeps the lights on in Flamestar studios, it keeps the synths and drumkits seducing your eardrums, and most important of all it keeps the passion burning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything to declare?\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eRight now I\u0027m balancing this between my day job. The more patrons and support I have, the less of the Day Job (tm) I have to do in order to keep the bills paid - and hence a greater output! So as time goes on I will be able to offer an even greater amount to you, oh humble listener. This is the ground floor - it\u0027s all uphill from here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Sometimes I\u0027ve been known to go on holidays - this may throw updates into disarray with timings for a week or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u003c/strong\u003e On the odd occasion I write music for projects outside of my own. Obviously this music falls outside of the scope of this patreon - but sometimes I may be able to offer a little sneak peek into behind the scenes things ;)\u003cbr\u003e- Occasionally I release music for free, to share the love. When this happens these tracks do not count towards the \u0027per track\u0027 charge!\u003cbr\u003e"
