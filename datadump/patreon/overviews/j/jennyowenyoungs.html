    "summary": "GREETINGS FRIENDS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to join Patreon as a creator because I love making stuff,\u00a0and I love sharing that stuff with you! I want to tell you immediately\u00a0that everything that I create and post online (videos, writing, cat\u00a0photographs) will continue to flow freely - both figuratively and\u00a0literally. That\u0027s not going to change, so don\u0027t panic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClarity is beautiful, so here\u2019s why this page exists:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-to bring a whole bunch of JOY content into one feed\u003cbr\u003e-to give interested folks a seamless way to support the (JOY)arts in\u00a0an ongoing low-impact way\u003cbr\u003e-to make it easier for us to interact with each other, and for y\u0027all\u00a0to connect to one another as well\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be making all sorts of things to share with you: new music,\u00a0unsolicited advice columns, cat photographs, pop culture commentary,\u00a0cover videos, drink-making videos, haikus, and much, much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: So what\u2019s the benefit of being a Patron if everything is going to\u00a0continue to flow freely, Jenny?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: I\u2019m so glad you asked! By becoming a Patron, you\u2019re not only\u00a0supporting the arts in a sustainable way, you\u2019re joining a community\u00a0of people who love a lot of the same things you do. AND you\u0027ll most\u00a0likely experience a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: But, like\u2026what\u2019s the real benefit?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Okay, okay. Patrons will not only be getting some exclusive\u00a0content, but also PREVIEWS of things like videos, new music, and\u00a0articles before anyone else in the whole wide world gets to see them.\u00a0Additionally, I\u2019ll be hitting y\u2019all with some sweet promo codes so\u00a0that you can get an early jump on any merch sales. We might even do\u00a0some random give-aways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: That all sounds cool, but what I REALLY want is a video of you\u00a0doing headstands and playing guitar behind your head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Well\u2026I\u2019ll take that under advisement. I want to know what YOU want\u00a0too. And if the Venn diagram of what I want to make and what you want\u00a0to see/hear/watch has some overlap, then we\u0027ll REALLY be in a party\u00a0zone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks for stopping by! Thanks for caring! I\u0027m so stoked to do this\u00a0weird new thing with y\u0027all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eJenny\u003cbr\u003e"
