No more searching for food, no more disease, and no more danger from traffic for the furry little guys. Maybe they\u0027ll find a forever home with some loving humans. Wouldn\u0027t that be nice?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO WE DO WITH DONATIONS? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil we raise enough money to open a shelter, we will be using the funds to help others pay for any kittens or cats they decide to take in from off the street.

He was all alone crossing a busy street. He nearly got run over! We stopped our motorcycle to pick him up and move him out of the road. There was an empty lot nearby that we thought he wandered out of. Our first thought was to put him back. We quickly realized if we did, he probably wouldn\u0027t survive so we brought him home with us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen we found him he was barely a month old and had scabs all over his body. He was not well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/cyvt7w\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/jYAh0G/IMG_3558.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eThe next day we took him to the vet to get him little kitten medicine and a checkup. We started feeding him milk with a syringe. He was too small to eat solid food. He also got a daily dose of vitamins and deworming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/dDgSZb\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/mowGSw/IMG_3564.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eWe fell in love\u00a0with the little guy.
