Check out the rewards to the right and pick a subscription level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is the PH silent?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause my name is pronounced Jordan, with a silent PH in the middle. #Shrug\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat exactly do you do?\u003c/h4\u003eI make Lore videos about the Dungeons and Dragons universe. I started my YouTube channel because I went searching for similar videos and couldn\u2019t find what I was looking for. I figured if I\u2019m interested in this mythology there must be others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I started Forgotten Realms Explained under the channel Jorphdan. \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJqE7QBvDyc_-q5sZQV3eUK6vwfznTt-6\"\u003eYou can check out my videos here\u003c/a\u003e. I try to keep them short, informative, and entertaining. I\u2019ll freely admit I haven\u2019t got it all figured out and I\u2019m no expert, but I love diving in and creating content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also run a DnD Talk show called the \"Saturday Morning D\u0026amp;D Show\" which we stream live on twitch Saturday Mornings at 9:00am Pacific. This has been a fun side project which has recently moved to its own YouTube channel.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgK09rx0qzZ8GPPFOltlFTg\"\u003eYou can check out those episodes here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat do I get outta this?\u003c/h4\u003eIn addition to helping the channel grow I have a monthly podcast exclusive for patrons where I talk with friends and patrons about their D\u0026amp;D experiences.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re a fan of the channel you\u2019ll be able to vote on upcoming topics and talk directly with me on videos you\u2019d like to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/h4\u003eBack into the channel. The amount of ad revenue from YouTube is comically low for a channel of my size. Patreon money will go towards lights,recording equipment, Dungeons and Dragons PDFs for research, and editing software. Basically keep me from losing money on this hobby channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith enough support I may be able to do multiple videos per week. Perhaps even record some of my D\u0026amp;D sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy Monthly, why not charge per video?\u003c/h4\u003eThis was a tough one. Ultimately I felt that monthly would feel more like supporting the channel as opposed to buying episodes. So for this endeavor we went with a monthly subscription and I don\u0027t see that changing in the future. If you wanted to help on a per episode basis consider subscribing at the $10 level as I average 4 videos per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThank You!\u003c/h4\u003eSeriously!  I do this because I love D\u0026amp;D, I love mythology, and I love making videos. With supporters like you I\u2019m able to keep going and make the content that I want to see. That\u2019s all I could ask for in the world, so again, thank you!"
