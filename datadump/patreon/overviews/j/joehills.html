With your help so far, I produced over 130 Hermitcraft videos in 2016!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFolks who\u2019d like to enable me to produce individual ad-free can help out by backing at the fifty dollar or one hundred dollar level. I know this is a lot of money to ask, but my wife is currently working 70 hours a week on her PhD, and I\u2019m juggling a full-time job and caring for our daughter from when I pick her up at daycare after work until she goes to bed. The money helps defray the costs of my recording space and babysitting, and it is massively appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, I\u2019d like to say that a lot of hard work by my wife and I matched by kindness and support from family and friends, has gotten my family through some rough times to a place of stability and happiness. Everything that you can give will be appreciated, but is not going to make the difference between whether we eat or not. No fan should feel guilty at all if you\u2019d like to give but can\u2019t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make things for all of you that make your lives a little better. Pitch in if you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, and keep adventuring!\u003cbr\u003e"
