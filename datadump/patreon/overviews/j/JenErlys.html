Every single human alive today has ancestors that practiced animistic relationships with Plants. And whether we honor it or not, we are all in those same relationships still. The Plants still turn pure energy into food, carbon dioxide into oxygen. They are still our medicine, our teachers, our allies, our ancestors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEngaging with Plant-beings is not a hobby. This is real Magic. This is true Power. This is paradigm shifting, radically liberating, inherently humbling, relationship-centered, and process-oriented LIVING. There are no rules to follow. There are no end goals to reach. There are no assurances of \"knowing\" rightly. There is no one else who can do the work for you.\u00a0There is no room for the fear of death and shadows. There\u00a0is only the never-ending process of fully embracing Life and all the beings that are Life incarnate... but I AM biased towards the Plant ones. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*More of my work can be found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jenerlys.com\"\u003ewww.jenerlys.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
