    "summary": "Hi! My name is Joshua!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little bit about me \u003c/strong\u003e- I recently moved to Melbourne to study music. I front a project called Amberhill and I frequently write short demos and sketches to be developed into full songs for EPs and Albums for Amberhill. I also have a huge interest in videography and I figured why not combine the two and hopefully make a little bit of extra allowance from both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what you\u0027ll find here - \u003c/strong\u003eMostly short compositions, rough ideas to be developed and sometimes covers of songs accompanied with videos! Sometimes they\u0027ll be videos of my friends and I playing, at other times footages I shoot when I bring my camera out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a Patreon, one of the perks you\u0027ll get at any tier is access to my exclusive feed or \"journal\" entries. Sometimes they\u0027ll be expansions and explanations on the ideas I have on the compositions, sometimes updates on projects i\u0027m working on and at other times I\u0027ll just be sharing my experiences of being a musician in Melbourne.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow this works \u003c/strong\u003e- By becoming a patron, you\u0027ll be pledging an amount to every video I put out. \u003cstrong\u003eI plan to put out between 0-2 videos a month. \u003c/strong\u003eThere are many different options and ways to pledge, and every dollar counts! Different tiers come with different rewards and you can also set a monthly maximum to the amount you pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I funding? \u003c/strong\u003e- Well, you\u0027ll mostly be supporting me with the extra bit of income for my groceries, rent and all that adult stuff. Your contributions will also aid me in affording better video/audio equipment and give me the opportunity to engage others for their mix/master or video and editing services. This in turn, will allow me to put out better content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaving said all that, please don\u0027t feel obliged\u00a0to pledge. \u003c/strong\u003eYou can listen to my band\u0027s music and watch our/my videos. Knowing that someone out there enjoys the work I\u0027ve been putting forth is more than enough reason for me to continue creating content. The support that I\u0027ve received up to this point has been pretty unreal and I don\u0027t think I can ever thank  all of you enough."
