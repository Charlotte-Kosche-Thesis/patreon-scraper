    "summary": "Hey there! My name is Jack Cloverway, or \u0027Egon\u0027, and I\u0027m a writer and webcomics artist moving into the convention circuit and printworks. Some of the fanfiction and longform prose I create may be adult-themed or deal with complex or concerning matters. I\u0027ve been using Patreon\u0027s new tagging system to retroactively tag a controversial ship, and I\u0027ll also tag posts and analysis as NSFW in addition to listing it in the post title if I feel it may not be suitable for everyone. Otherwise, I\u0027ll be using this as a place to share miscellaneous updates for fiction and storefront alike, as well as sketches and progress. Due to Patreon\u0027s difficult image system, I will not have NSFW images posted (any form of NSFW!), because outside of monetary restrictions, there\u0027s no way to make sure they aren\u0027t viewed by people who don\u0027t want to see them.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt present time, I\u0027m responsible for:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn online storefront for cute and geeky goods\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn interactive webcomic called BlindAura\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUndertale fiction: We Are Monsters (NSFW) and The Lies That Destroy Us (NSFW)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEditing an Undertale fan book\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eScripting for a comic called Guardians, with characters created freely available for use under Creative Commons\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSonic the Hedgehog expanded universe fiction and art (STC, Archie...)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis Patreon will allow me to do that much more effectively, getting goodies to my supporters, and supporting other writers, artists, and creators in turn. It\u0027ll allow me to be able to make some of my dreams a reality: print out some items I\u0027d always wanted to make, produce big collaborative art books and comics that showcase my best possible work, and devote more time each week to producing quality work to pass along. Instead of furtive WIPs and concept sketches every now and then, I\u0027d be able to put something complete and wonderful out each week -- starting with new fiction, and expanding into new webcomic posts, updates, votes, and more. The more financial freedom I have, the more freedom from external obligations, and I can in turn share my artistic devotion with you, always with the ideal of self-improvement, giving you all the best work I can make at the time, holding myself to high standards and doing what I love best.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat will you get out of this?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll be part of the inner circle that gets to help decide what goes to press and what gets printed, and you\u0027ll see works in progress, demos, variants, and process pieces before they\u0027re completed. You\u0027ll get to vote on which fictions I prioritize, what I write about, if a certain character cameos, which AU deserves its own fiction, what should make its way to charms, pins, lanyards, and other merch. You\u0027ll be a part of the creative process in a whole new way! The more I\u0027m funded, the more work I make, which means the opportunity to see the things you love put to paper.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial tiers will receive physical items that I\u0027ve been able to make as a result of these funds: washi tape, lanyards, prints, posters, postcards, pins, enamel pins, jewelry, clothing, art books, and comics. I\u0027m aiming to have a convention presence, and these items are ultimately what I\u0027m looking to provide -- you\u0027d receive it all in gratitude for helping to make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027re here, it\u0027s because you like my fiction or my art or my ideas about community and helping other artists along, and you know that the good stuff takes some time and is worth waiting for. So you\u0027re here because you like the things that I like, and because you want to help me build something amazing together. I\u0027m excited to see what we can do!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*NOTE: I\u0027ve been working very hard to make sure that posts are appropriately tagged and that people are made aware of the content before deciding to read. It\u0027s one of the reasons why I\u0027m largely keeping the more explicit NSFW pieces to AO3 alone, even if commissioned or patron-funded, because it allows me to tag, warn, and protect more effectively than here. If you have concerns about ships for the sake of shipping, or wish to argue the issues of such a ship, I\u0027m more than willing to have a hearty and civil debate on tumblr or twitter, but this probably isn\u0027t the best place for it, and if you have repeated objections to my work, I might not be the best fit for you. I\u0027m trying to do my part to protect viewers/readers (I\u0027m limited to five tags here) and still maintain freedom of expression, to the best of my abilities, and I believe that \u003cem\u003ecensoring\u003c/em\u003e a group or ship isn\u0027t the best way to \u003cem\u003ecensure\u003c/em\u003e it. Outside of that, I respect your ability to disagree with my works and opinions, regardless of whether I\u0027m being paid or not!\u003cbr\u003e"

With every golden month you keep me in socks and marmalade, you get one-on-one time on my private skype line to discuss the once-a-month chapter additions or posts dedicated just to you. Not every month will have the same length of chapter, but each month will have the same amount of love and devotion. You\u0027ll also get the $15 tier level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: The skype chats will be weekends; no calls, no webcams, no roleplay. We\u0027ll likely time the chats within a few days of the payment clearing; we can share thoughts and introspections about the long-fic I\u0027m writing you. The fiction update will likely post toward the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e",
