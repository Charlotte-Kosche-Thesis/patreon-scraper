First I had to get past some bs middle class indoctrination before I managed to do this page. I write- largely erotic fiction, but also quite a bit of sexual education and non-fiction focused on various sexual education, social justice, and marginalized identities. It all started off with my \"Vala\u0027s Story\"- first written as a birthday present for my dominant at the time, but it\u0027s become so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly and happily, babysitting isn\u0027t happening so it\u0027s not stressing me and reducing the amount of microaggressions I have to deal with, but finances are extra tight- my Master is struggling to make ends meet- this is sucking the joy and the ability to write out of me- hence part of why I\u0027m seeing about this. See, I\u0027m not so good about writing what passes as \"mainstream\" even within the erotic romance genre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI carry several marginalized identities within me, although racialized identity isn\u0027t one of them. However I am bipolar 1 with rapid cycling with OCD tendencies (yeah, I\u0027ll spell out what that means if you ask :D ) and that diagnosis really doesn\u0027t guarantee disability, but my mental health is such that a job with regular hours and a regular paycheck makes me sick; I\u0027m sure on the Autism Spectrum and the ways I\u0027m different made me easier to teach and parent so no diagnosis; as a 39 year old woman, I question the point of diagnosis now.\u003cbr\u003e"
