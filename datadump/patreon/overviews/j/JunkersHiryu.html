    "summary": "As promised I\u0027ve made a streaming channel for the community. So, as Char has so graciously asked, join me on my failscapdes through WoT.\u003cbr\u003eThe playerbase in WoT is lacking in direction, regardless of tank tier. I cannot say the knowledge isn\u0027t out there because many players have found different places to get information be it the guides on the \u003ca href=\"http://forum.worldoftanks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eofficial forums\u003c/a\u003e, the new \u003ca href=\"http://forum.wotlabs.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWoTLabs forums\u003c/a\u003e, or elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI thoroughly believe that players want to improve... they just don\u0027t know how\u003c/strong\u003e (especially because 90% of players don\u0027t even know the forums exist).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the months I\u0027ve run multiple games with players from 40% to 57% and the difference in skill between them is immense... One thing these players all had in common was the need to improve their level of play.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve said many times the players that seek help are not the issue. Currently there is no good way of reaching the untold masses to steer them on the correct path of proper tanking. An in-game tutorial is in place along with a fairly informative video that denotes the basic gameplay needed to understand the game. I was surprised at how informative this was despite how long it took to appear in the game, but I think the players need more.\u003cbr\u003eSo, what am I getting at here? We\u0027ve gone over the main points of what makes WoT a great game and what we feel ruins the experience ad infinitum. So I want to extend my hand to help the community. I now have the tools to do so and will be working diligently with any player that contacts me via this stream, forums, or in game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I would like to do with the players that contact me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eReview overall tank stats.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReview replays from you, myself and other players.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTackle problems with tank classes, help you find your niche.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp you understand the importance of map reading and what it is exactly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to spend your gold effectively.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMap positions and their importance.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat to do when you see Unicum on your side or the enemy team.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen to be aggressive.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to trade hit points effectively.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSTAYING ALIVE.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIf you want help, understand players are out there that won\u0027t just lash out at you and call you everything under the sun.
