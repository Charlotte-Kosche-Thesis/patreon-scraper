    "summary": "Hey beautiful people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever you have found your way here to my Patreon profile - thank you. I wanted to explain a little about why I decided to do a Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have looked at so many different crowd funding platforms over the past many years and decided not to do a campaign because I didn\u0027t like the way they asked for money only for a project and then it was over :( Because I have been doing this for many years I know that artists and creators of the arts need recurrent funding not only for one small project but for many small projects that eventually make up your portfolio of works, albums, EP\u0027s, videos all this is needed to maintain a community of people who are able to be affected by your work. A career in music is not about one project and one project alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Patreon was introduced to me by a friend I saw immediately that it answered this problem. It provides a way to truly connect with a community of people who are interested in what you are creating. AND it keeps the creator accountable by only funding when a creation is made! I LOVE THIS! It is possible to make a Patreon campaign a monthly campaign meaning that you would contribute monthly even if there are no creations by me. I didn\u0027t think that would work for me, I like the fact that I need to create in order to get paid, and I know that my community will keep me accountable. I\"m looking forward to getting to know you all, and the people that I already know, I\"m looking forward to getting to know you better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been getting some AWESOME questions\nand messages. So I\u2019ve compiled a list of information that I think will explain\nPatreon in much further detail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst I\u2019d like to say that unlike other\nplatforms Patreon is  a perfect place for\npeople to contribute small amounts because the funding is recurrent. Example if\nyou sign up as a Patron giving $5 you can put a monthly max of $5 (which you\nonly get charged when I post a \u201cCreation\u201d) over the course of 12 months that\u2019s\nan absolute total of $60, and that\u2019s only IF I create 1 thing every month. Even\nif I create 10 things every month that\u2019s still an absolute total of $60, and\nyou still get access to my creations. I have supported other artists that I\nbelieve in with small amounts $2, $5 to help them on their way. These amounts\nadd up, if 100 give $5 per creation I will be able to create really awesome\nacoustic videos of my new songs J\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWHAT IS CONSIDERED A \u201cCREATION\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGreat question!\u00a0A creation for me will be anything like\nthis:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn acoustic Video Recording\nwith audio professionally recorded - $500\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA song professionally recorded\n- $1500-$2500 (depending on # of musicians required)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn EP (Album with 4-6 tracks)\nprofessionally recorded \u2013 up to $10,000\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA music video - $10,000\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u2019m even thinking of creating a\nbook in the future! ?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe creation will depend on the amount of\nfunding to be sure that I can create it. I put some figures to the above\ncreations as approx. of what these creations might cost me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWILL YOU BE POSTING CREATIONS FREE?\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYes absolutely when I create new songs I\nmay decided to do a home recording of it just to keep you up to date with what\nI\u2019m creating and  I can post these things\n\u201cfree\u201d. Which means you won\u2019t get charged anything at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLOVE JOANNE"
