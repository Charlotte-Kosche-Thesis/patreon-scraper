He use to have a lot of tantrums and he was not able to control himself but thank God the medication is actually helping him been more in control of his emotions. And he is not self harming as often as before which is an improvement and the reason why I decided to medicate him in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is taking 6 different types of medication (The last 2 are just vitamins):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ Topiramate 50mg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003e+ Fluoxetine 20mg\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ Aripiprazole 5mg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003e+ Methylphenidate hydrochloride 10mg\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ Omeganatur 1000mg\u003cbr\u003e+ Vitamin C\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUPDATE: Josh is no longer taking Fluoxetine and Methylphenidate Hydrochoride, he is now taking Sertraline 50mg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of this Josh has asthma and is currently using 3 different inhalers to help him control his attacks.
