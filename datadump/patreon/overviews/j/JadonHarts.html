    "summary": "Welcome! My name is Jadon. I\u0027m still in high school as of now, but I\u0027m determined to carve out some of my time in hopes of getting my story out there I call \"Saviors\". It\u0027s a Fantasy book set in an around modern time that includes action, mysteries, romance, and a lot of other heart-filled components I\u0027ve put in that I\u0027d like for you to discover yourself. Saviors tells the story of our modern world crossing the bridges with heaven and hell. We follow a special group of characters as they rediscover themselves in a world that\u0027s flipped upside down. I should have the first chapter on my page for everyone to read! Then I should post 1-2 chapters a month for my patrons. I\u0027d \u00a0appreciate it enormously if you could pitch in as I carve out my time and hope to get past the expensive process of licensing and publishing. Even the smallest help from a lot of people can add up. I have goodies waiting for you if you decide to! Thanks so much!"
