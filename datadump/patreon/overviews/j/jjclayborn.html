    "summary": "Why am I on Patreon? Because I want to share my project, \u003cem\u003eThe Starsong Chronicles\u003c/em\u003e, with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is it? It\u0027s a fictional universe that I\u0027ve spend the last decade building and creating for a series of novels and other stories. It\u0027s arguably the largest, most complete, most, accurate, and most consistent universe built. This universe features 20,196 star systems (real stars that you find with your telescope). There are 65 major planets and at least another 13 minor colonies. There is also over 2,000 years of history in this universe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started back in 2002 when I had a dream about some spaceships in the aftermath of a space battle. At first I wanted to turn it into a video game, but I decided that a novel would be better. By 2008 I had begun drafting the novel based on that dream. It was called \u003cem\u003eUnity\u003c/em\u003e. I had to put it on the back burner for a while. I got about 30,000 words into it and I found myself constantly asking \"Why did this happen?\". I would find an answer for that, and then I would ask \"Well, why did that happen?\" Before I knew it, I had created 2,000 years of history and wanted to start at the beginning.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are at least two main story arcs in this universe. The \"Exodus Arc\" follows the story Damarien Tierney and his descendants as they struggle to settle an alien world in the Hyades Cluster. There are at least 9 books already outlined in this series, waiting to be written. The first book, \u003cem\u003eExodus\u003c/em\u003e, is already drafted and is being edited now. The rest of the books follow different members of the Starsong Family (as they are called) at different points throughout this fictional history.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second story arc, the \"Fracture Arc\", has at least 5 books in it and answers several major questions from \u003cem\u003eExodus\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that are left unanswered.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use many programs and tools to keep this universe real and consistent. I have a private wiki-encyclopedia that I\u0027ve built. I have 3d models of the ships that I\u0027ve made, I use a timeline program to keep the chronology on point. I have a 3D starmap program that helps me keep track of planets, stars, fleets, and planetary surfaces. What this means is that no matter when I write a book, or which story arc the story takes place in, you can be assured that the information is consistent within the rest of the universe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy become a patron? Because I have a lot of material that I created because it helps me make this universe a real place, but it doesn\u0027t make it into the book. It also tells me that you find this story arc interesting and motivates me to keep investing time in it. I have 2,000 years of history and 65 major planets. ...that is a lot of stories just waiting to be told.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
