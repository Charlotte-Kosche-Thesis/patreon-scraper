The show is three people telling three stories centered around one topic. We\u0027ve done episodes about childhood, shame, camp, humiliation, drinking, and \u0027that sinking feeling.\u0027 \u00a0Sometimes it\u0027s funny, sometimes it\u0027s sad, sometimes it sounds Skype-y.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe use all the available words in the English language, and we don\u0027t censor people\u0027s stories, so sometimes the stories can be NSFW, or at least NSFTween.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve produced more than twenty episodes and its starting to feel like the very beginning of a small thing. \u00a0And I\u0027m still really iffy about asking for your dollars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause you give enough. To a lot of great shows. Including the one I work on in the daylight hours (Hint: It\u0027s initials are DTNS). But then my boss on that show told me that I should trust the audience to decide what is and is not worth their support. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I trust you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like this show, you can support us with some very valuable laundry quarters. If you like the music on the show, I\u0027d like to be able to send the musicians some of those laundry quarters.\u00a0If you\u0027d like the audio quality to be better, that\u0027s gonna take a few more laundry quarters, so we made a goal for that. If you\u0027d like an actual audio engineer to take over so that Jennie can focus on storytelling, we made a goal for that too. If you\u0027d like us to come to your hometown and do shows with all the amazing people you know, well there\u0027s a crazy stretch goal for that too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! - Jennie, Matt and Jax\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
