In an industry where artists are, now more than ever, expected to give their art away for free, this is something that makes it progressively difficult for entirely independent artists like myself to get our art out there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to enter into a partnership with you. \u00a0In addition to helping me afford to be able to pursue my dreams, I\u0027m going to hook you up with regular exclusive materials that will ONLY be available to my supporters through Patreon. This includes EXCLUSIVE concert streams, merchandise, videos, opportunities, virtual concerts, music, and MORE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial goals for your pledges involve creating an advertising budget so I can cover printing costs for future shows, as well as social media advertising helping to connect my music with just the right niche!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoals in the future include upgrading my hodge-lodge of DIY equipment, another professionally-recorded album, which I hope to fund in the next 6 months with your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patreon pledgers will be on the forefront of everything new going on the world of Jessamyn Orchard music, as you are the people helping make my dreams a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
