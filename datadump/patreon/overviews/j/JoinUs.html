    "summary": "Bonjour from France !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been creating free, educational podcasts about France for over two years. These episodes have been listened to 500,000 times and, since you are reading this, I suspect you enjoy the show too. So thank you for listening to the show and for visiting my Patreon page.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue to bring you the best of France and share my passion for France travel done right. I also want to keep featuring podcast listeners who had a great time in France and want to help others do the same. But a lot of work goes on behind the scenes, the more popular the podcast gets, the more time I have to spend on it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could really use your help! For a donation of $5/month you can make sure the show continues and you also get full access to the Lunchbreak French series that I am launching along with this Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLunchbreak French is a short French lesson targeted to people who have taken French at school, enjoyed it, but could use a bit of a refresher. It will include both audio and written components because my aim is to help you untie your tongue and get comfortable using your French when you come visit France. You will get a new installment of Lunchbreak French every month. The only way to get this bonus content is to support Join Us in France via this Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your $5 donation you also get access to extra installments of the French History Brief so you can learn the best bites of French history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, please sign up right now and thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://joinusinfrance.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_7811.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
