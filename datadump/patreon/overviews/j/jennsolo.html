    "summary": "I am a Freelance Creative who focuses on illustration. I am from NYC, but live in NJ for the more than obvious reasons- affordability!  I have been creating art for as long as I can remember but don\u0027t feel that I was really able to put my full focus into in until \u003cstrong\u003eRIGHT NOW\u003c/strong\u003e. I have been building and making calculated steps to get to this moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past 8 years I have been creating art in various mediums and styles and have tried to balance having a \"day\" job (or two) to make the transition to become a working illustrator.  Over the past year I became the Creative Director for Equality for HER (www.equalityforHER.org) and have been working on more and more projects with clients. I also compeleted the D\u0026amp;AD\u0027s New Blood Shift Program (\u003ca href=\"https://www.dandad.org/en/d-ad-new-blood-shift-nyc/)\"\u003ehttps://www.dandad.org/en/d-ad-new-blood-shift-nyc...\u003c/a\u003e ) which helps to mold creatives to think in an advertising world. These two things have been really impactful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my art about? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the time I like to work on projects that deliver a message or shed light on something that needs to be in the forefront of our minds. There are times that I just draw and paint fun themes and fan art and sometimes whimsy things but in the core of everything, I am about the everyday that we go thru. Whether it\u2019s just sketching someone spending time outside, to Travis Scott killing it on stage at a concert. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you be a part? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is where \u003cem\u003eYOU\u003c/em\u003e come in... If you like the art that I am creating and want to be a part of the journey (and own some great pieces), then become a Patron so we can build together.  I know all of this has that really cheesy sound to it, but let\u2019s be real - it\u0027s not about just taking your money so I can run away to Fiji (although the thought sounds great).  It\u0027s about using that money to create personal work with meaning, \"buy\" more time to create and experiment with new ideas and being able to work on more projects that would reach more people.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share my journey, my thoughts and struggles as well as what inspires me with YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eCheck out the rewards for your patronage on the side of the page and see where you fit in. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited about this and I hope you are too! Even if you decide to not become a Patron, I thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully get to enjoy some art on my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.jennsolo.com./\"\u003ewww.jennsolo.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you \u003cstrong\u003eDO decide to become a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e, I thank you so so so damn much for your support and for believing in this with me.  Every dollar counts toward something somehow and I am grateful that you take your hard earned money and send it this way to support creativity and the possibilities. \u003cbr\u003e"
