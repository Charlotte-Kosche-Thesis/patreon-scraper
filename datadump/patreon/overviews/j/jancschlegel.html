He discovered his passion for photography at the age of 14 with in the scope of a Photo course at school. For his first own camera, the reflex camera Minolta XG9, the 14 year-old saved long. As winner of a AGFA photo competition with focus on portraits, Schlegel took part in a seminar by the photographer Walter Schels in the Staatslehranstalt f\u00fcr Photographie in Munich. Under Walter Schel\u2019s influence Jan C. Schlegel began to ascertain his fervor for black-and-white portraits. Toni Schneiders, a distant neighbour of Schlegel, became the second important mentor for the young photographer. After a two and a half year long apprenticeship at Lake Bodensee Schlegel was a professionally trained photographer by the age of 18. Schlegel works for the University of the Nations. He teaches courses in photography and takes students through Africa and Asia, mentoring them as they discover their own way of seeing. Since 2011 he is exclusively represented by Bernheimer and has been shown with great success on art fairs in London and Paris.",
