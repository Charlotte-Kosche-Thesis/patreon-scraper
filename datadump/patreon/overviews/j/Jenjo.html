I\u2019m a storyboard artist, Illustrator\nand instructor. I provide storyboards to companies who pitch big (Coke Zero, Runescape, Kickboxer Vengeance) and small projects (Nature Trekkers, Aloha). My\nillustrations can be found in children\u2019s books such as \u201cMajor League Presidents\u201d\nand \u201cBarnyard Buddies STOP for Peace\u201d. I illustrate the webcomics \u201cROLT\u201d \u0026amp; \"Lastrex Labs\" and\nwrite and illustrate the comic \u201cSeafoam: A Friend for Madison\u201d, both of which I self-publish. In my\nfree time I teach community classes that guide young artists through the\nprocess of writing and drawing their own stories. I\u0027m also a proud, registered tribe member of the Cherokee Nation and I am diagnosed with a condition called Reactive Hypoglycemia, which means I have not only a very strict diet, but if I get too stressed or sick my blood sugar drops rapidly, which makes working a day job very difficult.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd now you\u2019re thinking, okay, but why donate? Well\u2026 I would like to produce more ORIGINAL content. That just isn\u2019t\nrealistic with my current income and project schedule. Because I have to take so much contract work under my belt to pay the bills I often have to push my personal works to the side, cause a gals gotta eat right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if just a handful of the people who read and enjoy my stories could pitch in even $1, that\u0027s $1 for three different stories I update regularly I could create even MORE content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eROLT will update TWICE a week. Seafoam issues will be out bimonthly. I will produce one animatic a month (original or fan-based if people have a preference). I will also be able to have more giveaways and send comics out to fans. I can also go out to more conventions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for less than a stick of gum, or a cup of coffee you can support my work.i appreciate your love and support and just taking the time to read my books, but I would love it if I could just create books full time for you guys. I completed five books this past year while doing full time work, just imagine how much I could pump out if I could focus on just comics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Thank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e-Jorry Jeanine-Jonee Keith\u003cbr\u003eaka Jenjo\u003cbr\u003e"
