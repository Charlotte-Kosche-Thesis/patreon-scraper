    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eASMR videos are a unique kind of relaxation video with a large and growing audience;\u003c/strong\u003e their purpose is to induce a sensation of relaxation and comfort in the viewer by utilizing various \"triggers\" such as soothing sounds, soft speaking, personal attention, and gentle hand movements. ASMR is a pseudo-science term that stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, and it refers to the pleasant, comforting tingling sensation that many experience in their head, neck, back, and/or limbs when stimulated by one of the triggers mentioned above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI create and publish free videos on my YouTube channel, Jellybean Green ASMR.\u003c/strong\u003e I use a combination of compassion and humor to make both traditional videos as well as unexpected ones. In addition to a well-rounded offering of videos, I work hard to give my viewers a high level of interaction in the comments section of my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOMMERCIAL FREE! \u003c/strong\u003eIf you pledge at any level, you\u0027ll receive links for commercial-free versions of my YouTube videos as they\u0027re released, as well as occasional early access to new videos before they\u0027re published on my main channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e making these videos, and I will continue to make them, for free, no matter what.\u003c/strong\u003e However, after my second child was born, I realized I didn\u0027t have time to fully commit to both a regular job AND a YouTube channel. So, I took a leap of faith, left my job, and became a full-time YouTuber. After caring for my two children all day, I devote the bulk of my \"free\" time creating videos, communicating with viewers, and managing my channel. I don\u2019t sleep much. By committing to be my patron, y\u2019all would be helping me to put money directly into improving my videos by buying props and equipment, as well as helping me to supplement my income and thereby allowing me to occasionally catch an extra hour or two of that elusive sleep that we\u2019re all chasing. ;)\u003cbr\u003e"
