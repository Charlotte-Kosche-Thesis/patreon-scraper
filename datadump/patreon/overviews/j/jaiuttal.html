The setting was Bakersfield, in the center of the dry, dusty California desert, and the year was 1969. My friends and I were on a mission to bring Kirtan to the young people of the world! So we packed up our instruments (sarod, guitar, tabla and violin) and set up a \u0027portable temple\u0027 at Cal State University and began jamming. Before we knew it, a crowd was gathered around singing and swaying, and we were on our way....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, pretty soon I realized that I actually didn\u0027t know enough about anything to be on any kind of a \u0027mission\u0027! But I did know that I loved music and that I loved sharing the practice of devotional singing, and that I had absolutely no other skills! There was nothing else for me to do... And those of you who have been with me from the beginning know that sacred music is not just a career for me, it\u0027s a deep life calling. And there has never really been a question about my answering that call.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime has passed, and I realize that I\u0027ve been a part of your lives for over 45 years; driving with you, dancing with you, cooking with you, loving with you, and hopefully helping your inner healing and bringing happiness to your heart. So what\u0027s next? I\u0027m 65 and my soul is calling for a slightly different tempo, a new rhythm, and I\u0027d like to invite you and give you the opportunity to join me in a beautiful circle of sharing called Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 117, 123);\"\u003eWhat is patronage?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://i.imgur.com/FPcd8Yh.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FPcd8Yh.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy musical Guru, Ali Akbar Khan, used to speak so sweetly about his time in the Rajasthani court, playing for the king who became his patron and benefactor. It was a time where he didn\u0027t need to think about the basic necessities of life and he could concentrate solely on his music. Khansahib, as we lovingly called him, claimed he would never have become the maestro that he was without having had that patronage. And the same is true for so many of the greatest artists, playwrights, scientists and musicians of history - they all had patrons helping them to achieve their life\u0027s vision. In the traditions of Ancient India this concept was taken much further. Even today it\u0027s considered a blessing to offer food or money to any sadhu, or spiritual seeker, who comes to your door.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it\u0027s 2016 and times have changed. The days of royal patronage are long gone. But now, with crowdfunding and other miracles, we\u0027re relearning the art of giving in a new and very modern way. As we rediscover our interconnectedness and interdependence, we find the awareness that we all need to become patrons of each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E0d7wbV.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon - a new web platform based upon an ancient principal, wherein fans can become an integral part of the lives of the artists they love. Through Patreon, I\u0027m creating a circle of devotion; an opportunity for us to be involved in something bigger than ourselves. My devotion to you, my fans, echoes and mirrors your devotion to me and to my music, and, together, like pebbles dropping into still water, our spirits can ripple outward with more energy, integrity and light. I\u0027m not asking you to \u0027support\u0027 me in my creative process; I\u0027m inviting you to become part of my creative and devotional world. Be my co-creator by joining me on Patreon and allowing me to keep on giving my art and my heart to you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 117, 123);\"\u003eThank you\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nYou can become a patron for as little as $1 a month, but you can give AS MUCH as you want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support is very meaningful to me, and I look forward to connecting with you here on Patreon!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZIkH82b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
