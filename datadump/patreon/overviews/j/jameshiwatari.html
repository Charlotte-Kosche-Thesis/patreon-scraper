    "summary": "I\u0027m the author behind the Chest of Stories, a place for stories as diverse as the characters within them. Come take a look, and you might find something you like!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nThe Chest of Stories\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I keep all of my stories. I write adventure, romance, YA, fantasy and fairy tales, usually with a decent dose of humour and fourth wall kicking. Despite so many different genres, my stories all have one thing in common: they feature characters who don\u0027t often get to play the hero. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou see, I\u0027m a migrant bisexual trans guy. I tick a lot of boxes on any \"diversity\" form, but it also means I almost never see someone like me represented in fiction. And I know there\u0027s plenty of people out there who maybe don\u0027t tick the same boxes as me, but who have the same problem. So I decided to do something about it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll my main characters tick a lot of boxes, but their stories are not always about ticking those boxes. They have adventures, make friends, struggle with their flaws, fall in love and find their happy ending just like any white, cisgender, straight guy and his beauty-standards-conforming girlfriend do. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe stories I\u0027m currently working on are:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Fairy Out of Her Tale:\u003c/strong\u003e a fairy loses all her powers when she kills another fairy and must adapt to a new life in exile. But with a war breaking out in her new home, she\u0027ll have to learn to let go of her past in order to survive and fight back.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Princess and the Wanderer:\u003c/strong\u003e the princess will marry whoever defeats her father at chess. The wanderer is the best player around. If you think you know where this is going, think again, and bring a map to waddle through the plot twists and a helmet to protect against the constant rain of fourth-wall debris. \u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSinf\u00f3n\u00eda:\u003c/strong\u003e a young prodigy violinist gets his dream job in an orchestra, but one of his colleagues hates his guts and will do whatever it takes to make him quit by the end of the year. Add to this the violinist\u0027s enduring crush on said colleague, and you get a romance that... is also not going quite where you expect it to.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaruMonzterz:\u003c/strong\u003e a 12 year-old girl must learn to overcome her crippling fears in order to... win at a children\u0027s game?! And save the world while at it?! Where I have I seen this plot before? Not here, that\u0027s for sure. \u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe Myself!:\u003c/strong\u003e a mixed-race teenager discovers his bisexuality by accidentally having sex with another boy in the school toilet. His family and old friends turn against him for that, so his journey of self-acceptance and discovery is paved by his new friends of the LGBTI club instead.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also an artist and amateur musician. I\u0027ve been drawing for over a decade and playing as many musical instruments as I can put my hands on since I discovered there was more to music than boring pianos and guitars. This means I often do my own illustrations for my stories and compose the odd tune to go with scenes or characters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eStories with a diverse cast that offer good representation and don\u0027t spread harmful messages are unfortunately still hard to come by. The number of authors with backgrounds similar to mine (or at least with as many \"diversity tick-boxes\") is increasing and more stories are reaching the readers that yearn for them. But it\u0027s still not enough. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe thing about writing for those marginalised is that we are the people more likely to struggle to afford books. So I want to keep all my stories available for free on the internet. When my e-books are published, they\u0027ll sell for a symbolic price, but the stories will still be available on my website (serialised at a rate of a scene per week, so that people who can afford e-books still have an incentive to buy them). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBut if I\u0027m giving away all my writings for free and not worrying that much about my book sales, I need to make money from somewhere else. At the moment I have a day job working for an LGBTI rights organisation, but as an author, my dream is to live off my writing. The more I earn through Patreon, the more time I can dedicate to writing and reaching out to people.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat are the rewards in the Chest?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Chest is a huge wooden box the size of a bed. Its inside is fitted with an impossible number of compartments storing everything from story drafts to discarded sheet music and partially used art supplies. Somewhere in there is a set of compartments for Patreon rewards. Those can only be opened with special keys.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEach key corresponds to a different reward tier. Thanks to their creative design, keys from higher tiers unlock the compartments for the lower tiers too, so you can get everything in them too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese are the keys and the content they unlock:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nIron Key - $1/month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis common Iron Key unlocks early access to all chapters from every story in the chest. I will post chapters here one week before they become available elsewhere.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou will also get an early look (and chance to give feedback) on cover art and book synopsis when those become available.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecret Key - $3/month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis Secret Key unlocks everything the iron key does, plus a sneaky look at unpublished extra material and trivia. These include scenes that didn\u0027t make it to finalised chapters, background information written as part of character building, and anything else that won\u0027t be used in chapters and is no longer spoiler. Posts in this category will happen at least twice a month, more often if I\u0027ve done a lot of work (and have lots of enthusiastic patrons). \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShadow Key - $5/month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis Shadow Key unlocks everything the previous keys do, plus a peek in the shadowy corners of the chest where the current book drafts are kept. These posts will appear at least every two weeks, more often if there is enough content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHeart Key - $10/month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis Heart Key unlocks everything the previous keys do, plus a personalised thank you card from a character of your choice. The card will be delivered via e-mail and will feature a chibi version of your choice of character with a short personalised message. Every month after payments go through, I\u0027ll make a post for patrons to comment which character they would like in their card. Recurring patrons can thus collect cards and messages over time. This reward should be delivered around a week after I\u0027m told your character preference. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a thank you from the heart!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGolden Key - $15/month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\tThis Golden Key unlocks everything the previous keys do, plus  a personalised letter from a character of your choice. Each month after payments go through, I\u0027ll write a post for patrons to comment under the character they want and a topic for the letter (patrons can also e-mail me directly if they don\u0027t want this information public). Each letter will be around 500 words long and will be delivered via e-mail before the next payment cycle (ideally within a week, but might take longer depending on the number of patrons in this tier).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eYou also get access to special fortnightly reports on the stories\u0027 progress, with materials not shown anywhere else. These will be more in-dept than the open posts and the rewards for the Iron Key, and will include things like draft artwork and music. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a golden opportunity!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStar Key - $20/month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou are a star! This Star Key unlocks everything the previous keys do, plus you get free signed copies of my books! Those will be paperback books delivered right to your door! You can tell me a few things about yourself so I can write a more personalised message as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eNot only that, but I\u0027ll name you in a \"Thanks to all my amazing patrons, especially...\" section in every post, chapter, and book I publish.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nMythic Key - $30/month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAll hail the mythic hero! This Mythic Key unlocks everything the previous keys do, plus you get to name a new character in a story of your choice. I have plenty of characters who need names! Some of them will be main characters, some will be minor. But either way, every month after payments go through, I\u0027ll be getting in touch with a description of a character who needs your amazing naming skills (though I reserve the right to decline overly silly or offensive names).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMay your name go down in history!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpirit Key - $50/month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat a generous soul you are! This Spirit Key unlocks everything the previous keys do, plus you get to create your very own character to appear in one of the stories (or even multiple stories). This tier is only open to ten patrons. It\u0027ll be one character per patron rather than one per month, but each month we will spend some time discussing your character and their role in their story. This means you get to learn exclusive inside information about the story before everybody else and you also get an insight into how I work on my stories. The more I get to know your character, the more important they\u0027ll become to the story, so that\u0027s your incentive for sticking around every month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nCosmic Key - $100/month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWow, that\u0027s... just wow.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Cosmic Key unlocks everything the previous keys do. And believe me, for this price I would unlock my entire universe to you. But since I can\u0027t do that, you get an exclusive, for-your-eyes-only short story featuring your favourite characters. Every month after payments go through, I\u0027ll discuss with you what kind of story you would like and which characters should feature in it. Each story will be at most 3000 words long and have 2-3 main characters. You\u0027ll be given the opportunity to feedback on the draft before I send you the final version. Seeing as we\u0027re talking about a whole short story it will probably take a few weeks to be sent off, but we will work closely together on it for that time, so it shouldn\u0027t feel like it\u0027s too long a wait. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Next?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this far. If you like what you saw and would like to grab your own part of the chest and a key, please hit that big orange button on the right and watch the fun begin! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford your own keys, but would still like to see these stories growing, you can earn your own honorary compartment by spreading the word and bringing other people to this page. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSee you in the next post!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
