Over the last few months I have been working on a unique photography project titled \"Unbroken: Native Americans Today\", which is a long-term gallery that focuses on modern Native American culture and the difficulties that Native Americans face in today\u0027s society. Through this project, I have photographed and interviewed dozens of Native American people - offering a new platform where they can share their perspectives and teach us lessons through their faces and words - and with your help, I hope to expand this project to where I can visit multiple Native peoples,tribes, and organizations all across the country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eTo check out the project, please click here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.jasonsinnphotography.com/Unbroken-Native-Americans-Today\"\u003ewww.jasonsinnphotography.com/Unbroken-Native-Americans-Today\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Admin-Album/n-t9vJH/i-nLGWnTj/0/73e4aa3a/X2/i-nLGWnTj-X2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Admin-Album/n-t9vJH/i-xvmJQzP/0/74438b53/X3/i-xvmJQzP-X3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhy am I Doing This Project?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eIt\u0027s no secret that Native Americans have been treated horrifically throughout North American history. Their land was taken, thousands of their people were killed or forced into slavery, and there were numerous organized attempts to destroy their culture.

To Share Native American Culture in a Modern Light\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost people in North America are far behind when it comes to understanding modern Native Americans, and a huge part of that is because we view their culture through inaccurate sources. We learn about their culture through outdated images from the 1800\u0027s, culturally demeaning depictions seen in sports mascots and Halloween costumes, and stereotypical roles found in Old Western movies. This has brought many people to view Native Americans as relics of the past or as a novelty for entertainment, which in turn has made their culture appear as less important or not being a part of current society. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fact of the matter is, Native Americans are constantly involved in our world and their culture (which is very much alive, strong, and still evolving today) could teach us many heartfelt and valuable lessons. It is only fair that we renew our sources, refresh our perspectives, and learn about this deeply inspiring culture in a modern light.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Unbroken-Native-Americans-Today/i-fRjc9Jz/0/32e999e9/X2/Stephanie-Big-Eagle-Native-American-Photography-by-Jason-Sinn%20%282%29-X2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Unbroken-Native-Americans-Today/i-XbCPhqT/2/35b55445/X2/Shya-Native-American-photography-by-Jason-Sinn-X2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.) To Bring Awareness to Current Native American Struggles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the situations that Native Americans face today are serious, ranging from loss of culture, to high suicide rates, to the reality of having to live in a world of unlawful dispossession, and although their efforts to bring attention to these issues deserve widespread concern, they are rarely discussed by others or given thorough media coverage. This has directly harmed Native Americans by censoring their voices and hiding their hardships from the public eye.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eUnbroken:Native Americans Today\u003c/em\u003e aims to fix this problem by unapologetically keeping these struggles within the focus of every picture taken.

Poor quality housing, underfunded schools, and poverty are only a few of the situations the residents must deal with, and to make matters worse, some of these reservations are continuing to be fragmented, stripped of their land, and exploited by both the government and larger corporations for natural resources.
