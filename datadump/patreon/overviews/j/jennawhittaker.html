I\u0027ve been writing all my life and never intend to stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help fund my writing efforts, I also do artwork! This includes graphic design pieces for websites (logos, headers, promotional images), book covers, game concept (character and environment) artwork, commissions (family portraits, pet portraits, etc), and my personal artwork done for fun! I can also do promotional images for your book, cover art, unique and personalised bookmarks/book plates, or even a custom painting of all of your book characters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here? I want to share this artwork and writing with you! Connecting to readers and anyone who is interested in my art, and getting help to support my best efforts in my books. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
