My name is John Levy and I am a filmmaker, screenwriter, photographer, video essayist, painter and all around artist and creator. I used to make my living as a videographer and video editor but stepped away to care for ailing family. I lost years of creative progress, clients, a business in production and everything I invested in my would-be first feature. I have come to Patreon to make up for lost time and work, be close to and support other creators and hopefully find success or at least support in my creative endeavors once again. I work multiple jobs, am producing not nearly enough content as I should be and find very little time to create work and nothing left after rent to invest in equipment/materials and am hoping to supplement my income to maintain the discipline of creativity and momentum of the work and in turn share my work and any successes with my supporters and fellow creators. I\u0027m asking for the help to have an oprotunity I already worked my whole life for, and what for me feels like my best self and greatest offering to my fellow men and women and most of all, I find incredibly fulfilling. I\u0027m hoping to find community, an audience, and other creators here. And if I surpass my monthly goal I will increase my rewards and a portion of that cushion will be donated to the charity of choice of a different subscriber each month and I\u0027ll commit a dollar a month to another Patreon creator. Any and all support is deeply appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration. Much love!\u003cbr\u003e"
