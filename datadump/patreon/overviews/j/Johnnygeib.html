One of my loves for music is not only making it, but showing others how to do it themselves. How to setup their rooms and get the best possible sound in the environment they will be working in. Some have a choice but most, that are just beginning, may not and need to maximize their space to sound the very best it can. And with that may come a small budget that needs to be used to get the best equipment possible within that budget. I will do my best to get you recording at the level you desire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have more than 25 years experience as an independent singer\\songwriter producer\\engineer and I have been teaching and creating training videos for for nearly 10 years.

I need better video equipment and video production tools to really provide high quality learning tools for all my faithful Youtube subscribers (over 3000 now) and Home Studio Trainer site members, now well over 600 signed up members. If everyone can put in $1, I can then create the kind of training content everyone will find invaluable, weather you are just a beginner or a seasoned hobbyist looking to go full time. \u003cbr\u003e",
