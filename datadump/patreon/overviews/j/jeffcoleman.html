It\u0027s not a bad job, but it\u0027s hard to sit down and write when you\u0027ve been programming all day, and for me storytelling is so much more than a passion. I want to create fiction that fosters that sense of otherworldy wonder that\u0027s so tragically missing from the world today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do this, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing to my campaign, you\u0027ll make it possible for me to spend more time writing novels, novellas and short stories. I post four unique pieces of flash fiction per month that you can only \nfind here on Patreon. You can pledge as little as a dollar for each, totalling only four dollars per month. You\u0027ll get to go behind the scenes with me as I write my books and be a part of the creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you give at least $2 per flash fiction, you\u0027ll get to read early drafts of every novel, novella and short story I write, at least one chapter every week, and will also receive a free digital copy of the final published book in the format of your choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t do this alone, but together we can make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to know more?
