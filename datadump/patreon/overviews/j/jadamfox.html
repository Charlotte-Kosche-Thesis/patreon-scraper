    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eAbout the project\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for sharing a few moments of your time to view my Patreon page.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a storyteller with a lot of fun new comic stories that I would love to tell and I\u0027m asking you to be a part of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMe... I can\u0027t help it, this is just something I\u0027ve \"gotta do\" before I burst. With all the new methods of digital self-publishing available, it has become easier than ever for a creator to share their work. And that is my goal here; to have fun, create new and interesting new stories and share them with you online and totally FREE to read. No strings attached. Simply visit my website \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.sidekick-d.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.sidekick-d.com\u003c/a\u003e and get start reading!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nVisit the \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sidekickd/book_preview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSidekick-d Facebook page\u003c/a\u003e for an eight page preview of the first issue!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sidekick-d.com/images/uploads/comics/201701_Sidekickd_1_1_juice/images/Sidekickd_issue1_000A_cover.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m traditionally trained as a sequential artist and animator and I\u0027ve become inspired by new digital media to break the wall of traditional static comics and try my hand at \"motion\" comics. These are comics that change frame-by-frame and reveal new panels, movements, and balloons as you progress through the story.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am working completely digitally. This means, I need computer equipment, drawing tablets, and time... lots of time. This is where you come in. If you have the means and wish to contribute to the project, your dollars will be highly appreciated as I work on the current, and future, motion comic stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA Hardy \"thank you\" to all current, and future, supporters. You are a valued member of my team; helping make my dream of creating motion comics a reality.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAbout the current story\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe \"Night Watchman\" was Grimes Central\u0027s first vigilante hero twenty five years ago. He became a beloved icon of justice and inspired other heroes. But, after he lost his sidekick under mysterious ciurcumstances, he disappeared from the lime-light and is thought to be dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn truth, he simply stepped out of the spotlight and took a job as \"a\" night watchman at a local library. But, when the place is locked up for the night, and he is all alone, he secretly steps out as \"the\" Night Watchman to fight crime and clean up his city.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, now in his fifties, fighting crime alone isn\u0027t as easy anymore and The Night Watchman decides it is time to, once again, take on a sidekick. But, he gets quite a bit MORE than he was asking for with his overzealous new partner. Especially once The Night Watchman learns that HE may have just been sidekick\u0027d!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sidekick-d.com/images/uploads/Sidekickd_images/NW_n_Vrl.jpg\" style=\"margin: auto;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Adam Fox.
