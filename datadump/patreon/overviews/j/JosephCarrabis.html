    "summary": "First, THANKEE THANKEE THANKEE for supporting me.\u003cbr\u003eJennifer, a friend who\u0027s helping me get \u003ca href=\"http://nlb.pub/jdcamazon\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy writing\u003c/a\u003e out, suggested Patreon a while ago and obviously I wasn\u0027t ready because I didn\u0027t pursue it. She brought it up again recently and \"the stars aligned\" as they say because here I am.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been writing since I was a child (see \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.josephcarrabis.com/2018/04/18/mission-of-the-heart/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMission of the Heart\u003c/a\u003e), was successful as a trade-technical author in the 1980s and was a regular contributor to several paying blogging platforms in the 2000s. I would write for any outlet that would hire me because I\u0027ve always believed that any writing I do will strengthen all the writing I do.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut last year (2016 as I write this), I realized that my day job wasn\u0027t making me happy any more. Heck, forget \"making me happy\", it was something I\u0027d grown to abhor. And writing was calling me. Strongly. Incessantly. Characters were ganging up on me. \"Tell my story!\" then another character would shout even louder \"No, tell my story first\" and still another \"No, me. Tell mine!\". I\u0027ve been collecting story ideas since I was a teenager and one of my great fears was that I wouldn\u0027t have enough time to tell all the stories inside me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I decided to change that part of my life. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. My writing was nominated for Nebula and Pushcart awards back in the 1990s but things happened. I stopped writing for about 25 years with occasional forays (some of them are in my area. Hope you enjoy them).\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut now...The Boy Is Back!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGreat, huh? \"The Boy Is Back!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut before you sponsor me, wouldn\u0027t you like to know if The Boy can write? I would, so here are some excerpts from a few \n\u003ca href=\"http://nlb.pub/TalesV1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTales Told \u0027Round Celestial Campfires\u003c/a\u003e...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom \n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://nlb.pub/ManiHe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMani He\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - Anthony Morelli saw the badger across the street as he came out of South Station, where the MBTA\u0027s southern terminus washed people towards One Financial Place. Anthony wore his St. James suit \u2013 bright grays with a black pinstripe \u2013 with cream oxford shirt and red and gold pumped satin tie, diamond studs, stockings which blended with his trousers, and black wingtips. It was an early Boston Fall and Channel-4 forecasted light drizzle. Morelli\u0027s raincoat was draped over his left arm and his accountant\u0027s case pulled down his right like a ship\u0027s keel in a storm. Today he made the presentation showing the errors in Thompson\u0027s plan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe badger sat on a pretzel wagon. People were buying soft pretzels with mustard, soft pretzels with cheese, soft pretzels with extra salt. The badger was passing small talk and change and nobody else seemed to notice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMorelli stopped and stared. The smell of coal-cooked chestnuts, peanuts and pretzels came over the diesel and street-level smog of Boston. His mouth watered and he remembered his father teaching him how to flip peanuts and catch them in his mouth. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://nlb.pub/goatmen\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Goatmen of Aguirra\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - 705015:216 - We\u0027ve landed in a grotto, near the center of Hochebene\u0027s Altiplano, but closer to the Towers of God than not. On one side of the grotto is the only run of clear water for some thirty kilometers, and I\u0027ve noted with Sanders that this could be a problem as all native fauna encountered thus far follow the same biologies as we. Immediately upon landing, Sanders ordered Tellweiller, Nash, and Galen to construct a blind. We are now a boulder, one among several, that slid into the grotto when we lowered a rumbler to cover our landing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNash estimates two standard hours before sunrise.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEarly estimates indicated Aguirra was three and a half to four billion years old. Now, with readings coming in about the deep core and mantle, we place it closer to five. Gravity is one-point-one standard and the atmosphere is quite like Earth\u0027s only sweeter due to a higher O3 content. There is also a free floating enzyme, essentially carbolic anhydrase, which explains some of the adaptive biologies on the planet. Everything we\u0027ve observed is based on the nitrocarbon cycle \u2013 everything we\u0027ve recorded from space and robotics shows up as a variation on some earth fauna \u2013 and the carbolic anhydrase probably helps redaction and reduction in the O\u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;3\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt; rich atmosphere when a stressing agent is introduced.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://nlb.pub/amzCymo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCymodoce\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - Jenny silently guided the boat to the dock, all the while keeping one eye on her three-year-old twins, Davy and Cymmi, sitting in front of her. When the boat was next to the mooring Jenny grabbed a line, pulled the boat to the dock and tied it. It was the first time she\u0027d been to the island since the twins were born. Her parents, who died within a week of each other the previous fall, left her the dock, the boat, the cabin, the two acres of land, and only property taxes and upkeep to concern her.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDavy fidgeted. \"Mommy, I\u0027m hungry. Can we eat now?\" \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShe put a finger to her lips and Davy pouted. Cymmi was leaning over the side of the boat, splashing her hands in the water. She paused, looked out over the waves, then splashed harder.Jenny moored the boat, lifted a lunch basket and helped the children onto the dock. \"Mom,\" Davy whined, \"I\u0027m hungry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"We\u0027ll go up to the cabin and eat. Okay, Davy?\" They started up the narrow path.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Mom, Cymmi\u0027s still by the water.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJenny looked up. Cymmi was in up to her ankles. Jenny dropped the lunch basket, ran back and lifted Cymmi from the water. Her feet glistened. Cymmi kept looking at the waves as Jenny sat her by the lunch basket, took out a container of fresh water and poured it over Cymmi\u0027s feet. The tiny, silvery marks began to fade and Jenny signed /COME /EAT /NOW /PLAY /LATER /OKAY/?// She took Cymmi\u0027s hand and gently pulled her along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd oh, by the way, here\u0027s my original introductory video:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D9olO8QTmo4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

You\u0027re \"Tony the Tiger\" Great!\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst, don\u0027t worry, this goal has nothing to do with pagecounts. I\u0027m not writing a novel with 2500 pages (some of my fun goals were based on pagecounts of my books). \u003cbr\u003e\nThis goal is based on my experiences in publishing (the late 1980s), 30kUS$ was about the total cost of getting a book published, meaning publishers starting making money after net sales hit 30kUS$. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s much less expensive now, and I\u0027ll still use it as a benchmark.

Extra points for people coming as a character from one of my stories.\u003cbr\u003eThird, at 5,000US$/month we can begin serious marketing efforts, including hiring an agency to get the word out there, get us listed with reading groups and societies, schedule book signing tours (we\u0027ll let you know where and when, and I hope you\u0027ll come by to shake hands and get a hug!) and more!\u003cbr\u003eTHANKS, TEAMABIS!
