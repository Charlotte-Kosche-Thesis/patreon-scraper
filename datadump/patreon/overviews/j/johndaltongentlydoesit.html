I\u2019ll explain what it\u2019s all about in a moment but first let me introduce myself and explain what I do. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is John Dalton and I am an artist and writer living in rural county Kerry in Ireland. I have a podcast where I chat with remarkable artists from around the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of my podcast before, here are previous episodes to give you an idea of what the it\u2019s like. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.johndalton.me/podcasts/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.johndalton.me/podcasts/\u003c/a\u003e  (but don\u2019t rush off just yet.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere is artwork from some of the artists I\u2019ve chatted with so far on the podcast.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBo Bartlett\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.johndalton.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bo-Bartlett-Halloween-800.jpg?w=800\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTeresa Oaxaca\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.johndalton.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/TeresaOaxaca_Yule_oiloncanvas_60x40-1200x520.jpg?resize=1200%2C520\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nVincent Desiderio\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.johndalton.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Vincent-Desiderio-Sleep-1.jpeg?w=900\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDorian Vallejo\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.johndalton.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dorian-vallejo-Awakening1.jpg?w=900\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNatalia Fabia\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.johndalton.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Natalia-fabia-Hooker-Dollhouse800.jpg?w=800\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRon English\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.johndalton.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ron-English-3.png?w=720\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPretty fantastic right, and that\u0027s just a few.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere is what people have been saying about the podcast.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u201cI would just like to add that I think John Dalton is the new Vasari of the New Renaissance!\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cOne of the best ART broadcasts I\u0027ve ever listened to.\u201d \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Quite an enchanting interview that spoke volumes about both interviewer \nand interviewee\u2026  thank you so much for a wonderful hour and a half!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Wonderful interview!  Thanks John for all the podcasts.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"John\u2019s questions were thoughtful, well pointed and interesting.\nReally enjoyed this conversation! Thanks.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Excellent, charming and educative interview.\"\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPretty humbling.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThese are long form in-depth conversations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt takes me about a day and a half of research in preparation for each podcast. \n\u003cbr\u003eThe recording takes about another half a day.\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd then it takes me about a another 2 days to edit the podcast.\u003cbr\u003eSometimes that can blow out to be more . . . like with Vincent Desiderio which took me about five days of research in preparation because Vincent has given so many lectures and interviews\n\u003cbr\u003eOr the podcast with Candice Bohannon and Julio Reyes which ended up being 3hours long and took about 5 days to edit.\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo there\u2019s a lot of work involved.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhere does Patreon fit in?\u003c/h4\u003e\nPatreon is a good old fashioned subscription service made new. It comes under the umbrella of \u2018crowdfunding,\u2019 but is different from other crowdfunding websites like, Kickstarter and Indiegogo in that with Patreon you commit to a small amount of money regularly - every month. As I said, like a subscription. Patreon was founded by artists themselves which is why I think they, \u201cget it.\u201d A little bit of regular money is, in many ways, better than a big lump of money out of the blue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHow much?\u003c/h4\u003e\nFor as little as $1 a month you can support the podcast. You can pledge more if you like and you can stop whenever you like.  You can road test how it works if you\u0027re scared (you can pull out before you\u0027re charged at the end of any month, so it\u0027s risk-free.)  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCommon Questions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e NO - Pay in any currency. As Patreon is a US based website, everything is written in Dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\"I don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron?\" \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eYes, please only sign up to donate what you can easily afford. Even $1 a month will make a huge difference and would be greatly appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Can I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\" \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eYes of course! If you can\u0027t afford to donate in the future, or you need to donate less that\u0027s absolutely fine. You can just log in to change or cancel the account whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eBecome a supporter\u003c/h4\u003e\nIf you subscribe to the podcast, then I encourage you to take that extra step and become a supporter here on Patreon. You will get that warm glow whenever you hear the podcast because you will know you have helped make it happen. You will be a true patron of the arts. If you find any joy and value in what I do, please consider becoming a supporter today with a recurring monthly pledge of your choosing, anything from the cost of  a pencil and to Medici support would be brilliant.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can see what I will be using the money for in my goals section. Click back and forth on the arrows to see future and past goals.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for taking the time to read this.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
