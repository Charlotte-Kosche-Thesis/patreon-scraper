The stuff I write is generally pretty well regarded,\nlike the \u003cem\u003eJohannes Cabal, Carter \u0026amp;\nLovecraft, Goon Squad\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eRussalka\nChronicles\u003c/em\u003e series. In all probability you\u2019re here because you already like\nmy stuff, but in case you haven\u2019t, here are a few lovely things people have said\nabout the stuff in question.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"76\" src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8612/29034966281_d244ca8b53.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e \u00a0Sci-Fi-London: \u003c/strong\u003e\u201cHoward is a\nsupremely talented writer and the Johannes Cabal series makes for superb\nreading. It would be easy at this point to say if you like Rankin or Fforde or\nPratchett or Holt, then you will love these books, but while it may well be\ntrue it would be doing Howard a disservice.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Booklist on \u003cem\u003eCarter \u0026amp; Lovecraft\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e \u201cHoward brings the fine writing and\nattention to detail (character, dialogue, environment) that he developed in the\nCabal series to this new book, and his fans should follow him to Rhode Island.\nThose unfamiliar with the Cabal books, especially readers with a taste for\nmodern-day urban fantasy, should also be pointed in this title\u2019s direction.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Denver Post on \u003cem\u003eJohannes Cabal the Necromancer\u003c/em\u003e: \u003c/strong\u003e\"The\nspot-on work of a talented writer.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, there you go. You may rest\nassured that I\u2019m blushing hotly at having had to repeat such praise. Anyway,\nwhat am I after with all this? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"75\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8083/28825519440_f6f7a5cfe2.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Time, as they say, is money, but\nmoney also generates time. I am in the unhappy position of having insufficient\nmoney, and therefore my time as an author is becoming short. Presently, if\nthings don\u2019t improve, I shall have to get a day job and my ability to produce\nwill drop from a novel and several shorts a year to the same spread over\nperhaps three years. That\u2019s not a fanciful projection; my first novel \u003cem\u003eJohannes Cabal the Necromancer\u003c/em\u003e was\nwritten over about three years or so. I am not a fast writer, and to produce a\nnovel \u2013 or perhaps two \u2013 a year and all the other stuff means I have to have\nthe time to do it, and that means money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"76\" src=\"https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8645/29079586306_47b71a169f.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My first contract was a large one,\nand allowed me to give up my day job at the time. That was just as well, as I\nhad to deliver a second and third novels annually, and I couldn\u2019t have done\nthat if I\u2019d been pulling a 40 hour week working for somebody else at the same\ntime. That contract also fooled me into thinking that all subsequent contracts\nwould be equally generous. They were not; my current contracts pay a tenth of\nthe money per book of that first one. It\u2019s not enough to live on. This is a\nproblem endemic in writing these days, I\u2019m afraid. I was heartbroken when a friend\nwho has written bestsellers and has had TV productions made based on her work,\ngave it all up as stressful and unworkable and went back to teaching. The whole\nexperience has turned her against writing. I really don\u2019t want that to be me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"76\" src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8414/28825518750_e97dd19b8a.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But, there is another way of doing\nthis. I\u2019ve steered away from Patreon up to now because it felt wrong somehow and, indeed, I\ncreated an account a couple of years ago, but then did nothing with it. That\nPatreon contained next to no writers, being mainly a venue for artists back then,\ndidn\u2019t fill me with confidence, either. These days, however, many writers have\nstarted using it and to my mind if it\u2019s good enough for N.K. Jemisin and\nSaladin Ahmed, then it\u2019s certainly good enough for me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"77\" src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8135/29007059742_159c252ace.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, what am I after? Essentially,\na steadier cash flow than writing contracts offer. The rent, utilities, council\ntax and so forth need paying, and that\u2019s just the things needed to keep a roof\nover our heads. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And, to make it worthwhile for\nputative patrons, I shall try and cram in some nonsense along the way, so you\ncan say, \u201cMy largesse allows me to access a steady stream of Jonathan L. Howard\u2019s\ntop grade luxury nonsense, while incidentally ensuring that he isn\u2019t living in\na ditch somewhere.\u201d Just think what a lovely altruistic feeling that would give\nyou. And, science assures us, the more generous you are, the better you feel. Let\u2019s\nface it, I am doing you a huge favour by allowing you this opportunity. It\u2019s\nokay, you don\u2019t have to thank me. Not in words, anyway. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"76\" src=\"https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8474/29079586826_6df4fea6dd.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What sort of nonsense would I be\noozing through your internet tubes? Damned if I know; I\u2019m making this up as I\ngo along. Well, if you \u003cem\u003emust \u003c/em\u003eknow then it will be bloggy stuff, bits\nfrom work in progress (where I can find non-spoiling bits), and new short\nstories. It\u2019s a necessity of rights protection that these only be draft\nversions and not polished as these things will likely be published further down\nthe line, and I have to maintain first serial rights for that. Still, this way\nyou get all the hilarity of seeing I\u2019ve called five different characters \u201cDave\u201d\nin the first draft and that, after all this time, I still spell \u201capartement\u201d\nwith an extra \u201ce,\u201d like I\u2019m French or something. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Did it again. Damn. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Gasp! You are my bestest pals (Terms and conditions apply)! For this you will get all the previous levels, plus be mentioned in acknowledgements of any new books. Also, any new work will be open for a Tuckerisation, i.e. your name or a nominated person\u0027s name will be used for a character. Limitations are that Tuckerisations are only for stories that use modern names (so not, for example, a \"Kyth the Taker\" story), and I have final veto, which I shall use sensibly. I just don\u0027t want to feel honour bound to include \"Arsy McArseface\" simply because somebody with more money than sense wins the sweepstake. Folk at this level get twice the number of raffle tickets for the Tuckerisation draw than those at the previous level.",

Shortly after Night Vale first went live and -- I think -- before Scarfolk began, I bashed out a script with a vague idea of seeing if Night Vale might be interested in it as a one-off. Then I forgot about it without ever sending it to them. Now the dangerous eccentricities of the tiny hamlet of Vesper Cloud are ready to bleed out into the world. What lies at the end of the west road? What is the secret of the OFSTED Inspector? And why must you never, EVER call the Police? Hit this goal, and find out.\u00a0",
