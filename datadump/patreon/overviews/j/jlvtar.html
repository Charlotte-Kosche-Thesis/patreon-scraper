    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHO\u0027S J.L. V\u0027TAR?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Julia. I\u0027m an author of fantasy and science fiction, a lifelong gamer, and wannabe game designer. Writing is one of my great passions. While I do I think of myself as a storyteller more than specifically an author, writing fiction is one of the primary means by which I tell stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a few books out already, which can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00914R3FQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/PariahSilver\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSmashwords\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THE WORK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll publish works of fiction. Usually, they\u0027ll be small pieces posted over on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.pariahsilver.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e. They\u0027ll be fantasy stories, science fiction, and I\u0027m even dipping my toes into detective noir! Most of them will be short character pieces, but some might connect and form longer narratives if you read them in order. As a Patron, you\u0027ll have first notification every time I post one of these on my site! I may publish only one a month, or I may publish several a week, depending on how inspiration strikes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that, I\u0027m always working on bigger projects (I\u0027ll detail them down below). What your generous patronage really supports is the publication of these books. They\u0027re full sized novels, and they mean a lot to me. I\u0027ve self-published before, but I want to take a far more serious approach from here on out. That means serious editing, beautiful covers, and lots of work. None of which is cheap, and so I turn here to my lovely patrons for support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Projects:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCaptain\u0027s Chair.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I want to write about a Starship Captain, so I\u0027m going to. It\u0027ll be set in a completely original science fiction setting, in which I want to push the limits of sci-fi technology. I want to really see what kind of society I can build when it\u0027s not just an analog for modern society. What happens when there are genuinely terrifying weapons instead of just laser guns? What does a society look like when it accepts all genders, sexuality, and lifestyles? How do things work when technology is so advanced that no one wants for anything? I really don\u0027t know if I\u0027m qualified to ask these questions, and I certainly don\u0027t think I have any answers, but I want to try.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDixie Gray Novel.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I am very fond of Dixie, Sadie, and the world I\u0027m slowly building for them. I really want to write a full novel set in this dystopian noir retro-future, and I want it to be good. I\u0027ve never written noir before now, and I\u0027ve never written a mystery, so I\u0027ll need to get a handle on it. Part of that is going to be done with the Dixie Gray short stories published on my website. This will definitely only be one novel, because I don\u0027t like the idea of dragging a mystery out for multiple books, but if it turns out as well as I hope there could be other mysteries to solve.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDragon Slayer.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve had in my head an idea for a dragon slayer. Set in the Divine Lands, my personal fantasy setting, this would follow the life of a warrior who is sworn to serve an order of wizards. She does so, for years and years, until finally she gets sick of the fact that nothing ever happens. Who attacks a tower full of wizards? So she retires, and becomes a dragon slayer. It\u0027s pretty straightforward, and I think it would be a fun adventure. It\u0027ll probably only be one book, but if it turns out well enough that could spawn sequels with the same character.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eModern Mage.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Many people like the idea of wizards, magic, and magical creatures going about their adventures in the modern world. I\u0027m one of them! I want to explore this from a different perspective, though. Rather than a simple narrative, I want to write a handbook, written by a mage for mages, giving tips and advice for utilizing modern technology to make wizarding a little easier. Many wizards tend to be fairly old, so this would be written by a young spellcaster who wanted to buck the ancient traditions. Most likely set in Seattle, of course.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnnamed Sci-Fi Epic.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Take the life of an existing historical figure, and place them in space. Every city becomes a planet, every army unit becomes a starship, and regional geography becomes galactic phenomena. I\u0027m going to retell the life of one of my favorite historical figures, but I\u0027m going to change all of these details (as well as names), because I feel that the more of these I change, the more allegorical it becomes. You can read the life of someone whose story you already know, but divorced from context in this fashion you\u0027ll hopefully be able to look at their actions more than the known result. This project will likely involve a series of books.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWizard Story.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Everyone who knows me personally knows how much I love wizards. So obviously I want to tell the life story of one. We\u0027ll follow her from childhood, through her apprenticeship and early study, to personal exploration of magic, and we\u0027ll see how her life goes. Will she survive long enough, and learn enough, to become an arch mage? Will she resort to using magic for evil? What will she do when faced with people who fear her power? Who knows! This will probably only be one book, but if it turns out well it could spawn sequels.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHOW\u0027S RELEASE WORK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy short stories will, as mentioned, happen entirely on my website. They\u0027ll be published whenever they\u0027re finished, often self-edited or with the generous help of some friends. Which could be frequently, or infrequently, depending on time and availability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBigger projects will take a lot longer. I\u0027m going to be working on them diligently, but carefully. Especially for my sci-fi stories this means research (doubly so for the epic), development, read-through, redrafting, polish, rewriting, again and again until I get it right. Once each book is done, I\u0027ll make them available for sale on Smashwords and Amazon. Patrons who are at a certain level or higher will get a code that lets them buy my books for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo start with, the money I get will go directly toward paying the cost of my website. Once that is paid, any remaining money will go to paying editors and cover artists for their invaluable services. After that, if there\u0027s any money left after every editor and artist is fairly paid, it\u0027ll go to supporting me because I do have this habit of eating regularly.\u003cbr\u003e"
