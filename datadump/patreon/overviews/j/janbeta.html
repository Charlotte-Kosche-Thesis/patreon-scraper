As unprofessional as it gets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon? I believe that it should be your choice to give me money. I\u0027m strongly opposed to things like running ads on my channel just to give me some income. I\u0027d rather try making good videos you can enjoy and throw some money my way if you enjoy them enough. But it should definitely be YOUR choice to help me out. No pressure. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m neither a rich man (rather poor, really) nor a professional electronics guy. I have a boring regular dayjob to pay the rent and everything else (including my hobby). Sometimes I sell stuff I repaired and make some extra money that way. It would really help to have the Patreon thing as a little monthly extra enabling me to buy spare parts, tools, and interesting things to show you on the channel. There\u0027s also at least a little truth in that \"time is money\" thing. You can\u0027t buy time, of course. But you can help me to have more time for making videos I don\u0027t have to spend making money in other (probably less enjoyable for everyone) ways. I\u0027m a hobbyist who likes to share his experience and maybe enable you to do stuff yourself. I believe in repairing things rather than discarding them. I also believe in learning about how things work rather than just using them. And I sincerely hope to make people smile sometimes.\u003cbr\u003e"
