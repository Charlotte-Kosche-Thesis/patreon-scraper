Why should you pledge to me? Good question! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe number one reason to pledge at least $1 per month to me is that you are acquainted with me, my life, my art, my works, or just humble me, and you believe that keeping me living indoors with sufficient resources to operate is something that you think would be good for me, you, all or part of the world, or just me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are not convinced, you may either stop now and go to another quadrant of the internet, or you can read on after the divider.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (-: \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, for those unfamiliar with JTG, that\u0027s me, consider the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI do many great, epic, things. :-D\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0\u00a0If you are someone who has been following me for decades, you know the sort of stuff I post, all the logic, reason, education, clarification, art, and drama. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e If I am new to you, prepare to be amazed. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I have been called a \"\u003cstrong\u003epolymath\u003c/strong\u003e\", which means I know a bunch of stuff. I call myself a \"one-man-think tank\". I want to communicate what i know via my video and art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I have ten (10) college degrees and can hold a conversation on almost any topic most people can imagine, and even topics i don\u0027t know, I can catch onto quickly. I have used that knowledge in the past to simplify and explain complex topics in text and video forms.\u00a0If you ever meet me, ask me anything and I will either be able to speak to you about that topic, or very quickly I will usually catch on after a couple questions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e//-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has two ways for you to contribute, a set amount each month, or pay-per-creation method. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon campaign page is set to be a month-by-month general support campaign, in that you make a monthly contribution to support my many artistic endeavours regardless of how many I produce. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have and will have other Patreon campaign pages which are and will be on the pay-by-project method; in other words in those other campaigns for each video, comic, or other art piece I create, you would be billed a set amount for each piece i create, as set by you, with a maximum amount. So, for example, if I have another Patreon campaign where I create a specific type of video, you could contribute $5.00 per video, with a maximum you may set o $20, so that if I create five videos in a month, you would only be charged for four. \u00a0Likewise, if I only created three videos, you would only be charged for there, i.e. $15. \u00a0As another example, if you pledged one of my web comics at $0.50 each, if I created and posted 20 in a month, you would be charged $10. \u00a0The pay-per-creation method rewards creation whereas the monthly-set-pledge is a general support pledge. \u00a0See how it works?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can either contribute here on this monthly-set price campaign, or on one or more of those other campaigns, or both or all, as you prefer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m planning several specific projects which require me to live indoors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I am launching a series of YouTube videos in which I explain topics and issues briefly and clearly. I have a talent to take very complex subjects and put them in understandable terms to the lay person. I am planning on one a week at the start, but will expand as my financial support allows. I am making videos which explain science, such as \"what is a planet?\", \"what is art\", \"how do I sell my house with or without an agent\", et cetera.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I am starting a personal weight-loss project which I call the 400 to 220 project, wherein I drop from my current weight of about 400 (down from 600 max) and drop to 220, while posting regular updates, exercise videos, recipes, and other relevant data as I proceed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Let us not forget the ongoing performance art that has been my life.  My life has been an open book on various social media forums over the past few decades, and some of you have been following the tales of my life for decades. I know my life is a story some of you follow like I were someone fictional, like Spock or Weird Al. Some of you have been getting free entertainment out of my life for decades, so how about a $ or so each month? Hmmmmm?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the basics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could go on, but I will stop there. You can ask me anything, and I may or may not answer, depending on how you ask and what you want to know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you read all that, then thank you, and you should be giving me at least a dollar a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for your support, and we now return you to your regularly scheduled astrology reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#jtg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
