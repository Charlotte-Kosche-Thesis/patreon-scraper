I am a writer, poet, spoken word artist, musician, photographer, crafter, and cosplayer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy journey started very young.  As a wee me, I was in various forms of dance and theatre.  I developed a passion for poetry and writing in elementary school (thanks Ms Borges!); at thirteen, I discovered photography and visual arts, which led me to pursue a degree in Photography at Drexel University.  Since 2001, I have hosted or been a regular performer for several slams, open mics, and salons, including independent shows for three consecutive years in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough my life, I have been able to have my own photography business and Etsy shop, a teaching job at the Philadelphia Zoo, and a current position as a flight attendant.  Through it all, creativity has been a driving force. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some of my current and up-coming projects:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* I\u0027ve completed my first fictional novel, and I\u0027m in the process of my first revision!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* I\u0027m signing on to a cooperative spoken word project and will presenting my first one-woman show in NYC in December!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* I\u0027ll soon be recording both musical and spoken word work to make myself more well-rounded and available!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am always looking for new and exciting outlets and new skills to learn. This has included: painting, chainmaille, leather working, and even cartooning. Artistic endeavors, new and old, have been prevalent throughout my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt and creation have always been very important to me, and I\u0027ve dedicated 2015 to be my year to push myself and see how much I can grow this integral part of my life.
