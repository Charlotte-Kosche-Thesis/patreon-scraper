I\u0027m a teenager playing a children\u0027s card game, and YouTube is my pride and joy, as well as a good source of stable income. I make videos about Yu-Gi-Oh! that explore the wonderful and wacky depths of anime cards. I have talked about Deck Masters, Supreme Kings, and even Royal Cookpals, so I know my anime stuff, you could say. I\u0027m currently a high school senior, and you know what that means: \u003cem\u003eCollege.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0So, I\u0027m trying to save up for that as well as paying rent once I graduate from high school. I also love movies, laughter, and my girlfriend Dylan, who has supported me whole-heartedly in my escapades.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat is all this?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I would love to put all the effort I can into every single one of my videos, I simply don\u0027t have the time to do that AND stay relevant in the YouTube algorithm. I have since brought back the Broken Anime Archetypes series because everyone loves it and they\u0027re quick to make. The stress of double daily uploads is intense, as much as I love what I do and would not give up for the world. All I ask is that the process continue in a more streamlined and self-sustainable fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy do I make videos?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never been satisfied where I am, I\u0027ve always wanted to ascend to a higher level of content production and generally making my viewers happy or at least entertained enough to forget about real-life problems for a couple minutes. I know because I\u0027ve had problems in my own life, from Depression to Crohn\u0027s Disease to seeing my own house get destroyed because we couldn\u0027t afford it anymore. Life is rough, and entertainment is something that truly makes it worth living, in my opinion, among other things. I just want to give that to the people who watch my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat if I can\u0027t pay?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love my content and want me to make much more of it, then I\u0027d appreciate it wholly for every cent I\u0027m drip fed. If you are not able to pay because of being too young, not having the disposable income (we\u0027ve all been there), or from supporting other content creators, that\u0027s also totally fine! There are many other ways to support the channel, like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTurning off adblock on my videos. This is a huge step in making my revenue grow and, let\u0027s be honest, 5 seconds and then pushing a button every time you click upon my videos isn\u0027t going to hurt anyone.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClicking advertisements on my videos. This is a big one, as it\u0027s the main way YouTube determines how much to pay out to content creators. Simply clicking the screen and closing the tab helps quite a bit, and would not cost you a cent.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinuing to watch my videos. You have no idea how incredible it is that over 1,000 people all over the world have decided they love my content so much they watch every video. That people watch my content and love it. Keep doing that, and you\u0027re still wonderful in my eyes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSend random gifts in my P.O. Box, which is\u00a0PO Box 1718, 5350 Bellaire Blvd, Bellaire, TX 77401.
