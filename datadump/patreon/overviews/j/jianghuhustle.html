We\u0027re watching our way through the wuxia canon, discussing the cultural and dramatic elements that define the genre. It\u0027s so much more than just high-flying sword fights and over-the-top acting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are training to develop a new tabletop RPG that captures the melodrama of wuxia cinema as well as the thrilling fight choreography. So far, we\u0027ve watched films like \u003cem\u003eThe 36th Chamber of Shaolin, Drunken Master 2, Five Deadly Venoms, \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0We collect all our discussions on a podcast hosted by the Misdirected Mark network.\u00a0You can find our feed here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://misdirectedmark.com/category/jianghu-hustle/\"\u003ehttp://misdirectedmark.com/category/jianghu-hustle...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we\u0027ve already got a podcast up and running, why are we asking for your patronage?

We need money for art, layout, and design for our playtest and promotional materials.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEngage the Community:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0What is a knight errant without a community to fight for? We want to gather together all the wuxia fans out there, especially those who are looking for a new take on the genre when it comes to tabletop RPGs! Patreon is one of the best platforms for you to add your support to this project.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodcast Production:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Training is tough work!
