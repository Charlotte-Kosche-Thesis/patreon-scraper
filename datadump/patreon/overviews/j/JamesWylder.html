I\u0027ve been featured on \u003cem\u003ethe New York Daily News\u003c/em\u003e book blog and in\u003cem\u003e the Elkhart Truth\u003c/em\u003e newspaper. I\u0027ve toured my writing in 2 countries, 10 states, and 23 cities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a lot. Many of my friends tell me I \"write like I\u0027m running out of time,\" and it\u0027s what I\u0027ve always wanted to do. Always. I feel incomplete and unfulfilled when I\u0027m not creating new things, and I want to make as much as I can, as good as I can make it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon will support creating the stories for \u003cem\u003eTales by the Blue Light\u003c/em\u003e, exclusive fiction and poetry for backers, plus support the other books I\u0027m working on on the side as well!
