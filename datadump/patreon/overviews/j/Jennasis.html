I\u0027d like to be able to share with you my joy and experiences regarding all things that I value, but this takes a great deal of time and money to do, neither of which I currently have, so this Patreon page and your kind assistance, is a potential means of enabling me to free up more of my life to deal with real stuff, and reduce the amount of time I spend staring at a screen and telling people how much money we are raking in for our shareholders...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you, for anything you are willing and able to throw my way - I am very grateful to you for even considering!!\u003cbr\u003e"
