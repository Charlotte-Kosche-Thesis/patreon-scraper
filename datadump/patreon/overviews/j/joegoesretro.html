I\u2019m a producer of internet videos on the subject of video\u00a0games, or more specifically those that I consider \u201cretro\u201d.  Stuff I grew up with or\u00a0just enjoyed playing in years past.  I\u2019ve been creating new videos almost every\u00a0week for over three years. \u00a0I started off with very simple videos back in the summer of 2013, which were very low-budget. \u00a0As time went on, I decided I wanted to take things a bit more seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe primary feature of my channel are my game reviews.  I have been honing\u00a0my craft of making to the point reviews and overviews of games since February\u00a02014.  I also do top 5 lists and a number of other features.  I\u2019m always coming \u00a0with new ideas for content, and I am dedicated to improving my content as\u00a0best as I possibly can. \u00a0From 2014 to the present I\u0027ve invested thousands of dollars in buying video equipment and computer hardware out of my own pocket for the purpose of making better content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are examples of what I\u0027m doing on YouTube currently: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpk351wmmoo\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvoxJ2LnX4E\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow, what is this Patreon thing about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot just would I love to improve the content which I create, and be able to\u00a0implement new ideas within my content, but also make more content more often. However that requires two very precious\u00a0commodities:  time and money.  Without beating around the bush, that\u2019s\u00a0where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a subscription-based fan-funding service for us creative types out there.  If you\u00a0find what I do worth supporting, you can choose to send a few bucks in my\u00a0direction.  This is \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely optional\u003c/strong\u003e and I will \u003cstrong\u003enever\u003c/strong\u003e charge for my content. \u00a0You can choose how much you want to contribute and cancel whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your support you will have access to some exclusive content such as blogs and of course the forum here. \u00a0I might do Q\u0026amp;As in the future in which I will answer questions posted by patrons.\u00a0 Or I may possibly poll my patrons for suggestions on video topics or games to review.\u00a0 There may be other perks as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
