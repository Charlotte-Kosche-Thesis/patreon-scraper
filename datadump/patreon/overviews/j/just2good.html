    "summary": "Hello, just2good here! What\u0027s so \"just too good\" about me? Well, it\u0027s more of the fact that I love sharing my insight, knowledge, and passion for LEGO. I make various different YouTube videos centered around the world\u0027s favorite building toy, LEGO!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust watching my content is a great way to support me, and I\u0027m incredibly appreciative with that. However, if you want to go a step beyond the support of just watching my videos, consider pledging towards this Patreon. You may ask, why the Patreon? Well, here\u0027s the thing:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLEGO building blocks are known to be an expensive toy. Not only that, but my video quality keeps getting better with each year. To keep up this consistent improvement of quality, I have to spend more and more time on video editing and money into new LEGO sets as well as equipment. However, YouTube and Google have been becoming less and less of a reliable source of income for this money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, some of my videos, which are all 100% child friendly, have been randomly demonetized for no reason. YouTube has been featuring my videos less and less each year, and Google\u0027s advertising payments have been dwindling with each year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, with all of this considered, I hope you can at least understand where I\u0027m coming from in making this page. Hope ya enjoy the stay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
