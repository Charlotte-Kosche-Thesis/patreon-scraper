    "summary": "My name is Jackie and I have been creating costumes and props for a bit now and want to use Patreon to create a SUPER community in which I can grow my passion for pattern making and foam folding all the things as well as instructing as many eager makers as I can! I want to cosplay ALL THE WORLD. You guys will be my super-circle. I want to reward your support with patterns and kits as well as information! Loads and loads of it! I hope to be able to grow and expand off of your feedback.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe time has come for a more structured return for you guys! I get so many questions on how to create something or what and when to use this or that. After creating my Blizzcon Virtual Ticket content in a more tutorial video format I decided I would like to do a bit more of that to cover much more than I can simply in replies to comments and questions. You can watch me talk with my hands and spill tea dribble down my chin...you know normal daily life for me lol.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have lots of ideas and growth in store for this patreon so things may adjust and change along the way only ever for the better of course! Stay tuned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat you can expect from me!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eIn supporting me here you will receive videos and patterns tailored to what my community wants to see! What YOU guys are looking to create as well as watching and learning along with my prop and costume journeys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will have polls for you to vote on what pattern and template content to create next as well as instructional video topics. Only here will I also offer in depth and honest(ofc) reviews of products I am testing. I am always testing something in the Jacki-lab!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will also be hosting giveaways just for you that will include some of the items created in the video content!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
