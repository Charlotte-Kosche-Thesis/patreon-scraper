     "about": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven\n for a fellow with no pretensions toward the avant-garde, Judson is a \ncurious fellow. He\u0027s both straightforward and oddly mercurial. While his\n vision has remained consistent, his style has been known to change. \nWhile he\u0027s been sporting a straight-laced studious look for a while now,\n not long ago he was long-haired and shaggily bearded. But whether he\u0027s \nbeen rocking hobo chic or a Cosby sweater, whether he\u0027s being absolutely\n kind or letting you know that he\u0027s onto you and the lies you tell \nyourself, his music has remained solid. I didn\u0027t always have his back in\n this regard.\u003cbr\u003eIt took me a while to latch onto what he was doing \nas his current band was coming together. But something started to happen\n with the band\u0027s performances that made the material come alive to me in\n a way I\u0027d been resisting. Perhaps it was the way his aw-shucks \npoliteness had come to coexist with a frenetic intensity, an \non-his-knees shredding that was as natural as it was unexpected. One \nsecond he\u0027s affably telling of writing a song in the Social Security \noffice, and the next he\u0027s playing like his demons are trying to crush \nhim through the stage floor. And I watched intently as \"William Jennings\n Bryan\" evolved from chilling violin showcase to a hellfire barnburner.\u003cbr\u003eThis\n prophetic streak has played out not just in his performance but in his \nlyrics, most tellingly in a song like \"When Will The Paths Be Straight \nAgain?\"\u003cbr\u003e- LORD GROWING, \u003cem\u003eThe 704\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
