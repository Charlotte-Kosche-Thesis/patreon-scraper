I\u0027ve always put them on youtube for free and that\u0027s not going to change. Through posting things on youtube I think I\u0027ve developed loyal and generous fans. You guys are so important to me, I never would have believed becoming a working musician was possible without the overwhelming support from all of you. Now, I can\u0027t imagine doing anything else, but I\u0027m sure most of us would agree, it is not an easy road, and sometimes it\u0027s hard to make ends meet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it\u0027s important to touch on the fact that no one actually has to pay for music anymore. Piracy is rampant, and there\u0027s like 0.00001% chance you\u0027d ever encounter consequences from illegally downloading my music. Yet still, plenty of you pay for it. I\u0027m so very thankful to the people that do, and honestly feel no anger towards the people that don\u0027t. I\u0027ve posted free music on youtube for 5 years because I value your loyalty more than your dollars. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is how I intend to use Patreon...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can totally watch my videos for free, but if you think it\u0027s worth it, you can give me the freedom to work and develop as an artist. I will be charging a minimum of 1.00 per release, but you can give as much as you like. \u00a0If you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, there\u0027s an easy way to set a monthly maximum for yourself when you\u0027re entering your payment info.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this help, I\u00a0can focus on making content that is worthy of your patronage. I hope you dig this as much as I do. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ James.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Unlike most musicians I started late in life down the path to writing, producing and performing my own original material.  In fact, it was Youtube that inspired me to learn how to do all of those things.  The possibility that I could independently produce something and have people from all over the world watch and listen to it, really got me excited.  \u003cbr\u003eI watched the musicians on youtube and thought that given enough time and effort I could do that too. I started slowly, but over time I have been able to produce better quality songs, performances and video.\u003cbr\u003eI am to the point now that I feel confident putting out a song / video on a weekly basis and the people that followed me along the way seem to like what I\u0027m doing. \u003cbr\u003eThank-you for letting me realize my dream.\u003cbr\u003eJames\u003cbr\u003e",
