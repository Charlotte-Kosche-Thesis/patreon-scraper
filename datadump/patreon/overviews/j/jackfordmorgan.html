    "summary": "I love creating worlds and seeing people have a great time together. Indie game development allows me to share this love with others but it takes a lot of time, energy, and money. Though I have already self-published and sold small runs of a number of games, I\u0027ve recently become a dad and my ability to self-fund development is becoming limited. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run regular game events with the Half-Monster community and provide my games at the lowest possible price I can. Even a small amount of support will make it infinitely more possible for me to continue making fun games for everyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon pledges will contribute to things like: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Prototyping Costs\u003cbr\u003e- Print and Manufacturing Runs\u003cbr\u003e- Acquiring and Shipping all of these materials\u003cbr\u003e- Internet Hosting and Domain Fees\u003cbr\u003e- Venue hire/food for test days\u003cbr\u003e- At the highest tier level, to provide a service that allows me to personally hand-make the latest prototype of any game you choose, in order to send to you to try out\u003cbr\u003e - May (one day) pay me personally a little for the hours and the clicking!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribers don\u2019t just support me to make more games, they also create a community helping me make better games faster. I have hundreds of ideas for new games, and as a subscriber you can help me decide which ones to develop next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making games and making people happy, and your continued support can help me achieve my dream of connecting people through creative, fun games."
