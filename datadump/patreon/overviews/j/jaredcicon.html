    "summary": "A 53 year old married father of 4 children, I\u0027ve dabbled in tons of things over the years, loving most of them. I currently \u0027pick\u0027 for a living. I\u0027m a picker\u0027. Like \u0027American Pickers\u0027 on The History channel. I\u0027m going to be sharing some of my experiences in treasure hunting and my views on politics (current events) as video logs here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a fiscal and social conservative, who realizes now more than ever, the need to bare political testimony. Conservatives have, for too long, been silent while the more vocal, liberal, radical minority activists have driven academic, governmental and societal change and for more than a century. The fallout of our apathy has resulted in forfeiting control to the radical (minority) left, allowing them to steer America to the brink of social and societal chaos with the emerging and distinct possibility of civil war. Let me be very clear. When I say \u0027The Left\u0027, I am not speaking of the democrat that existed at the time of John F. Kennedy, or even those whom supported Jimmy Carter. These old-school liberals and Democrats, loved our country and have much in common with today\u0027s conservative (notice I didn\u0027t automatically say \u0027Republican\u0027). My concern is with the neo-liberal...those who call themselves \u0027progressive\u0027 and who at their core, hate America, it\u0027s founding fathers, the core documents and everything The U. S. States of America stands for. Make no mistake, these freedom-hating progressives exist in great numbers and have ruddered our country to it\u0027s detriment, fairly overtly for decades now. This \u0027Fundamental Change\u0027 crawled from out of the shadows and became \u0027visible\u0027, a little less than a decade ago with the election of President Barak Hussein Obama. He said he was going to change our country. He warned us. We did nothing. He and his associates delivered on the promise. It has taken hold. Make no mistake: We are at a precipice. Fervent, focused, purposeful, caring, loving, mature, concerned, constructive political testimonies need to be borne...yours and mine. Conservative opinions must be shared, and lived. Join me...it\u0027s time to bear our political testimonies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT PATREON: I\u0027ve committed to producing video commentary, (minimum of 4 videos per month) on politics and picking. Check out the introduction video at the top of the page. It\u0027s a fair example of the nature and quality of the video postings I\u0027ll be producing. If you find value in this type of content I ask that you help support me in producing them. Each 3-10 minute video requires between 2 and 3 days to record and edit (produce). In suspending my \u0027day-job\u0027 to produce these I need to make-up the income shortfall in some way. I respectfully ask for your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining the fight. Please share these videos those you think might appreciate and/or benefit from them. Not just with like-minded members of the same chorus, but with acquaintances you identify who might be suffering from exposure to the left-leaning, majority media opinion and would benefit from increased conservative balance. I\u0027ll do my utmost to be accurate and honest, and will be prepared to back up information I provide with factual references where possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
