See in a comprehensive, condensed and entertaining way how I build bases from start to finish. Get your idea factory running and learn how to bring the scenery from your mind into reality! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.benkomets.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mumi_bio_matt.pdf\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMatt\u00b4 s Bio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to give you some insight on how my mind works, what techniques I am using for constructive elements and what motivates me to push the boundaries of miniature art. Many people asked me for my opinion or guidance and I would like to make it happen in a more convenient (digital) way to reach as many of you wherever you might be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have already produced a couple of the bases you can see below, but there are many, many more to come. Please give me some time to expand the pool of knowledge further. My promise to you is that it will be well worth your time to study my content and that you will be able to build bases that you would not have thought you could build from scratch. Patreon is a great platform that allows me to dedicate a big portion of my time to produce the best material for you. I will constantly improve my presentation and production to make content better and better every time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage gives you full access to detailed step by step instructions for every base I create, regular in-depth tutorials and videos paired with Streaming sessions so you can engage with me personally and ask questions about the entire process; I have been practicing this art for 15 years by now and have learned from all the mistakes I made, so you don\u00b4t have to learn bad habits or make mistakes as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, if you have a special Basing project that requires more attention, you can choose one of the rare \u0027Master Explorer\u0027 Private Coachings! Here, you will get my full attention for your project. We will be developing a unique concept and turn your existing Projects into a real Showpiece. 1 hour of personal, videostreaming coaching monthly, highly exclusive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate: In addition to all content produced exclusively for this Channel your patronage will also unlock your access to the \u0027Joy Of Basing\u0027 Community on Discord! Here you can share your basing projects and get quick, honest and useful feedback about your work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.benkomets.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blood_bowl_pitchbase_01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.benkomets.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hexbases_01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFUTURE PLANS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am constantly improving my technical knowledge and set up here in the workshop, so I will look into ways to improve the image and sound quality over time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor the start and as long as we are less than 50 Patrons, I will only be able to make video tutorials about the building process of each base. Once we hit more than 50 Patrons, I will upload or create the painting process for every base. I am very committed to release content on a monthly basis or more frequently.\u00a0I hope that with some additional funding from aspiring miniature artists out there we can increase the frequency of production, as it takes a lot of time to put everything together. I will be collaborating with both manufacturers and fellow miniature Artists to bring you some really unique projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.benkomets.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/all_future_bases_warm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "For over 15 years, Matt has strived to turn the Miniature Hobby into a true Form of Art. Although he does seem like an typical Architect / Urbanist, he really cares a lot about Film, Poetry, Art, Music and Science. Matt always tries to push the boundaries of what is thought to be possible and to find new, innovative, creative, surprising, stupid, unusual, boring and appealing ways to tell relevant and interesting stories through his narrative Dioramas. In his free time, Matt likes to Walk around with an open mind and open pockets, swim with the Whales while counting the pool tiles (4.324) and meeting old people that can teach him a lesson or two. He likes his Tea with Brown Sugar and Milk. Also, he loves speaking about himself in the third person.",
