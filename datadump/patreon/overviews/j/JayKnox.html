While working on this project I will be releasing a schedule-following webcomic and some non-schedule following background arts and video game experiments. Check out the art I\u0027ve already posted and if you\u0027d like to see more of the same (with improvements over time of course) please feel free to donate!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAN IMPORTANT NOTE TO PATRONS 3$ AND UP: Reward tiers involve sending physical and digital goods to patrons, and I know some people only want to donate rather than deal with me sending them packets of sketches in the mail. In the interest of making things smooth and easy, I reach out to patrons in these tiers to ask their wants/preferences as to what they receive. If you want a certain part of the reward tier and not another, that is absolutely fine. This may change in the future due to patron volume, but for now each patron will be dealt with individually to make sure they\u0027re getting what they want out of donating."
