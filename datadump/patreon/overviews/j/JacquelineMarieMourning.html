    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Jacq, and I\u0027m a professional misfit. \u003cbr\u003eFrom the very beginning I\u0027ve done things a little differently. While other kids were making friends at school and listening to rock bands, I was talking to trees and hanging out with animals, both wild and domestic.\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eI was discovered at 18 by a French model scout and sent to Paris, where I learned the fine art of looking good, and even more importantly, making clothing and other things look good, in front of a camera. I enjoyed a fine career for many years but in time decided that mainstream modeling really wasn\u0027t for me. I lived too much of a fantasy world in my head and desperately needed to bring that to the world. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve turned my attention in recent years to doing more creative and alternative modeling.\u00a0 Fully indulging myself in the fantasy world I love is a dream and\u00a0I\u0027m shooting almost weekly. But doing this is not a money making venture for me. I am creating for the art, and the love of expressing my haunted fantasy world to my fans and followers.\u00a0 Doing so gives me great joy, but takes hours of my time away from my ability to earn a living. With a household of mouths to feed (both four legged and two legged) as well as my own, I can use any help I can get to enable me to keep creating my vision. \u003cbr\u003eBecoming my Patron would give me the ability to create when the urge overcomes me without fear of not making ends meet. It would give me more time in a week or even a day to take photos and videos, edit\u00a0them and post them online for all to enjoy.\u00a0 It would give me some extra income to purchase props, and other needed items for new photo shoots, and to upgrade both my camera set up and my editing software.\u003cbr\u003eEither way, knowing you are interested enough in my story to have read this means a lot. Knowing there are those out there who believe in me is just as important as financial support, and I thank you.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my Patreon page, you can find me at the following places:\u003cbr\u003eMy Website \u003ca href=\"https://www.jacquelinemariemourning.com/\"\u003ehttps://www.jacquelinemariemourning.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JacquelineMarieMourning\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/JacquelineMarieMourning\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/JacquelineMarieMourning\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/JacquelineMarieMourning\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JacquelineMourn\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/JacquelineMourn\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrB49pMUce4Q2iHTEdfq3Kg\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrB49pMUce4Q2iHTEdfq3Kg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSnapchat @JacqCT\u003cbr\u003eAll my love!\u003cbr\u003eJacq"
