    "summary": "Greetings, all!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Jeanine, a.k.a. J Tullos Hennig. I\u0027m a\nhistory geek, a retired professional horseperson, a grandmama, and a dance teacher whose knees have unfortunately become less than adequate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlong with all these things, I\u0027m a writer and novelist. And yes, if you\u0027re thinking that sounds a bit\nlike a detox confession, you\u0027d not be far off. I\u0027ve been driven to write all my\nlife. This isn\u0027t something picked up on a whim even as little as ten years\nago; this is a practice... a craft... an \u003cem\u003eart\u003c/em\u003e I respect and take some pride in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have always told stories in some fashion; my fiction is immersive and character-driven. You\ncan find my work\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.jtulloshennig.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eHERE\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I do my damnedest to conjure situations that urge readers\nto \u003cem\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003ethink\u003c/em\u003e; I want to challenge preconceptions. I believe in the importance of exploring under-served points of view, not only in my #ownvoice, but also with the knowledge that #weneeddiversebooks. I also hope to share a meaningful experience with those who enjoy a good story. Perhaps you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd it seems we have a new--and also most ancient--way to\ndo just that. Throughout history, art has been supported by powerful, loyal patrons; now every person has\ntheir own power of support: through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou see, as both a history geek and an elder, I\nknow things usually come round and back again. In this moment, the concept of\npatronage is once again finding a place in our society. And it\u0027s a necessary\nplace because, let\u0027s face it, all too often any value that\u0027s given to creators\nand makers of art? Well, it\u0027s rarely commensurate with the work that goes into\nthat art. Most of us have several jobs outside our true calling just to keep a\nroof over our heads. And those less-than-adequate knees I mentioned? They aren\u0027t supporting my other workload as well as they used to. I can\u0027t dance hour-long shows any more, though I\u0027m still able to teach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I write.\u00a0 :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll consider joining my Patreon. In return for your\nsupport, each month you\u0027ll receive access to content found nowhere else: sneak\npeeks at works in progress, lost scenes and \u0027fic bits\u0027, artwork, giveaways, and other\nspecial and exclusive perks (including the audiobook serialisation of \u003cem\u003eWinterwode\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSummerwode\u003c/em\u003e and the upcoming \u003cem\u003eWyldingwode\u003c/em\u003e!). Perhaps things I\u0027ve not even thought of yet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLet me sit by your fire like a storyteller of\nold, and share tales--written and spoken--of other places and times. Wander the\nforest and wonder at the stars, join in the drumming and dancing--and if you\ndon\u0027t know how to dance, well, then, I\u0027ll teach you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, and I look forward to sharing my worlds with you.\u003cbr\u003e~Jeanine\u003cbr\u003e"
