Kel is a nonbinary ten-year-old (well, eight in Lon years) being raised by their mother on the planet Avalon, about 26 light years from Earth, thousands of years in our future. \u003cem\u003eA Lon Beginning\u003c/em\u003e is seven chapters, kid-friendly, but suitable for all ages. It will have a number of sequels, as Kel grows up, learns about their world, and gains increasing mastery of the technology-based magic made possible by Ama and the nano/microtech skin of the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m also working on several stories in the same universe, set in this century, about humanity\u2019s last ditch efforts to save itself from complete destruction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the year 2060, zero children are born, due to a multifactorial planetwide fertility crash. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the late 21st century, the seas are rising faster than ever, global communications have failed, and the fragmented nations of North America are disappearing as their populations age and food supplies crash. The Last Generation and the Babylon Cooperative work frantically in the domes of the Pacific States of America to make sure the human race continues, in spite of the people who have decided that it is the will of God for humanity to die. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Lon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLon is Avalon, a planet terraformed by nerds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLon is Babylon, Earth, the cradle of humanity.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLon is the Dandelon Project, a nanotech hybrid Star Wisp-EM drive used to colonize space.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLon is the Babylon Cooperative, working to save the genetic diversity of Earth.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBut most of all, Lon is a hard science fiction story about the end of the world and what it might take to save humanity from disasters of our own making.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eLon is also a deeply collaborative and multimedia project, with a goal of working with artists and fandom to eventually create a rich tapestry of stories and art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps the most important thing about Lon is that it is a story for all of us, with a diverse and complex cast of characters and a deep foundation in the plausible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer, activist and parent, and somehow my dystopian near-future apocalyptic novel turned into my children\u0027s favorite bedtime story.
