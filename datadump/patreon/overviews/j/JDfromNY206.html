    "summary": "Hello everyone, my name is Jerry and welcome to my Patreon page. I am supposed to tell everyone here why you should pledge and support and hopefully what I tell you grabs your attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral years ago I was living in Southern New Jersey and ending a chapter in my life that went about 7 years. I was forced to move back home to New York closer to my family because I couldn\u0027t find a roommate to move in with me and I was going thru relationship issues so I packed up all my stuff and left. I also wanted to be closer to my Grandparents as my Grandpa was battling Alzheimer\u0027s. I got a job in Mid-Town Manhattan and was doing very well for myself until that very job after 4 years fired me for no reason on Black Friday, right after Thanksgiving. It was at that moment, I decided to buy myself a microphone and a cheap camera and take my voice to YouTube creating Gaming videos and expressing my views on the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment). Maintaining YouTube as a hobby I found other jobs and nothing ever really satisfied me. In most cases, as I grew, I always put more effort into my YouTube Channel than my actual job. Job after job, leading up to current day where I feel like I am stuck in a place with literally no way out, YouTube has pretty much becoming my top priority. I can sit at work all day and just think about what WWE News Story I will talk about that evening, or I would be planning my next Podcast topic. I\u0027ll be thinking about setting up my next Call Of Duty livestream. YouTube has honestly kept me sane thru what has been the most emotional time of my life the last few years with the death of my Grandpa and the constant depression and sadness I feel when it comes to certain aspects of my life and my job. I hate my job. Nobody understands the miserable feeling I have every day I wake up, knowing I have to work there, and feel unappreciated, underpaid, and not wanted. Some say find another job but with the way things are today, that\u0027s easier said than done. I have taken solace in my WWE Podcasts. I have take solace in my gaming. These are the things I am passionate about. These are the things that turn that sadness I feel into happiness because I know within my heart I am doing something that I love to do, and thats all i ever wanted. I never had the opportunity to wake up and say to myself that I love what I do. I never had the opportunity to wake up and feel excited about getting to work on a project for that day. YouTube, my gaming and my WWE Podcasts bring me that feeling. If you become a Patreon to my cause, you will be helping out someone who has dedicated the last 3 years of his life to give people the content that they want, with no questions asked. You will be helping out someone who can turn around and tell his company he is walking away for good because he has something much better waiting for him at home. Happiness, peace, and the joy of bringing smiles to peoples faces thru his voice and personality. Thank you for reading, thank you for stopping by here and thank you for hopefully making my dream become a reality."
