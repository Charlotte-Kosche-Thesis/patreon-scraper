    "summary": "Hello lovely Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jourdain Searles, and I create culture criticism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the creator, editor and primary contributor to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fishnetcinema.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efishnet cinema\u003c/a\u003e, a feminist film and media critique site. With \u003cstrong\u003efishnet\u003c/strong\u003e, I aim to analyze the depiction of women and femmes in entertainment. Many pieces on the site focus on the work and depiction of women in film, television, animation and other forms of performance. I also run the official twitter for the site (\u003cstrong\u003e@fishnetcinema\u003c/strong\u003e). This website is a labor of love and I currently make no money from the essays I publish there. And because I do not make any money off of it, I am unable to pay anyone who wants to contribute (or myself for that matter). I would really love for that to change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my writing my on \u003cstrong\u003efishnet\u003c/strong\u003e, I also have a Medium account where I write very personal pieces and/or pieces that get rejected by editors. This Patreon also supports those pieces which you can read\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@jourdainsearles\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also run two podcasts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBad Romance Podcast! \u003c/strong\u003eMy cohost Bronwyn Isaac and I watch one bad romantic film a week and then make fun of it on the podcast. We\u0027re both comedians so OF COURSE its funny. But we\u0027re also writers and feminists, so we analyze the gender representation in the films as well. This is my primary podcast and it seems to be gaining a good following. I hope you listen and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Shady Lady Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e is my feminist interview show. Each episode I sit down with an artist of some kind (often women) and discuss a topic that is important to them, whatever it may be. I like to provide a space for them to talk about their art, or discuss something that\u0027s just been burning in their brain. This podcast is more sporadic. I would like it to be monthly, but the time it takes to coordinate with guests and edit our conversations takes much longer than BR. Hopefully, this podcast will get on a better schedule once I have the time and finances to get it where I need it to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these projects, in one way or another, require money to continue to exist, thrive and grow. I\u0027m a freelancer and college grad, so needless to say I don\u0027t have money in the bank. I\u0027m very much living the odd jobs and instant rice life. Still, I believe that my work has value and is worthy of compensation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges go towards maintaining \u003cstrong\u003efishnet\u003c/strong\u003e, podcast hosting fees, recording equipment, compensating me for my writing and eventually providing me with the funds to pay guest writers for \u003cstrong\u003efishnet.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit more about me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a queer black woman with a visual disability. I have a\u003cstrong\u003e BA \u003c/strong\u003ein Communications with a concentration in Television and Cinema. I also have an \u003cstrong\u003eMFA\u003c/strong\u003e in Dramatic Writing from NYU\u0027s Tisch School of the Arts. Along with my\u00a0criticism\u00a0and podcasting, I also write plays, screenplays and have some TV pilots I would love to become shows some day. I\u0027m a feminist, leftist and passionate about the empowerment of women of color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a black woman, in means the world to me to know that there are people in the world who appreciate my work and find it worthwhile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much."
