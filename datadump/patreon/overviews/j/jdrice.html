Rice, and I\u0027m a flash fiction writer and novelist, writing mostly science fiction and fantasy. My accolades include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e30+ published flash fiction stories\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFormer professional ghostwriter\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCo-author for the novella series, \u003cem\u003eOf Angels and Olympians\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(book 2 coming soon!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I work as a professional writer in the federal contracting space, which, while fun, cannot compare to my dream of writing fiction full time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough this Patreon campaign, I hope to increase my writing output, share my stories with a wider fanbase, and achieve my dream of becoming a career novelist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get for your support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my rewards involve early access to my published works, along with additional behind-the-scenes insight into my writing process. Anyone who commits just $5 a month will receive early review copies of all self-published books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome rewards also involve collaboration, which means my writing can help get your ideas onto the page! I am an experienced ghostwriter (I did it professionally for two years!) so I have a knack for working well with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get from your support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the basic things like money for copyediting, cover art, marketing, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut more importantly, your support buys me TIME. I am a working husband and father, so my time for writing is limited. The more Patreon goals I reach, the more time I will be able to justify committing to my writing, the more books I\u0027ll be able to write, and the closer I\u0027ll be to the ultimate goal of writing fiction full time.
