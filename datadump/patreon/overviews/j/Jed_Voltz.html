     "about": "Ever since I was a little dude, I knew that someday I wanted to be an artist. As I grew up, I had loads of different ideas of how I\u0027d achieve that, and what kind of crazy, globe-trotting celebrity creative I\u0027d become. Then I found the theatre, and then the film industry, and those dreams got kind of shoved aside in lieu of a (mostly) steady paycheck, and at least a crumb of security.\u003cbr\u003eWell, a couple of years ago I stepped back and made a conscious decision to try to really make it work as a full-time artist. Since I\u0027m into so many different mediums, it\u0027s been tough finding a place for myself. I\u0027ve done freelance illustration, I got really hard into block printing for a while, I invested way too much personal energy into jewelry making (which I still love), I had a little success making miniature treehouses and plant art.... Long story short, I\u0027ve tried a lot of things, found them fun, but not completely rewarding in that way you want when you are going to put your entire life from there on into something.\u003cbr\u003eWell, about a year ago, I took a community adult school pottery class, and instantly fell in love with clay. Over the last year or so, I\u0027ve been more and more convinced that this was something I could not only be good at, but could enjoy enough to stick with for more than a couple of years. Making pots, planters, and tiles with my drawings and sculptures on them feels so natural and rewarding. Holding a finished piece of stoneware in my hands gives me a feeling of permanence and satisfaction that drawings, paintings, and more ephemeral sculptures don\u0027t. I love knowing that I could bury a piece in the ground, unwrapped or sealed, and maybe, if the fates align, and nobody builds a condo on that exact spot, it\u0027ll be discovered in 1,000 years by some future archaeologist to puzzle over. I could go on all day about my newfound love, but you don\u0027t want to hear that. Or maybe you do. Meet me for a beer and I\u0027ll talk your ear off about it.\u003cbr\u003e  So, here I am. Almost 40 years old, and just now deciding to leave the relative security of an industry I\u0027ve worked in for 15 + years, and try to make my way as a professional ceramic artist.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got lots of ideas, lots of time, and no money, so I\u0027ve come to Patreon to see if I can get the jumpstart I need to make this dream a reality. Like they say during NPR drive week, every little bit counts. I\u0027m going to do all sorts of cool donor rewards, and also the occasional donor giveaway where you have a chance to get something really special from my personal collection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me for what I hope will be a successful and fulfilling new chapter In my artistic story.",
