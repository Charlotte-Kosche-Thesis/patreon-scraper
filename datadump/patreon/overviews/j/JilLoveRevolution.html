Her family valued education and sent her to study at the prestigious L\u2019estonnac .  Her mother, Enriqueta, also loved the arts and inspired Jil enormously with her passion for the cinema. At the age of 16, Jil moved to Barcelona to learn film and acting. Two years later, she moved to Madrid. She worked as a dancer and public relations manager for a well-known club, where she had the opportunity to meet people in the entertainment industry. She was quickly   discovered by several photographers and talent agencies. She hosted several TV shows and appeared in a number of movie productions. In 2006, she moved to Los Angeles, California and began making her American dream into a reality.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eJil has lived all over Europe, North Africa and the western coast of the US but it is in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she found her spiritual center working as a nurse assistant at a hospice. It was here in 2012, when she wrote, produced, directed and acted in her first and most provocative film to date, Saving Isis. Jil has since produced, directed and written 4 movies and acted in 3.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eShortly after completing Saving Isis, her mother passed away.

On September 25, 2012, while still in Spain, she introduced her ARTivist social movement \u201cLove Revolution Now\u201d at the Madrid riots during a meeting of the Spanish Congress. She was channeling a divine force, praying half naked in front of the riot police. Cameras from all over the world immortalized the moment. She became instantly known everywhere for her action of peace and beauty. Ever since, Jil Love has been a non-stop Artivist, performing in the US and Europe. She founded her Love Revolution.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eJil LOVE REVOLUTION is an International Social movement which creates ARTivism, Art + Activism to raise awareness, motivate society and expand consciousness.
