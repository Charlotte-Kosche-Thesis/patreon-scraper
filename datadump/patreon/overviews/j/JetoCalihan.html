I blame Disney and anime cat girls personally. Then again I\u0027m a sucker for biology, and zoology in particular, so maybe it was inevitable.\u003cbr\u003eThat said I am studying Biology, but not zoology~ The degree I should have as of the start of 2017 will be a BS in molecular and cellular biology. Why? Because the central US doesn\u0027t offer bachelor\u0027s degrees in genetic engineering, hell I haven\u0027t even found a graduate program on the subject. And while you can blame Jurassic Park for igniting my desire to manipulate genes, I\u0027ll let you all ponder just what kept that flame going~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I create: \u003c/strong\u003eMy artwork is\u003cstrong\u003e 80% 18+ \u003c/strong\u003ework, that\u0027s sexual in nature. Of that 80%, \u003cstrong\u003e99.99%\u003c/strong\u003e has been furry while the remaining 20% has a \u003cstrong\u003e95%\u003c/strong\u003e furry concentration. It\u0027s not that I won\u0027t or can\u0027t draw humans or meme types, just that I wanted to get really good at the furry stuff and sorta lost my own interest in drawing them. So you\u0027ll pretty much only see skin around here if someone commissions me, but if you like fur you\u0027re in the right place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat all said, there are certain things you will never see me draw. Even for commission.\u00a0Some for are for moral objections and others are for hygienic; \"I would be too grossed out to work on the art\" reasons. So you\u0027ll never have to worry about me showing you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eScat, watersports, fart (though I may make fart jokes I suppose), pedophilia, rimming, diaper, death/gore (in sex. It may happen outside of intercourse for plot reasons), or hard/full digestion vore/absorption.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eOh, I should also mention most of my artwork is digital. I rarely do new traditional works simply because\u003cstrong\u003e I do not feel I am capable of coloring with traditional media forms, and I need to practice coloring in general as it is!\u003c/strong\u003e Like the newest traditional piece I\u0027ve done was a con badge for this yeah, and that was only colored because I did it \u003cstrong\u003eat the con\u003c/strong\u003e and so didn\u0027t even have access to a PC. But I do love a good solidly penciled bit of line-work, and I ficken love grey scale/sepia tone work, so you\u0027ll probably see new pieces of those sort from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in \u003cstrong\u003ecommissioning me\u003c/strong\u003e, you can see my prices \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/commissions/jetocalihan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eby clicking here\u003c/a\u003e. And if you have any questions or just want a quote on what your idea would cost to commission from me, you can private message me here or on any of my accounts listed below. The quotes are completely free, and I\u0027m open for commissions continuously.\u003cbr\u003eI am also accepting\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eart trades/collaborations\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and am open for \u003cstrong\u003erequests in the form of SAW topics.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Requests which I\u0027ll complete at my leisure. Just message me here or on any of those accounts below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyhow, if you can\u0027t afford to contribute any money I completely understand. I\u0027ve been in tight spots too and it sucks. Hell, I\u0027m in one now and will likely continue to be until I can find decent lab work once I\u0027ve finished undergrad. And the last thing I want to do is hide my art behind a paywall. The entire reason I do art is either to have a visual reference or more commonly to show other people my ideas! Sadly though we don\u0027t live in 2 Gryphon\u0027s utopia where furry porn can be legal tender, and food, shelter, and the connection I need to upload my art still cost legal tender. As such I do need some incentive to get people to actually become Patrons. As such the newest page of whatever comic I\u0027m currently drawing will be patreon exclusive, and certain sketches will be permanently exclusive to patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, regardless of whether you become a patron or not, I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to even consider supporting my works. It honestly means the world to me."

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003eNeed a con room/roommate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAssuming I can get to know you well enough we can room together at a con of your direct choosing (assuming nothing like work gets in the way of that con)! Or you can join any room I have previously set up so long as there is physical room. If not (with 7+ people) we will have to be able to get a second room. Otherwise this could be redeemable the day before the convention. Just ya know, tell me as soon as possible for better organizational purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ll be keeping track of how many redemption for this each person has, so if you just want to grab one and then back down to a more sustainable patron tier you can. You\u0027ll retain all of the rewards here that aren\u0027t upkeep like the two requests a month (you\u0027ll get the two for the month should you indulge, but the next month will be reset to your current level.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can also earn the hotel parts of this reward through proper friendship! And all that requires is the right personality and communication (via Skype or messaging on the art sites).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOr if you don\u0027t like/trust patreon patreon a direct tip to my paypal will do the trick. Link will be set up soon.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will also draw you a con badge (by the con if given time prior to it)! And that one is not your free art unless you want a digital painting badge. In that case alone it is both.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will not only have access to the room\u0027s booze, but will be encouraged to drink it (and yes, in my room there is always alcohol of some sort unless it\u0027s all been drunk!).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAssuming you have access to the devices required, you\u0027ll be able to keep in touch with me and hang out for the con\u0027s duration. We can go to lunch, panels, art jam, drink, ect.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOh, and you get all the rewards from the last highest tier too.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo be warned Though! While I\u0027m 100% okay with being the one on an air mattress should it come to that and I\u0027m pretty skilled about managing the room fees and scheduling and the like, I have two \"bad\" habits as a con room mate. \u003cbr\u003e1. I\u0027m an early riser, even after a late night. I\u0027m pretty sneaky about getting out, but I can not help how loud the shower is. And I don\u0027t shower at night when the room is still partying. that would be useless/redundant.  Also we will not room again if you clearly don\u0027t follow the 1 of 6-2-1.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e2. The room\u0027s AC will remain at 65\u00b0F or lower! Unless that incurs fees... This is because I melt at 70\u00b0F so gotta have them cool sleeping conditions.\u003cbr\u003eSo yeah! You have been warned about rooming with me!",
