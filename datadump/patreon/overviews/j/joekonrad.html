Every day over 100 people are lost to suicide. Your friends, your family, your coworkers. Most of the time we don\u0027t see it until it\u0027s too late. It\u0027s very easy to feel embarrassed about our mental health conditions. It\u0027s very easy to hide. We don\u0027t show it to you because we\u0027re afraid. We\u0027re afraid that we\u0027ll be judged. We\u0027re afraid that we\u0027ll lose our friends, the only support that we have sometimes. We\u0027re afraid that we\u0027ll get looked at as weak.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission is to drive suicide from this world, but I can\u0027t do it alone. I believe that by allowing everyone to feel peace, that we can create happiness from there and lessen the impact that depression and mental illness has on the world."
