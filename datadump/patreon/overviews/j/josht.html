    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Josh Tynjala, and I\u0027m the creator of open source projects like \u003ca href=\"https://feathersui.com/\"\u003eFeathers UI\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"https://as3mxml.com/\"\u003eActionScript \u0026amp; MXML extension for Visual Studio Code\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpen source has been a huge part of my career. In the past, I worked at Yahoo, and I helped build their open source \"Astra\" AS3 and Flex components. I also released a number of custom Flex components that I developed in my free time, like \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/joshtynjala/flextreemap\"\u003eflextreemap\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/joshtynjala/flexwires\"\u003eflexwires\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve even contributed to the compilers in \u003ca href=\"https://flex.apache.org/\"\u003eApache Flex\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://royale.apache.org/\"\u003eApache Royale\u003c/a\u003e to make them better! My best work comes from helping other developers get their projects done faster with high quality components and tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeathers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://feathersui.com/\"\u003eFeathers\u003c/a\u003e started out as simple mobile UI components that I needed for some casual games that I was developing with Adobe AIR for iOS and Android. This was before Stage 3D, when AIR on mobile was still brand new. When Stage 3D and Starling Framework were introduced, I redesigned those components to take advantage of the GPU, I open sourced them, and Feathers was born. Since then, it has expanded from simple buttons, toggle switches, sliders, and lists into a huge collection of components for building complete apps on mobile, desktop, and even smart TVs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons get look behind the scenes at the newest components and features coming to future versions of Feathers, as they\u0027re still in development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://nextgenactionscript.com/patreon/patreon-feathers@2x.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eActionScript/MXML in Visual Studio Code\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdobe no longer updates Flash Builder, and the latest version isn\u0027t particularly stable anymore. While ActionScript and MXML support continues to be maintained in IntelliJ IDEA, there hasn\u0027t been a lot of new development lately. Newer SDKs, like the Feathers SDK and Apache FlexJS, require special workarounds and extra configuration to work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I started working on an \u003ca href=\"https://as3mxml.com/\"\u003eActionScript \u0026amp; MXML language extension\u003c/a\u003e for Microsoft\u0027s popular \u003ca href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\"\u003eVisual Studio Code\u003c/a\u003e editor. I believe that it\u0027s now up to the community to ensure that we continue to have a modern development environment for ActionScript that supports all of the SDKs and features that we use today to build our projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://nextgenactionscript.com/patreon/patreon-vscode@2x.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I work on Feathers, my main editor is now Visual Studio Code. I use my extension every single day. Multiple developers contributing to \u003ca href=\"https://royale.apache.org/\"\u003eApache Royale\u003c/a\u003e use the extension to work on the Royale framework and components.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will support continued development of this VSCode extension, and I will share early previews of new features as they\u0027re still in development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo my projects help you out by saving you time and money?
