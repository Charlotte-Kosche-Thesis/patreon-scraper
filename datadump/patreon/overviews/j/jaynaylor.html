They can be about character, context, and personality-driven situations that make everything even more erotic in the end. That\u0027s what I strive to do, whether it\u0027s happy and charming, to dark and unsettling; I have a pretty broad range.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will be where I post just about everything for those who are willing to support my continued work, as well as be able to listen to and value the opinions of those who contribute. To start with, I intend to release every adult comic page I complete on Patreon, as I complete them. This usually comes out to about 2 full color pages per week, or 8 per month, sometimes more (this number may go up as my need to do commissions decreases). I also will be doing warm-up sketches, many of which are serialized in their own mini-stories, and posting them here, exclusively. As Patreon becomes more successful, it may free up my time to do more exclusives for contributors, like side comics for fun and illustrations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to listen to my contributors. When I finish projects, I always have a list of new stories I can work on, next. I will let contributors weigh in on what they\u0027d like to see next. I\u0027ll also listen to those who may wish to sway where my future warm up sketches go, and which characters get more \"development\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have three \"universes\" I work in:\u003cbr\u003eOriginal Life - Is a world just like our own, with the humans simply replaced by anthropomorphic animals.\u003cbr\u003eCottonwine - A fantasy world of furries, humans, elves, and other derivatives, with embellished sexual hedonism that continually threatens higher civilizations. There\u0027s no magic, no gods, but there\u0027s enough superstition for people to believe in them.\u003cbr\u003eLumpkinville - A straight-up cartoon universe set in the generic rural South, complete with humans, furries, witches, magic, spells, and anything and everything I feel like at the moment."
