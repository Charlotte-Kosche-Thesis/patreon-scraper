    "summary": "Hi, I\u00a0am so glad we found each other on this platform. I love to find creative ways to communicate about important messages. The barriers and challenges experienced by mothers are numerous and systemic, and thus, an important topic of conversation. I am moved to share knowledge and evidence-based information with mothers to offer a beacon of inspiration throughout this, at times, incredibly daunting journey. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMotherhood is hard work and from the moment a woman\u00a0decides to conceive or finds herself surprisingly pregnant, she enters into the world of motherhood and is faced with a barrage of information resulting in increased stressors and responsibilities that will forever change her life. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a mother, first and foremost, \u003cstrong\u003eI speak from the heart through lived experience\u003c/strong\u003e. However, I also bring to the mix 1\u003cstrong\u003e8-years of cumulative experience\u003c/strong\u003e as a childbirth advocate, student of midwifery, doula, childbirth educator, maternal mental health researcher, and therapist, with women-centered care and trauma-informed therapy guiding the way.
