    "summary": "Bonjourino. My name is \u003cstrong\u003eJacob\u003c/strong\u003e, and twice a year, I lurk in a bush for a day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are reading this, chances are that unless you are a fan of Reading FC and/or follow my Twitter, you have \u003cem\u003eabsolutely no idea\u003c/em\u003e what is going on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let me explain. Let me regale you with the tale of \u003cstrong\u003e#BushWatch\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs long as I can really remember, I\u0027ve followed the Royals (the football team, not Kate Middleton and company). God didn\u0027t bless me with a knack for playing football, but I\u0027d be damned if I couldn\u0027t watch it. And so, watch the Royals I did, over land and sea \u003cdel\u003eand Oxf*rd\u003c/del\u003e. If you cut me open, I\u0027d bleed blue and white hoops, though I\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast-forward over a decade - in September 2014, as a bored, bleary-eyed and unemployed youth, I decided to stake out the Madejski Stadium on Transfer Deadline Day for the very first time. \u003cstrong\u003eIn a bush\u003c/strong\u003e. I can\u0027t honestly tell you why. Maybe I felt a calling. Maybe I\u0027m just unhinged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, from that day forth, I became one with the #bush. And the beast that is #BushWatch was birthed kicking and screaming onto this mortal coil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, every January and every August/September, I\u0027ve acted as the eyes on the ground for the Reading FC mandem - bringing them \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive photos and a unique insight\u003c/strong\u003e into the final frenetic few hours of the football transfer window. The first face that any prospective new signings see is, unfortunately, my ugly mug. And then a camera lens. And then a shaking of a #bush.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust a small sample of my borderline-psychotic undertakings include\u003c/strong\u003e: borderline harassing Nigel Adkins and his family, watching Ola John being bundled into a black car, becoming best buddies with the Madejski hotel staff, memorising every wrinkle on Nick Hammond\u0027s face, developing squat-cramp, and making acquaintances with all those people kind enough to run me down food and coffee during my #BushWatch. Amongst other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn August 2016, after #BushWatch trended in 6th place on the Twittersphere, I somehow made \u003cstrong\u003enational news\u003c/strong\u003e - appearing on the Scott Mills show on BBC Radio 1. I later popped up on BBC Radio Berkshire (twice!), Jack FM, and Brum Radio. All of this, plus a peak audience of 4000 people watching #BushWatch live on Periscope, made it a memorable 24 hours indeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then in January 2017, with your support, we had our most successful and eventful #BushWatch to date. In a frenetic few hours, we scored photos of all three new Reading FC signings (with the help of our friends at GetReading, we caught Reece Oxford on live video!). #BushWatch also trended at \u003cstrong\u003e3rd spot\u003c/strong\u003e on Twitter in the UK, racked up \u003cstrong\u003e8000 total views\u003c/strong\u003e on Periscope, and featured once again on primetime \u003cstrong\u003eBBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 5live, in national news outlets\u003c/strong\u003e, and - bafflingly - \u003cstrong\u003ethe German press\u003c/strong\u003e. Yes, #BushWatch had somehow gone international.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLater in the year, to help raise money for the Royal Marsden cancer charity in memory of Eamonn Dolan, I auctioned a selection of #BushWatch-branded mugs and T-shirts. In doing so, we \u003cstrong\u003eraised \u00a3130\u003c/strong\u003e for one of Reading FC\u0027s most beloved servants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow, I need your help again - to take #BushWatch to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d love to expand what I do to produce \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e dedicated, high-quality #BushWatch videos and content, \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e consistently, and for \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e of the year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I\u0027m asking of you lovely people, with my tail between my legs, is: \u003cstrong\u003eif you feel you\u0027ve enjoyed my previous #BushWatches, and want to help build and ensure the future of #BushWatch, would you consider donating me a dollar* or two? \u003c/strong\u003eThink of it as a pat on the back\u003cstrong\u003e -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d really appreciate the gesture. \u003cem\u003e(*Patreon only deals in dollars apparently. For reference, $1 currently equals 77p)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf supporting #BushWatch is something you feel you want to do (\u003cem\u003eand I totally understand if you don\u0027t! I wouldn\u0027t either\u003c/em\u003e), then check out the exclusive rewards on the right-hand sidebar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace, love, and merry bushing,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob South-Klein\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
