I make messes and mistakes. I make babies - \u00a0in fact, I\u0027ve made five of them (my husband helped).  Recently I\u0027ve been writing a lot about what it\u0027s like to be the accidental matriarch of a family of seven over at my blog \u003ca href=\"http://www.lifeinthecircus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.lifeinthecircus.com\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublishing my blog has started a quiet revolution in my life. I am reminded that I have stories to share, that we ALL have stories to share, and that sharing those stories with each other builds connection and builds community. I\u2019m excited to bring that community here to Patreon, a wonderful platform designed to help artists and makers connect with people who want to support their creative endeavors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my posts I share wordy-bits about being a broke artist, married to a broke artist (my hubby is a theatre teacher). I write about navigating motherhood in the midst of that. I don\u0027t pull any punches. I write about the funny parts. I write about the tender parts. I write about the guilt plagued parts and the downright shitty parts. I share my whole truth, as much of it as I can, with the firmly held belief that telling our truths allows other people to tell their own truths. And truth telling is where it\u0027s at. The light of truth is where shame goes to die, and from that richly fertilized soil, connectedness, togetherness, forgiveness, and understanding bloom. This is the Garden of Eden, folks. This is the kingdom of heaven.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI will continue using words to make connections, as long as I think I have anything to offer, as long as I can, because connection is what I live for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat connection is what makes Patreon such a fabulous platform. It\u0027s just like in the days of old when artists, writers, and performers were supported by their very own patrons of the arts. Except now, thanks to democratization of the Internet, you don\u0027t have to be a gazillionaire to support the creators you love. You can have a real relationship, you can make a real difference, for just a couple bucks. It\u0027s like buying your favorite artist a beer. But better, because if enough people do it, it becomes so much more than just one beer. It becomes a powerful affirmation of support. It becomes a giant, \"Yes!!\" A giant, \"Yes, I value you. Yes, we are all connected. Yes, we are all together in this crazy thing called life and we belong to each other.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support allows me to support others, and that support branches out and grows like crabgrass until it carpets this garden. And then, all of us artists, and if you are living - \u00a0if you are \u003cem\u003emaking\u003c/em\u003e a life by stringing together moment after moment, make no mistake, you are an artist; all of us artists can look around this kingdom at each other, and say \"See what we have made! How great it is!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHow It Works\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s so simple.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou sign up to contribute a certain amount of money per post. It starts at $1. Every time I post a piece there\u0027s a tick mark in your account. At the end of the month, Patreon charges your credit card for the total. However, you can set a maximum per month. I tend to post 2-3 times a week. So let\u0027s say you\u0027re feeling super generous and you think \"$3 a post times 12 times a month, equals $36 a month. \u00a0I can do that!\" But what if I post 4 times a week this month? Well, if you\u0027ve set your monthly total to $36, it doesn\u0027t matter. I could post 100 times and you\u0027d still be contributing $36. Pretty lovely. And if you want to, you can cancel at any time. No strings attached. I promise I won\u0027t hound you and you\u0027ll always have my undying gratitude - after all, that\u0027s why it\u0027s \u003cem\u003eundying\u003c/em\u003e."
