    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eWell hello there. Thanks for stopping by :)\u003c/h4\u003e\nThese days when you can have all the music you want for free, it\u0027s pretty darn exciting to have folks like you who are willing to pay artists for the music they enjoy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is new for me but I\u0027m hopeful it will help me to continue doing what I (and, hopefully, you) love: making music. If this whole thing is overwhelming for you, and you know you wanna support me, consider becoming a $3 patron. This will get you a free copy of all the music I release, and it\u0027ll help me keep practicing, writing songs, and doing all the other stuff that has to happen in the background to keep the music coming.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat the heck is Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nIt works like this.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eStep 1:\u003c/strong\u003e You tell Patreon that you wanna support me by tipping me every month. The amount you tip is completely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eStep 2:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Once a month, Patreon will automatically charge all of my Patrons according to their settings, and tip me accordingly (deducting a small fee for themselves). (I will also create and share a video with you every month but Patreon would still charge you if I didn\u0027t)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eStep 3:\u003c/strong\u003e Repeat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOh, and depending on how much you\u0027re tipping, you get special fun rewards. Check the panel on the right for descriptions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHow often will you be releasing videos?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027ll post at least 1 video per month. Sometimes I\u0027ll release an extra. Probably never more than 2.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat\u0027s in store for 2017?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027m glad you asked. Here\u0027s what I\u0027m planning.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eRelease 1 self-produced solo EP (4ish songs) and 1 full ensemble, full-length album (8ish songs)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eRelease at least 1 but hopefully 2 new videos every month. These will be a mix of originals and covers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWrite at least 1 new song every month.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePractice a lot! I am constantly working on being a better pianist, guitar player, vocalist, improviser, songwriter, and a bunch of other stuff.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePlan a 2018 tour across the US and Europe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
