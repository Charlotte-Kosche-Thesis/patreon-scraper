I have some really exciting plans for the future and I\u0027m asking you to be a part of it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBackstory: \u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI decided to pursue music again back in 2012. \u00a0That was when I decided to leave my 8+ years of employment at Eileen Fisher in NYC to focus on why I had moved up in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first few years were honestly a lot of making up for lost time. \u00a0I learned sooooo much--and some of those lessons were uncomfortable. \u00a0Part of that was learning I had walked away from financial security in a time when the value of music had drastically changed. \u00a0But that didn\u0027t stop me from self-releasing my third record \"Held Momentarily\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter moving to Nashville in 2015 a few months later, things started falling into place around songwriting for me. \u00a0I started a songwriting club in early 2016, which led to me writing 28 new songs in just over a year, frequent airplay on WXNA\u0027s Soul of the City, a new podcast (The Hexagon), and several shows in and around Nashville.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have a bunch of great new songs that I\u0027m eager to share with you, and several of you have asked at shows \"When will you release these songs\"...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I remembered that I had seen some creative friends using this website...and realized that we could build something together--you and I. \u00a0I can share with true fans what I\u0027m working on, what\u0027s going on with the podcast...and I\u0027m starting to release my new project \"Steady Drip\" one song at a time, starting January 2018...and you\u0027ll get early and exclusive access.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me on this journey. \u00a0My appreciation for your partnership is boundless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJesse"
