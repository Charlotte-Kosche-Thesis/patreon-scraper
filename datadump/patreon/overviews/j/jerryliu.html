    "summary": "First off, thank you all for your continued support on YouTube (and elsewhere)! I have not used Patreon much, but I will devote a lot more time in 2018 to interacting with my patrons. My goal in life is to keep encouraging thought and discourse. As YouTube makes it harder and harder to challenge the status quo, I will have to devote more time to finding alternate sources of shekels. As a token of appreciation, I will use Patreon as a place for to show pictures and videos that non-Patrons cannot see on YouTube. You can also request topics here if you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who haven\u0027t seen my channel, I talk about relationships, gender, evolutionary psychology, history, but most importantly, I have lots of very in-depth discussions with a variety of people from many disciplines. My goal is for my audience to learn and think. I also analyze the issues that men face in modern 21st century Western society. Special issues that I cover include the Men\u0027s Rights and the Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) movement. Having lived in both China and America, I\u0027ve been raised by two cultures, speak two distinct languages, and have witnessed the effects of political ideologies on people. Having no real male role-model my whole childhood also has had a profound impact on me. I flexed my brain in high school and attended the prestigious University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. There, I took classes in Psychology, Political Science, Economics, Philosophy, and History. Having the life experiences and the academic studies, I would like to lend a Chinese-American voice to the various issues that confound, confuse, and excite people from all walks of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a lighter note, I also share embarrassingly funny stories, life-hacks (if you can call them that) and do standup.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for inspiring me. Without you, I wouldn\u0027t be doing what I\u0027m doing!\u00a0The more support I get, the more I will analyze, research, poke fun of, and make higher quality information-dense content.\u003cbr\u003e"
