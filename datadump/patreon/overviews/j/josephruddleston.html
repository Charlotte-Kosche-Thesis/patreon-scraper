Let me tell you what I\u0027m doing here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write and record songs, hopefully with the kind of honesty I believe artists and fans deserve and ought to share. So, you\u0027ll be seeing a lot of songs being posted here first and foremost, before any other platform online. And, being a Patron, you\u0027ll be able to experience my world as a songwriter/musician from an intimate, unedited perspective. As I update you on my songwriting path, I\u0027ll be talking a lot about a lo-fi bedroom-folk project by the name of \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO MEMORIE\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003c/em\u003ewhich recently released a self-titled album available to all Patrons. So, expect a totally in-depth glimpse at the work going into each release long before the general public. As well as project updates, I\u0027ll be getting you involved in songwriting workshops, instrument tutorials, private Q\u0026amp;As and much, much more. So there\u0027s something for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, what your much-appreciated patronage can do for me is help me carry out projects like \u003cem\u003eO\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eMEMORIE\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and share the songstories around. I\u0027d love to be able to distribute 1000s of CDs and vinyls with an elaborate collection of text and images to make listeners feel fully involved in the music experience, and your patronage can do exactly that. Whats more, the contents of these CDs and vinyls will be available in updates featured here on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you truly. Thank you so much for getting this far.\u00a0I really believe that artists are only as good as the people that support them.
