Patreon offers us a unique opportunity to connect as creator \u0026amp; patron, to combine a small amount of your funds (as little as $1/month) with a great deal of my passion \u0026amp; experience to create an ever evolving body of paintings, drawings, and illustrations that inspire a light in the hearts and minds of those experiencing them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I hope to share lots of behind-the-scenes information regarding the process of creating two-dimensional works of art in a variety of media. I will share process photos and videos, time-lapses to see the overall development of pieces, and I am excited to delve deeper into other ways to share these things with you. Please let me know what types of content inspires you most and that you\u0027d like to see more of, I am happy to share.\u00a0The spirit of the artistic community is nothing short of magic, and the more we pass around our lessons, the more the body of knowledge grows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e______\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome with me on a visual exploration through the mythos \u0026amp; mystery, cosmology \u0026amp; philosophy of Earth\u0027s multitudinous cultures from Past, Present, and Future. On this journey I hope to inspire within each viewer the opportunity to ask questions of themselves \u0026amp; others regarding who and what we are, both individually and collectively, and where we go from here. The alchemical process of painting affords abundant opportunity for insight - I can only hope that my visions can invoke new perspectives, questions, and opportunities for growth in others as they have for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
