    "summary": "I make (mostly) daily videos are about a a guy who has set off on a cycle adventure from China to the USA on a recumbent 3 wheel trike all the while trying to check off his bucket list items along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already completed a Everest summit expedition, gotten hit by a truck on a lonely Chinese highway, ran marathons in North Korea and traveled around China and Southeast Asia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI built this whole project around my mantra, JaYoe. \u00a0It\u0027s a play on an existing Chinese phrase \u52a0\u6cb9, which means \"to add fuel\". \u00a0I\u0027m trying to add fuel to my life and the lives around me thru inspiring acts of adventure and travel. \u00a0Up until now I have self funded my tour and video production, but with over 400 VLOG episodes to date and a bunch of video projects coming, I figured it was time to ask for communal help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live in an amazing world, where independent artists and filmmakers can produce their own product which can entertain, inform and inspire people all over the world. \u00a0And they can do this with all the drive and determination of someone at the helm of their own ship. \u00a0But most of us don\u0027t have a studio paying us for our service. \u00a0We do it because we are passionate. \u00a0We enjoy it. \u00a0It drives us. \u00a0But often times passion projects like this do not get the requisite return on investment, and this forces us to try to pay the bills with a lesser option while sacrificing the quality of our true passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess what I am saying is if you have been entertained, informed or inspired by my videos, I invite you to join the JaYoe Nation. \u00a0By giving whatever you can afford to give, you will be helping support my efforts to create, and help me to focus on the things that I love.\u00a0 In turn, I can continue to deliver to the best possible quality videos and interactions with the world as I travel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry. \u00a0If you don\u0027t want to give, cannot afford or don\u0027t like me that much, I\u0027m totally OK with that too. \u00a0I still love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the way, if you are wondering what JaYoe means and the message that drives me... i made this little video to help you understand!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4m7t4Vt1Ir8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
