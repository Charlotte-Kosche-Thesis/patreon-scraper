    "summary": "Born and raised in Waynesburg PA Americana/ country/rock singer/songwriter Jackson Gardner picked up a guitar at the age of 14. Gardner proceeded to teach himself the craft of playing guitar and writing songs. While spending countless hours every day listening to a vast variety of artists from Waylon Jennings to Jimi Hendrix, he allowed these inspirations to mold his process. \u201cI was raised on Country music \u2018the good stuff\u2019 like Waylon, Strait, Haggard but I always had a deep love for rock and blues or any music that contained great guitar players and songwriters. I was and am still drawn to music made by artists that create and perform from a place of true conviction and I hold myself to that same standard. Truth is key\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJackson has made a habit of breaking the mold most artists are squeezed into. This habit has helped him develop a style of writing and performing that bridges genres and challenges the status quo. \u201cI\u0027m not sure what genre my music fits in. At the end of the day I don\u2019t care what it\u2019s called, I just do what feels right.  What\u2019s in a name anyway? As long as its real and honest it doesn\u2019t matter to me\u201d"

A lot of the songs in this tier will be acoustic work tapes (these are the first versions recorded of the songs immediately after they are written. These are usually done on a phone or a very simple demo).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALSO you\u0027ll get early access to any full production recordings. I will post any and all full production songs whether they make the album or are a b-side as soon as the master tracks are complete. B-side recordings that do not make the album will only be available to patrons in this tier and up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso this tier will admit you to a private concert held once a year for Patrons only.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a full time songwriter I am constantly creating songs that may never be heard by anyone. I wanted to stop this cycle. What if someone needs to hear one of those songs? I know the impact of hearing the right song at the right time that is why I am doing this. No more secret songs. No more waiting. If I write a song I will post it as soon as I possibly can. Only patrons subscribed will be able to access this catalog. Some months there will be 20 plus songs added and others maybe 2 or 3. But if I write a song I will upload it. Even the funny, ridiculous tunes I write when I\u2019m bored.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will create more tiers down the road with more rewards but for now I wanna start with just getting you music.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for your support please share with your friends and send feedback!\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Jackson\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e",
