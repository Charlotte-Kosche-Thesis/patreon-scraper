    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jen Digate and I am an animal trainer, a writer and a teacher. For the last seventeen years I have made my living helping people \nobserve and train their dogs both in-home for behavior issues and in my own group classes for companion dog training. I am a certified behavior consultant canine (CBCC-KA) and live with fifteen dogs in my home. \u003cbr\u003e For the last seven years, I have intensively studied \nhorse training in the positive reinforcement paradigm with an emphasis on emotional regulation and non-traditional routes to essential skills. My work includes taming and starting untouched adult mustangs, starting young horses under saddle and learning biomechanics to help horses carry themselves in safe and healthy postures. I have seven horses of my own, four mustangs, two Friesian crosses and a spanish mustang cross who are my partners in this work. I was an inaugural member of \u003ca href=\"http://www.clickertraining.com/clickerexpo/portland/bios#Jen\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClicker Expo\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e first horse curriculum in 2016 and just finished my second year at \u003ca href=\"http://www.clickertraining.com/clickerexpo/session-details#Stallion\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClicker Expo Portland\u003c/a\u003e where I presented on both horse and dog training. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I do? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I write two blogs: \u003ca href=\"https://spellboundhorses.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpellbound \u003c/a\u003e(horse training) and \u003ca href=\"http://Hesper in School\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHesper in School\u003c/a\u003e (dog\n training). Through each blog, I chronicle in-depth my training progression with \nmy animals, explaining concepts, mechanics, emotional thresholds and my \ndecision process, as well as their personal stories. I include video to illustrate the process more fully. Through these blogs I aim to make learning to train more accessible to everyone regardless of location and monetary resources. \u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I have just begun making monthly \"Try this at home\" videos that pull directly from what I am working on here with my own dogs and horses. The videos demonstrate related behaviors and exercises that you will be able to teach at home to your own animals, which will allow you to learn and build your own training repertoire. The videos will provide clear, directed learning for readers and the accompanying blog will explore concepts on a deeper level. Currently, I write both blogs in addition to running my own training business and managing a farm of fifteen dogs and twelve horses. It\u0027s a lot, and I\u0027d love to make blogging and content creation a more primary pursuit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will your patronage contribute to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to travel much deeper into my work and create even more substantial, in-depth blogs and video instruction. In addition, over the next two years, I will be working on creating a deep foundation-level course for both horses and dogs (individually). The courses will combine essential skills with a deeper look into emotional thresholds and behavior for dogs, and emotional thresholds and basic biomechanics for horses. These courses will set people up to both have a solid essential skill set with their horse or dog AND help them develop knowledge about behavior through the very exercises they are teaching their learners. In this way, we can grow together as a community, and no matter where you are located, you can join the science-based, positive reinforcement training community. With everyone\u0027s support, I will be able to pursue this work as a long-term, creative effort, moving toward longer and more enduring forms, like recorded seminars, short courses on individual subjects and books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining me on this journey; I look forward to our conversations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
