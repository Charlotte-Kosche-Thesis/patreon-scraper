    "summary": "Film \u0026amp; TV have always been something I have been passionate about and now we live in a day and age where sharing that passion for the things we love has become such an integral part of our culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter being influenced by people like The Angry Video Game Nerd, The Blockbuster Buster and even guys like Jeremy Jahns and Chris Stuckmann. I decided to begin my journey as a YouTube reviewer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s never been the easiest of roads but with my video reviews, I\u0027ve always tried to keep them simple, direct and to the point but in more of an old fashioned way without an expensive camera or expensive lighting. Now I\u0027ve decided to join Patreon to hopefully bring you guys some better content in the near future and if you can help me reach that goal. I promise to do the best I can for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow what is the point of this Patreon page for such a small YouTuber such as me? Well with your help and requests, in return for your support I aim to fulfill your requests to review whatever DC TV, Marvel Netflix or Doctor Who episode of your choice. As well as whatever movie you wish me to review and also feature Vlog videos on occasion about things in my daily life. All videos will be completed unedited and unscripted, very similar to the way I used to do my videos in the beginning, no quick edits or footage used. Just me talking directly to you guys, my Patreons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook forward to seeing you on the other side!\u003cbr\u003eJames\u003cbr\u003e"
