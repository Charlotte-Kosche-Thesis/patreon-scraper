    "summary": "Well...\u003cbr\u003eFor those who know me, you would know this was not an easy decision to join Patreon. I have always believed that the Artist deserves reward for their talents, but not necessarily to go on platform to beg for it. But, I guess in this day and age, this is not begging, but simply asking if you enjoy what I do, what I provide, and would like more, would you be so inclined to help me continue this work, as I first do what I do musically for God, myself and ultimately for you and to leave a thumbprint on the world...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, even though making music has become much more simple these days, it still does cost quite a tidy sum to make \"quality\" sounding music! And, with technology now, unfortunately the artist releases something, and its put up for free and people have forgotten that we, those who make art for the masses to enjoy deserve to be paid for their time giving to the world. Now, don\u0027t get me wrong! I am not talking about becoming wealthy or rich! I am not even about making a nice living off of my art. But, it shouldn\u0027t be passed around for free either! At the very least, some bread for the day so I can continue the strength for the next journey, and so on... If that makes any sense...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what is my goal? To be able to make music for YOU! I want to be able to record and release music for those who are part of this network that belongs to YOU! Even if its 10, 100, 500 people at max, for less than the average person spends at Starbucks, or Peet\u0027s, or McDonalds in a month, you can help an artist that you have admired, been inspired by, or as many letters and emails to me over the years have stated that my music helped you through some difficult times! This is your time to continue this, so that those that are inspired, touched and even emotionally healed as music certainly can do, can continue to be such!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I were indeed to state why I feel I go through the trials of life, and write about them in my music. The joy and the pain, the suffering and the pleasure, the tears and the smiles, if it can help someone out there not to feel alone in these struggles and to help bring hope, then I believe my purpose if fulfilled...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I am not looking for a living... I am not looking for you to be my sole benefactor! I simply want to be able to continue to bring the art that you have stated you love so much and have expressed gratitude for, well, simply put to help me financially continue to bring it to you, and the world that will listen...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJPBII"
