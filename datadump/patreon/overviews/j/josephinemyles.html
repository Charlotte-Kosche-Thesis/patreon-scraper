    "summary": "Hello, lovely people! I expect you\u0027d like to know why I\u0027m setting up a Patreon account?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst up, I\u0027m a writer of gay (that\u0027s male/male) romance fiction. Often extremely filthy romance fiction, with a good dollop of humour thrown in for good measure. I have a backlist now of over a dozen novels and novellas, along with heaps of short stories (\u003ca href=\"http://josephinemyles.com/published-stories/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e check them all out on my website\u003c/a\u003e!). All are available as ebooks, most as paperbacks, and I\u0027m hoping to get them all into audiobook format too over the next few years. I originally worked with digital publishers, but have gradually made the move to self-publishing as more and more digital publishers bite the dust. On the plus side, that does mean I now have creative and administrative control over my entire backlist, even if it does mean more time spent doing the \"boring bits\" of publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://josephinemyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/The-Hot-Floor-433x650.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, after a\u00a0year of juggling looking after a toddler with getting all my Samhain backlist self-published after they closed doors, I\u0027m now in the unenviable position of having very little royalty income and no new titles in the pipeline (unless you count the m/m sci-fi novel I originally wrote as a serial on my blog years ago, which I am currently editing into an ebook). Quite frankly, a little bit of regular income would be absolutely smashing and make a huge difference to my ability to start \u003cstrong\u003e\"Project Backlist Audiobook\"\u003c/strong\u003e (needs a snappier title!) along with providing the funds to help me self-publish my next book. Self-publishing does require a hefty chunk of funds upfront\u00a0for cover art, professional content editing and copy editing, all of which I insist on to help ensure I\u0027m putting out the very best books I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my first planned audiobook, once I raise enough money:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://josephinemyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/HTTYD-433x650.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut more than simply a financial incentive, I want to get involved with Patrons because I\u0027m one of those writers who thrives on a deadline. I used to find my motivation to write from having publisher deadlines, but since I don\u0027t really want to get involved with publishers again (I\u0027ve been burned too many times now) I need somebody else to hold me accountable and spark my inspiration. I crave that regular interaction with fans of my writing, and I\u0027d love to get your feedback on works in progress as well as your suggestions on what I should write next. I\u0027m going to need all this extra motivation to keep my word count up when child #3 arrives in May 2018!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I want to give something to all of you, too. Writing can be a lonely pursuit and it makes all the difference to know that you have people cheering you on. So I want to say thank you for that by providing you with all kinds of goodies, in the form of my new ebooks free for all Patrons, and exclusive new fiction before anyone else sees it along with opportunities to give feedback on my work in progress for the Patrons on higher tiers. Should anyone go for the highest level of support there\u0027s also the opportunity for me to take you on a guided tour of my book locations in either Bath or Bristol if you happen to be visiting the area. I\u0027ll even take you out for tea and biscuits! Or a pie and a pint if that\u0027s more your thing :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://josephinemyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ScrewingtheSystem-433x650.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m thoroughly grateful to everyone who supports my writing, and I want to give you all the very best gay romance fiction I\u0027m able to wring out of my brain. I\u0027m confident that interacting with you all here will be a motivating force for me and enable me to get back into that regular writing habit I really miss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and why the biscuits? Well, I\u0027m British, aren\u0027t I?! There are few things that say British quite like dunking a biscuit in a milky cup of tea ;-) (disclaimer: I will not be able to send you all biscuits. Sorry!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig hugs,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJo x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://josephinemyles.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejosephinemyles.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS, as I\u0027m new to this please bear with me if I need to make small adjustments to the reward tiers during the first few months. Don\u0027t worry: I promise I will always honour the reward you signed up for that month, and keep you all updated if I do make any changes. Rewards are more likely to improve than not!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePPS: please feel free to give me any feedback (even critical) on what I\u0027m offering here. I want to make this work well for everyone involved, so would love your suggestions on how to improve things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePPPS: the small print- I will send out physical and virtual rewards once your payment has cleared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eBiscuit image credits: Rich Tea by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Xyrael\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Sean Whitton\u003c/a\u003e, Ginger Nut by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/_rq/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e JaredZammit\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0PInk Wafer by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pilettes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Pilettes\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0Shortbread Round by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Hortensja_Bukietowa\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Hortensja Bukietowa\u003c/a\u003e, Bourbon by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Yes.aravind\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Aravind Sivaraj\u003c/a\u003e, Chocolate Digestive by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesrbowe/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e James Bowe\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eAll biscuit images are shared under\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e CC licences\u003c/a\u003e and all are unaltered from the originals, except for cropping of\u00a0the shortbread round and chocolate digestive, and colour adjustment of the pink wafer.
