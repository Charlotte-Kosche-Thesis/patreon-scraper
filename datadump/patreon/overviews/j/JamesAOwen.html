    "summary": "Simply put, I\u0027m on Patreon because this platform will allow me to share more of my work, with more of my readers, more often than ever before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always created stories with both Words \u0026amp; Pictures, and those stories have been enjoyed by thousands of readers all over the world. For most of the last decade, my work has been primarily writing (and illustrating) the \u003cem\u003eChronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica\u003c/em\u003e series of novels. Before that, I had worked mainly in comics, writing and illustrating the series \u003cem\u003eStarChild\u003c/em\u003e, and one of the biggest differences between the two is that it often takes one or two years (or more) for a single book to be published, whereas with comics, the work was able to be published and go on sale far more quickly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love books, but I also love the speed and flexibility of periodicals. And while I want to create much more work in both mediums, I also have to find ways to make a living while continuing to create new work. The changes in the publishing industry have made publishing books through smaller imprints much easier to do, so they can be released much more quickly than the books published by the larger companies. And the opportunities afforded by social media and online networking mean that I can publish things like the \u003cem\u003eTwentieth Anniversary Essential StarChild\u003c/em\u003e hardcover, and even a series of coloring books, by using platforms such as Kickstarter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Kickstarter is best suited to single projects \u2013 and I wanted to find some way to give new art, and stories, and glimpses into works-in-progress to my readers on an ongoing basis, while still figuring out a way to pay (and be paid) for it all. And that is EXACTLY what Patreon is designed to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Project\u003c/h4\u003eI am creating new work all the time, and some of the current projects include: my magnum opus, the illustrated series \u003cem\u003eFool\u0027s Hollow\u003c/em\u003e; new \u003cem\u003eImaginarium Geographica\u003c/em\u003e stories, including a graphic novel co-written with Kristin Leigh Luna; \u003cem\u003eMapping the Imagination\u003c/em\u003e, a book of annotations to the IG series; the conclusion to my series \u003cem\u003eMythWorld\u003c/em\u003e, and the graphic novella spinoff \u003cem\u003eObscuro\u003c/em\u003e; additions to my nonfiction trilogy \u003cem\u003eThe Meditations\u003c/em\u003e; my personal project, the best Superman story ever told in the comics; the middle grade series \u003cem\u003eCalliope Steem\u003c/em\u003e, co-written with Kevin J. Anderson; \u003cem\u003eThe Magic Makers\u003c/em\u003e, an anthology of illustrated short fiction co-edited with Joshua Essoe, and featuring stories illustrated by me and written by friends of mine like Terry Brooks and Peter S. Beagle; and much, much more. I\u0027ve been busy, and I want to stay busy creating great work for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this work exists in my Studio in one stage or another until publication, and most of it can be shared: I love to show my working process, and I love showing finished pieces of work yet to be published to you, my best fans, readers, and Patrons. I\u0027ve shown a lot of in-progress work on my facebook page, and elsewhere on the net, but that has never really been very satisfying to me. I\u0027m a reader and collector myself, and the books and periodicals I cherish most are always close at hand. There\u0027s something about the form and feel of the books that makes them more accessible to me And I want to do that for YOU with EVERYTHING I\u0027m working on now, and in the future. So what I want to do is ask for your support to create more Words \u0026amp; Pictures, and in return, that\u0027s EXACTLY what I\u0027m going to give you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWords \u0026amp; Pictures\u003c/em\u003e will be a 48-page periodical which I am hoping to publish six times per year, and it will consist of chapters-in-progress, art, stories, comics, photos, and anything else that I think will be fun to include. It will be the best of my efforts, from every project I\u0027m working on, along with a few special projects with some amazing collaborators. Each issue will be around 48 pages, but some might be larger (and some may be smaller), depending on what\u0027s been completed for the new books. There will be a pdf version of each issue first, but the main goal is to have a beautiful print version, so that these issues can be collected and cherished. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e What\u0027s in it for YOU\u003c/h4\u003eThe print version will have the same high standard of production and design quality as every other book Coppervale has produced, and will have the look and feel of limited-edition chapbooks. I wanted to reach \u2013 and hopefully maintain \u2013 a specific monthly goal in order to produce the pdf of \u003cem\u003eWords \u0026amp; Pictures\u003c/em\u003e on a bi-monthly schedule, and then hold off on doing the print editions until a larger threshold was crossed...but we\u0027re going to make them happen anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery Patron supporting this at the $5 level and above will get a PDF of each issue. Patrons at the $10 level will recieve both the PDF AND the print editions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a project created FOR my best fans, supported and made possible BY my best fans. And I am very grateful for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"

     "goal_text": "Because I have decided we can produce the print edition alongside the PDFs, I have changed our goals from financial ones to community ones. Not everyone who wants to support my work can pledge at any level, but every supporter is valued. So I chose a number that represents some of the goals I had early in my career: 245. That was the limitation number I set for my limited-edition books and prints. I believe a good man with a few dedicated supporters can do great things. I believe someone with the support of many supporters can do impossible things. And I believe, that with the support of just 245 people, who help hold me up and propel me forward month after month, I can reshape the world and make awesome things happen \u2013 and together, we will do just that.\u003cbr\u003e",
