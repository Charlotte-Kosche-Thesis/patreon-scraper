I\u0027ve been a professional author since 2007,\u00a0and have had over twenty novels published in that time, as well as a wealth of shorter fiction pieces, including short stories, novellas and the occasional audio script, some of which was for Games Workshop\u0027s Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy licensed fiction lines.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://joshuamreynolds.wordpress.com/works/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u0027s a full list of what I\u0027ve written and where you can find it, if you\u0027re interested\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0grew up in South Carolina,  a place where hoodoo is still regularly practised. Where vampire-trees are marked with witch-sign and where soul-bottles are hung from branches. Where people paint their houses blue to keep out hungry ghosts and never burn wood from a tree where someone\u0026#8217;s been hanged. I now live in England, which, if M.R. James is to believed, has more ghosts than roundabouts, and England\u0027s got a LOT of roundabouts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn retrospect, my chosen vocation is probably unsurprising.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that vocation is the reason this profile exists. I like writing stories. Stories involving monsters, secret societies, Charles Fort, ghosts, Pinkertons, monsters, the Royal Occultist, career-criminals, alternate earths, Sherlock Holmes, time-travel, eldritch horrors, time-travelling eldritch horrors, occult investigators, super-detectives, monsters, movies, Dracula, true romance, and monsters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid I mention monsters? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said, I like writing stories. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t get to write as many of them as I might like these days, given my schedule. So, as a full-time author, Patreon support will enable me to write more short stories. Short stories which you will then get to read. Supporters will get to read a previously unpublished story by me on an irregular basis, before anyone else. The irregular bit is why I\u0027m keeping the reward small and story-centric for the moment, though that might change in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may also offer up some previously published, but currently out-of-print, short stories, or even a serialised novel, along and along. But for the moment, my focus is on new short stories of various lengths. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to sample some of my work before laying down your hard-earned cash, check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://joshuamreynolds.wordpress.com/works/free-fiction/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis page full of links to all sorts of free fiction\u003c/a\u003e, and see if anything strikes your fancy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how about it? Feel like helping me pay some bills?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
