     "description": "If the total of monthly pledges reaches $600 or higher I will begin a Patron only Choose Your Own Adventure series, in which Patrons will be able to vote in order to guide a character through a new scenario every couple of months (with updates a minimum of once a week). It could be an adventurer navigating an ancient dungeon, or a space traveller exploring a distant world. Whatever the setting, expect twists and turns aplenty along the way! \u003cbr\u003e",
