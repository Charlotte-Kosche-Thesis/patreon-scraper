    "summary": "My name is JR Butler and I am an artist in Siler CIty, North Carolina. My goal is to raise funds to produce public art for the enrichment and enjoyment of the people of Siler City, and also to promote its growth and development economically, culturally and socially, I would like to use my artistic sensibilities to improve properties in need of a facelift through the implementation of public art projects such as murals and sculpture. I envision this initiative as being a collaboration between myself, the community and the town government.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLocal works I have completed are the Chatham Rabbit mural and the Diversity mural, both found at 143 North Chatham Avenue in Siler City. Working on these projects made me realize that my love of public art could benefit the economic development of Siler City. \u00a0Raising funds on Patreon will give me the ability to make this passion the focus of my art career while giving back to the community. Your donation will go do directly to purchasing materials and allowing me to work on these projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your interest and support. I think that the\u00a0community \u00a0of Siler City and I both have great potential and this could help realize that potential for myself as an artist, and for SIler City as a burgeoning art destination."
