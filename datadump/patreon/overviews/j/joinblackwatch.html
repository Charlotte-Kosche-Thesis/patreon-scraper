    "summary": "Blackwatch is one of the only Overwatch Communities on Facebook that prides itself on having a tight-knit, non-toxic community. It was founded in 2016 and\u00a0has grown to 35,000+ members where they can come together from around the world to find teammates, discuss tactics, and share fan content that ranges from video clips, live streams, to fan art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the group creator, I oversee a moderating team of over 10 people that spans several countries and international time zones. Our team handle community guidelines, conflicts, and promotion of the community store and Discord Server, which is home to 2,000+ members. We orchestrate online events like tournaments, movie nights, biggest loser competitions, and karaoke nights, as well as in-person meet ups at LANs and Conventions... \u003cem\u003eand we do all of this for free and any giveaways come out of our own pockets.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI would love to be able to give back more frequently to the community that has taken up such a big part of my heart and my life\u003c/strong\u003e and will be seeing how I can expand more upon this with goals as we receive Patrons (hopefully!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA large portion of our time is taken over by overseeing community post approvals and server channels for appropriate content and regulating member requests in addition to moderating comment sections. We do what we can to create an environment where people feel safe and included, especially in a gaming community, where this can be quite hard to achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been honored to be selected for Facebook User Research Sessions for being one of the most active Gaming Groups on the social media platform, with an average of 380,000 posts, comments, and reactions per month and over 22,000 active members and incredibly active administrators and moderators,with three of our admins being invited to Facebook Only Admin groups to help our group run as smoothly as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I dislike asking for money, many people have asked us to give them a way to give back to us, so we figured we would start by asking for donations to help afford keeping members excited to interact with the group and the server through continued giveaways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e will go towards giveaways for members and Patrons of BW!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile there may not be any substantial rewards\u00a0right now, a sincere thanks to those who donate as you\u0027re helping us stay motivated and afford future giveaways (and shipping of those giveaways!) to members and Patrons.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*We will be working on rewards and seeing if we can connect with some of the artists in the group. At current, we are only able to offer roles, lounge, and Private Voice channels with direct access to mods/admins as rewards but there will be other stuff in a future update (no timeline at the moment!) \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**If you cancel and we don\u0027t receive the pledged donation, we will remove access/roles from the server and will not send out future rewards (for said persons)."
