    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m Jake munro and I\u0027m a daily vlogger, musician and gamer. My daily life is pretty much consumed by creating content of various kinds for YouTube. I go on adventures to exciting and fun places around Northern Ireland with my drone, camera and an inquisitive attitude. I also play guitar and sing in a metal band that will soon touring and lastly, I do a comedy gaming channel that posts daily videos of deep conversations, crass humour and gamer rage over gameplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As you can imagine, doing and sustaining all of this content is pretty expensive, especially considering that this is already my full time job. That\u0027s right, content creation for YouTube is my occupation and I couldn\u0027t be more thankful and lucky to be able to do this everyday. But to be able to keep doing what I\u0027m doing and to progress as a content creator of music, vlogging and gaming I need the amazing support of you guys to help get me where I need to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As I\u0027m still new to the music scene as a performer I need to gather the equipment and pay for a few self funded tours, travel, music videos and merch to be able to make it my own self sustaining career. But because I\u0027m a daily vlogger, anything I accomplish as a musician will be will be intimately shared with all of you. So whether you want to pledge $1 or $1,000, everything will be greatly appreciated. So thank you for reading this and thank you for watching my content, I\u0027ll see you guys in my next video and remember; You can have a great day if you just make it a great day..."
