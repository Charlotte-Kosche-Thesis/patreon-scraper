When it came out, I got a surprise, though. You see, when I turned in work at school, I didn\u0027t waste time writing my entire name. I used just my initials, but with big periods in between.  Like \u0027o\u0027s.  So, when my poem was published, it was credited to JoWo.  And that was it.  Henceforth, my art and writing was signed JoWo.  When I got married, I changed my last name and became JoWoSo.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, now you know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patrons will help me do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe angels and demons in my head provide the fodder, the materials that I work with. \u00a0You can help me by becoming my patron. \u00a0Help me help them. \u00a0Through Patreon, when you fund my art and writing, you allow me to produce more work, more updates, more feathered angels with halos and horned demons with a sharp bite. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will be helping me take this to the next level, reaching a wider market, making more connections and getting my work in front of more people. \u00a0You will be helping me buy supplies, gas up my car, and get groceries. \u00a0I might even be able to pay it forward and help other struggling artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy inner angels and demons need me to express them in paint, graphite, and the written word.  In order to do this, I need time, and time is what I seem to be running out of. \u00a0With your support, I can continue to manically, restlessly create, giving voice to those beings from within.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re unfamiliar with how Patreon works, here\u0027s a quick overview. \u00a0You become my patron by choosing how much to contribute each month. This will place you in a reward level. It\u0027s called a reward level because you do actually get something for your contribution! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the level you choose, you will get access to digital images of my artwork, poetry, short stories, and, at the highest level, a solid, hold-it-in-your-hand reward. \u00a0\"Access\" means you can print them, use them for wallpaper on your computer, etc. but not for selling or giving away. \u00a0It\u0027s all just for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimple, right? \u00a0So glad you are here and I hope you enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e"
