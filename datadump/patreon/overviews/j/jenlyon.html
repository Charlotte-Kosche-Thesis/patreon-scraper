I cannot be more grateful for all of the people along the way who have helped me, from a simple hug and smile to all of you who help make my dreams a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe decision to leave a 6-figure income, secure job to pursue an incredibly unstable life as an actress was not easy. I did not do this on a whim. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eI carefully weighed what was most important to me and I felt that not trying...never trying and always wondering \"what if\" would be more disastrous to my psyche than trying and failing on the most epic level. \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course my resigning from my job was met with 98% percent \"I wish I could do that!\" \"You got this!\" \"Go get them\" \"You\u0027re going to be a superstar!\" and \"See you on the Red Carpet\" kind of wonderful enthusiasm from co-workers, friends and even strangers who wished or wanted to follow their passion in the same way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there was my Parents. Imagine if you will, wanting to pursue something that burns in you like a white hot iron. You think about it day and night and it drives you to work until 3am and then you\u0027re back up at it a couple hours later to continue working at it. This is your passion, this is what you are M E A N T \u00a0to do. You feel this amazing magic coursing through your veins, your friends see it, your co-creators see it, you might even have already had success in your field or maybe your are just starting out but you turn to show your role model or your parents how proud you are of your work and-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"You\u0027ll never be successful at that. Get a real job.\"\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know how many amazing artists, painters, sculptors, comedians, podcasters, actors, race-car drivers, authors, whatever your passion is, stopped right there. I don\u0027t know how many we LOSE to that sentence that KILLS dreams dead. \"Get a real job.\" If the above weren\u0027t real jobs, why do we run to those things to relieve our stress from those real jobs that are slowly killing us daily?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow here\u0027s the rub.\u003c/strong\u003e I didn\u0027t leave my job to become an Actor/Writer/Producer on purpose. I had to because I needed to do something This is where the irony is so thick, you might have to sit down. I received a phone call from my parents while I was still at my high-paying job across the country 2 years ago. In about 5 minutes I was told that everyone in the family was dying and to come home. Just a quick side note, I talk to them daily and this was never mentioned so they decided to save it all up for a fast hit all at once. \"Come home now, everyone is sick, leave your job.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tried to relocate back to that part of the country and as great as my company was, they kept sending me all across country on assignments. Finally I had to resign as I realized I couIdn\u0027t spend any time with my family. I did NOT have 6-10 months of savings in my accounts as Suzy Orman, the financial wizard suggests..I\u0027m a normal human being. Seriously...who does this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI lost my Mother, Father, Brother, Aunt and even my dog Jake who I had for 14 years over the past 15 months. I cannot describe how painful the loss is now and everyday I wake up. There is no family left now except for me and Mack, my 10 year old American Foxhound. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rub is that my parents chastised me for choosing \"acting\" and leaving such a great job when in fact, I was just trying to spend time with them before they passed away. I was acting and writing and doing whatever I could from home in order to stay close to them. It was the only thing I could think of to try to pay bills and stay close and all they could do was put it down. Like I said...Ironic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is \u003cstrong\u003eThe Dream\u003c/strong\u003e? Well to put it most plainly, it\u0027s to create in every form possible to tell a story. To entertain an audience and for just a few moments, take someone out of their worries, their stresses, their concerns and give them a hearty laugh or gasp. Perhaps a thoughtful pause and once in awhile a heartfelt tear although I tend to lean back to the laughs at the end. Life is hard enough and if I can provide that respite, however brief, that is joy beyond bounds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write, I act, I produce. I can\u0027t stop. I\u0027m addicted in the best way and so afraid of having to go back to sell my soul to corporate in the worse way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether I can show you what it like to give it all up to do the daily dance of trying to hustle for jobs and money to make ends meet. How do bills get paid? What does it means being a Full-Time Actress/Producer/Whatever? You can live vicariously while getting to keep that 401K. ; )\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so very much,\u003cbr\u003eJen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
