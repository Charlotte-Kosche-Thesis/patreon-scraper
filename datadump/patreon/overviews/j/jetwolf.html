    "summary": "Greetings! I am Jet Wolf. I\u0027ve been around for a little while now. If you\u0027re wondering \"Are you the Jet Wolf who did the thing?\" the answer is probably yes. And also that I\u0027m old. So thanks for reminding me, you ass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor going on twenty-five years now, I\u0027ve been creating online content. Stories, liveblogs, videos, commentary, meta, analysis, WORDS OF ALL SORTS, awful doodles, bad Photoshops, absurd laughs, and occasionally some insight and advice when I have it. I care deeply about my communities and the people in them, and try to give as much of myself as is possible in everything I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA question I\u0027ve gotten often over the years is a way for people to give back. I\u0027ve never felt particularly comfortable with the idea, not wanting to make things complicated or create feelings of ~obligation~ or whatever. But I think this may be a way to have it all. I THINK THE TIME MAY BE NOW.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I commit to you guys a regular amount of content that\u0027s all yours (or at least all yours for a nice chunk of time). This gives me an extra layer of motivation to continue to create, not just for you, but for everyone. I think, at the least, it\u0027s worth a shot. AND SO HERE WE ARE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Jet Wolf Has A Patreon And Is Not Afraid To Use It. Come give me money. Come get some crap in return. Help me continue to forever entertain you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe fine print! All content produced for this Patreon will remain exclusive for at least one month from the day it was made available, at which point it may or may not be posted elsewhere, for I am a creature of whimsy as much as lazy. Throughout the month, prompt solicitation and voting (for things such as liveblogs) will be open to all members of this Patreon at the $1 and above level, although the content itself will be locked to the appropriate tier. Toward the end of the month, I\u0027ll post a schedule of what\u0027s been voted on and is upcoming, so people can join (yaaay!), upgrade (whooo!), or downgrade (hiss!) based on their preferences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParticularly in the \"you pick\" tiers, I reserve the right to refuse to do certain things. I\u0027m not going to jump to the end of PGSM, for example, or Doodle stick figure porn, which how would that even work. But say, take another stab at Avatar: The Last Airbender? Yeah, that\u0027s on the table. If a request doesn\u0027t work for me, we\u0027ll sort something out, but if you have any questions ahead of time, please ask before you pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is all kind of a learn-as-we-go thing for me, and there might be a few kinks to work out, but I\u0027m confident we\u0027ll get there. I am extremely open to your comments, suggestions, and ideas. Let me know what you think! Your Jet Wolf loves to hear from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
