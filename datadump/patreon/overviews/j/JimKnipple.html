    "summary": "The major challenge facing most cutting-edge theater artists today is the lack of financial stability. On the one hand, we are driven to create projects that push boundaries and challenge both ourselves and our audience. On the other hand, projects need to be financially successful so that we can pay the bills and keep creating. One bad project could set an artist or institution back months or even years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in! I\u0027m the new Director of New Works at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.firehousetheatre.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFirehouse Theatre\u003c/a\u003e in Richmond, Va, and have been tasked with creating shows that reach beyond traditional definitions of theater. What does that mean? I don\u0027t exactly know! I haven\u0027t created it yet! But I\u0027m about to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m calling this Skunkworks@Firehouse. \"Skunk works\" is a term that\u0027s used primarily in the air plane and automotive industries to denote a small subset of a company devoted to radical innovation. Better. Faster. Rule breaking. Boundary shattering. Incarnating that which had previously existed only in the wildest of imaginations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me as I build Skunkworks@Firehouse, you\u0027re supporting theater that is-not-yet. Productions. Play readings. Development workshops. Installations. Moments. Inspirations. Little pockets of imagination that bubble up out of passionate artists driven into the unknown. Every month we\u0027ll present something during the late night hour for the audience that desires something innovative. I\u0027ll be working with a core group of actors, pairing them with visionary writers and directors (such as myself!) and seeing what happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can you help? I\u0027ll be honest. Firehouse is an amazing home for the curious artist, but like every non-profit arts organization, money is tight and my position is new. Currently, my only compensation is a travel reimbursement of a few hundred dollars a month. With your support, my hope is that my basic needs can be met, freeing up my time and attention to focus on these projects. The more time I can devote to this, the higher the levels of quality and innovation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve probably seen what I\u0027ve done in the past. \u003cem\u003e13 Christs. columbinus. Book of Tink. bobrauschenbergamerica. Mother Courage.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Help me move into the future with Skunkworks@Firehouse."
