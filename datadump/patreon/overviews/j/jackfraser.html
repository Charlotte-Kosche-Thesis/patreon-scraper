    "summary": "My name is Jack Fraser, and I am a current physics student at the University of Oxford in the UK.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2015 I have been using my knowledge of physics to contribute to Quora, a question-and-answer site with a great scientific community. You can find my profile\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Fraser-11\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, or you can get a feel for the content I write by following this link\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-Jack-Frasers-most-upvoted-answer/answer/Jack-Fraser-11?srid=V4Un\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and sampling what\u0027s available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started out as a simple hobby has quickly grown into an addiction of worrying scale, and I currently have over 2,000 answers to my name, several of which have been published by external outlets such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/08/24/newtonian-mechanics-may-not-be-useful-in-the-quantum-realm-but-we-shouldnt-forget-them/#68bfc7ce1fcc\"\u003eForbes\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e(\u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/11/07/how-do-we-measure-the-speed-of-light/#431fa4fc21d2\"\u003etwice\u003c/a\u003e!), and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/myths-about-sun-turned-out-be-wrong-2541653\"\u003eInternational Business Times\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my reach on Quora grew and grew, and personal messages began to flood in telling me what my contributions meant to them, I began to see the role I was playing in bringing interesting science to the masses. I had, entirely by accident, become something of a Science Communicator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m now looking into expanding my repertoire away from just answers on Quora, as well as giving you the option to incentivise me to answer your questions on Quora. I have been being bugged about creating a YouTube channel, about writing a book -- you name it, someone has probably asked me to set it up at some point!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am, unfortunately, a full time student. Money and time are often somewhat scarce materials, and more often than I would like, this his impacted my ability to contribute to Quora -- it has most certainly dissuaded me from expanding \u003cem\u003eoutside\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of Quora.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhilst I don\u0027t think any of you can help me find more time in the day (unless you fancy doing my work for me?), you can certainly help me actually, you know, have enough money to eat. Eating is good.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than the warm fuzzies you will of course be getting by knowing you\u0027re helping fund someone who\u0027s work you appreciate, I\u0027ll be offering rewards to those of you who sign up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, these rewards are quite basic -- access to my private feed, a quick-access Ask-To-Answer feature, sneak peaks, and greater influence over what sort of answers I write on Quora. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if (or when) I reach my targets, and I start expanding outside of Quora (a YouTube channel is my first aim) , then these rewards may get a great deal more exciting! Stay tuned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set up the payment plan to be per-monthly: I thought if I started charging anyone per-answer that I would quite quickly bankrupt you all, and we don\u0027t want that, do we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me either here, or on Quora.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to hearing from you!\u003cbr\u003e"
