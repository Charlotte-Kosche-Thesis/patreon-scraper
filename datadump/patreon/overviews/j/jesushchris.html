    "summary": "Hello. I\u0027m Chris. I have problems. I want to make them yours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, I only kid (sort of). What i want to do is create a podcast series that goes back in time and looks at individual Propagandhi songs and recounts the stories behind how they came to be: their inspiration, their meaning, their time and place, their reception (then and now): perhaps the technical aspects of creating and recording them and, where applicable, their glaring faults that continue to haunt me as i lay awake at night, punching myself in the balls mumbling swears through clenched teeth in the darkness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut i\u0027m going to need your help to do that; I\u0027m going to need *you* to help me punch myself in the balls in the darkness. Not just to make it viable financially, but to help guide that angry fist. I mean, sure, I may want to do multiple, marathon episodes on the profound spiritual journey that was \"Ska Sucks\", but who knows? Maybe some of you think there\u0027s another song or two that warrants more attention? I need to know these things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do i want to do this? Well, you know, throughout the history of the band, I\u0027ve never really just done the band. I\u0027ve always dabbled with other stuff: recording other bands, running a record label, creating other podcasts; \u00a0it would seem i\u0027m attracted to audio related stuff in general. I mean, I also have no friends and there\u0027s only so many times you can watch Captain Ron every month. I\u0027m also 47 years old this year. That makes me statistically much closer to death than birth. On some mid-life crisis-esque level, I want to find out if the hopes and dreams of young me were warranted, or if decrepit me is right and that anything short of an extinction level event is the mere rearranging of the deck chairs on the Titanic.\u00a0With these happy queries in mind, and with a new Propagandhi record coming out this fall, maybe now would be a good time for me to reflect on what will be considered by others to be my life\u0027s work and see if i must somehow summarily apologize for the bulk of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess i look at it this way: if Sacrifice or Voivod or SNFU or Rush were publicly toying with the idea of doing something like this, i\u0027d be literally trampling my own children trying to get the Performa 6400 to sign up as a patron. Maybe some of you will feel the same way about this project and will likewise trample \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e own children?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d really appreciate that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ejesus h. chrissy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
