So a few changes \u0026amp; a few new agreements for folks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not promoting this page as the Tabernacle of Immaculate Perception anymore. Most of the work that I have done community-wise is spontaneous and undocumented. That means it never even usually makes it to the patreon page so that y\u0027all could see what I\u0027m up to. Also, I\u0027m shit on delivering *rewards*.\u00a0 I\u0027d tell y\u0027all all about the Healing Artist Residency that I designed and implemented last year, or the 10,000 gallons of fresh water I organized to be delivered in under 48 hours, or the spontaneous healing circles \u0026amp; healing moments that are a regular part of my life but to be honest, this is just what Black women do. It\u0027s both remarkable and everyday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just gonna be real with y\u0027all. I am a Black, queer, mother of 5 children who has been under surveillance, \u0026amp; a constant threat of violence \u0026amp; terror by both people I know and the state. I am a Black woman with C-PTSD and I deal with the effects of the constant retraumatization that being Black, queer \u0026amp; a mother is. I am also a gifted writer, and an amazing ass healer \u0026amp; a miracle-worker.\u00a0 \u00a0I take long ass breaks because I deserve \u0026amp; require the space to heal. It allows me to show up fully in my work on this planet as a healer with a concentration on liberation. I require more resources because I have more people to take care of than most folks. I\u0027m not telling y\u0027all this for y\u0027all to pity me. I\u0027m telling y\u0027all this for y\u0027all to have context.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, If you choose to continue to support me, what I *am* agreeing to is new writing at least once a month, maybe more. It may be poetry, it may be an essay, it maybe a healing recipe, but it will be first access to\u00a0 quality literary jucieness specifically for my patreon supporters. If not, thank you for supporting me up to this point. It is greatly appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now what I\u0027m very invested in is a memoir/healing manual for hood chicks. Become a patron for updates \u0026amp; excerpts.\u003cbr\u003exo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
