    "summary": "Hi Family!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Javetta, I am a self taught photographer/writer/visual documentarian from Albany, Georgia. I am creating a visual project (photography, book and film experience) about the amazing folks I come into contact with in South West Georgia, a small city area \u0026amp; rural area filled with an incredible history of African-American life and culture.\u00a0 My project is about capturing the stories and landscape of the culture I love while also acknowledging the challenges of living in an underrepresented area with limited resources.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am in possession of 2 cameras and a 2011 Dell Desktop. I mainly use free software to edit my photography, film and book materials.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for donations of any size to help me achieve my goal of producing a photo-documentary book and exhibit.\u00a0 Donations will go to purchasing much needed day to day equipment like mics, soft boxes, and SD cards. If donations go far (which I hope they will!!), I can even hope to one day purchase a laptop with up to date editing software.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created and assisted with previous community oriented projects and I would love to continue doing this work for as long as I can. I don\u0027t have much, but all that I have I give back into my community with art.

     "about": "Javetta Laster is a storyteller by speech pattern, and a historian by way of gossiping. Her work is centered on race, gender, and African-American myth making. Her greatest accomplishment is writing the obituary for her grandmother\u2019s funeral. Through an authentic truth, she writes to connect with her community and engages writing as a healing medium for their past and present. She attempts, very earnestly, to bridge the two worlds of what she\u0027s known and what she now knows and feels. Both worlds have been influenced by blackness, southerness, queerness, love, grief and experiences that cannot be spoken about just yet. She currently resides in Albany, Georgia with her ancestors, her mother, her aunt and a host of cousins and kin-friends.",
