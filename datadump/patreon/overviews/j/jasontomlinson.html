    "summary": "In the fall of 1993 I lived in Burton, Michigan where I was a 15 year old sophomore at Valley Christian Academy.  Around that time I had joined the staff of Word Up, a section of the Flint Journal that appeared every Sunday.  At Word Up students were encouraged to submit all sorts of articles and write-ups including poetry.  The creative atmosphere among the Word Up writers was just the sort that was ideal for me to write my first poem.  So, one day in biology, I cranked out my first, Outcast\u2019s Cry.  It was instant satisfaction and I\u2019ve never looked back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwenty -five years later my pen is as active as it ever has been. The poetry that flows has certainly found a home on the internet through YouTube, Facebook, iTunes, and Wordpress. Most of these mediums lend themselves pretty easily to my skill set except for one - YouTube. The professional standards that YouTube content producers must adhere to in order to maintain an appropriate level of relevance are lofty indeed. As a spoken word poet on YouTube, I have been producing content since 2010 in some form or fashion and several times I have partnered with professional independent film makers in order to present the best videos I can possibly make. One swiping scroll through my channel is proof enough that the videos I have produced in collaborative community with my creative partners are the most compelling presentations I\u2019ve ever made. Fortunately, there is an opportunity for you to partner with us. As a public school teacher of seven years in Middle Tennessee you may imagine that my budget for professionally produced videos is non-existent and you would be right. Enter Patreon. Patreon is this amazing \u00a0organization that partners artists with supporters. If you believe in the spoken word poetry that I have been producing on YouTube then I invite you and your family to be a part of it. Right now, I am inviting individuals and families to join me as I seek to add creative expressions that bless everyone. Please consider coming alongside me, my family, and these outstanding film makers in order to produce the most excellent expressions of beauty and truth the world has ever seen."
