    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! What is Patreon? It\u0027s a way that you can become a patron of the work I produce. There are various reward levels, starting at $1/month! There is no long term commitment, you can cancel at any time or move up to a better reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019ve been following me for a while, (\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jphillipsphotographic/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jphillipsphoto\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e) you know I take a lot of photos. A lot. I almost always have a camera with me. Some of my favorite photos were taken when I had no intention of taking any photos when I left my house that morning. I live in East Tennessee, an area of the world known for the Great Smoky Mountains, however, I rarely find time to shoot in that area. Most of my favorite photos have been taken on my daily commute to my full time job.\u003cbr\u003eI search for beauty in the mundane. I try to see the world each day with fresh eyes. I drive by a small lake on my way to work and back each day. Sometimes I have to stop. Sometimes I take 100 photos. Sometimes I take no photos. I have taken the vast majority of the photos on my website within a 20 mile radius. Many times I stop at the same exact spots where I have taken hundreds of photos prior.\u003cstrong\u003e I challenge myself to take the photo not taken.\u003c/strong\u003e I look for a new angle.\u003cbr\u003eI have no secrets. Ask me anything and I\u2019m glad to help. I\u2019m generally not doing anything that can\u2019t be replicated with a modern cell phone. \u003cstrong\u003e90% of taking a great photo is being there.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, hopefully it\u0027s because you like my photos. Patreon is a way that you can support what I love to do. I have tried to come up with many different ways to do this. You can show your support for as little as $1/month! Take a look at the options on the right and (hopefully) find a reward that works for you. Thanks for your support!"
