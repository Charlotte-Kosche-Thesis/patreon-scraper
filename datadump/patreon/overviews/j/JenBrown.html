    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eGreetings, friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an actor, creator, feminist, gore-hound and all around nerd-extraordinaire from Austin, TX. I\u0027m mostly known for my work on popular Rooster Teeth shows such as Red Vs. Blue, RWBY, Camp Camp, DAY 5 and more. I\u0027m also beyond happy to say I am the current voice of Harley Quinn for DCUO! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been an avid horror fan since I was a child and I truly believe it to be the perfect genre, despite its history with negative female representation. Twice a month the\u00a0fabulous Dawn Humphrey and I break down our favorite and our not so favorite films on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.womenincaskets.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWomen In Caskets\u003c/a\u003e horror podcast now on the Bloody Disgusting Podcast Network. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am surprised and honored to say I am the winner of the 2016 Austin Chronicle Readers Poll for Best Non-Chronicle Film Critic! Which means at least more than 5 people listen to us, so that\u0027s fun! If you have yet to check us out, I would definitely recommend you do so as it is a wonderful sneak peak into how my mind works :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that\u0027s out of the way, let\u0027s get down to business!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJEN BROWN PLAYS\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrying to get original content made will take A LONG ASS TIME... In the meantime, Barrett thought \"Hey, let\u0027s embarrass Jen on Twitch!\" My nerdy and wonderful partner Barrett loves video games. So do I. However, I\u0027m pretty abysmal at playing most games unless they are Tell Tale style. That\u0027s where Jen Brown Plays on Twitch comes in! Every week I will post a poll where my Patreon subscribers get to pick which game I play on Wednesday at 8:30 pm CST on my Twitch channel. I also stream on Sundays from 1-3 pm and Mondays from 8:30-10ish pm. Sometimes I\u0027m good. But I often end up cussing and singing about how bad I am. Plus, the lovely Barrett is there as well and sometimes we\u0027ll play together. It\u0027s a grand ol\u0027 time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBROWN RECLUSE FILMS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter thinking long and hard about what I love doing the most, I realized it was time for me to start putting my money where my mouth is and start creating content. I successfully produced theatre in Austin for 5 years as the co-artistic director of The Vestige Group. I\u0027m ready to take that experience and apply it to film with the help of some talented friends and collaborators from said film world, of course. That\u0027s where BROWN RECLUSE FILMS comes in. That is what I am calling my potential horror production company. Get it? Brown recluse spider. Jen Brown. Yeah. I\u0027m a bloody genius. Your contributions will help me get closer to my vision of starting this company. There are a couple of projects in gestation and here is just a tiny little bit of teaser information about two of them:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMARVIN\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver a year ago I finished co-writing my first horror feature film entitled MARVIN. I approached my good friend and collaborator Rafael Ruiz with an idea for a horror short and we quickly expanded it into a wildly gory, unique and fun full-length film. I enlisted my stupidly talented best friend and playwright Bastion Carboni to add his unique take to the story\u00a0and the result is something I couldn\u0027t be prouder of!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put it very simply: It\u0027s like Martyrs meets Frances Ha with a heavy dose of gentrification.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSAVAGE WORLD\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will be an animated series of ten short episodes for the first season. It takes place at \"Rick Savage\u0027s SAVAGE WORLD\". A haunted house attached to a failing amusement park run by a fading 80\u0027s goth/glam rocker named, you guessed it, Rick Savage. It is an entire work of fiction. Except for the fact that it is all loosely based on my real experiences as a haunted house employee at Alice Cooper\u0027s Brutal Planet at Six Flags when I was in high school. Other than that it\u0027s ALL FAKE. It is a comedy but NOT for children.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWell, there ya go! While the production company is a far off dream, your help with Jen Brown Plays knows I have the support to make it happen for real.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your $1 donation (Or, more. I don\u0027t control you) you will have a chance to pick what I play most Wednesdays on Twitch at 8:30pm CST.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you took the time to read this, THANK YOU! You are special. Reading is hard these days. Also, if you decide to contribute just know that you are greatly appreciated\u00a0and will now be known as a SUPER special.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003eJen Brown\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
