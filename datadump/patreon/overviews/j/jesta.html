I am 100% supported by YOU and every single bit makes a difference!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI gave up listening to the radio a long time ago.\u003c/strong\u003e Why? Because, with a few rare exceptions, radio stations are tied into playing the same old playlists, or bland soul-destroying music that \"appeals to the masses\". Well, I don\u0027t know about you but I\u0027d like to think that I\u0027m an individual with my own unique musical tastes, not one of the sheep who is told what to listen to by those only following the advertisement money!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I decided the best way to spend my time was to switch off the radio and start making the music myself! Fortunately for me I have been working for many years in the recording industry picking up tips and improving my musicianship skills. I\u0027d love to now begin to seriously work on my songwriting too, but like most of us there are bills to be paid, a family to care for and only 24 hours in the day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal here is to try to monetise my art so that I can spend more time to write some GREAT songs and make some fun music videos that I really hope you\u0027ll enjoy. I\u0027m sure as time goes on my songcrafting skills will improve which will result in a happier me and a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ehappier YOU\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford to help me out right now, it\u0027s not a problem - I appreciate you simply spending the time to check me out. I\u0027ll still be creating whether you donate or not, and I hope in the future you can jump on board and become part of my exclusive circle. For now, why not share the link to this page with some friends instead - that would be as valuable to me as the money!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,230,148);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome questions, answered...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat am I sponsoring you for?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Your sponsor payment comes into effect when I release to you either a new song recording, or a video of me performing an original song or cover version.

I don\u0027t want my sponsors to drift away as they cannot afford it anymore! Also, you can set a maximum limit for your sponsorship - this guarantees that if I get really busy you won\u0027t have to suffer.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e NO - Pay in any currency!

However, it\u0027s very likely that the music will take much longer to appear there and there will be none of the other benefits hear on Patreon such as regular updates, rewards and more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
