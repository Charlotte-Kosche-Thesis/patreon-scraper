    "summary": "Julie Mannell is an author of fiction, poetry, and creative non-fiction/experimental personal essays. She is the recipient of the Lionel Shapiro Award for Excellency in Creative Writing, The Mona Adilman Poetry Prize, the Constance Rooke Creative Writing Scholarship, and the HarperCollins Creative Writing Scholarship. Her work has also garnered praise from both notable celebrities and the literary elite.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer style has been referred to as \"Southern Ontario gothic with a spark of magical realism.\" Furthermore, Julie Mannell has been described as \"edgy,\" \"a literary badass,\" \"cut throat,\" and \"radically anti-romantic.\" She is an author of dramatic comedies and her signature is the ability to make a reader cry and laugh at the same time in a single sentence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJulie Mannell is originally from Fonthill, Ontario where she grew up with a single mother and in an environment that was not supportive of women. When she was seventeen she moved to Montreal where she received an undergraduate degree in English Literature and Philosophy from McGill University. Her work has been widely published and she has toured across North America. Julie Mannell currently splits her time between Montreal and Toronto where she is pursuing her Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing at University of Guelph.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite being very successful very young, Julie Mannell was still unable to support herself with her work. She was employed for many years as a nanny and a maid while living in a walk in closet and sleeping on a single mattress on the floor. Much of this is due to the lack of funding for the Arts in Canada. It is also because in order to attend university students like Mannell have to take out large bank loans with lofty interest fees.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMannell\u0027s goal is simple. She hopes to support herself through her art. She desires to have the time to keep creating. Her current major projects are two novels. \"little girls\" is a novel that features\u00a0a small, insular community in rural Ontario as a failed Garden of Eden. The story follows a friendship between two girls as they try to discover what kind of a woman God would be and then trying to make themselves in Her image.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second novel is titled \"Weekending in India\" and it follows a complicated romance between a Francophone separatist activist and an Anglophone artist during the 2012 student strike in Montreal. The novel explores gender, identity, politics, and sexuality through the eyes of 20-somethings living in a city characterized by striking linguistic divides. Trustworthy secondary readers have already remarked that it might be the raunchiest novel ever published in Canada.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will help Julie Mannell finish her projects that she has sacrificed the larger part of her 20\u0027s to realize. Rewards for donations include workshops, having a character named after you, being listed in the acknowledgements page of her novel, and receiving individualized poems. For $1000 you can have your name tattooed on Julie\u0027s rear end.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all seriousness, Julie Mannell would be very grateful for the opportunity to continue to write the stories she loves and share them with the world. Your donation would make these dreams possible. Thank you very much for the consideration and best of luck in your patronage.\u00a0"
