    "summary": "Hello and thank you for visiting me on this, my newest of adventures.\u00a0I am an artist (or entertainer... pick your poison). I create spontaneously and I create passionately. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an independent artist, \u003cstrong\u003emy job is to create without any guarantee of ever being compensated for it\u003c/strong\u003e, and that is the game I choose to play. With Patreon, the odds can be stacked more in the favor of the independent artist (as long as they are offering something worth your time).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy chipping in a \u003cstrong\u003ecouple bucks\u003c/strong\u003e each time I create something, you can help ensure that my creative muscle will stay strong because I will \u003cem\u003eknow\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I have an audience waiting to support me. With that, you will challenge me to keep coming up with \u003cstrong\u003enew goals, new ideas, and new creations\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0And I never back down from a challenge...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, just about everything is free these days. With music streaming and YouTube, anyone can find anything they want and not pay an extra cent for it. And that is FINE. I enjoy streaming music just as much as they next guy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut sometimes I want to be able to help out, throw a little \"tip\" to the artist for their work that has touched my heart or my mind. Thus, Patreon is that community where \u003cstrong\u003eyou can help by throwing me a tip when I release a project\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I HERE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an experiment for me. \u003cstrong\u003eI saw the incredible support, excitement, and community that came out of throwing a successful crowdfunding campaign and I want to see what happens in the afterparty\u003c/strong\u003e, if you will.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the crowdfunding, I had a very set goal monetarily and creatively and a community formed to help me reach those goals. With Patreon, the bigger picture is to continue to \u003cstrong\u003eenrich our community\u003c/strong\u003e by asking for financial support, yes, but also to ask for creative feedback and integration. I want to be inspired by you and your ideas. And I want to share those projects back with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I\u0027m going to keep creating (for free) and sharing (for free) and you\u0027ll probably be able to find most of the stuff I put up on Patreon in other places for free. But if there\u0027s anything I\u0027m doing that has resonated with you so much so that you\u0027d like to \u003cstrong\u003ejoin in on a creative conversation\u003c/strong\u003e and leave me a tip (and also get some cool exclusive content along the way), then that\u0027s why Patreon\u0027s here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic, Art, Videos, Podcasts, Behind-The-Scenes....\u003c/strong\u003e Not sure what will come of this but I promise it will be spontaneous and you will be in mind each time I create something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love -J\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e--Actual Questions and Actual Answers--\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ:\u00a0So if we are pledging per creation is that money automatically deducted from our accounts or are they billed? Also, how often will the creations be produced?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes, I believe your pledge is automatically deducted when I post something new. However, so I don\u0027t abuse that, it is my job to be aware that I\u0027m only putting up stuff that I think is super relevant and high-quality. I will also not be posting every week or maybe even every month, but rather once I have something that I think is worth sharing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLUS, I also believe you may set a personal limit for yourself. So if you want to pledge $10 per project, but don\u0027t want to spend over $100 in total, it will take all that into consideration and give you the first 10 projects but then respect your limit."
