    "summary": "Hi!\nMy name is Jim1537. My wife, Meremystic, and I have been doing the Metaphysical\nTools For Transformation Podcast for a while now. This podcast offer tools for\npersonal transformation that are based on sound metaphysical and spiritual\nprinciples.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth\nmy wife and I have in-depth experience in the spiritual and metaphysical fields.\nWe have extensively studied subjects such as psychic phenomenon, spirituality,\nmetaphysics, astrology, healing, and affirmations, among many others. We have\ndedicated ourselves to sharing this knowledge in many ways, not only with our\nclients, but also as published authors and podcasters.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\nstarted the podcast because we wanted to share tools to help people understand and\nheal their pain. This may be the trouble associated with difficult personal\nrelationships. It could be complicated family dynamics. Many of us have deep\nemotional wounds that keep us from moving forward and transforming our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\noffer tools that focus on the importance of past lives, reincarnation, karma,\nlife lessons, and our individual struggles in today\u2019s world. It is our hope to offer\na deeper and more comprehensive picture of the human experience and its\nprofound spiritual purpose than that we are used to hearing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur\napproach is direct, sincere, and straightforward. We tell it like it is and try\nto keep things clear. As much as possible, we do our best to present\ninformation in ways that aren\u2019t complicated, mysterious or hard to understand.\nSharing our knowledge and experience with you is a very fulfilling thing for us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight\nnow, we are doing one podcast a month, and we would like to expand that number\nto two, possibly three, or even four.However, the\ntime it takes to plan, record each episode and prepare the podcast for release\nis time that we are not able to work to support our family. Without some form\nof financial support, we can\u2019t expand the podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s\nwhy we are asking for those who believe in what we\u2019re doing to help financially\nsupport the project. That allows my wife and I to not only expand the number of\nepisodes we do, but we can also provide longer content and expand our offerings\nin new and exciting ways.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\nare so gratified by the responses and support we\u2019ve received from people who\nhave told us how much the podcast means to them personally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo\nthose of you who choose to support us, you have our deepest gratitude and\nthanks. Even a $1 pledge really makes such an incredible difference in\nsupporting what we do! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts \u2013 it means the\nworld to us!"
