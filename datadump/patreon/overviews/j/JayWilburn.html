I try to offer cool pieces that are different from\nwhat people may find everywhere else out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy journey also includes my journey to a kidney transplant. Polycystic kidney disease runs in my family. My grandmother,\nfather, and brother all died from it on dialysis. I was able to get a successful transplant on Februrary 8, 2017 and now I work to stay healthy and to keep up with my meds to avoid rejection.\u003cstrong\u003e I want to see my sons grow up.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI taught school for sixteen years before leaving to pursue\nbeing a full-time writer and to care for the health needs of my youngest son.\nSince 2013, my son\u2019s health has improved, but mine had declined until\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI was down single digit kidney function.\u003c/strong\u003e I like to think my writing has improved too\nalong the way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can\u2019t separate out the parts of our life\u2019s journey.

It comes with pain\nand constant exhaustion. It has put a toll on my family in terms of having to\nput up with the times I could not give more. It comes with financial burdens\nwith medical costs and trying to keep up the production that pays the bills. My\nwife has committed to supporting my dreams of being a writer and this journey\nfor a kidney to save my life. Now, paying for meds is expensive, but the changes to lifestyle are well worth the sacrifices required for more time. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBy buying into my story, you are giving me the\nsupport I need to achieve these things. \u003c/strong\u003eIn a very real sense, you are helping\nme buy more time on this Earth with my family and the words I write.
