    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome! This is my \"Artist Residency in Motherhood\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you, Thank you, Thank you for making your way here! This is my Patreon page-aka \u003cstrong\u003e\"Artist Residency in Motherhood\"\u003c/strong\u003e. We are building something new here- a sustainable path to new work and a window into the process that makes it happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make music to connect.\u00a0 Many a hard day has been made bearable because I had a speaker to put my ear against. Many a good day has been etched into my memory because I had the right song to sing along to.\u00a0 Music makes life good, and I make music. I want to write and record songs that connect us to the bigger picture, to the people we love, and to each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI been have been SO LUCKY to be able to create music that people actually hear. Some of you are new to my music. I am stoked to meet you and sing for you. Some of you have been with me a long time, from the early days of The Blackberry Bushes (Moon Pie anyone?) and my solo releases. Through Creatures of Habit, These Days, Crow, Even The Trees, Little Bit of Grace, At The Break, and Three Red Feathers, I have made all of my albums because of the support of my fans.\u00a0You build me up; you are a part of everything I make, and I am blessed to have fans like you. I have so much new music waiting to be made, and so many songs that I have not put on an album yet! I want these songs to delight and inspire you! I want these songs to heal your heart like they heal mine. I want to build bridges and share the journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is all about NEW MUSIC!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of August 9, 2017 - I AM A MOM! The birth of my son has changed things, and given me more inspiration than my heart can hold.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, many of you have gotten music from me in person. I have taken the troubadour role to heart and traveled full time for almost 10 years to sing my songs to you in person. It is time to evolve, make tours more special, and find a more efficient way to get new music into your life.\u00a0 Now that our Early Bear is here, we have Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHere is what I am asking -\u00a0 a couple of bucks a month. I am challenging myself to put out new music every month that you can have digitally -you can download the digital file to add to your playlist. I will also post here about the trials and triumphs, take questions, and do my very best\u00a0 to make this a worthwhile digital destination.\u003cbr\u003eYour funds help with the costs of making music. They may also keep the lights on, the water hot, and pay for an occasional Kombucha. Right now, they also help me stay home with my baby and make his childhood magical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an ongoing subscription to the music I create, but you can jump on for a few months or the long haul. You can cancel anytime.\u00a0 I love you all, and I am humbled by your generosity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that is the plan. \u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can be a part of this with me on any level, I am humbled and thankful. Really, y\u0027all. \u003cstrong\u003eYOU ARE THE BEST. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
