I have pretty much devoted my life to music- I have 17 instruments on stage in my live show and in the last 10 years I have released\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jayhoad.com/mp3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e5 albums\u003c/a\u003e (6th coming out in 2017), played over 2000+ live shows and performed in 28 countries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA few years ago I decided that I would focus all my energy on aiming to tour my show via the ocean instead of by car and plane.\u00a0So now on to the real adventure... sailing and touring by sea! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the ocean, music and performance, writing, travel, love, food, surfing, diving, sailing, yoga, art, learning and depth. Most of all I love adventures and finding new places I have never been before... and that\u0027s pretty much a good chunk of what this video blog is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am about two years away\u00a0(all is going to plan) from setting sail and I am 100% dedicated to make this happen. I would love to share these adventures with you as I document the hard work that goes into an exciting and unique lifestyle, and eventually show you how I live my dreams on the ocean. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos take a huge amount of time and hard work to shoot, edit and prepare, and that\u0027s where Patreon comes in as this allows independent artists like myself the means to continue to create content. Your\u00a0support will help in ensuring the regular release of my music, lifestyle and adventure\u00a0videos while I pursue this dream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand some people simply don\u0027t have the money to be donating to folks such as myself, so if you are unable to become a patron, no worries at all :) Just by spreading the word, you have done more than enough. And\u00a0in saying this, 90% or more of my content and videos here will remain freely accessible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become a patron and donate your hard-earned cash to support me on this journey, please know I am extremely grateful for your kindness. In return I am offering a generous selection of treats for you all in the rewards section. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly,\u00a0I would like you to know I am deeply grateful and humbled that you have taken the time to read this, or watched one of my videos, or listened to one of my albums and\u00a0feel\u00a0very fortunate to share this journey with you all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo come join me and watch this all unfold, and thank you for helping support me and choosing to be part of my dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Hoad\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
