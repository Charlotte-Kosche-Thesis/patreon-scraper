I was born in Thailand, and I have lived here for 24 years. I love drawing and painting as a hobby. My passion is to do it on a daily basis. Usually I illustrate about homosexual love. The reason why I love to draw it is because I\u2019m gay. If we are talking about homosexuality, most people will define me as a humiliation. I never acknowledge who defined the borders of sex and force us to love heterosexually. The only thing on my mind is just a personal fancy of sex, which some people will frown upon. I intent to communicate with them that gays are not disgusting, we have some elegant side that they never knew. I will change their opinion throughout my artworks and put my personality in it. My artworks definitely tell my stories. Such as my favorite songs, situation of regret or happiness. It seems my character can tell my proposition same way as my Facebook status. Obviously, my character portrays my feelings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thank you for the opportunity given to a newbie artist such as myself to\u00a0impress you.\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eART WORK\u003cbr\u003eFor your safety as you always support my work, I will send the finished picture to you on the 5th of every month via chat box in patreon for downloading.
