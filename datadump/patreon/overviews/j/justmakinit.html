We have crafted these differentiated rewards packages for our patrons to select the level that fits you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd truthfully, you are the reason we are here.

     "description": "Alright Patrons. This is the level that makes it easiest for you to purchase Garrett\u0027s paintings! You get EVERYTHING from all the lower levels which means you automatically get a 20% discount on all of Garrett\u0027s paintings.\u003cbr\u003eThere are two ways this could go:\u003cbr\u003e1. You let us know a specific painting you wish to purchase, we tell you the final discounted price and you sign up for this reward level for as many months as it takes to pay for the painting you are buying. If there is a remainder below $60 for the final payment, we will coordinate with you which reward tier you should switch to to pay off the painting you purchased. We will mail you the painting you desire once you have completely paid for it but in the mean time you get to enjoy all the perks available to patrons at all levels of Just Makin\u0027 It!\u003cbr\u003eOR.....\u003cbr\u003e2. Just like option 1 except this option is for patrons who know they want to buy one or more of Garrett\u0027s paintings but do not have a specific painting in mind. If you signup\u00a0 for this level, you pay $60 a month, you get all of the rewards from lower levels and we will send you an original Garrett Bollig painting every 3 months for as long as you are a patron at this level!\u003cbr\u003e",
