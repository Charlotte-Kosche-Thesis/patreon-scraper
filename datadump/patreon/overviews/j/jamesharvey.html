    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m James. I write and draw comics for a variety of publishers, to some acclaim. I love what I do and want to do it for as long as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time of writing (11/09/2016), I\u0027ve had a broken hand for over a month, which put me in a scary position- I didn\u0027t know when I\u0027ll be able to earn money through my drawings again. My cast just came off, but it\u0027s unclear how quickly I\u0027ll be able to get back in the saddle. The bones aren\u0027t completely healed, and while my first efforts to draw again feel initially comfortable, I don\u0027t yet know whether or not it\u0027s going to be a better idea to let the bones heal up and stay out of action for a while longer. This will mean passing up on yet more paying work. This is a problem because at present, drawing is the sole source of my income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also just spent a lot of money relocating my wife from the US to the UK. This was a costly process that put us deeply in debt. After an eight month forced separation, I finally brought her here, and: guess what! She just broke her toe, and will now be out of action for 6-8 weeks. So now SHE can\u0027t work, either. While my work is all done with my hands, hers is done on her feet. This means I\u0027m going to be the sole breadwinner in the family for the time being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s why I\u0027ve chosen to reactivate this Patreon- to allow us a financial safety net in this difficult and stressful time. If you\u0027re able to pledge anything at all, it would be greatly appreciated. I\u0027ll deactivate this Patreon when we\u0027re back in a stable position in terms of our health and finances. If you pledge to support us, you\u0027ll gain access to a backer blog where I talk about things I\u0027ve been working on recently. If my hand remains broken, it\u0027ll mostly be scripts and other writing. I don\u0027t promise regular updates, but ideally I\u0027d like to put something up at least once a month. There\u0027s also a backlog of entries from a previous incarnation of this Patreon to peruse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSocially conscious and with a biting sense of humour- get lost in the imagination of one of the industry\u2019s most promising up-and-coming creators\u201d- The Onion A.V. Club.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(above: my favourite quote about my work.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUPDATE 05/12/17: I\u0027m happy to report that my hand has been completely healed for a couple of weeks now- there\u0027s still some residual tenderness in my wrist but aside from that I\u0027m able to work. Zoe\u0027s toe is healing nicely. We\u0027re just about keeping our heads above water. Your pledges will be extremely useful to us!\u00a0Thank you so much for your support thus far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
