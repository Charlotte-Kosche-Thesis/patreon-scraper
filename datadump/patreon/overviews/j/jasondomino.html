I am passionate, my heart is in the right place and... My Masters Degree and experience working for NASA shows that I actually have a few braincells too.

The results of which appear daily. My work on HIV stigma reduction has already prevented 1 suicide that I am aware of, and possibly more I am not. By Promoting PrEP I actively reduce the future impact of HIV. I do not say that it prevents over STIs but promote it as a minimum practical step.\u003cbr\u003eBy making my sex live an example and showing my love for people regardless of HIV status, I can speak to a very vulnerable part in some viewer\u0027s lives.",
