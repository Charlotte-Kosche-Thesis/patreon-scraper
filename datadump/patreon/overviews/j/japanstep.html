    "summary": "Hello everyone, \u003cstrong\u003eJapan Step\u003c/strong\u003e here! We are a small team of two music promoters aiming to spread japanese music all over the world, whether it is J-DNB or J-Dubstep, J-Chillstep or even J-Electro (among many other genres) - we intend to make dedicated j-music producers well known.\u00a0We started this project way back in 2013 and we never expected to get the support we have today - fans all over the world kept the dream alive. Recently we have upgraded our personal computer and bought the latest Adobe After Effects software allowing us to create more videos with better quality much faster - the thing is, we are college students so we do not have the biggest amount of time on our hands, this is why we decided to give it a try here at Patreon. If we manage to get better resources and income we could finally remove intrusive advertisements from our Youtube videos and buy better software and hardware to create our content, providing our viewers a greater number of videos and helping music producers getting the attention they deserve.\u003cbr\u003eRecently we teamed up with \u003cem\u003eArcane, \u003c/em\u003ean incredible music producer and we feel that he and many others could benefit from our Youtube video promoting - awesome music producers deserve getting attention - you can check out the video here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MA7kPqufjmA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides \u003cem\u003eArcane, \u003c/em\u003ewe have promoted artists such as \u003cem\u003eAsterisk, Camellia, Akira Complex, Logue4, Cametek, Syntax Error, ESAI, KJ Sawka, Mii, Akinyan Electro,\u003c/em\u003e among many others.\u003cbr\u003eWith your support we could get better hardware and software, be more dedicated to our videos by having more time to focus on them, do even more game giveaways (we have done some in the past, but due to financial issues we do them more rarely now) and most importantly reduce, or even remove, our Youtube ads. With more time we could promote even more artists, bringing more j-music to every house around the world.\u003cbr\u003eWe appreciate any support you might give us and the artists we promote, every bit counts - we would not even be around if it wasn\u00b4t for you, our loyal fans and supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all these amazing years!\u003cbr\u003e"
