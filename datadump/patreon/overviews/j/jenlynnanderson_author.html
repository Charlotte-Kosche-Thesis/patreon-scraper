For example, I\u0027d love to have cash to pay a graphic designer for some Blow-Your-Mind cover art! I\u0027d LOVE to be able to find a local press to print some short orders, to distribute to local indie book stores and to bring to author events. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, I\u0027d love LOVE LOOOOVE to get Stormriders physically into your hands, as soon as possible! Having a Publishing Fund is an important step toward this goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIF THIS GOAL IS ACHIEVED: I will create a newsletter, exclusive for Patrons, to keep you FIRST in the know about upcoming release dates, book events, and promo deals for Stormriders!",
