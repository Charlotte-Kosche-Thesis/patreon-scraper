I was always drawing , coloring, painting and seeking some sort of approval from every person whom I showed my work to. At the time I was just a child, but to me that knowledge of knowing something I created was wonderful was an amazing feeling. I was always a perfectionist. I remember sitting on the living room floor in Ville Saint Laurent when I was around 8-9 years of age coloring a bear picture. To me this bear picture was my best piece yet. I remember thinking about how evenly the color spread over the bear and how I did not forget any spaces to color. I saw no white nor any coloring outside of the lines. Around the same time I realized I really loved to draw. My brother had a friend over one day and he sat and taught us how to draw a tough guy with spiked hair and sun glasses. I thought he was the most coolest character ever. I started to then draw characters. Now that you have learned how I fell in love with drawing and coloring I will tell you how I came across blending colors. Even though my mom till this day says her coloring skills are not the greatest I concur !!! I remember coloring with her as a teen and the way she colored in the beasts hair from beauty and the beast with multiple colors rather then just brown, amazed me. I was floored and proud! I took my coloring to the next step and started my own blends. As I got older I started to paint on canvas. I started children\u0027s wall art commissions, and for awhile it suited me. It was wonderful. In the back of my mind though I kept wondering if this type of medium was for me. I hated that lingering off feeling. One day in 2006 as I was browsing ebay for competitors. I came across reborns and then sculptures. I was amazed! I browsed through tuns of tutorials .I shopped on ebay and bought all that was needed to start creating. I joined a wonderful community called ooakdollart. I there then met amazing people, learned so many different methods. I branched off on canvas while sculpting my ooaks and fell in love with portrait painting.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eMy Preferred\u00a0Mediums\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(250, 192, 143);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOoak sculptures and miniatures\u003cbr\u003ePolymer clay\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePortrait Paintings\u003cbr\u003ePencil crayons\u003cbr\u003eWatercolor\u003cbr\u003eAcrylic\u003cbr\u003ePastels\u003cbr\u003eCurrently practicing oils.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(250, 192, 143);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003eMy link\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.gardensofutopia.ca\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWebsite\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ko-fi.com/janisgarayt\"\u003eKo-Fi\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/janis.higgins.5\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/janis-higgins-85b327a7/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLinkedin\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/GardensOfUtopia\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(250, 192, 143);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.ca/gardensofutopia/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gardensofutopia/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gardensofutopia.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gardensofutopia.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mewe.com/i/janis.garayt\"\u003eMeWe\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/GardensOfUtopia\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
