    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Jukzta?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey! Thanks for checking out the page! My name is Justin and I am an artist in the Midwest. My mind is constantly running faster than my hands are able to keep up with. I have many ideas for creating, design and manufacturing. I am a professional tattoo artist for almost a decade now, with background in traditional art, media, design, logos, graphics and recently diving in to 3d art and development. I first started my Patreon to try and open possibilities for my video game streaming. Oh yeah, I\u0027m a gamer and a streamer. Did I mention that? I\u0027ve also helped run a couple of \u003cdel\u003enot quite\u003c/del\u003e successful gaming communities. Anyway...\u00a0 some of you may know me from streaming or playing video games so, welcome to some insight into the \"whole\" me. I\u0027ve actually long kept my social life kind of separate from my professional life, which have both been a bit separated from my personal life. This is where I start to break down some of those barriers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I want your money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking for patrons like you to help support smaller facets of my artistic endeavors. This would allow me to put more focus on things that would otherwise be lower on the priority list. I absolutely love my career of tattooing but I thoroughly enjoy designing logos, business cards, flyers and other graphics. These design impulses along with my passion for video games has recently geared me toward creating overlays for twitch streams and other gaming community type art and design. Another hope for this page would be to allow me to earn some monetary support to translate some of my art and design on to t-shirts and other clothing or accessories.\u003cbr\u003eSo, as I mentioned, my mind is constantly pumping out ideas and I would like to let this place be the outlet for my hands to try and keep up. It\u0027s with your hard-earned money that I can allow myself to independently progress my passion of art, media and design and let these facets rise on the list of priorities and keep me busy.\u003cbr\u003eTo start off, the money that I receive here will go directly toward buying art supplies and equipment for making and maintaining media online and offline. Even an online presence takes time and money to own and operate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnough about me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s talk about you, the Patron! Your support will never go unrecognized. No matter how great or small any contribution is, it\u0027s greatly appreciated! Any contribution here will gain you access to the Patron-only posts and an opportunity to participate in conversations and polls.

You are awesome! Whether you contribute to become a patron or not, I appreciate you taking your time to check me out. Feel free to stop back by anytime and stay updated. I know that not everyone is financially able to help support my artwork/insanity. But you are all welcome to show some love and give me a like, follow, heart, thumbs up, or whatever subtle emoji is tied to these social media outlets. Thanks again for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
