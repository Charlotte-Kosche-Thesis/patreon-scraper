    "summary": "My name is J.Striker, though Menace is what I usually go by online. I\u0027ve been writing fanfiction since 2012 on various websites, mostly for the Naruto fandom, and am looking to get back into writing while branching out a bit. I\u0027m currently a university student working two jobs to pay bills and cost of tuition, so the hope is that Patreon allows me to take time off from work to write more often. If you choose to subscribe to me, you\u0027ll be paying for my time, not any given work of fanfiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027ll be writing\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll be writing a mix of fanfiction and original fiction, more fan than original to start with. When a story finishes it will be replaced with a new one, and who knows. Maybe a year from now I\u0027ll be all original. For now, this is the line up:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRazzle Dazzle\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e(RWBY)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eDuring her first week at Beacon, Weiss Schnee is invited to a Councilman\u0027s soir\u00e9e on her father\u0027s behalf.

There are some stories, ideas, or thoughts on the process that I\u0027ll be posting periodically for Patreon backers only. Some will be small, some will not. Also, if you hit the commission tier, you can pitch a story idea to me (within reason) and I\u0027ll have it sent to you as soon as I can. From there it\u0027s your choice whether or not I post it to my account on ff.net, spacebattles, DLP, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much I\u0027ll be writing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, during my peak production of \u003cem\u003eThe Howling Wind\u003c/em\u003e, I wrote 1500 words a day. I\u0027d like to make it back to that level soon, but for now I\u0027m setting the goal at 1000 words per day, or 30000 per month. That\u0027s about 1/3rd a good sized novel, at a pace I can maintain without burning out immediately on school and work. This doesn\u0027t include commissions, Patreon-only stories, etc. That\u0027s all bonus content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen I\u0027ll be writing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll do my best to keep it even between my three stories- roughly 10000 words each per month, meaning a good sized update every other week for each story. Or, a 5k update every five days, give or take.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll update this page as I get a better handle on Patreon and this new schedule, so check back in if you have any questions and feel free to email me at menacepatreon@gmail.com. Thanks to all of you that read my stories, and thanks again for helping me make time to get back into writing.\u003cbr\u003e"
