    "summary": "Hi friends!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the end of October, 2016. Let me start by saying I am grateful to your love and support in the past few years that I\u0027ve shared my work online. What you\u0027ve meant to me isn\u0027t something words can describe, so all I can say is that without you, I wouldn\u0027t be here on my journey to fighting oppression with my feeble words. Yet, as you\u0027ve noticed, the rate of my production has come to a grinding halt. This isn\u0027t because I don\u0027t have ideas anymore. Nor is it because I\u0027m tired of writing. Simply put: words don\u0027t make enough money to sustain me. And while I haven\u0027t given up on fighting, I\u0027m reaching out to see if you\u0027ll be able to sustain my work in the future monetarily. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is entirely voluntary. If you wish to donate monthly, I would greatly appreciate it. If you don\u0027t, I will still appreciate you and you will continue to be able to read all my work for free. A couple of bucks a month will pay my electricity bill for a day. So every bit helps and every bit will go towards helping me writing more of the work you\u0027re looking forward to from me. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking because writing freelance and earning money from it has become almost impossibly difficult. In the past year alone, I spent days - and at times weeks - writing at least half a dozen articles, which were either not published for unknown reasons or published and the compensation hasn\u0027t reached me, yet. This is both frustrating emotionally and hurts my ability to keep myself fed, clothed and sheltered. Because I could have spent that time cleaning up floors at a Target instead and made money that I need, but I want to keep writing. That\u0027s why I\u0027m reaching out to you, my friends, readers and supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still clawing my way back from years of not having the ability to get paid for my work. The grants I get from school - where I study full-time - barely cover tuition and a few small expenses. I am also continuing my freelancing and fighting to get paid for it, so that\u0027s another avenue that will contribute money towards keeping me going. But I have no savings. And no monthly income beyond the little money I manage to grab from freelancing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther making the situation dire is the fact that I\u0027ve decided to move full-time with my parents and basically pay as much of the cost of their living as well as mine as I can. They\u0027re both retired; my mom is recovering from lung cancer and my dad has a heart condition. So... it\u0027s not just me I\u0027m trying to support - it\u0027s also two really sweet old people who I couldn\u0027t be happier to have in my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will give us a cushion to fall back on in case my freelance checks don\u0027t make it through. For now, I\u0027m pledging to write three articles a month, whether op-eds, essays or reports. And you\u0027ll get to read them all without any paywalls wherever they are published.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe key is, if you want to donate to support me, fantastic. If you cannot afford to or don\u0027t want to for some reason, that\u0027s still fine. I\u0027m not going to appreciate anyone more or less by how much they donate to keep me writing. I write because I believe it\u0027s important to amplify the voices of the oppressed\u00a0and to speak up for what\u0027s right, what\u0027s important and what\u0027s unspoken but needs to be. Thank you for sustaining me till now with your love, kindness and energy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForever yours,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJosh\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
