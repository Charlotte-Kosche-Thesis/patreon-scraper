I\u0027m currently competing in MDL as well as any ESL One / DreamHack / IEM circuits along with a handful of other smaller scale and less frequent events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon page is for people that are able to learn and apply what they\u0027ve learned to be able to give back what they feel the value of that information was. If you watch my videos and learn but can\u0027t spare a dime, that\u0027s completely fine. I\u0027m all about having information being publicly available and letting people decide how much or little they want to or are able to contribute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting / stopping by and I hope you were able to learn something.\u003cbr\u003e"
