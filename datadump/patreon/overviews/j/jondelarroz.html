As it stands now, I\u0027m going to be releasing at least four novels in 2018 alone, and I\u0027m working with some great teams to try to bring comics to readers as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to try Patreon as a way to fund comic production. Eventually, I\u0027d like to get to a place where I can produce a monthly comic book just from the money raised.I know we\u0027ll be able to get there. But even at a slower initial pace, I\u0027ll be able to start getting comics to you the reader (on top of my books). My monthly goals look like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$ 125 - One professional comic page per month\u003cbr\u003e$ 500 - One professional comic page per week\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$ 2,750 - One professional 22-page comic per month.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027m willing to write \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and create more awesome content for you in order to make these happen. It means you\u0027ll not only be helping me to fund comic production, but you\u0027ll be getting a lot of awesome stories too! With your contribution, we\u0027ll be able to make big waves in culture.\u003cbr\u003e"
