I\u0027ve lived in Prague my whole life and Czech is my native language. It\u0027s also the language that gave us the word \"robot\". Czech science fiction and fantasy doesn\u0027t end with Karel \u010capek or Josef Nesvadba. It\u0027s been thriving for countless decades and still produces beautiful, mindbending works.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you need proof, check out Hanu\u0161 Seiner\u0027s short story \"\u003ca href=\"http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/terra-nullius/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTerra Nullius\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\" in \u003cem\u003eStrange Horizons\u003c/em\u003e and novelette \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.tor.com/2017/05/10/hexagrammaton/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHexagrammaton\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\" at \u003cem\u003eTor.com\u003c/em\u003e. I translated both of them, and luckily there\u0027s more where they came from. Seiner often reminds me of Greg Egan and Ted Chiang, but it would be too easy to stop at that. Each writer is unique.

Nah. I know stories that would keep you awake at night with a book under your blanket, that would blow your mind or brighten your day. But if you\u0027re not a Czech speaker, someone has to translate them first (in this case into English). I guess that would be me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut translation is demanding and time-consuming, which makes it hard if you don\u0027t have a certainty that the piece will be published at professional rates. Unless it is, I have spent a lot of time doing something that just doesn\u0027t pay, although it has value. Some editors are willing to look at translation pitches or samples (which take time to prepare too), however, for most venues, having a full translated story is best, though it\u0027s extremely risky time/money-wise for the translator. I hope that you\u0027ll help me overcome that and come up with more great translations!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"But I want...\" Yes: What do \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach month, I\u0027ll share several patron-only posts for all supporters - let\u0027s call it \"glimpses of the life of a writer\", with all the tooth and claw that comes with that! They will include writing and publishing tips, minireviews and thoughts on what I\u0027ve read or seen recently, and some extra content (look below at \u003cem\u003eWhat\u0027s more?\u003c/em\u003e), and access to an overview of how much I wrote each day of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll backers pledging 5$ or more will also receive\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ea large chunk of my writing or translation in progress\u003c/strong\u003e, available both online and as a pdf download.\u00a0Top subscribers will be also eligible for one \u003cstrong\u003eshort story critique\u003c/strong\u003e per month (see Rewards).
