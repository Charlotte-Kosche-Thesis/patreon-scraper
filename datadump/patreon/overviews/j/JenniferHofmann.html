With over 70,000 subscribers (and growing!), my checklist has become a rallying cry for action and civility among groups of friends, Indivisible groups, Women\u0027s March huddles, and even disenfranchised conservatives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMany subscribers--including moderate Republicans--have complemented my thorough research, clear writing, and deliberate avoidance of polarization. Readers appreciate my Acts of Gratitude and lists of good news.  My checklist has been a recommended resource on HuffPo, the Karen Hunter Show, Tumblr, Medium, in spiritual, progressive, and feminist blogs and on conservative forums. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis checklist doesn\u0027t magically appear. It takes work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIt takes a lot of time and energy to produce my weekly checklist.

If I were charging my current published \u003ca href=\"https://jenniferhofmann.com/work-with-me/ghostwriting/\"\u003ehourly writing rate\u003c/a\u003e  ($75/hr), creating a month of these checklists would cost $8700. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMy buddy Jennifer B. volunteers 2-3 hours each week, sharing her keen-eyed skills as a professional editor.

Do I sometimes get weary and tired? Yes. But is it worth standing up for our fellow citizens\u0027 rights and our country\u0027s future? Absolutely.
