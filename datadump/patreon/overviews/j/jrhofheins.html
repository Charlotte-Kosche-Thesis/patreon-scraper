    "summary": "Consider this content to be leading edge and life giving yet in DRAFT FORM and ever being addended. You get first peek as the content builds and forms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving almost always been open to the Wisdom in the Wind, others have discovered me as\u00a0something of a clarifier, an objective encourager; Someone receiving insight that I pass along to others who are attracting it or interested. \u003cbr\u003eOver the years I have enjoyed the aligned role of assisting others in locating solutions, and better- assisting them in listening in for the answers themselves.\u003cbr\u003e Counselor, Professor, Leader, Mentor..Ive been told I should, would, could \u00a0write books. However, eventually I admitted to myself that I never really felt like sitting down long enough to complete a book. Plus once something is written down, it\u0027s basically obsolete; \u00a0something new is coming in!. B U T....I like writing a page or two of what I\u0027m receiving clarity around and the information is often helpful to and appreciated by my psychology students, by a few people on Twitter (@jrhofheins) and by the staff, groups,and conference gatherings to whom I have spoken the current stuff at the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s see what the parts can come together to create! \u00a0Webinars? \u00a0A series of articles? A compendium of articles as a book? \u00a0I\u0027ve played with it, what seems like loose parts can definitely become components in a \"whole\". Each piece is either ongoingly unfolding or being replaced by the \"new next\".\u003cbr\u003eDue to the naturally expanding nature of the universe, my work will always be in process. Energy is always flowing and changing. Therefore the world, people, ideas, creations are changing...\"upleveling\" I like to say. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe process for anything is always like that for me. What is \"lit up\" is what I act on. And something is always lit up. The inducement for me is to pay attention 360 degrees. Think of this as a sort of an ongoing conversation that is never complete, but is helping us clarify along the way for the effect of calm spirits amidst change. It\u0027s fun!\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your interest and participation in uplifting and encouraging others/ the world to recognize who we humans really are.\u003cbr\u003e[Note: If ever someone else\u0027s video is used it is purely to show support of and collaboration with the piece I have personally written, to spread that person\u0027s message is for the good of all who view it. The credit belongs to the creators of those videos and monthly support is only associated with what I have personally created].\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eon Amazon.com Humans Are Higher Frequencies; and Higher Frequency Parenting.

Since as far back as I can remember I was receiving input from what I know now was Infinite Love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBecoming fearful of reactions around me when I began to reveal the calming clarity I was gaining, I sort of denied myself the continued opportunity, and began to practice listening to others instead of the Wisdom that had been fresh air and life into my body and mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe more I have dropped discomfort of being around the energy of \" life is hard\" theory, the more clarity and enjoyment have resurfaced.\u003cbr\u003eLife is easy. It\u0027s meant to be easy and enjoyable. I\u0027m practicing the expansion of that and intend to model it for others so more earth dwellers can also catch whiffs of the Wisdom in the Wind.",
