Welcome to my little place among the 1\u0027s and 0\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Joey, and while by day I may resign myself to a life as a Computer Nerd, fighting the injustices of paper-based processes across the vast landscape of healthcare. By the rise of the moon,\u00a0I tie tight a homemade cape and become... \"A creator.\" (Queue Heroic Theme Song). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a creator (or one that I want to be), I figured I\u0027d try out this Patreon thing as a way to share my work and possibly garner public support for those efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e::Gasp:: Maybe I can work towards a life of creating rather than a half-life of such. Wouldn\u0027t that be great!?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have two fiction novels I have begun to dream up, loads of photography to share, a blog in the works meant to discuss social change. I let myself run in many directions, it\u0027s a flaw, I know, but this place is primarily for my writing to be shared. I hope this platform will help motivate me to continue providing content and essentially help nudge me across the finish line for the works i\u0027ve already begun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that all being said, thank you for stopping by, and I hope that I can create something that you will enjoy!\u00a0"
