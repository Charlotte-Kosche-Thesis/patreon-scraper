I\u2019m a 37 year old self published author, who likes, besides writing science fiction, enjoys drawing and play video games. I\u2019m a liver transplant recipient, cancer survivor, and a Capricorn; if that kind of things matters to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s get to the bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWe\u2019ve all worked jobs we hated but we did it anyway because we all have a powerful need to eat. I\u2019ve done this as well, but it left zero time to feed those creative outlets that are as important to me breathing is to you. Having to chose, do I spend my limited free time and days off with family, friends, or making art was killing me because it always felt like I was neglecting something at the cost of something else. When I\u2019d spend time with my friends, I think about being home writing or drawing. Games piled up. I barely saw my family.\u003cbr\u003eThis had to stop. And finally it did.\u003cbr\u003eIf you check some of the recent posts, my health isn\u2019t great at the moment so I was forced to take a medical leave of absence from work; without pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have all the time in the world to write, draw, and game, but no money.\u003cbr\u003eAnd unfortunately in the world we live in, having no money is a problem.\u003cbr\u003eI want to say right now that I\u2019m not asking for money because I\u2019m out of work. I\u2019d rather be working and getting paid for what I do and that is what this Patreon is for. Getting paid for the work I do, with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the time now to focus on writing, drawing, and making Let\u2019s Play Videos and that is how I want to make a living.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a creator:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to move away from generic advertising that stands between the creator and the audience.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to be able to subsist as an artist, without having to have a day job. I\u0027ve seen too many members of my family put their creative talent on hold or channel it into some project to which they have no passion, simply because being an artist couldn\u0027t pay the bills.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI don\u0027t want to feel like I\u0027ve given up on the best part of me, to work a job I don\u0027t love simply because that job provides a meager bit of security.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to feel like I\u0027m giving the best part of myself to those who want to and and are eager to enjoy it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to be a self sustaining artist that isn\u0027t force to compromise my art because it doesn\u2019t pay the bills.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want the time to get better not only for myself, but for you the audience as well. This takes time as do all things, but it\u2019s time I have and together we can make things, better.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs an Audience Member:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI want to create work that is directly linked to the audience and serves what they want to see.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in and you the consumers of art and creativity and I the creator become partners. Through an interactive and dynamic community, we can engage directly with one another and together create something better than either could have achieved separately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe will is there, now all that is required is the means to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a direct supporter of my creative efforts and help me make art. Nothing will be hidden behind a paywall or flooded with outside advertising. You will always have access to my work here and across the web for free, unless I deem the work so substantial that it needs to be sold at a higher price than the single $1 tier that all members join at. For example, if I were release a novel, that would definitely be for sell, however Patreon members would get early advanced copies or perhaps a discount of some kind. We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish you the very best and to those who have decided to take this journey with me, you have my most sincere gratitude and thanks.\u003cbr\u003e--Jon"
