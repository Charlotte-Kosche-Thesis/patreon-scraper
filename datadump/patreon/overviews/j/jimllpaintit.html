What started as a hobby eventually took over all my free time and I ended up quitting my job to keep up with demand. I have never asked for any money for the hundreds of pictures I\u0027ve painted for people, instead supporting myself by selling prints and T-shirts of the resulting artwork, all of which is proudly made on Microsoft Paint XP. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGenerally this has worked out pretty well. But ever harsher restrictions on non-sponsored Facebook reach means it\u0027s becoming harder to make ends meet. And just because someone might appreciate the work I do and enjoy seeing it on their Facebook or Instagram feed, it doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that they want to wear it on their chest or put it on their wall. The weirder and darker my paintings are, the less money I can hope to make from them and the harder it is to support myself and keep the project going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, it\u0027s understandable that while a lot of people may \u0027like\u0027 my recent Thomas the Flesh Abomination piece, considerably less want it hanging in their living room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://likeregularchickens.com/thomascompare.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCan you see the problem here?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of changing the direction of the project or picking requests just because I think they might sell, I would rather keep Jim\u0027ll Paint It as irreverent and occassionally revolting as it needs to be and instead ask my fans for a little help in keeping it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a supporter won\u0027t mean preferential treatment in terms of what requests I choose to paint - \u003cstrong\u003eJim\u0027ll Paint It is free for everyone and always will be\u003c/strong\u003e - but you will get exclusive goodies as a thank you for helping to keep things weird.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patreon supporters will get access to my Patreon feed.
