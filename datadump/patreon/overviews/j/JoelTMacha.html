I\u0027ve written a few unpublished books, but until recently, I didn\u0027t have the strong, supportive writing group I needed to continue my writing. And I realized that was something a lot of aspiring writers don\u0027t have. So I want to write articles and make videos talking about how someone in your position might overcome the challenges you\u0027re facing in your own writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons can expect \u003cstrong\u003ewriting tips\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ewriting prompts \u003c/strong\u003eweekly - \u003cstrong\u003eexclusively for patrons\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot an aspiring author?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot a problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be uploading \u003cstrong\u003ereviews of comics, movies, websites, programs and more\u003c/strong\u003e, both as articles and exclusive videos.

A small donation from you encourages me to continue. By writing and making videos, I might just help out other aspiring authors while getting ready to publish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink Kickstarter, but way cheaper and cooler. You donate a few bucks, and I continue writing and making videos. You can pay any amount you want, and can even set a limit for yourself, since it\u0027s pay per post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this takes off, I\u0027ll be doing more. What does this mean to you? More, higher quality content. I will eventually have art, more videos and I want to do story reviews. I might even review your story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave questions? Just ask.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want this to be interactive for you.
