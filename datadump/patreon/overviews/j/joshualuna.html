But the problem with my comic strips is that there is no promise of income at all.\u00a0 And that\u0027s where your help comes in!\u00a0 I have been releasing my comic strips for free, and I will continue to do so, but if you enjoy them, please consider supporting me with donations.\u00a0 Your pledge will not only keep the comic strips coming, but will ultimately help bring the book closer to release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny pledge, no matter how small, is greatly appreciated. I\u0027d be honored for you to join me on this journey to exciting new beginnings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Joshua Luna\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.joshualuna.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
