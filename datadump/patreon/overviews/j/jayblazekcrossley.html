    "summary": "I love making maps, analyzing census data, analyzing things politicians say, analyzing the people allowed to make certain decisions, thinking about how to make streets and transit and pepper plants stronger and better. In my work, I am pretty much at an aha moment several times a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes it is deep in a giant excel file on TXDOT spending in rural counties. Sometimes it is at a Senate hearing on flooding. Sometimes it\u0027s a vision of what Texas can be - or maybe what that little corner of that neighborhood could be. I\u0027ll post at least something every week, and sometimes a lot more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share these aha moments with you in their raw, unfiltered form, as they come. Screaming an amazing idea out across the room is part of how I work. So I hope you will join me in that room. I think it will be some neat stuff. I think we can help Texas grow better - together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of this will be from my work at Farm\u0026amp;City, but I want this space to be open to observations about politics, for mistakes, or exploring crazy ideas. Hopefully the best of what you find here will then be built upon to become major reports, new community efforts, opeds, and things out in the world. But this space is a closed room for you and me to explore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe opinions, ideas, claims, maps, and charts herein do not necessarily reflect the views of Farm\u0026amp;City or its board, staff, or supporters. All Patreon funds after fees will go directly to Farm\u0026amp;City, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. However, one of the things this nonprofit does is pay my salary to pursue our mission of high quality urban and rural Texas habitat in perpetuity. So that\u0027s good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for believing in Texas."
