I competed in youth chess competitions, then worked with teams to build format-defining Magic: the Gathering decks. I worked in the No Limit Hold \u0027Em community to develop theory and hammer out solutions to unexplored areas of the game, and have helped to fund AI which have eventually outgrown the ability of any human to play the game. For the last few years I\u0027ve been playing competitive strategy/tactics games like Civilization and XCOM, and even got to help work on XCOM 2: Long War 2 with Pavonis Interactive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal as a content creator is to break down what makes a game engaging and help viewers to connect with that game at a deeper level, and from there to be able to take the lessons they\u0027ve learned from the game into everyday life as tools for decision-making and understanding the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat keeps me going has always been the community that I\u0027ve played and studied games with, and as my Youtube and Twitch following has grown I\u0027ve loved getting to know more and more people who love games and want to share and discuss things about them with me. Patreon is a place for that community to have a voice in deciding which games I\u0027ll play next, what concepts I should explain or explore, what types of streams and videos I should make, or just to say thanks and support me keeping on doing what I\u0027m doing!\u003cbr\u003e"
