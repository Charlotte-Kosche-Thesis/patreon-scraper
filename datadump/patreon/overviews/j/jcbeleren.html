The premise is simple \u2014 Logan suddenly has the ability to speak words that aren\u0027t the truth, and his whole reality turns upside down. People believe everything he says, aligning their own thoughts and actions to match his words. When he tells his bitchy ex-girlfriend that she wants him back, she begs to fuck him. When he orders his gorgeous calculus professor to spread her legs, she can\u0027t imagine anything more pleasurable... But there are people out there who want to use Logan\u0027s powers for themselves. People who might not be bound by the same rules as everyone else.

Perfect 10s on his arm and dollars in his pocket that he earns teaching timid men how to approach, flirt with and bed beautiful women way out of their league. Of course, while his training works, Jason never gives away his true secret to success - he was born with the strange ability to sense and control the emotions of people around him. With a word, Jason can turn any woman into a subservient plaything, a hot, wanton bimbo willing and eager to do anything to please her new master. Everything is going Jason\u2019s way\u2026 Until he picks up the wrong woman. With a target on his back and the Mob\u2019s most highly-trained assassin closing in, Jason has one night to run, talk and fuck his way out of the most dangerous plight of his life\u2026 Or he might just end up getting made an example of.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTRANCE, Inc.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014 What if all pornstars had a secret hypnotic trigger phrase?\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0My current favorite storyline, Chance is a lowly quality control technician at the biggest producer of adult films in the country. When he realizes that a particular phrase turns actresses into horny, submissive playthings, his entire world is turned upside down, and in weeks he has a bevy of gorgeous, wanton women at his beck and call. But who is behind this mind control pandemic?
