    "summary": "For as long as I can remember, I have had a passion for music. It wasn\u0027t until my early twenties that I actually started creating my own music. I tried to deny my passion for a while, doing the sensible thing by entering the corporate world. Funny thing, though - you can\u0027t squelch your creativity forever and in 2006 it boiled over. I left the safer path and started out on the road less traveled, exchanging my corporate career for one as a performing songwriter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has been an incredible journey! I have my amazing family, friends and fans to thank for that. There is nothing more fulfilling for an artist than to have his creation touch and impact the lives of others. That is why I am so excited about this new platform. Through Patreon, I will finally be able to share my art in the way that will make it more personal to each of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron of my Patreon page, you will help me be able to continue making great music, writing and recording new songs, creating music videos, searching out new venues and everything else associated with the creation of this form of art. \u00a0You will receive exclusive access to music videos, intimate acoustic performances, learn the back stories behind the music, see how the creation process works and get a closer look at the heart of who I am. A lot of what will be released here (typically one to two posts each month) will not be shared with others on social media, on my website or through YouTube - they are only created for my Patrons. In addition to this content, when I do create something intended for the larger stage, my Patrons will be able to get a sneak peak and enjoy it first before the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge is per creation I post to this page and will enable me continue on this journey, living out my passion as an independent musician. Unlike other crowd funding programs that support one project at a time, this is an ongoing pledge to support continual creation of my artistry. As you set up your account and enter your pledge, you will be able to set a monthly maximum that fits into your budget. Please know that part of my work goes to support Donate Life \u00a0in their continual efforts to bring awareness to the organ donation registry and YoungLife in their efforts to be a positive influence on our youth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo come join me now by selecting a monthly pledge that fits your budget and be sure to check out the additional rewards I have for you at each level. I have so much I want to share with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn Tracy"
