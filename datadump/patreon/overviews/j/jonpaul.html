     "about": "Born in Beverly, Massachusetts on April 30, 1996, Jon Paul started singing at the age of 5. That young boy with lots of charisma, and the love for God, sprouted into a talented singer, songwriter, and musician. At the age of 10, Jon Paul\u0027s first instrument was the saxophone. In 2006, Jon\u0027s parents were informed that he has an ear for music by his musical teacher. Three years later, his family picked up and moved to El Paso, Texas. It was here that his musical journey began. In the summer of 2009, Jon picked up his guitar (which was gifted to him when he was 10 by his grandmother). Utilizing the free classes that were given on YouTube, Jon Paul sprang into action. At the age of 13, the first song he taught himself to play was El Mariachi (performed by the DNA strings). His next cover and big hit was \"I\u0027m Yours\" by Jason Mraz which he taught himself to play and sing all all at once. That year he entered the seventh grade talent show at Captain Walter E. Clarke Middle School where he took first place. From that day forward, Jon Paul has not looked back. He is not only chasing his dream but making it a career.",
