It\u0027s Jill Pantozzi here but you may know me better as... \"\u003cstrong\u003eThe Nerdy Bird\u003c/strong\u003e!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thenerdybird.com/2008/01/which-did-i-like-more-star-trek-teaser.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBack in January 2008\u003c/a\u003e when I started my \"Has Boobs, Reads Comics\" blog at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thenerdybird.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTheNerdyBird.com\u003c/a\u003e, I was working as a DJ and producer at a radio station in New Jersey. I\u0027d gone to school for journalism with the hopes of becoming a news anchor but couldn\u0027t pass the opportunity to be \"on air\" in whatever form that took. Several years later I was itching to write again and thus \"The Nerdy Bird\" was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though it was only a few years ago, the internet is a much different landscape than it is today. For one, there were less people online daily. It was easier to make friends and have real conversations. There also weren\u0027t many women writing about comic books. Today there are so many! I still have people find me at conventions or online to thank me for being a vocal lover, and critic, of comics and for helping them do the same.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot too long after I started reporting on TheNerdyBird.com, I started paid freelancing jobs at the most well-known comic book websites. While comics were usually my focus, I tended to tell people I wrote about \"all things nerdy\" and skipping ahead a few more years would find me in a full time job doing just that at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.themarysue.com/author/jill-pantozzi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Mary Sue\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout all this, my following from \"The Nerdy Bird\" were absolutely wonderful to me. From sharing my articles, my joys and sorrows, to helping support my various charitable involvements, and not unfollowing me for posting many, many, many cat photos, YOU were there. I \"met\" most of you online but every now and then I got to greet a smiling face in person to give a real hello and those were the moments that meant the most to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027m striking out on my own once again, I\u0027m hoping those of you who are willing and able will lend me a hand. TheNerdyBird.com is completely redesigned and I\u0027ve been working the last few weeks in secret to fill it anew with content! I will continue to do so regardless of whether or not anyone can support my Patreon but my hope is a few of you who\u0027ve mentioned wanting to help in the past can do so now. ANY amount you can give is a good amount.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping \"getting back to my roots,\" as it were, will help me reconnect with all the wonderful people I\u0027ve met over the last several years and help continue to foster all our enjoyment (and frustrations) of \"all things nerdy.\" Join me!"
