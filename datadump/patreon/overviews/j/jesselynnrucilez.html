Hopefully, one day my passions will be the core of my existence,\nrather than mere recreation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPeople often ask me what I write. Unfortunately, my fiction\ndoesn\u0027t fit into any specific genre. Thus far, I\u0027ve written about everything\nfrom giant evil teddy bears, suicidal junkies, porn stars, and witchcraft, to\nliving alien technology; all with a character driven, literary bent. From here\non I plan to write futuristic thrillers, dystopian satire, space opera,\nfantasy, and superhero novels. I like to blend genres, so everything will have\na touch of humor, romance, and action. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhatever it takes to tell the best story I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBe warned, however, that my writing is ferocious. I won\u0027t\never massage your brain. My intent is always to grab you by the throat and not\nlet go until you\u0027ve read the last line. I want to make you laugh. Make you cry.\nMake you love. Make you hate. Make you envy. Make you pity. Make you angry.\nMake you morose. I want to entertain, of course, but, most of all, I want to\nmake you think. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u0027s the power of good writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd if you choose to read my stories, I\u0027ll be eternally\ngrateful...but I will ask one favor: Please pay attention. Don\u0027t just let your\neyes skim over the words; be attentive to context and subtext, to character and\nmotivation, theme and style. Delve deep into my world and meet me halfway, and\nin return I\u0027ll promise you this: \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhether you like my writing or not, I\u0027ll never bore you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJLR \u003cbr\u003e",
