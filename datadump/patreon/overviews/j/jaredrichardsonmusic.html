I am an emerging composer, songwriter,\nand music producer from Victoria, BC, and a recent graduate of Berklee College\nof Music (Boston, MA) with a Bachelor of Music degree in Electronic Production\n\u0026amp; Design. I have written over 100 pieces of music in a diverse range of\ngenres, including pop, electronic music, jazz, film scores, and works for\nconcert band and orchestra. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver the past 8 years\nI have composed many orchestral works, several of which have had performances by\nthe Victoria Symphony and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Two of my pieces\nhave been performed at Victoria Symphony Splash, an outdoor concert in\nVictoria\u0027s Inner Harbour that attracts an audience of around 50,000 annually \u2013\nwhere I was honoured twice with the title of Victoria\u0027s only-ever \"Splash\nYoung Composer\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt\nBerklee College of Music, I studied film scoring, composition, and electronic music production, graduating with a major in Electronic Production \u0026amp; Design. While\nattending Berklee, I began to develop a\u00a0second brand as an electronic-pop songwriter/performer, with a\nsignature style featuring prominent melodies, contagious energy and groove, and a unique combination of influences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince graduating Berklee, I have had the opportunity to work alongside composer Tim Williams, as orchestrator and technical engineer on the recent blockbuster films \u003cem\u003eGet Out\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u003c/em\u003e.

I compose music\nthat embodies a thirst for adventure and discovery of the unknown. My process\nof composition is centered around melody, which I consider to be the most\nessential element in any piece of music.
