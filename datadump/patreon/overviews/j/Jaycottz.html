You most likely know me from being half-naked on Instagram, or most recently from Youtube/Twitch. After 3 years of just photos and small videos of me I want to bring you bigger and better things whilst keeping the basics running. I want to provide you with more content and another side of me. However, I cannot invest additional time unless I can make it more plausibly worth it, and this is where you can come in, and thank you so much for choosing or thinking to contribute to help keep me working on all my social media platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the advantages of supporting me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome closer to me, see a greater insight to my life, my world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me will allow me to focus more time on creating YouTube video content, live streams, and additional features like you have not seen before.
