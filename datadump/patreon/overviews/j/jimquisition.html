Where on Earth do we begin?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Jimquisition is a weekly webshow that criticizes the game industry, games themselves, and whatever else has inspired spirited discussion or incredulous shouting. It\u0027s presented by Jim \"Thank God For Me\" Sterling, who is probably a mortal man, but certainly one possessed of inhuman charisma and a near Godlike sex appeal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut for realsies, I\u0027ve been in the games criticism business for over ten years. Originally a reviewer and reporter for traditional games media, I grew sick and tired of obsolete business models, pressure from advertisers, and the increasing need for corporate sponsors. I never wanted to be in the position where I\u0027d have to hawk coke products on The Jimquisition, but it was made clear to me that if I stayed in traditional media, that\u0027s where I was headed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it is that I declared Jimdependence, delivering The Jimquisition and associated content directly to the viewer, supported by those who care enough to see my own brand of no-nonsense nonsense continue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd thank God for you... because it seems that quite a few of you care!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eWhat Does This Patreon Cover?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151,72,6);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThe Jimquisition Video Series\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy weekly webseries, ad-free, hosted on my YouTube channel (JimSterling), every Monday.

Listen to our pain!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as those two shows, the channel plays host to other occasional audio content, such Jim Won\u0027t Give Ian His VR, a series in which comedian Ian Boldsworth tries to bully me into giving him a VR headset.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Original Shows\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe success of The Jimquisition\u0027s Patreon has allowed me to hire a full-time art director, Justin McDaniel, which has resulted in a better main product and all-new content.

I hold myself to the same standards that I\u0027ve always held the game industry to - I want you to fund me because \u003cem\u003eyou want to fund me. \u003c/em\u003eI do not want to gate off content, hold it to ransom, or otherwise batter you into opening a wallet. While I will obviously need to raise awareness of this Patreon, I will not litter my videos and social media with constant calls for funding. I\u0027ll do \u003cem\u003esome \u003c/em\u003epromotion, because that makes sense, but I\u0027ll work hard so that it isn\u0027t obnoxious. You wanna watch and read my stuff, not be advertised to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo access my Jimquisition content, you need only access it. Pay as much or as little as you want. Pay nothing if you don\u0027t believe you should. And if you ever do become a patron, but decide to stop, no hard feelings. I get a lot of apologies from people who cut support due to financial issues - it\u0027s YOUR money, you are NOT obliged to give me any of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I love you for doing so. \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClearly, I\u0027ll need to be able to make a living off this in order to keep doing it, but it\u0027s your decision as to whether or not I do. I\u0027ve gone back and forth on the idea of crowdfunding. I\u0027ve been scared to do it, sometimes critical of it, and I\u0027ve always wanted to make stuff first and get paid later. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, Patreon allowed me to strike for true independence and editorial control. It\u0027s allowed me to bring my show to you, with increasingly entertaining production value, unfettered by corporate owners or obligations to some sketchy taskmaster.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I don\u0027t do it while hawking some bloody corn snack products.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eAnything To Declare?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclosure is important. I need to be upfront with you all to make this work. So let\u0027s be clear about what you will and will not be funding, as well as my other sources of income.

Whether I tackle a subject on The Jimquisition that you have opposing views on, or I love/hate a game you hate/love, there will be times where we philosophically clash. That\u0027s okay! I love civil disagreement, personally. Of course, some people take disagreement more personally and angrily, and they may expect that crowdfunding requires my views to align with theirs. That\u0027s impossible. If you choose to fund me, please be aware that my personal opinion is my personal opinion, and that I will share it even if you don\u0027t like it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eAre You Finished?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that covers most of it, but if anything else pops up, I\u0027ll cheerfully discuss it. The Jimquisition has been successfully funded by you lot for a couple of years now, and I hope it can continue. Seriously, thank you so much for keeping this going. It\u0027s meant the world to me, and kept my passion for the business running.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you fund me or not, thank you. Honestly, thank you.
