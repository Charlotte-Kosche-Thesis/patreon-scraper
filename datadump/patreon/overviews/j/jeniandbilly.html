     "about": "\"There are two kinds of music \u2013 the blues and Zip A Dee Doo Dah. That\u0027s what Townes Van Zandt said. But there is a third kind, which finds the best parts of both of those kinds of music and turns it into something seamlessly American and wonderful. That third kind is Jeni \u0026amp; Billy music.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u0027s the assessment of Grammy-nominated songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Dillon O\u0027Brian, who co-produced \"Picnic in the Sky,\" the latest studio recording from the Appalachian folk duo.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the first time in their eight-year partnership, Jeni \u0026amp; Billy recorded with a full band \u2014 a crack group of Los Angles-based musicians assembled by O\u0027Brian and Grammy-winning co-producer, Dave Way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe result is a sparkly new sheen on the impeccable storytelling and musicianship that fans expect from Jeni \u0026amp; Billy. But deep Appalachian roots of the music shine through.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNovelist Lee Smith says, \"Jeni and Billy\u0027s stunningly original music is as old as the hills, yet brand new at the same time. Jeni is a true poet and a born storyteller, through and through -- many of her songs contain whole novels.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Like their other records, it\u0027s organic and raw,\" Maverick Magazine writer Hazel Davis says. \"Jeni\u0027s voice still falters beguilingly and the duo\u0027s synergy is still very much audible. This new disc is a special treat for Jeni \u0026amp; Billy fans, but will be a classy introduction for the uninitiated.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJeni Hankins spent every summer of her childhood in the Southwest Virginia homes of her grandmothers \u2014 and every summer Sunday in the pews of the Friendly Chapel Church.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cMy grandmother\u2019s church was Pentecostal,\" Jeni says. \"People spoke in languages I didn\u2019t understand, they believed in a fire that did not burn, they fell down in the floor, and they sang. They sang loudly and passionately. Their singing got under my skin because it wasn\u2019t for prettiness or show -- they were hollering their story up to God with every ounce of their being. To me this is singing and this is songwriting -- to shout the story of life as an urgent message to the beyond.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cHankins\u2019 approach is often compared to that of Hazel Dickens (1925-2011) and aptly so,\u201d Rob Weir of \u201cSingOut!\u201d magazine writes.\u201d Though Hankins has a smoother, less nasal voice than Dickens, it has the same born-in-the-bone twang \u2013 the kind you don\u2019t get by dressing up country and scouring songbooks. Hankins also grew up in the same contiguous coal mine region that spawned Dickens, and with the same sensibilities: an appreciation for the grace of ordinary people, mountain gospel music, support for miners\u2019 unions, and a gift for finding beauty where less attuned people fail to see it.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBilly Kemp\u0027s schooling in the traditions of mountain music took place in the mill village of Ellicott City, Maryland, among Appalachian migrants who had come to escape the mines and work in the mills, bringing their fiddles and banjos with them. Billy listened and learned becoming a versatile instrumentalist who can soar in any style from Rockabilly to Indian ragas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Jeni\u0027s songs spring from the true vine,\u201d said Mary Smith, Director of the Richmond (VA) Folk Music Society. \u201cBilly is the perfect partner, skillfully accompanying Jeni with guitar, banjo and harmonies. These two are tradition bearers -- the next generation of traditional music.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat Southwest Virginia catch in Jeni\u2019s voice blends perfectly with Billy\u0027s finely tuned vocal harmonies. Jeni\u2019s solid rhythmic playing provides a solid bed for Billy\u0027s syncopated and gorgeously melodic guitar and banjo solos and fills. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs producer Dave way puts it, Jeni \u0026amp; Billy are \"the sweetest, most down to earth, good people making music just like that. Their roots run deep and sprout the most fragrant flowers.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTheir brand new CD, \"Picnic in the Sky,\" is available at cdbaby.com and jeniandbilly.bandcamp.com. More information about Jeni \u0026amp; Billy, including a tour calendar, is available at jeniandbilly.com.\u003cbr\u003e",
