They instruct us (me) to provide access to the \"rewards\" after you\u0027re charged so you gain access on the 1st of the following month. However, if you sign up at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.moxie.games\"\u003emoxie.games\u003c/a\u003e separately you get instant access to hold you over until your Patreon membership kicks in.\u003cbr\u003e"
