I plan to use all the funds I gain from Patreon to invest in my writing and really push the envelope as far as I can take it. So that means professional editors, cover designers, websites, marketing, and more\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does all that mean for you though?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2026It means that every friend you share my stories with is only going to make future episodes better and give me more time to focus on writing, which will help me release faster.\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy The Captain\u2019s Inferno :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eRegards,\u003cbr\u003eJordan T.
