Whether you become a Patron or not, know that I appreciate you and every second of support you give me, and have given me, no matter how small. Any kind of support is big to me, very big. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m James Redwine and I\u0027ve been expressing my creativity, consistently posting weekly YouTube videos since January 2016, and since then I\u0027ve discovered there was more to me to give, more to me that I wanted to express to the world. Being able to express this creativity and having it impact people in positive ways has given me a new sense of self and purpose.\u003cbr\u003eI never knew who I was, always feeling out of place and disconnected from the rest of the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBecause of this new found creative outlet and your support I\u0027ve discovered who I am.\u003cbr\u003eLoud and Quiet, Liberal and Conservative, Popular and a Loner, Out-going and shy, normal and weird (really weird). Apparently, I\u0027m a guy of contradictions but i think that\u0027s my charm (if i have charm). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon? Why Should You Support Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowd-funding platform for content creators, but instead of supporting one big project one time, you can support continuous, small projects on a monthly basis. Becoming someone\u0027s \"Patron\" helps content creators like myself maintain a consistent stream of funding. My content is free and will remain free, don\u0027t worry! \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is simply a way to support the creators you really care about\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cem\u003eif you choose to do so\u003c/em\u003e. Even if it\u0027s just a dollar - every bit helps!\u003cbr\u003eAll funds received will be put back into my creating, updating video equipment and accessories, and post-production software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Content Do I Make?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my main YouTube Channel, \u003cem\u003eJames Redwine\u003c/em\u003e, I produce a variety of content, such as parodies, skits, short films, original music (kind of), reviews, current events, tags (but always with a James twist), and vlogs (again always with a James twist).\u003cbr\u003eI also created and manage a YouTube Collab Channel, \u003cem\u003ePositively We\u003c/em\u003e, where myself and 4 other YouTubers around the world, discuss mental health awareness, positivity, mindfulness, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy future goals include, 3 more channels that have been created. They\u0027re just waiting for uploaded content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIndependent Living Skills\u003c/em\u003e - A channel dedicated to creating learning content for adults with mental disabilities, using my 16 years experience working with said population.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJames Redwine Vlogs\u003c/em\u003e - A normal vlogging channel, that focuses on my daily life, family, friends, and behind-the-scenes on all other videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Pagan Guy\u003c/em\u003e - This is where I get to discuss the most personal aspects of my life. My religion. I plan to inform, discuss, and enlighten, hopefully shedding judgments and misconceptions, as well as creating content to show my spiritual journey from Christian to Atheist to Pagan. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, I\u0027d like to thank you very much. Any kind of support no matter how small means I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more time and resources to what matters most to me. Positive thoughts and best wishes to all. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
