Small businesses and nonprofit organizations need support, but they can\u0027t always afford to hire a consultant or other service professionals. Yet, when folks try to do it themselves, they frequently get isolated and overwhelmed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd then there are all of those hucksters who are only in it for the money.

Because, in the era of social media,\u00a0there\u0027s more to marketing \u00a0than tips and tricks.\u003c/h2\u003e\nLet\u0027s face it, you won\u0027t get your marketing done if it\u0027s a \"should.\" If marketing is an obligation, something you \n\u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to do (but don\u0027t want to do), it becomes a chore.
