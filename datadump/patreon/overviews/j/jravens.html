Well It\u0027s mods for your PC games! \u003cbr\u003eSome of the mods are good, some are great and some (not many) are complete and utter crap. You be the judge. One thing though that is always true though is I put my heart into them and my sole purpose for doing it is to make YOUR playthroughs better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is more to it than that of course, but you get the point. The thing is, this is a very hard kind of thing to monetize. What do you do when you make things that are meant to be free? I don\u0027t really want to ask for other people\u0027s hard earned money... especially for free mods. This is a labor of love, but it eats up all my time and I often have to juggle work against modding when really (and let\u0027s be honest here) I would rather just be modding for you guys for you guys. It\u0027s what I love. This Patreon is my way to be able to continue doing that for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Back Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make a whole lot of stuff for free, but sadly it can get rather expensive and take lots of time. This is especially true for large mods and overhauls which can take weeks or even months to develop. Supporting me on Patreon not only allows me to keep making this stuff, but also lets me keep it free while giving backers exclusive access to mod updates, beta tests, and all kinds of cool and unique stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you believe in my work too, and you like what I\u2019ve created so far, please consider supporting my efforts on here, or alternatively making a one-time contribution \u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/JRavens\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much!"
