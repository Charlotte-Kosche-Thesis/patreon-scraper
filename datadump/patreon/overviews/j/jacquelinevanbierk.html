It was a ton of fun but like most things, it didn\u0027t last; dealing with different personalities, creative differences, financial responsibilities and just in general people\u0027s goals and priorities that change over time. Music is my life and I can\u0027t live without it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward, here I am. A new path. A new beginning. I love playing shows, connecting with my fans, traveling, making music, collaborating, evolving and experimenting. Let the journey begin!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePATREON is an excellent platform for artists and fans to stay connected and interact with each other. With your pledge you enable me to release high quality content every month. I release between 2-4 video\u0027s a month. Never more than four, usually two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat You Pledge Does:\u003cbr\u003eHelps me make music, release\u00a0albums, music videos, merchandise, hit the road and tour cool venues, release more awesome content, including paintings, fashion accessories and e-books. You basically inspire and motivate me to make art in any way shape or form. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cool thing about Patreon is, you decide how much you want to invest in me per month and project, you can change the amount any time and set a limit so you\u0027ll never go over your budget.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll only get charged when I actually create something. No RISK to you at all! Plenty of motivation for me! I will most likely never release more than 4 videos a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to have you and forever grateful for your support! Feel free to contact me on here, say hello, ask me any questions you might have!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e;)\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003eJVB\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
