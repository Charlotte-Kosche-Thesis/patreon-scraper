    "summary": "This is an experiment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe culture we live in seems to have defined art as a business. An artifact is produced, marketed and sold to market just as any other consumable. This model makes the working artist a small business, competing with other artists in every conceivable market in order to win market share, gain popularity and hopefully profit off of their creation. This also seems to mean that those with the most investment capitol will win the majority of market share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I believe that every artist creates freely, and most creatively, if their means of survival are secured. Most artists, including myself, would gladly give away their creations if it wasn\u0027t their sole source of income, as it is the process of creation that I enjoy, Not the selling of products.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery artist has an audience that would like to support the art they love. Often times that same audience can\u0027t afford the prices that their favorite artists charge. As a tattooer I frequently engage with clients that want to do larger work, but cant afford the cost of a tattoo.\u00a0 I want my work to be worn and viewed by those that truly want it and would like to be able to offer something to those that desire what I have to offer. In other words, I want a win-win relationship with those that enjoy my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon! The patron model allows an artist to have some upfront financial capitol to create freely without the fear of not selling. It also allows the artist to directly engage with his/her audience allowing feedback and a fair exchange of goods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, How does it work? Simple. By becoming a patron you are essentially subscribing to my artistic process. You help me achieve the financial security to produce art and I in turn make it easier for you to have that work. Along with special offers and \"patron-only\" content, you get a discount code for purchases from my online store at \u003ca href=\"http://jacobsenart.bigcartel.com/\"\u003eBigcartel.com\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I would like to do with this platform is still taking shape in my mind, But what I would love is to be able to create things that directly connect to an audience, to create community around my work so I can best serve others needs rather than just appeal to their fancy. Art is nothing without this connection and I would love to be able to affect the world around me in a positive and beautiful way that promotes the change I wish to see in the world. If you would be willing to help me, even in the smallest of ways, You become someone very special to me. You become the reason, the drive and the accountability to me to do good work in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are four tiers of support available, Starting from the basic fan level of $1/month up to $25/month. With each tier you get more benefits as a thank you for helping me do my thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTIER ONE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $1 a month, you\u2019ll receive \u003cbr\u003e\u202210% off anything in my online store. including prints and originals!\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron allows you to view patron only content and take part in exclusive offers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTIER TWO:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $5 a month you\u0027ll receive \u003cbr\u003e\u00a020% off the online store!   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTIER THREE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003efor $10 a month you\u2019ll receive \u003cbr\u003e\u202220% off the online store \u003cbr\u003ePlus a free gift every 6 months \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTIER FOUR:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $25 a month you\u0027ll receive everything in the previous tiers, \u003cbr\u003e\u202220% off the online store,\u003cbr\u003e\u2022a free gift every 6 months\u003cbr\u003eplus an original painting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigher donations are available for negotiation but will have to be done on a person by person basis.
