Without religious doctrine. Without family strings. And without dependency on a teacher. It would need to be peer-led. And the community would need to be continual (not just a weekend or even a year). I also wanted it to be accessible, which meant it would need to be online. And affordable. \" \u003cbr\u003e- Debbie Happy Cohen\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eI have been on a deep quest for truth since age 19. This search led me to meet the most interesting people and study the most far out practices, to find myself. Including metaphysics, psychology and best practices for teaching and learning. Most amazingly, I learned how and where LOVE gets stuck and how to release it so it can flow again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I continued discovering new ideas, I loved sharing them with others. I wrote books like \u201cReach Your Stars!\u201d to help people find themselves and take steps toward their dreams. I brought \"Reach Your Stars!\" workshops to thousands of students and teachers, and developed and led a yearlong mentorship program for a group of 15 foster teenagers. I taught Mastermind classes to help people clarify their vision and manifest really amazing and cool things and experiences. Which we all did. It was fun! \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAnd yet... something essential seemed to be missing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a difficult break-up which caused me to question everything I had studied, I took a sabbatical for a few years. During that time, I wrote and published a children\u2019s book called \u201cI Don\u2019t Think So!\u201d And I painted. A lot. And I traveled. A lot. And discovered a couple of teachings which changed my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found what was missing and saw a void that needed to be filled in the world. A structure needed to be built for people like me, who had done so much inner work and who were seeking a place to hang their hat, where they could continue to grow among like-minded others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI envisioned a place where people could develop their sense of empowerment and JOY. Without religious doctrine. Without family strings. And without dependency on a teacher. It would need to be peer-led.

And affordable.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I shared the idea and asked for support. After a successful Kickstarter campaign in June 2016 and a year of re-designing the online experience, our \u201cclubhouse\u201d is thriving. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur members co-authored this description: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cJBL is an online safe haven and community for learning, honoring and practicing unconditional Love with the intent to embrace and empower greater Joy!\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe structure for our community was deliberately designed to create as much safety as possible. Because growth, development, thriving and JOY are not possible without safety. The fact that our members expressed it so clearly was validating to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery single day, our members have the great privilege of being with others as we each expand our feelings of safety, into greater joy, and from there into becoming more fully self-expressed in the world! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we grow, we give back to other members through sharing our own experiences, offering encouragement and holding space for one another.
