    "summary": "Hey there Dudes and Dudettes its you\u0027re Friendly neighborhood JaxBlade here and there is nothing more and enjoy than helping people see that they can become better themselves. As many of you know I used to be a chubby anime fanboy getting bullied and beaten up and led to believe I could never amount to anything. But my inspiration from Fictional Characters from Anime and Cartoons has helped me transform myself into the strong individual. I have a Series on my Channel Called \u003cstrong\u003eTOUGH LIKE THE TOONZ \u003c/strong\u003ewhere I take Fictional Characters and make a Workout program based on them so you can achieve and similar body type and attributes to that character.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NQvKuBJyAw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4LTXILjQSY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SO0flJikCb8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here today and I want to share my knowledge and experiences to help others see and reach their inner potential which I know is full of Greatness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know you\u0027re more than likely Asking\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy do you want money?\u003c/h2\u003eCurrently,my video creation process is severely slowed down by my 5 Day a week Day Job at a Fast Food Restaurant, I know right a Fitness dude working fast food its sad. While I Also do Online Coaching and Personal Training its not always a consistent paycheck like that job I\u0027ve had since I was 19 years old and going college fulltime learning all About Fitness Science. I really want to be able to use this Knowledge I\u0027ve learned to HELP people better themselves instead of letting people eat themselves to death. The more money I\u0027m able to earn online, the less I have to get through other jobs, which frees us up to make more videos! Plus, if I\u0027m able or better off making our living partially or completely on the internet You\u0027lll see a MASSIVE INCREASE In Quality and more Uploads I can put my heart and soul into studying like my Would that Workout Series?
