The library is open-source and \nreleased under the MIT license as the original one.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis library is free and will stay free, but needs your support to \nsustain its work. There are lots of stuff and features to implement. \u003cbr\u003eIf you use this imgui jvm port or have the \nmeans to do so, please consider financial support.\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Imgui\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, essentially because Dear ImGui is the de-facto debug gui (and often even in production).\u003cbr\u003eWhen making games or real-time interactive applications, ImGui \nmakes making tools and debugging unusually trivial, dare I say fun \nagain. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s really easy to setup and ideal for small independent \ndevelopers. It also works well for bigger productions and the original \nversion is being used \non several console titles by different studios, while this port is \nactually being used in one visibility-field-analysis CAD program. \u003cbr\u003eWhen it becomes easy for\n everyone in your team to naturally make tools, your process and \nproductivity can improve drastically. Make better 3D application, faster.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy not a binding\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUnfortunately on the jvm world a lot of standard and awesome tools existing on C/C++ are missing and this is one the case.\u003cbr\u003eGiven the importance of having a solid and customizable gui, a binding wasn\u0027t the best option. Since I was looking for something that I could modify, play with it and adapt to my needs, I went with the porting.\u003cbr\u003eA full port allows to take advantage of:\u003cbr\u003e- possibility to customize it\u003cbr\u003e- optimization by the jvm\u003cbr\u003e- garbage collector\u003cbr\u003e- debugging it to the bone\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI started working on the port on May 2016, I managed to\n port some stuff but I never reached a working point and having other priority I temporarly put it in standby. \u003cbr\u003eThen, after circa an year, I kept again the development and this time with the advantage of Kotlin on my side and now I have reached a point where the porting is not yet complete, but quite usable.\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately the features we need at work are quite basic, so I don\u0027t have the \nresources\u00a0 to finish it at the same pace any more. \u003cbr\u003ePatreon funding allows me \nto spend more time finishing the port, taking care of its mantenance and synchronization with the original and add some cool stuff that only a modern language such as Kotlin can offer (like functional programming).\u003cbr\u003e Your help is \nvery meaningful to me. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour help allows me to keep working on the port of ImGui by:\u003cbr\u003e- Finishing it by mostly adding all the cool widgets \u003cbr\u003e- Maintaining it synchronized with the original version by Omar Cornut\u003cbr\u003e- Improving the performances (on the opengl side and not only)\u003cbr\u003e\n- Improving existing features, with the variety of usage patterns and \never growing expectations there are not lack of improvements\u003cbr\u003e\n- Adding new features (e.g. new layout helpers, tabs, keyboard control, \ndrawing primitives, remote viewer, docking, color picker, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e- Implementing some additional aliased calls that accept lambdas in order to avoid the boilerplate begin*() ... end*() to make code cleaner and less error prone\u003cbr\u003e\n- Answering questions on the github, provide support to users and applications using ImGui.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Keeping a watch on the architecture, so it stays simple and efficient.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Developing a testing framework to more thoroughly test for regression, keep the library safe and stable.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Making it easier for anyone to extend ImGui and share their code.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Providing more examples, possibly web-pages with visuals and lots of usage tips.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease see the GitHub for mode details:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui\"\u003ehttps://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd also the Github of the C++ version\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ocornut/imgui\"\u003ehttps://github.com/ocornut/imgui\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
