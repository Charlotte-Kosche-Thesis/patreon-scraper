I would love it if you would consider partnering with me to bring my songs to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking if you would consider paying $2 or $5 or $10 (Whatever you are comfortable with) when I release a new song. \u003cstrong\u003eYou only pay what you want and \u003cem\u003eONLY\u003c/em\u003e when I put out new content.\u003c/strong\u003e In exchange you will get a copy of the song first plus exclusive content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePartnering with me will help with distribution costs, licensing fee\u0027s, mastering costs, etc... But best of all it will give me the time to put into each and every song to make it as great as I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make this a cool community and as rewarding for you as possible. So along with getting a copy of my music first I will also be releasing exclusive demo versions, acoustic version and behind the scenes look at the songs to my Patreon friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the simplest and best way I have seen to support the artists you enjoy and help ensure that their songs continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e SO MUCH for your support! \u003cstrong\u003eClick \"Become a Patron\" \u003c/strong\u003eto get started and see exclusive content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy the music and that these songs can impact you in some way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*I am working to release only 1 song per week. If I release more than that you will not be charged for additional songs per week.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
