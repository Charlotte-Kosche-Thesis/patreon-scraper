    "summary": "Hello folks, Joey Waggoner here. For those of you who don\u2019t know me I\u2019m a web cartoonist, writing and drawing comics in the style of the classic cartoons. Welcome to my patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u2019t know what Patreon is, Patreon is a website that allows fans to donate money to their favorite content creators. Kind of like Kickstarter, but for a longer running project. It\u2019s basically like an online tip jar. You put in what amount of money you would like to donate to the creator of your choice (as much or as less as you want) and later on Patreon charges you that amount and sends it to the creator (in my case, patrons are charged at the beginning of every month).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow as fun as it is being a cartoonist it isn\u2019t the highest paying job, but luckily this is where you come in. Now, just to make it clear the comics will still be put up to read for free, donating is completely optional, but with your help and donations I can focus more on getting the comics done faster and not have to worry about financial troubles. Not to mention that with enough money I\u2019ll be able to start working on some new projects as well. Plus not only will you be helping me, but you\u2019ll also get some great rewards! It\u2019s a win-win situation, I get money and you get some cartoony comics and extra rewards. What\u0027s not to love?\u003cbr\u003e"
