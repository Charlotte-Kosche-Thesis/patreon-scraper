    "summary": "I\u2019ve spent years trying to\nframe our political dialogue in ways that are grounded in basic civics. Too\noften we see coverage that gets the basic stuff wrong, or that doesn\u2019t call out\nwhen the parties and players are playing fast and loose with the system and the\nrules, and I\u2019m hoping to create more spaces to have these conversations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.routineproceedings.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRoutine Proceedings\u003c/a\u003e has grown tremendously over the past five years, and is widely read\nby MPs, senators, and political junkies across the spectrum. But it\u2019s been a\nlabour of love that I spend two or three hours a day on, six days a week, with\neven more time spent on QP recaps when Parliament is in session. I\u2019m also\nlooking to expand my digital footprint with a video channel to provide\nopportunities to engage with Canadian politics junkies, and to provide some\nunique content, along with some new voices that currently aren\u2019t being heard.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause I\u2019m doing this as a\nfreelancer without any help from a steady day job, I\u2019m counting on the\ngrassroots support of you, my readers and followers, who are looking for\ndifferent voices than we see in the mainstream, and having different\nconversations than we see on the network shows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe plan is for weekly\ncontent that will alternate between explainer pieces, interviews, and answering\nyour questions posed over Twitter, as well as segments that will delve into\nsections of my book,\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dundurn.com/books/Unbroken-Machine\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Unbroken Machine\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, and how it relates to issues that\nare being seen in the news of the day. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAbout me:\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been a member of the\nCanadian Parliamentary Press Gallery since 2008, and I have a fairly obsessive\nknowledge about Canadian politics. Much of that knowledge is about the\ninstitutions of parliament itself, which are fundamental to understanding how\nCanadian politics works. I first got my taste of politics as a page in the\nAlberta Legislature back in high school, and when I later moved to Ottawa, that\ninterest turned into a full-time career in reporting on federal politics. Later\non, when I did my Masters in Journalism, I examined the role of\ncommunity-of-interest media in the Press Gallery, for which I learned more\nabout the history of the Gallery.
