Community. From that moment onward, I took some significant steps towards bettering myself and preparing myself for being the best person I could be. \u00a0I looked unto the world with wide-eyes and the curiosity of a toddler, exploring with a completely open heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter spending three months deeply entrenched in the beautiful home sometimes known as \"The Vegan Tree\" I knew where my heart had been this whole time -- I signed up for a ten day silent Vipassana Meditation course which helped me perceive and release the negative programming that was gifted to me by our over-individualized society. \u00a0Two months after that, I was engulfed by a community-oriented festival--the first I had ever attended--Open Mind. \u00a0I reached out to dozens of strangers, they were instantly my family and I loved everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd only two months later did Occupy Montreal commence and consume my life. \u00a0I spent thirty days living there and helping coordinate. \u00a0I had found others struggling for community and I had found my partners. \u00a0By early 2012 I moved into a community home, Coop Sur Genereux; an ecologically-oriented intentional community striving to promote permaculture in urban environments while fostering a space for community-collaborative initiatives to occur. \u00a0While the intention had been set with the home in 2003, it had significantly diverged from its main course and I dedicated myself towards incorporating permaculture design principles and improving communication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past three years, I have dedicated a significant portion of my time and energy to the Coop. \u00a0We are about 15 people with a variety of visions and goals collaborating and communicating as best as we can to find our way; all while sharing a home. \u00a0We have made thousands of meals feeding strangers and friends alike. \u00a0We have hosted dozens of events fostering community growth and solidarity with our neighborhoods. \u00a0And we have hosted hundreds of couchsurfers from throughout the world. We are working incredibly hard to both generate a sustainable model for collaborative urban living and to offer a non-commercial space for local community development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter living in the space for six months, I discovered what would become my destiny.
