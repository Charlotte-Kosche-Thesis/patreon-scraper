    "summary": "Hello!  My name is\nJessica Fogle and I write lo-fi dream folk / bedroom pop songs + existential lullabies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m here on Patreon because I\u2019ve lived a very charmed life musically speaking \u2013\nI\u2019ve found my voice (and very specific genre), released multiple independent\nalbums, and almost had a song in a Chrysler commercial in the Super Bowl\nonce, had my music featured in an award-winning movie-musical, had a 4-week professional run of a musical I wrote in grad school, I\u0027ve even had the surreal experience of famous people singing my songs and being incredibly kind and supportive.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe ONLY thing is, it rarely pays.  Most\nof these things pay at the hobbyist level, or not at all.  I realized that if I could find a crowd of\npeople who love me and find value in this music I create, and wanted to become\nmy online fan base of patrons, that I could have my cake and eat it too!  I could stop wondering about whether at a\ncertain age I had to \u201cgive up\u201d and \u201cbe practical\u201d and start caring more about\nbuilding a \u201cserious business\u201d like online piano lesson tutorials or something.\u00a0 Which I\u0027d be happy to do as a side thing, but mostly I just want to keep writing and sharing songs.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI work VERY hard already.  Last year I\nwrote about 500 songs in 365 days (the official challenge was a song a day for\na year, but I went overboard at times).  This\nyear I\u2019ll be releasing 12 albums/eps on Bandcamp, in 12 months.  I write to labels and venues and book shows\nand curate shows for friends and fellow musicians and start festivals and\ncollaborate and am in a band (cloudlight) and perform multiple times a month, AND run a 28 student\npiano/songwriting lesson studio.  So I\ndon\u2019t want to change a thing about my current work flow, it\u2019s just that my income is\na little too low to sustain it for much longer \u2013 without suspecting that I\nshould really \u201cgrow up\u201d and be more practical soon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I feel like EXACTLY what I\u2019m doing and working on in this world is needed,\nand unique, and interesting \u2013 i.e. a particular combination of cheerleader\noptimism (that YOU can do it too \u2013 I love giving tips on writer\u2019s block and\ncreative play, just made a video about that for some patrons), mixed with a strange\nmelancholy from healing so many traumas, and being vulnerable and transparent\nabout it in music (hence the \u201cexistential lullabies\u201d).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you\u2019d like to come on board as a patron, I would love to have your\nsupport \u2013 and share my way of looking at life with you.  Check out little perks and packages at the\ndifferent levels.  I\u2019m still growing into\nthis Patreon thing, but I\u2019m loving it so far.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for listening and reading!\u003cbr\u003e\nJessica\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.s.s. here\u0027s some nice things people have said about me, if that helps you decide :) \u003ca href=\"https://jessicaintherainbow.com/pr/\"\u003ehttps://jessicaintherainbow.com/pr/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDreamy, intimate experimental pop\u201d\u003cbr\u003e-Bandcamp, \u201cNew \u0026amp; Notable\u201d 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cFogle\u2019s half-whispered is a thing of intrigue\u2026\u201d\u003cbr\u003e-GoldFlakePaint, Tom Johnson (re: cloudlight 2017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.p.s. and here are some links...xo\u003cbr\u003e\nMUSIC: \u003ca href=\"http://www.jessicaintherainbow.bandcamp.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.jessicaintherainbow.bandcamp.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMUSIC (old releases, Chicago years): \u003ca href=\"http://www.jessicafogle.bandcamp.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.jessicafogle.bandcamp.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMUSIC (with cloudlight) \u003ca href=\"http://www.cloudlightmusic.bandcamp.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.cloudlightmusic.bandcamp.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFACEBOOK: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/jessicaintherainbow\"\u003ehttp://www.facebook.com/jessicaintherainbow\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nINSTAGRAM: \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/jessicaintherainbow\"\u003ehttp://www.instagram.com/jessicaintherainbow\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTWITTER: \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessinrainbow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitter.com/jessinrainbow\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYOUTUBE (365 Days songwriting challenge): \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWUrJO6vPyVVCk_VDABUmaw\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWUrJO6vPyVVCk_VDABUmaw\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBLOG/SHOW DATES: \u003ca href=\"http://www.jessicaintherainbow.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.jessicaintherainbow.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
