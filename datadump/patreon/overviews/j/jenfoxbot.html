My goal is to help improve the educational system because I believe quality education is the key to an equitable, progressive, and stable (democratic) society. Education is the foundation for solving our own and the world\u0027s greatest problems. The more we know, collectively and as individuals, the more problems we can solve and the better we can solve them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also believe that the best way to learn is to just throw yourself into the deep end of the pool! ... with floaties and maybe a life jacket. Which is why I create, build, and publish open-source project tutorials, science \u0026amp; how-to videos, and develop/teach project-based workshops.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe greatest work I do will be through my students. The more students I can teach and the more things I can teach them means a greater impact on the world and a better life for everyone! Something like that :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting my Patreon page and for reading this lil\u0027 blurb! If any of this resonates with you, please make a contribution to help sustain my work. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003ewww.FoxBotIndustries.com\u003cbr\u003e"
