    "summary": "My name is Jade Mayjean. I am a singer, songwriter. I have been singing since the age of 12 and taken part in competitions locally and globally and nationally. I have performed in countless venues both with a band and acoustically.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy love for music started at a very young age. I was heavily inspired by my late nanny who would sing mainly whilst cooking. She sounded a lot like Ella Fitzgerald. I remember feeling mesmerised when listening to her and I wished I could sound just like that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I have written original material alongside other musicians and producers and completed my own renditions of cover tracks (you can check out my cover track of Drake- Hotline Bling) below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seemed to have gained quite a big following in and around my hometown of Ipswich and now I am looking to sprawl further afield. In order to achieve this I am going to need to find gigs and opportunities in other areas. I recently have gained a slot a Mayfairs Art Club in which I will be playing their supper slot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough a lot of venues want cover tracks because that is what their clients will know and can relate too, I really want to push and create some more original compositions. It\u0027s original work that eventually will gain more credibility and open up even more doors and opportunities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be seen and respected as a recording artist in my own right and not just as a cover artist. I am able to write my own material and with the right team around me I can reach and fill my full potential.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
