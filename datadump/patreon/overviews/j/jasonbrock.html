    "summary": "Hi my name is Jason Brock and my vision is to make edible landscapes the norm, not the exception. \u00a0I believe Guerilla Gardening is one of the \u00a0groundbreaking actions that begin this transformation. \u00a0Thanks for taking the time to support my passion and my work to regenerate the neglected urban landscape. \u00a0I hope you join me on this incredible journey that connects us, feeds us and entertains us. \u00a0For as little as $1 a month you can lend a hand and make these gardens a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Yes, I have goals to reach and projects I\u0027d like to complete, and yes I love permaculture and plants, but this is green activism we\u0027re practicing here too, raw and edgy, and full of freedom. \u00a0We\u0027re striking at the root. \u00a0And it feels great. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support \u00a0I\u0027ll be able to build more soil, plant more starts, dig more holes, havest more veggies. \u00a0I\u0027ll be able to organize art and garden partys. \u00a0I\u0027ll be able to design murals, produce workshops to teach and write my book. \u00a0Whichever reward level you choose, you\u0027ll become a part of the story, part of the growth that connects us. \u00a0We must grow these gardens together. \u00a0Here are a few questions folks have already asked me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What is a Guerrilla Garden?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u00a0\u003cem\u003eGuerrilla gardening\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e is the act of gardening on land that the gardeners do not have the legal rights to cultivate, such as abandoned sites, areas that are not being cared for, or private property. -Wikipedia \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuerrilla Gardening\u003c/strong\u003e is \"transforming neglected public corners into adopted gardens.\" -Richard Reynolds, On Guerrilla Gardening.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Are there specific locations you\u0027re interested in?\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e Yes, Right now I am concentrating on the Bike Path Garden in Ventura, CA. \u00a0There are other locations that are on the list, most recent ones will be LA and Orange County, as I am in these areas frequently. \u00a0I\u0027ll keep you updated on the action.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u00a0What will you plant?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027ll plant things that can be brought to the table, from Kale to radishes, onions and peppers, herbs of all kinds. \u00a0Education is nourishment for the mind, so I\u0027ll source plants that are native and edible or usable in some way. \u00a0Plants that capture all the senses. These gardens are seed starters for awareness, empowerment and peace.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can we visit the Guerrilla Gardens? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is highly encouraged and necessary! \u00a0The community must love and care for their guerilla garden for it to grow to it\u0027s full potential. \u00a0So, yes, please visit and bring watering cans and extra plants. I encourage you to plant your own GG. \u00a0I\u0027ll be posting videos of my actions too.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u00a0What hurdles are there when setting up a garden?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s a good idea to scope out the site before installing, dig carefully to avoid underground hazards (electrical, irrigation, gas lines, etc) Sometimes I bring orange cones to mark off the area so you don\u0027t get hit by cars or bikes, so folks don\u0027t trip and fall over materials etc. \u00a0Visibility is a good thing usually! \u00a0Water is always an issue, so DIY drip systems are helpful to install. \u00a0Still more to come in regular posts, so check back often.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:  Is this legal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe legal aspects of reclaiming neglected space are varied. \u00a0There is oftentimes a stage of negotiating with landowners and/or the city to bridge any legal backlash. \u00a0Remember, building community is necessary to keeping any installation alive, and the learning curve of negotiating for use of space is empowering. \u00a0Sometimes I plant first anyway, and ask questions later. \u00a0Why? Because seeing is believing. \u00a0I almost always reach out to local collectives and community orgs in the area to get the inspiration flowing. You can get in trouble for picking flowers, and you can get in trouble for planting flowers, probably, though it hasn\u0027t happened yet. \u00a0I will post more about this part of guerilla gardening as this journey unfolds, and there is a lot of information online as well.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u00a0Are there garden parties on the horizon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYes, the next one is Summer Solstice. \u00a0I\u0027ll post pictures of any happening like this for you to see. \u00a0I am also a musician so music and art will be threading through the experience.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Check back often to ask questions and get updates on all the details as the they unfold!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep Growing!\u003cbr\u003eJason\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
