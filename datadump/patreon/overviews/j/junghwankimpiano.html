I have been playing the piano since I was 7 years old and I won the first prize in a piano concour in Korea when I was 10, but I quit it when I was 14. I studied non-musical subjects for 6 years after I quit, but I missed playing the piano, then I started to study composition for 6 months and got into Yonsei University in Korea as a composer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 I learned classical music theories such as harmonics, ear training, instruments, notations using Finale, and classical music composition in school. However, after I studied classical composition around 1 and half years, I realized I was more interested in popular music and rock music. Then I quit the school and started to play and learn the keyboard alone. I also learned drums for 1 year after I started to play the keyboard.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 I was impressed by the band Green Day, Rage Against The Machine, Deep Purple, and Dream Theater. Since I did not have a keyboard teacher or a lesson, I tried to cover Dream Theater songs as a keyboardist and uploaded my performing videos on Youtube. Then I met the guys in the band Bad Salad on 2012, and we made an EP album (Puzzled) on 2013. After that, we played in Progressive Nation At Sea 2014 as a band.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 While I am still playing the keyboard in some bands, I wanted to play more piano pieces and acoustic music on my own, and \u201cBeauty and the Beast Medley\u201d is the first one officially. It will be on my new Youtube channel soon.\u003cbr\u003e(\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5phyLiW2wkPN7jAQnPftCw\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5phyLiW2wkPN7jAQnPftCw\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\tWhy is your support really helpful?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Since I quit a college of music before, it is really hard for me to get a job as a musician without any connections in music field. I studied veterinary medicine after I quit music school, and I worked as a veterinarian for 6 months on 2016. Now I manage to live from that time and from supporting by my family and friends, but I am afraid I can not continue to play music anymore because of a bad situation moneywise.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 So if you support me, you are promoting more videos, you are extending my music life, and you are inspiring me with passion and motivation. There are already great musicians around the world and I am not a superstar, this being so, it will be helpful even with little support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you pay for?\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0Consequentially, you are paying for my musical work. In order to make a video, I need to learn the song, to make a music score, to arrange, to practice, to record audio tracks, to take many videos, to edit them all, then to upload it.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 If you work for the company, you get your salary then you might have some bonus later if the business works well. In this point of view, I can not promise bonus in advance as a freelancer musician, but if my works continue to prosper, I would be delighted to share some bonus later.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 You can just start with $1 per 1 project, and it will make a big difference. If you support more, I can say you are going to get more cool extras. You can even choose the options that you like. It applies to just one project, so you are not going to get charged if there is not any new videos.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 So, if you enjoyed my video and want to see more, please support me to do it more often. Thank you for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Sincerely, Junghwan\n\u003c/div\u003e"
