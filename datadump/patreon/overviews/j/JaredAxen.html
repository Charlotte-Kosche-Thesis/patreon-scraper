    "summary": "\"I think I can\nhonestly say that I have never felt such a strong connection and calling with anything else the way I\nhave with making music. That does not mean that I\u0027m not strongly grounded with\nthe important things in life (love, life, family, loyalty, God, etc.), It\u0027s\njust that my connection to making and preforming music is different. The role\nof an artist is complicated. You are telling your audience \"here is a\npart of me. Here is an extension of who I am\" and then you ask \"do\nyou like it?\" It\u0027s a condemning question really\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJared\nAxen\u003c/em\u003e -singing/songwriter\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0My name is Jared Axen and I am \u201cYour Singing\nNurse\u201d. This is something I tell my patients every morning when I start my\ndaily rounds. As a registered nurse, I have the opportunity to serve so many\npeople from the extremely diverse population that makes up Los Angeles and LA County. I have\ncome to recognize that music bridges our differences with a common bond. Music\nis the common language, spanding cultures, history, and time itself. Music has\nproved to be a useful tool, enabling me to reach out to my patients and\nprovide therapy and comfort in ways that nursing by itself was limited. Even\nwith my older population, I have been able to reach out and provide comfort\nwith older songs from their times. Happiness is in the single moments. I try to\nhelp them find and remember those moments. Nursing is about connecting with\npeople, and so is music.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0While I cannot show much of how I use music in the\nhospital setting due to protected information, I can share my music and art\nwith you, my \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon subscribers\u003c/strong\u003e. Patreon has provided the unique opportunity\nfor you and I to work together in the creation of music and art. As my Patreon\nsubscriber, I will be able to keep you involved through live chat feeds, video\nupdates, live lyric and music writing sessions, and an overall look behind the\nscenes as new music and art is created. You will be involved on the ground\nfloor and would have a direct and intimate impact on the direction of my music\nand really the direction of me as an artist. Of course you can be one of the\nmany gracious followers on social media who support and share my music, but wouldn\u2019t it\nbe neat to be a part of how it all starts? I would love it if you would join me\non this journey.  \u003cbr\u003e"
