    "summary": "I love being an artist. I love making images that uplift and inspire. And I feel so alive when I lead workshops and see people igniting their own creative fire. I want to start off by sincerely thanking you for your support. Without the generous support of my loyal fans I wouldn\u2019t be able to do what I do. My primary medium is paint, but my life is also my art. It\u2019s a form of spiritual practice. Painting is my connection to the mystery... And when I paint, I feel like the whole universe is painting through me. It\u2019s not for me alone, it\u2019s for everyone that my work touches. My intention is to inspire personal healing and global awakening through my art and workshops. Throughout history, art has been a catalyst for expanded consciousness, for shifting paradigms, and for recovering the soul. Can you even imagine a world without art? It would be a bleak world indeed. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m here to ask you to join me on this journey. I\u2019m here to ask for your continued support. I took a leap of faith 5 years ago to pursue my art full-time. It\u2019s been thrilling and deeply fulfilling, but it has not been easy. Online fundraising tools like Indiegogo, Kickstarter and GoFundMe have helped many artists raise the money they need for \u003cem\u003especific\u003c/em\u003e projects and goals. Patreon is a crowd-funding platform that functions a little differently: It\u2019s not a one-time push but rather an \u003cem\u003eongoing\u003c/em\u003e form of support for artists...so that we can sustain a living pouring our hearts and souls into our work and sharing that with the world\u2014thanks to you, the loyal patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, YOU get to set the amount of how much you want to give each month. It can even be $1. Believe me, EVERY dollar counts. In addition, you receive rewards at each giving level, which keep us even more connected and give you special offers and sneak peeks at what I have going on. You can change your giving amount or stop at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you say YES, you become part of the fuel that sustains my creative work. You essentially become a creative partner with me. So...thank you from the bottom of my heart for believing in what I do and wanting to see it continue and thrive. Thank you for helping me make a difference in the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jenspaintings.com/images/patreon/ThankYouImage.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

All of images of YOUR choosing, based on availability. See my\u00a0online store for image and size options. These items make great gifts for family and friends, for business associates, or for donation items. PLUS anytime I create prints from new paintings you\u2019ll have the option of a free print or pendant of that piece, up to one per month.\u003cbr\u003e(OR if you\u0027d rather not receive \"things\", you can instead opt for a complimentary on-site process painting workshop for up to 20 people, to be scheduled after 3 months of support. Check out the Creative Nectar Studio website for more information about process painting.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
