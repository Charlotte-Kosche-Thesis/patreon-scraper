    "summary": "\u003cimg\u003eThank you for finding me here! I appreciate all my fans and especially those who have taken it to the next level to become my patron. Please allow me to introduce myself to those who are new, and I will then explain a little about patronage through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is John Grunden, and I write stories that are science fiction or paranormal-ish, working with the goal of one novella to one novel per month or two. Between book publications, I write short stories in the speculative fiction genre also. Since setting up this Patreon site, these stories are published exclusively here, until they are put into collections, on which my patrons will receive special offers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, how does this whole Patreon thing work? From the ancient world forward, patronage has been an important piece of funding the artist, so that he or she could focus on creating art. What had been reserved for nobility, the wealthy, and aristocrats has been opened up to the masses through the digital age. Now you can feel the same pride in sponsorship, by signing up for as little as $1 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than pride, what is in it for you? You may ask. Based on the level of membership, there are exclusive rewards, such as being a part of the community; getting to read the short stories before anyone else; hanging out via Google Hangouts or exclusive videos to see behind the scenes of my writing. For the very special level of sponsorship, you (or the person of your choosing) can be written in as a character in a book or short story. There are other perks to come along also, like signed copies, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I seeking patronage? Patreon will allow me to fund things such as editors and cover designers, without having to decide which kid doesn\u0027t get to eat. Perhaps a little hyperbolic, but patronage will help offset the costs to produce the books and stories. Upon obtaining greater patronage goals, I will be able to concentrate that much more time on writing, instead of working overtime and extra jobs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering supporting me and my work through patronage on Patreon. It really does mean a lot to me. Whether or not you are at a place to be able to become a patron, I am pleased you thought enough to support me by checking me out and spreading the word. I have the best fans, and I love you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn"
