    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u2019s Start With \u201cThank You\u201d and an Introduction:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for coming by! I am Jennifer Liles, a licensed clinical social worker in the Kansas City metropolitan area who has also been writing about progressive politics and personal life as Maureen O\u2019Danu for two decades now on various platforms. I have been a participant in many of the discussions Americans as a nation have been having on social justice, mental health, mental health provision, and the future of progressive politics, and I have written both fiction and poetry on these topics as well. As of February, 2018, I am moving all of my online content to Patreon both to consolidate and to save on hosting fees.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOut Of My Mind:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write on two main subjects, both of which I am developing podcasts for that will be rolled out in early 2018.\u00a0 The first is focused on living a full life while managing chronic mental illness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only am I a mental health therapist, I am also a person living with post traumatic stress disorder, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as executive function issues caused by a head injury. \"Out of My Mind\" (credit to Jean Rossner, LMHC, for the name) is my column and podcast about living a full life with mental illness, told from both my professional and personal perspective. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTopics include things like dealing with disability and varying levels of ability, technology that helps, navigating the US mental health system, dealing with friends and family, dealing with children, and specific question and answers for a large variety of related topics. My therapy clients and their immediate family can contact me directly and I will send them exclusive links to the podcasts before they are available to anyone other than Patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAm I The Only One Dancing?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNamed for my now dormant and soon to be defunct website, this podcast focuses on bringing the various parties on the left of American politics, the center, and the near right together to improve the lives of working and middle class folks of all backgrounds, educating people on civics and social justice concepts, and battling disinformation of all sorts. Oh, and sometimes I talk about cats and dogs and kids and life, here, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost weekdays (and a few weekend days) you will find me creating a \"Tweet storm\" on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/odanu\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e on a social justice or political topic, and a Question of the Day on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/odanu\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e that is more general and deals with things such as self care and self awareness in addition to political and social justice questions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent on Am I The Only One Dancing? is focused on political and social justice education, finding unifying themes (and cautioning against erasing anyone\u0027s concerns in unification), and debunking rumors and bad information. (If you go back into the stone ages, prior to Trump\u0027s election, you will find a lot of general lifestyle content. I hope to have the luxury of returning to writing like that again someday).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Does My Patronage Pay For?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of Patreon as a virtual busker\u2019s hat for something you like enough to want to see regularly. Providing therapy to working class and impoverished people is emotionally and spiritually rewarding, but it isn\u2019t particularly financially rewarding. And, see, my husband has chronic pain that resulted in a total of seven surgeries (so far) that we\u2019re still paying off. So that\u2019s part of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of it is that if my writing is helping to support me, I can do more writing and educating \u2014 and I really enjoy writing and educating, and if you\u2019re still reading, you enjoy reading my writing and educating. Finally, I have a (long term) goal of forming a non-profit company that pays for therapy on a partial or full basis for people in need, so that they can see private therapists increase their choices for service providers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, as my support increases through the Patreon and my medical debts go down, I will increase the number of hours I and other therapists who work with me are able to serve people who have limited ability to pay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Bottom Line:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will increase the amount of writing I do that will teach people about mental health and social justice, will help me replace my husband\u0027s income so he can retire and allow his body to heal, and will go towards people in my area, and eventually people farther afield, getting inexpensive or free mental health therapy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
