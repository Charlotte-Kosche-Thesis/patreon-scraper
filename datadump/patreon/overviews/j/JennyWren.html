    "summary": "Jenny Wren is the pseudonym of a poet (two chapbooks and one full-length collection currently in print), 2D and 3D artist, and university-level writing instructor who doesn\u0027t want to cross the streams of work life and wyrd-ness. One of my other talents is divination: Tarot and Lenormand cards, ogham staves, pendulums, runes. Now, you and I know that \u003cstrong\u003eTarot, etc. readings are for entertainment purposes only!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0They are definitely not a substitute for qualified psychological or medical care! However, some people find this all unbearably odd, hence the pseudonym. I like lots of birds, but I felt that \"wren\" applied: they are tiny, plain birds but they can make themselves heard for miles. (Also, the Paul McCartney song \"Jenny Wren\" isn\u0027t bad, but I\u0027ve never tried the golden ale.) Plus, in some Celtic myths, the wren is the monarch of the bird kingdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate! \u003c/strong\u003eMy titanium-hydroxyapatite hip prosthesis was installed. My pocket is kind of hurting from investing in real running shoes to protect me from the impact of all the walks they want me to start taking now, plus other ongoing physical therapy expenses.\u00a0I won\u0027t be offended if you sign up, get a poem or a Tarot reading from me, remain with me long enough to have your card charged, and then cancel your patronage. Times are tough. I will just be grateful that you thought I was worth your time in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy readings are so accurate that I scared myself with the most recent one. I might tell that story sometime.\u003cbr\u003e"

This is for entertainment only and is definitely not a substitute for therapy or qualified medical opinions!
