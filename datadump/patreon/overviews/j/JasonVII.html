I have been making these video\u0027s for three years and they have grown in popularity year on year. I want to keep making and creating content and improving as I go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes I release other blog and vlog style video\u0027s, these will not be considered Patreon related video\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m asking for your money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking and creating video\u0027s requires three things; passion, time and equipment. I have plenty of the first and less of the second than I would like, but it\u0027s the third thing that generated the need for this page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo making has been a passion of mine since I was very young but I\u0027ve never had the money to get the right equipment to shoot the footage I really want. I\u0027ve recently been able to upgrade to my first real camera that shoot\u0027s decent looking footage, with that, I need extra batteries, cards, tripod, microphone and all the cable\u0027s, chargers and bits and bobs that go with them. That is exactly where the money will be going. Every penny will go on equipment or film making expenses. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I\u0027m doing, consider buying me the equivalent of a coffee, I would very much appreciate it. I will absolutely continue doing this whatever happens, Patreon is just about improving the quality of the videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your ongoing support, it really is a huge deal and I very much appreciate it."
