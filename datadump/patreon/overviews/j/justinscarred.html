I\u0027ve met so many wonderful people who appreciate all the content created, whether the first Randomland videos, or the Sometimes Vlogs, the quest for positivity, Randomland Adventures, Paintings, Photos, Stickers, etc. It would not be possible to keep creating the amount of content I do, (and especially expanding and traveling and covering more subjects) if it weren\u0027t for all the support I receive from you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo many people have replaced TV with YouTube. Most of us creating content online actually get paid little to nothing for the actual content itself. Unless each video is getting millions of views a month, the ads on those videos aren\u0027t making much money. People pay for cable, for netflix, hulu, etc, yet often watch online content such as youtube videos much more often. So, because so many people suggested it, here\u0027s a Patreon account! All I ask is, if you can afford it, and if you get enjoyment out of my videos, consider contributing $1 per month. If you feel like the videos are worth more to you, or you\u0027d like to help more, thats ok too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis doesn\u0027t change the fact that all of my videos are free!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e All this does is allow those who wish to contribute to the ongoing creation of videos to do so. If you get entertainment value from my content, it\u0027s a simple tip jar so you can make a contribution. If my videos are worth $1 a month to you, toss in a buck. If \u00a0more, awesome! Either way, Thank you for taking a look! I\u0027m going to keep working as hard as I possibly can to make great stuff that I hope you all enjoy. I don\u0027t offer rewards because I\u0027m already trying to throw everything I have into the videos \u0026amp; not be distracted with constantly trying to figure out incentives for other people. I hope that you enjoy the content that I create. Thank you so much for stopping to read this, and \u00a0I hope to see you out there in Randomland!\u003cbr\u003e"
