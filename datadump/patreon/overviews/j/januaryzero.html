    "summary": "My name is Gareth, and January Zero is my music. I\u0027m writing songs that try to sort out the confusion and alienation of modern life, to gather moments of wonder and beauty along the way,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eand hopefully, somewhere in the process, to shine a light on the paths back to a world of meaning and deep connection. The sounds are the ones that I love best, that I have been hearing in various ways my whole life long -- the tones and rhythms that have been among the best of medicines for me in difficult times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping to build a way forward for music! I love making music, and I put so much of my time, my core, and my reflections into it, as so many musicians do. But for a very long time now, musicians have been faced with a really lousy choice: trying to \"make it\" in the corporation-owned marketplace,\u00a0chasing after exploitative record deals,\u00a0spending most of their vital energy trying to navigate the pitfalls of distribution and advertisement, all while trying to tour, perform and somehow\u00a0stay out of debt -- or to go it alone, maintaining rights and creative control, but lacking any real access to building an audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is changing all of this, for musicians, and for so many other kinds of artists. In centuries past, much of the best, most enduring work was created by artists who were supported by royalty or wealthy patrons. But now, thanks to the internet, we don\u0027t all need a Duchess or a Grand Vizier to stumble upon our tunes. And what\u0027s even better, we can each of us take a part in the supporting of the art we care about, to invest in a way so much more direct, connected, and palpable than even buying an album has ever been able to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we spend our money on says a lot about what we value, and what means the most to us. Most of the time though, today, we\u0027re making that declaration to faceless corporations. Here, just like down at the farmers market, the act of making something AND the act of buying or supporting it have again become connected to the building of real, vital communities. This return to something that felt long-lost, thanks to Patreon, and to all of you, is nothing short of amazing. Let\u0027s see what never-before-felt things we can feel, what celebrations we can create, and what worlds we can dream up and visit together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
