You can check those out at \u003ca href=\"http://www.jennitooley.com\"\u003ewww.jennitooley.com\u003c/a\u003e or on my IMDB page.

Well, it didn\u2019t\nwork\u2014it never does.  You would\nthink I had gotten the message by now. \nI then decided I would take a week, trust that I am being taken care of\nby something bigger than myself, and just receive\u2014this means, let things come\nto me rather than go out seeking. \nIt\u2019s a practice of listening, being willing, and doing whatever footwork\nis required.  Well, within a week\nall the bills I had been concerned about were paid and I had money coming in\nthat would cover the next month\u2019s bills too.  Hmmmm...\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u2019t the first time I have tried this.  In Recovery I am told that my higher\npower is my employer so two years ago I decided on a month by month basis that\nI would write down what I was going to do or focus on that month and that I\nexpected my HP to provide x amount of income.  It always worked-- when I remembered to do it;)  During that time I somehow was also\nable to fundraise, pre-produce, and produce and independent feature film for\nwhich I am not being paid but I still had enough.  Hmmmm\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I have decided that rather than continuing to fight the\ngood fight, I will practice acceptance and faith (this is a different kind of\ninternal fight) and I will set out on a year long journey of Receiving.
