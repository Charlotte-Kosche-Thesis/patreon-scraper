Wherever you came from, Welcome :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a 3x Regional Champion and a 3x (soon to be 4x) Worlds competitor (placing 32nd, 13th and 20th respectively) and I make competitive Pokemon VGC content. With the release of Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, VGC will be bigger than ever, and I want to do my best to contribute towards it. I have made a name for myself for using unconventional Pokemon and sets at the highest level, and I will certainly be using those strategies in my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have just started my second year at university and was unable to get a loan for the university fees. At the moment I have just about enough for the year, but I still want to attend as many Pokemon tournaments as I can, but attending tournaments costs a reasonable amount of money. If I got a job, then I could attend most tournaments, but if I got a job, then I would not have enough free time to create consistent videos. You can help with this! With enough support, I will be able to keep making the content I enjoy and attend the tournaments I love while still being able to survive being a student.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel I have enough experience competing to be able to impart a good amount of knowledge, and as far as I know, there is no place for inexperienced players to be tutored by high level players. Well, there is now! \u003cbr\u003eHere is my list of notable achievements so far:\u003cbr\u003eRegionals: 1st, 1st, 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 3rd, 3rd, 5th\u003cbr\u003eNationals: 7th, 31st, 35th\u003cbr\u003eWorlds: 13th, 32nd, 20th\u003cbr\u003eAnd there is more to come ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and I hope you enjoy my videos :)"
