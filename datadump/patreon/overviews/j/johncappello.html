An even extra Thank You upfront if you\u0027re coming here to donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be fully transparent, I only do comics in my spare time. My moneymaking work is...freelancing... in the film and television industry full-time. Needless to say, I only get to make comics in what few precious spare time that I have. By helping me with your support as a patron, I would be able to take on less video work and focus more time on creating this web comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my comic series The Wonderful Wheels, my old strategy of making comics was to complete a 24 page comic, writing/illustrating/coloring, and to sell the finished product at comic conventions and online. Very infrequently, I would upload portions of it online, but not \"too much,\" because I wanted people to buy it. Well, I\u0027ve finally accepted that strategy doesn\u0027t work for me. I can barely manage to draw enough, let alone promote the art I make for the comic. And I figure that since I hardly make any money from my comics anyway, what\u0027s more important to me now getting my comics in as many people\u0027s hands as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with this new series, I will be releasing the comic online as I make it. My goal will be to illustrate and color a panel of the comic and release it every other day. I\u0027ll do my best to keep this schedule, but there may be some days where I will break or have literally no time at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor anyone following my life and who know about my father and his own condition, Ember in the Redemption is very much a personal story for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI set up this Patreon page to accept donations if anyone is so inclined to help me financially on this journey. Obviously, I understand if you can\u0027t or even if you don\u0027t want to. I will be making and releasing this comic to the world regardless of whether I make any money off it. But if you feel like you would like to help me pay my New York City rent a little in order to get me to produce the comic a little faster, I will greatly appreciate that."
