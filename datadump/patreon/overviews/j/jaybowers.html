My name is Jay Bowers and I\u0027m a singer/songwriter.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years ago, I woke up one morning and could tell something was wrong.  Just the day before, I had a normal level of energy.  On this particular morning, I felt so fatigued I could barely get out of the bed.  I thought it would go away within a day or two.  It didn\u0027t.  I napped constantly.  I couldn\u0027t work out anymore.  I could barely even stand up for more than a few minutes without getting tired.  I had been a personal trainer, so this was all new and strange to me.  Fitness and exercise had been a huge part of my life up to this point, and all of the sudden I couldn\u0027t do any of the things I\u0027d been enjoying for the bulk of my life.  I went to four different doctors and specialists and after a gamut of tests and theories, they were all stumped as to what was wrong with me.\u00a0 Seeing I had hardly any energy and was home-bound most the day, I had to find something I could do that wouldn\u0027t totally wear me down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo I picked up a guitar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years later, fighting through the cloud of fatigue, I have managed to learn the craft of singing, songwriting, and guitar playing.  I have played nearly 100 times at open mics and paid gigs and have written over 100 songs.  I am not going to let this fatigue stop me from achieving my goals and living a fulfilling life.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have continued working a day job but with limited energy, it is very difficult to do this while also making and sharing music.  I would love to have a sustainable income from music so that I can focus all of my efforts on creating and sharing original new songs.  Each donation made will get me one step closer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePick your bird on the right, vote on which songs you\u0027d like me to record!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e(I couldn\u0027t resist choosing birds.\u00a0 My mom dubbed me \"Jaybird\" as an infant and the nickname has lasted nearly 3 decades.\u00a0 I find it strangely prophetic considering my current diet consists largely of sunflower seeds and I sing for a living...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!!!\u003c/strong\u003e"
