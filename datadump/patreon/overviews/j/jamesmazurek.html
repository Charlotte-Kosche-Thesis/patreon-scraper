It\u0027s an entirely rewarding experience, and the best of it all, is that it\u0027s something you create for free. So, If you\u0027re a fan of my music or simply enjoy it to some extent, then this is the place where you\u0027ll find my creations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWHAT ARE YOU CREATING EXACTLY?\u00a0\u003c/b\u003eMy goal is to create songs, and to eventually create enough songs so that I can release an EP or an Album. I will also be creating covers of songs that I like, or believe will advertise my music better in some way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWHY COVERS? \u003c/b\u003eI honestly believe that investing time in covers is a great way to improve as a musician. Funny thing is I actually learned to play guitar by learning a song I loved. It was because of that song that I invested in learning more about music in general, and I still learn new things when I listen to my favorite artists.\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eCovers are also a great way to acquire new fans. The truth of the matter is that people aren\u0027t searching for me on YouTube, so by investing time in covers I help people find my music. Plus, I\u0027ll always be open to suggestions from you guys!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWHERE DOES MY MONEY GO?\u00a0\u003c/b\u003eMy goal is to create quality music that sounds great, and feels great. Unfortunately, in order to record, mix, and edit my creations the way I picture them in my mind, I need the right tools for the job. \u00a0Aside from paying my dues (we all got bills to pay, that\u0027s just life), I would use the money you give me to acquire the tools I\u0027d like to have so I can produce music of better quality and eventually begin releasing free EPs. Then, a little bit down the road, I could fund small tours and play live shows in an effort to promote said EPs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSO HOW OFTEN? \u003c/b\u003eI intend to create and release one song every two weeks. I will most likely release one original song, then two weeks later a cover song. This gives me enough time in between to write, practice, record, mix, and upload the content online. I\u0027d love it if I could release content more frequently but I can\u0027t really come up with songs that fast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWHAT\u0027S THIS \"REWARDS\" THING? \u003c/b\u003eSo, a very cool feature that comes with using Patreon, is the ability to add a \"rewards system\" so that people who actually give money can get something cool in the process. In my case, I\u0027ve added two simple rewards and will most likely add more as time goes by. You can choose which reward you\u0027d like to receive depending on how much money you\u0027d like to give when you become a patron.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWHAT ELSE YOU GOT? \u003c/b\u003eWell that\u0027s pretty much it. All I\u0027ve got left to say is thank you! Specially to those of you who decide to become my patron. To you I must confess my undying gratitude. Also, don\u0027t forget to download a free copy of my song \u003ci\u003eFix This. \u003c/i\u003eYou can find the link right above this big wall of text, you can\u0027t miss it, so go ahead and download it. You don\u0027t have to be a patron to download the song. :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"
