It\u0027s been a long and crazy journey, with about 400 different storylines happening a once.

The title of the site is a true reflection of the process (powerful change!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m celebrating the fact that I\u0027ve hung on \nthrough some pretty rough \npatches, and feel totally ready to steer this ship to new waters!

There is something so beautiful in the moment of exchange when you create something that someone says \u0027changed their life,\u0027 or \u0027touched their soul.\u0027 I love the interactions that spring from shared experience and the feeling that someone else understands you.
