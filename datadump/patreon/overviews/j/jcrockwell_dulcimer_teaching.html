    "summary": "The mountain dulcimer is my life. Ever since I first heard one in the late 1960s, I\u0027ve been totally in love with this unique American folk instrument. As far as I\u0027m concerned, the mountain dulcimer is \u003cstrong\u003eTHE most welcoming musical instrument on the planet\u003c/strong\u003e, and here my main mission is to share with you the joy I have found in playing simple folk and Celtic tunes, rounds, and easy-to-play chord exercises. I\u0027d also take great delight in showing you\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ehow to make up your own little jams and musical experiments!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon platform is a really amazing and wonderful thing! It basically allows you to download mp3 audio files, pdf files of music and tablature, and more detailed pdf files with some very basic beginners instruction. I will be doing one mp3 audio recording per month plus the associated tablature and instruction, so you can get access to my Patron-only feed for as little as $1 per month (for the mp3 download). For $5 per month, you get the mp3 plus the TAB pdf, and for $10 per month, you get the mp3, the TAB, plus another pdf with some very basic beginner-level instruction. The Patron-only feed, which is available to all levels, will include some beginning and intermediate level instruction tips, plus \u003cstrong\u003efree download links to mp3 audio and more pdf music and TAB!\u003c/strong\u003e. Higher levels will have intermediate and advanced level instruction and insights into how you can get more music out of your mountain dulcimer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love Patreon because it is like on-going crowdfunding: it allows you to support my work with your monthly subscription. I\u0027m really fired-up about developing these educational materials for you: there is nothing in this whole wide world I\u0027d rather be doing! And Patreon makes it SO EASY to us to communicate. You can tell me what you like, how you are doing, and how I can improve my explanations to help you learn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpon signing up as a Patron (at the $1 per month level), you will instantly get the following rewards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ea free pdf ebook download of my \u003cem\u003eBeginner\u0027s Tunebook for Dulcimer (DAA and DAD tuning)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea free pdf ebook download of my \u003cem\u003eDulcimer Solos\u003c/em\u003e 2 book\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea free pdf download of the 6 most important chord charts for the key of D (taken from my book\u00a0\u003cem\u003eMusic Theory and Chord Reference for the Mountain Dulcimer - Tuning DAD\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
