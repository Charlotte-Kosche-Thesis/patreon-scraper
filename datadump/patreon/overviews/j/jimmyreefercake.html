    "summary": "My name is Jimmy Reefercake, and I make songs about reefer legalization. Reefer is good, but its the hypocrisy that really gets me fired up, so I also sing about all kinds of hypocrisy in the news and politics. I started the web site allthehypocrisy.com as a platform for authors around the globe to blog about hypocrisy. The hypocrites in charge pay lip service to FREE DUMB in order to gain POWER! While hypocrite leaders come and go, the masses never let go of their search to unmask the hypocrisy of their rulers. I am here to serve the masses. I invite you all to contribute your hypocrisy related content right here at ALL THE HYPOCRISY DOT COM!!!!! Worldwide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHypocrisy has a long history of importance to human concepts of society and morality. Jesus, Gandhi, Mohammed, Buddha, all the spiritual leaders in the history of the world have warned of the dangers of hypocrisy, but that hasn\u2019t stopped this most irresistible sin from infesting human kind. To some degree, all of us Americans are hypocrites. We all suck at the teat of American imperialism, on the backs of children in sweatshops in China. The blood is on all our hands for American aggression and war around the world, to the point that our tax dollars pay for torture and killing, all in the name of freedom. Could it be that our leaders talk of freedom but are really interested in power?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile simple herbal remedies such as marijuana are banned in favor of drugs manufactured by transnational corporations. Again, freedom is sacrificed for power. I send my songs into the Majority Report, and occasionally other political talk shows, and I do not back down from my criticism of hypocrisy on the right, left, and the insipid middle. I humbly ask that you become my patron, and enable me to continue and expand my unique method of education and laughter, and support an open platform where folks like Joseph Ballin, Cool Cat,\u00a0Houston Eulers, Joe Thirtypack, Right Wing Mandela, myself and anyone else can blog about hypocrisy. Make a name for yourself and become another word warrior in the struggle against hypocrisy. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

You should opt for the CD, with artwork and all that. Its going to be friggin sweet. BUT THERE IS MORE! After 6 months, I will give you the reward of directing my song content. You can simply give the topic, or even dictate the exact lyrics (obviously no unwarranted hate speech). \u00a0You can be general or specific- example, do a parody of the Humptie Dance, called the Trumpie Dance. Not that I want to do that, but I will if my corporate overlords request it. You get the idea?!? This is limited to 52 patrons, because that\u0027s how many weeks there are in a year. Cool?
