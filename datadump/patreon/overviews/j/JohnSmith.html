    "summary": "Hello everyone! It\u0027s John Smith!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a Christian for half of my life. As a Christian I never actually read the Bible cover to cover. I only read what my Sunday School teacher or Pastor or \"older person in general\" told me to read. So now, as an atheist and skeptic, I decided I was long overdue to read the Bible and know exactly what was in it. I began my YouTube channel in an attempt to explore the Bible cover to cover and chapter by chapter. I wanted to showcase the \"epic violence\" and \"sexy time\" that I found in the Bible\u0027s pages. I am also continuing to do some \"extra Biblical research\" along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mainly do this channel for fun and like many of my atheist peers I am not a fan of \"e-begging.\" Content will still be made for free whether you send loot or not. I certainly don\u0027t want you to have to part with tons of your hard-earned loot. My philosophy is that you all should spend way less of your loot and learn way more about the Bible than you would if you actually attended a church (where you \"learn less\" and \"pay more\" loot to the collection plate every Sunday). Any and all loot you donate here is much appreciated, as Satan and I need to maintain electronic equipment and occasionally try to upgrade things like software, microphones, and plug more and more cables into gizmos, widgets, doohickeys and whatnots.\u00a0So thank you for your support and for making The Skeptic\u0027s Review: The Bible series all that it can be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and hugs!\u003cbr\u003eJohn Smith\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
