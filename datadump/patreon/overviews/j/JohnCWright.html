The second was to be a Planetary Romance adventure, following the footsteps of Edgar Rice Burroughs or Otis Adelbert Kline. Each was to run in fifty\nor so weekly episodes of two-thousand words.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, the magazine folded and returned the rights to me. It\nis my wish to bring these tales to my fans directly. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Space Opera is called\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eSUPERLUMINARY\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt concerns an imperial family of mad scientists who use the superscience of a lost race of Forerunners to control the fundamental forces of the universe, and rule the human race with a rod of iron. Only the youngest son of the queen ruling planet Venus, a youth named Aeneas, dares to oppose them. But he will soon discover an enemy darker and older than any of earth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe first episode is here:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.scifiwright.com/superluminary/#01\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.scifiwright.com/superluminary/#01\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Planetary Romance is called\u003cstrong\u003e LOST ON THE LAST CONTINENT\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nColonel Preston Lost is catapulted into the remote future of AD Two Hundred Million.

In 1987, he graduated from the College and William and Mary\u2019s Law School (going from the third oldest to the second oldest school in continuous use in the United States), and was admitted to the practice of law in three jurisdictions (New York, May 1989; Maryland December 1990; DC January 1994). His law practice was unsuccessful enough to drive him into bankruptcy soon thereafter. His stint as a newspaperman for the St. Mary\u2019s Today was more rewarding spiritually, but, alas, also a failure financially. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe presently works (successfully) as a writer in Virginia, where he lives in fairy-tale-like happiness with his wife, the authoress L. Jagi Lamplighter, and their four children: Pingping, Orville, Wilbur, and Just Wright.\u003cbr\u003e",
