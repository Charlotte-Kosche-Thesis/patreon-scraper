I\u0027ve been volunteering in politics since I was a teenager, and now a large amount of my work is writing about, speaking about, and being an activist about issues I care about. Since I\u0027ve moved to St. Louis I\u0027ve blocked streets with Black Lives Matter, helped plant the first Trans Memorial Garden in the USA, lobbied the MO state house to invest in clean energy, and led a clergy coalition to oppose an anti-LGBTQ \"religious freedom\" law (we won!).
