Right now I have been lucky enough to have an amazing job as a teacher and I work mostly nights, giving me all day to work on my Illustration. My work is mostly based on ghost stories, folklore, song lyrics and nightmares. I love creating art that is beautiful at first, though after looking at it for a few seconds you start to get why its creepy. That\u0027s what I love doing and want to keep creating for y\u0027all to see. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell for those of you who are new to patreon, its basically like Kickstarter, the only difference being that instead of y\u0027all donating money to one large project; you are becoming a patron of my work. When you pledge a certain dollar amount per illustration (you control the amount and can set a cap so you don\u0027t go over a budget) you allow me to keep creating. As always my content is viewable online for free via my website \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ejestonrodriguezillustration.com\u003c/a\u003e , facebook www.facebook.com/jestonrodriguezillustration, Instragram @jestonart or tumblr \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etuxcatartists.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e. For prints and other goods Society6 society6/JestonRodriguezIllustration.\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal with posting\u00a0 is to upload a few full illustrations each month, though for rewards purposes I will be posting things throughout the month.\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging\u00a0 not only are you helping me to keep creating by making ends meet and supporting my art work you also get really awesome rewards and never before seen content based on the dollar amount pledged. \u003cbr\u003eBy becoming patrons of my work, y\u0027all can keep me productive and it\u0027d be amazing to see the feedback and have y\u0027all along for the creative process! \u003cbr\u003eSo lets get illustrating!\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/div\u003e"
