But that\u0027s not me. That\u0027s not who I am as a creator or a person. I\u0027m a pathological polymath. I can\u0027t contain my interests in one genre, one form, or one topic. I\u0027m not going to put out four-hour-long podcasts diving into a specific historical event.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to create out of a sense of calling, a vocation. I will continue to share what I make with you as I figure out what it is and you all can find me (thanks again for doing the work to find me, that\u0027s not a simple thing and it\u0027s a big deal that you did it). So it might be a comedy-action-romance novel about a slacker with super powers. It might be epic fantasy inspired by Celtic monasticism and the magic of music. It might be poems attempting to express an instant of emotion that resonates through time and space. It might be podcasts about hope or neuroscience or theology. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know. But I\u0027m going to do my best today and try to do better tomorrow.\u00a0"
