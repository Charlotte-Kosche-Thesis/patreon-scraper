We have so much waiting in the wings, you guys- Chapter 2 of Kindred Skies is already scripted and in motion! Another webcomic that we\u0027ve already planned and designed! Prose- short stories and novels that exist in the Kindred Skies world, and other universes! All just waiting for just a little bit more free time on our end...\u003cbr\u003eWe also have some less lofty goals, though!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake a look at our milestones below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first goal, 100 a month: we\u2019re going to push to give you an extra page of Kindred Skies every month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur second goal: We\u2019ll introduce a NSFW tier, because you guys are already asking for it and we certainly aren\u2019t here to disappoint, friends ;) . 18+ please!  All the spicy stories and drawings, just for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd third: we have a BL-themed webcomic that is already plotted out and ready to start up (concurrently with Kindred Skies) - but with both of us working full-time, there\u2019s currently no time in the day to actually draw it! If we can hit this goal, we\u2019ll drop down to part-time work and make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount you\u0027d care to invest in us would mean everything! We make this silly little webcomic because it means alot of us, but knowing other people like our work fills us with joy. (Seriously. In cartoonish proportions. We \u0026lt;3 you!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you all for your support!\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://kindredsuncomic.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Maureen_bookmark_2point5x7.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
