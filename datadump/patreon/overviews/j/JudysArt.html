    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePainting has become a real passion of mine! I love creating both realistic and abstract paintings. My visual art expresses aspects of nature and the ocean, which is where I find my inspiration and joy. I try to capture nature\u2019s beauty and power. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRecently, I have been exploring acrylic painting styles that are creative, fun and abstract. Letting my imagination and creativity come to life in these paintings is my goal. The colors I tend to use are earth based colors. Water is a theme in many of my paintings, as I live near the ocean and love all aspects of it!. I have two styles of painting and I tend to go back and forth based on my inspiration at the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is your chance to get involved in my painting! You sponsor me and I can afford to keep painting new and exciting paintings! You can sponsor me for as little as a $1.00 a month if you feel called you can subscribe at a higher level. For Patrons who sponsor me at the $5.00 or higher rewards levels, I will post 1-2 paintings a week. As a bonus and for fun, I will be adding videos of me painting at least once a month, so you can observe my creative process. Those who sponsor me at the much higher rewards levels get access to an actual painting of mine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money I receive from Patrons each month helps me in a variety of ways. To buy art supplies; paints, canvasses, paint brushes etc. The money will help me pay for a website where my paintings will soon be available for purchase! Having Patrons truly makes it possible for me to give much more time to painting by helping with some of my living expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we both win, I get to paint more, you enjoy the paintings! I\u2019ll keep painting whether or not you personally support my visual art, but your help is greatly appreciated.\u00a0This way you can enjoy my art and say thanks with a monthly contribution to my art. I hope you will join as a Patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know others who love Art who would be interested please share my page with them.\u003cbr\u003e"
