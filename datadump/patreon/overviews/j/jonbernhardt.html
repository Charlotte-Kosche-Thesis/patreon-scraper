If you\u0027re on this page, you\u0027ve probably already read some of my baseball coverage on sites like \u003cstrong\u003eBaseball Prospectus\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSports on Earth\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eVICE Sports\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Guardian\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eToday\u0027s Knuckleball\u003c/strong\u003e. A little bit curmudgeonly columnist, a little bit modern statshead, a little bit stuck-up, self-indulgent essayist; I try to bring something of everything to my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started this Patreon to both supplement the columns I\u0027m already doing -- and that I hope you already enjoy -- with stuff about baseball that I\u0027m interested in writing but for which I can\u0027t find a home, and also to branch out a little bit more into essays on other topics, as well as perhaps some short fiction (know this: every writer, without exception, is also a novelist in some stage of want, regret, or failure).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll play it by ear in terms of what\u0027s eventually offered; the content for lots of these updates will arrive as inspiration strikes and I find something I want to write on. But what your contribution will always guarantee you is at least one book review per month of some baseball-related book, old or new, and probably a bit on the obscure side; there are a lot of reviews of \"Ball Four\" out there, after all. And of course, if you have suggestions, I\u0027m more than open to hearing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still mulling over reward levels and goals at the moment -- they\u0027ll be coming soon -- but for now, any contribution will get you the book review, the first of which I\u0027m planning to have finished by the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut wherever this ends up, thank you for supporting me and my work (and my health insurance), whether as a patron or just a reader."
