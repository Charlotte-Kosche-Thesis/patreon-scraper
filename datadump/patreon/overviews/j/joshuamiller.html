I also write a gaming blog, create\nprops, and write content for table top games as well as a live action\nrole-playing game called Amtgard, all of which allows me to do what I love, creating\nworlds.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreating\nworlds has always been a passion of my, all the way back to grade school where\nmy friends and I ran around pretending we were part of an elite group of anthropomorphic\ncat commando super heroes. Creating worlds is the backbone to all of my\ncreative endeavors be it writing, photography, table top gaming or a more structured\nform of make-believe, LARPing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://theapatheticgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2-Smaller.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn college I\nneeded to take an art class to graduate, I figured photography would be fun and\nboy was I right. That one class turned into two, then three, then four; by the\ntime I graduated with a degree in History I could have had a minor in photography.\nNeedless to say I fell in love. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOut of all\nof the projects I created it was my last that I enjoyed the most. I managed to\nmerge my love of world creation with photography by making a landscape and\nusing miniatures to photograph thematic scenes. With the countless hours of\nwork done and the prints in hand I knew I had to continue doing this, but alas,\nafter graduation I didn\u2019t have the time, space or resources necessary to\ncontinue creating such projects. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTimes have\nchanged and now I do have the time and some limited space but I still don\u2019t the\nresources a university provides. I\u2019m turning to my future supporters to help\ncreate a good foundation to allow me to continue working on the arts that bring\nme so much joy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://theapatheticgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Spy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlongside my\nlarger projects, such as miniature photography stills, I\u2019ll be working on\nsmaller ones such as prop making, story writing and I will continually blog and\nwrite expositions on different aspects of my creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
