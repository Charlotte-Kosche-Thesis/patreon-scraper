    "summary": "Hi there! \u00a0I\u0027m Josh and I\u0027m trying something I\u0027ve never seen done before. \u00a0Besides creating art tutorial videos I\u0027m also going to attempt to create a community of super smart, passionate geeky folks who want to help me build a fantasy world grounded in science for a unique intellectual property I\u0027m developing. \u00a0There is SO much brilliance out there that is untapped by the mega corporations that own the franchises we nerds love so much. \u00a0Well... I\u0027d tap that! \u00a0You know how you have specialized knowledge of a field or two like earth science or networking or prehistoric sociology, and every time you see a show or book that deals with that area they do it in the dumbest way possible? \u00a0I\u0027m aiming to make MY franchise different. \u00a0And I\u0027m going to do that by talking to all you super smart people while I\u0027m developing the world! \u00a0Attempting to world-build with an eye towards scientific plausibility is a massive -probably impossible- task. \u00a0But with our powers combined, I think we can crowd-source the talent and perspectives necessary to make something truly special and incredible. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides your delicious brains, I can also use the cash moneys for building the platform so more people can see this project and we will increase the hive mind! \u00a0Any little bit is appreciated."
