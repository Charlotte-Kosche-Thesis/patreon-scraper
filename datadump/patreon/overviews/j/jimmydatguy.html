    "summary": "The \"DO IT ALL\" Project\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know I ramble on about becoming the greatest adventure-athlete to live, but you are all probably wondering how I am going to accomplish that and what that actually entails. Traveling to every country has been done by others before me, but if I were to finish this leg of my journey I would be the 1st Mexican-American; as well as the 1st bboy to win in more than 50 countries/territories. Of course, winning a breaking event in as many countries as possible, and visiting every nation won\u0027t make me the greatest adventure-athlete. That is why this is only the first leg of my project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project as a whole is HUGE!! In order to claim that title I plan to be the first person to: see all nations; win a breaking event in a.m.c.a.p; finish the 6 world marathon majors; finish the 7 epics; climb the 7 summits; finish the Iditarod Race; and sail the 7 seas. All in ONE LIFETIME. Now people have done many of these, but nobody has done them all. I plan on being the first. That is where YOU come in. My dear patrons, supporters, friends, family, and fans. As you can imagine, a project like this is going to take plenty of time and money. That is why we must focus on the first step, which is visiting every nation, and winning events. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have been saving up and work 2 jobs (Ruffhouse Pet Resort and Infuse). Soon it will be 3 jobs (Walker Evans Warehouse). Working three jobs is very tiring and makes it incredibly difficult to practice breaking, which requires a tremendous amount of energy and time. If I want to have a productive practice and continue to improve so I can compete at an elite level; then every bit of energy and time is important. Currently I practice 5-6 days a week in my living room from 10/11pm-1am. I wake up the next day at 5:30 am go to work till 9-10pm and do it all over again. So even the smallest amount helps me to become more independent and fully focus on my dreams and goals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBesides helping with practice, the money will also be helpful while I am traveling abroad and I no longer have a safety net, I will need help with food, transportation, flights, visas, and occasionally housing.I will also visit/volunteer at various animal sanctuaries while raising awareness for the Center for Biological Diversity. I am saving up as much as I can so I can be secure when I launch my expedition, but everything helps and I do appreciate it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is an estimate for the total costs if this were to be a 6 year journey-\u003cbr\u003ehousing/beds- $7/month\u003cbr\u003efood- $40/month\u003cbr\u003etransportation- $100/month\u003cbr\u003eFlights- $140/month\u003cbr\u003eVisas- $163/month\u003cbr\u003eSanctuaries/Wildlife Parks- $20/Month\u003cbr\u003eTotal: 470$/month- this is a rough estimate of course.\u003cbr\u003eI will be using couch surfer, camping, eating cheap, and getting the cheapest flights/ transportation. Also take into consideration that some countries are very cheap and some are incredibly expensive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy quest will begin in May 2017, when I will go to the Philippines for the international Skillz Bboy Competition, and start my trek through South-East Asia. Stay tuned and thanks for all the support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-ENDORSED BY THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY-\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/support/give/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.biologicaldiversity.org/support/give/index.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
