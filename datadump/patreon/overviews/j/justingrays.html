    "summary": "Greetings, Salutations, and Hello! Thank you for visiting my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an advocate, an educator, and a writer. I graduated in 2010 from Minneapolis Community and Technical College with an associate\u2019s degree in Liberal Arts, and again in 2012 from Metropolitan State University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Gender Studies. Since graduation, I have attempted to work in advocacy or education, but have gained experience in offices and theaters - however, I keep bringing as much insight into advocacy and teach as much as I can no matter where I work.\u003cbr\u003eI am currently employed as the Audience Services Manager at a theater in Downtown Minneapolis. I also volunteer my time as a Community Manager for \u003ca href=\"http://twincitiesgeek.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwin Cities Geek\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0as a Committee Member for the \u003ca href=\"https://www.stlouispark.org/government/departments-divisions/police-department/volunteer-programs\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSaint Louis Park Multicultural Advisory Committee\u003c/a\u003e, and as a member of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.stlouispark.org/government/departments-divisions/fire-department/community-emergency-response-team-cert\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSaint Louis Park Community Emergency Response Team\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.justingrays.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJustinGrays.org\u003c/a\u003e, where I blog about various topics - either shared information from my city, topical situations, or things that I find interesting. Unfortunately, with the amount of time that I have to spend on looking for new work and stressing about the job that I currently have, I am not able to put as much focus into making quality posts as I would like.\u003cbr\u003eAt the same time, I would like to spend more time writing science fiction and fantasy stories and sharing them with the world. Perhaps even make a living out of writing. But as things are at the time, I don\u0027t have enough time to write, edit, deal with work, and make my meager income stretch as far as I need it to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Symbiotic Relationship:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe both will be getting something out of this - this is a form of symbiosis. You\u0027ll get quality blog posts, early access to completed stories, and the knowledge that you are helping me fund the creative process. I will get the some stress reduction as I won\u0027t have to worry about finances as much anymore, and that will help me be free to create more work.\u003cbr\u003eMany of these stories will be created anyway, but they\u0027ll likely take longer as my life is filled with how much else is going on. Your support will help me get in a position where I can create more with fewer stressors to be a distraction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am confident that some good stuff will come of this. If you can help support this adventure, I will be most appreciative. Stay awesome, everybody!\u003cbr\u003e"
