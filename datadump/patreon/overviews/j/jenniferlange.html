    "summary": "Ever since realizing that one can simply make up worlds of one\u0027s own, the ideas have never stopped flowing for me. I worked hard to acquire the skills to describe and illustrate them, which I spend most of my spare time on today. Each world is fleshed out with some writing, and plenty of paintings and drawings. Some are open settings, some are just glimpses into other realms, others have definite storylines with endings. My largest and most beloved project is Genius Loci, a fantasy setting where I aim to make everything as exotic as can be, while remaining believable. I have been working on it for several years, and describe it in its blog \u003ca href=\"http://starmakersgaze.blogspot.de\"\u003eStarmaker\u0027s Gaze\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eOther worlds in development are for example the Harpies, where four tribes of winged misfits fight for dominance over the realm; or the Elders, a calm and mystical world where people dwell in the remains of titans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery world or setting explores something else. Sometimes I want to newly interpret an old myth, or I\u0027m interested in distorted anatomy, or to illustrate in charcoal - the reasons for a world\u0027s invention can be very different.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://jsl-art.de/download/PatreonPageImage4.002.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll the worlds will be tied together into an annual sketchbook with sketches, drawings, WIPs, and final images of the artworks of the chosen settings. It will be released at the end of the year. Every ten patrons, one supporter will be picked to receive an original artwork!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
