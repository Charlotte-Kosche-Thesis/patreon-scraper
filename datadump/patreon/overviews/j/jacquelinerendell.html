Raw, gritty, beautiful and true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it wasn\u0027t until my very first gig that I discovered my TRUE purpose. Surprisingly, I saw that the songs I had written for myself were making a difference for other people. My message was resonating, and my voice was uplifting and finally...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...I was HOME.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your Patronage, I can stay there. Metaphorically and literally- it\u0027s where my studio is! ;) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
