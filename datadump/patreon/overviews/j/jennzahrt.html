The Weimar period in Germany proved to be a major hotbed of astrological innovation in the twentieth century, yet many of the source texts remain untranslated and, therefore, are inaccessible to anyone who cannot read or understand German. I am creating a series of German astrological source works to finally allow others to have access to the fascinating conversations taking place in print in pre-WW2 German culture. By supporting this project, you enable me to flex my superpower to bring those materials over to you. Once these source works begin appearing, I hope they enrich and further the current conversations taking place in our astrological community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn order to accomplish this, I need to begin at the beginning: translation of the public domain material. This includes most material published before 1923, which gives me 12 years to start with until 2019, when (fingers-crossed) the US copyright laws release more material into the public domain. Once these translations are underway, the project will coalesce into a series of publications perhaps organized by theme, perhaps produced in volumes of what happened to get translated first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jennzahrt.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12819188_10105066935647153_9026203853837396139_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhy is this important? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCultural transfer is \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e most critical way I can contribute to the astrological community. From the very outset of my astrological career in 1997, I committed myself to becoming fluent in German so that one day, the English-speaking world of astrology would be able to benefit from this rich archive of material. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first goal in that project was to become fluent in German (since 1998), and complete formal education to the highest level with a PhD thesis on the cultural significance of astrology in Germany, which I achieved in the German Department at UC Berkeley in 2012. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy second goal was to complete an MA in the history of astrology. People always ask why this came next, and not the other way around. I did this in reverse order so that the school, in this case University of Wales Trinity Saint David, would be able to boast having students with PhDs studying the history and culture of astrology in their program, which, I hoped, would raise the stature of the program. In addition, this program enabled me to\u00a0explore more technique-based astrological publications that were off-limits in the UC Berkeley German department.\u00a0I completed the MA in Cultural Astronomy and Astrology in July of 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have embarked on the third phase: translating and publishing the source texts that were pivotal to my research. I have spent the past twenty years getting ready to make this possible for the community. Commencement from a degree (or two) is just that, \u003cem\u003ea new beginning\u003c/em\u003e.
