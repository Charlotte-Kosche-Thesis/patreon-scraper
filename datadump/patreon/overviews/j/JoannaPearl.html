Yes, that\u0027s me...my name is \u003cstrong\u003eJoanna Pearl\u003c/strong\u003e, and I\u0027m a passionate singer-songwriter based in Southern California. I want to start by thanking you for taking interest in my Patreon page. It is increasingly difficult for artists such as myself to earn enough from their work to allow them to keep on creating. As wonderful as it would be to go on simply giving gifts to the world, unfortunately the day to day financial demands are always there...studio time...equipment...travel...and yes, even food!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nPatreon\u003c/strong\u003e has a phenomenal mechanism for allowing people who appreciate and wish to support an artist or content creator in their endeavor to keep on keeping on. On this page you\u0027ll see several tiers of support that can be pledged, from as little as one dollar upwards. Every cent I receive will help the production of my next album and more, and I have many exciting ways to bring you along for the ride. You\u0027ll only get charged your pledge amount at the beginning of each month, and only if and when I\u0027ve uploaded a music video of some sort. That may be a performance of a cover version, or a fully produced video for one of my original songs. The more you\u0027re able to pledge, the more I\u0027ll be able to spoil you...and don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll commit to having a limit of two videos per month as a maximum, so nobody fears any nasty surprises. If I post anything above and beyond that, it\u0027ll be my gift to you...just because I love you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a \u0027Pearl Patron\u0027 is super simple. Just click on the orange \u0027BECOME A PATRON\u0027 box on this page and choose your Pledge and Reward level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://joannapearl.com/PutYourMoney.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
