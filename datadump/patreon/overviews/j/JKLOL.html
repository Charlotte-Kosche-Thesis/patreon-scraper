I make music derived from old nes sounds in order to bring you awesome music! I have made songs that have been featured CHIPTUNES=WIN (I\u0027m the guy who made the F**K Glenn Dubois song ). I enjoy making music for you guys, but I don\u0027t get a lot in order to pay the bills so I can keep myself afloat. Hence why I came to Patreon, as I\u0027ve seen many creators succeed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow are the tantalizing tiers that I hope will help you decide whether or not you would like help me out, like joining in skype sessions with me during livestreams, and getting free merch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for helping me out in advance!"
