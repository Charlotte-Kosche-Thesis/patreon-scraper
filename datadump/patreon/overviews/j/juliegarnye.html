People have been asking me for one for years - and it is now time! The first album is called \"Julie Garny\u00e9 -\u0026amp;- The Writers\". I will be celebrating and collaborating with my favorite composers on the planet and I cannot wait to share this music with you.\u00a0The Parameters: I pick the composers. The composer picks a song they have written that I will record...and they have to play on the album too! I have already raised a fair bit of money but lawyer expenses and a few other things have led to me having to raise a little more capital to make this project a reality. And you can be a part of that! Some of the writers contributing include Stephen Schwartz, Paul Adelstein, Lance Horne, John Bucchino and Georgia Stitt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second album I\u0027m looking to create is a much bigger project but one that I am truly excited about it.\u00a0It will be a live recording called \"Garny\u00e9 Sings Gorm\u00e9 - The Songs of Eydie Gorm\u00e9 - Live at Vibrato Jazz\". It will require that I hire a 17 piece orchestra. It will require that I employ a transcriber to recreate the arrangements and orchestrations and charts of Eydie Gorm\u00e9\u0027s songs. It will require hiring engineers to record, mix and master the CD. I will need to fund rehearsals and reproductions of the CDs once the album is done. It will require compensating my musical director, Billy Stritch, as well as hiring a director and stage manager for the event. And ALL of this...will require at least $75,000. You heard correctly. It is a big project. And I couldn\u0027t be more passionate about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther projects include a series of Ampersand EPs (CDs with 5-6 songs on them) called \"Julie Garnye - \u0026amp;\" -\u00a0EPs will include: \"\u0026amp; Favorite Male Duets\", \"\u0026amp; Favorite Female Duets\", \"\u0026amp; Favorite Up\u0026amp;Coming Songwriters\"...and many more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0 --- PHOTOGRAPHY ---\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always dreamed of having a full showing of my photography.

Even $1 per month per song/video/artwork I release will make a huge difference\nand would be greatly appreciated :-) AND...you can limit the number of pieces of art you would like to support per month! So, for example, you\u0027ve decided you want to limit your pledges to $5 per month. You choose the $1 level per art-release. Then, in a given month, I release 8 new songs. That\u0027s okay - you will still be only charged your set limit of $5 (for the first 5 songs I release).
