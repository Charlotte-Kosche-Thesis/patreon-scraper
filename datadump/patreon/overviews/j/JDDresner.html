Thus far I\u0027ve completed a novella and a novelette, both of which are available for purchase, and I\u0027ve finished the first draft of a 4-book epic, tentatively titled, \"The Talisman Series.\" It is my dream, my desire, and my drive to publish these stories, to bring joy to fantasy-lovers around the world, and to help develop other aspiring writers in their publishing pursuits.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eHow Did Corwyn Come To Exist?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/botophucket_01/News%20RING%20400x400.png\" style=\"width: 61px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIt all began when I was young, quite illiterate, and somewhat introverted. I\u0027d draw all day long, often depicting gods, adventurers, fabled lands, and lost magical artefacts. Eventually (after failing English 3 times in high school, spending class after class drawing wizards in the margins of my notebook) something changed within me. Sometime between my struggling teenage years and my budding college 20\u0027s I fell in love with the English language. I started to write; I began to escape into the world that existed between my fingers and the keyboard.One day a friend asked me to write him a Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons campaign... I wrote for two months strait, and at the end of it I handed him a binder filled with pages describing a world of magic, turmoil, and of fantastic beings. By then he\u0027d given up on the campaign, and I was left with a detailed outline for what I believed could be a novel worth writing\u0026#8212;I just needed to write it. A decade and 4 books later, the planet Corwyn developed into a richly populated world where magic is a common practice, but science is on the brink of booming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eSo, Tell Me More About This New Fantasy World?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tCorwyn is a world where magic and mythical creatures exist, where humans, dwarves, the nymn, and elves live in relative peace, and where imagination becomes reality. Civilization is on the bring of scientific revolution: lightning-charged bulbs are slowly replacing magically conjured light, the gnomes are tinkering with steam-powered mechanisms, and the first locomotive is being developed in central Craggmo\u00e4. The world is on the brink of change as The Age of Thieves winds down.\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOnly four seasons remain before the dawn of the new age, and there are but a few individuals who know what changes shall come\u0026#8212;for with each new age there is always change. One age brought darkness into the world, where malevolence overpowered the good-willed, and chaos and anarchy dominated over control and peace. Another, peaceful age introduced the gnomes and nymn races to the world. The inhabitants of Corwyn see each age as a \u0027tweaking\u0027 of their universe\u0026#8212;to some these changes are the gods\u0027 decree, while the more scientific minds consider these changes to be evolutionary steps, or alterations in the physics of reality.\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tNow, an indescribable evil has arisen. The dead lands of \u00cessard stirs once more, and a looming shroud has begun to spread across the continent. Four magical talismans\u0026#8212;created in an age where magic potential was unhindered\u0026#8212;have revealed themselves after spending many years in hiding. These talismans are the key to controlling the realms, and it is believed that whomever wields these talismans shall ultimately shape the new age in their image.\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/botophucket_01/Anthon82916nosig.jpg\" style=\"width: 119px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tAnthyn Ambrose is an everyday swordsman who grew up in the shadow of his father.

Accompanied by the half-dwarven son of a senator, D\u0026#243; Karr D\u00e2yne, and the chatter-mouthed thief, Nina Kevlar, Anthyn ventures outside his hometown for the first time. In his travels he sees wondrous things\u0026#8212;things he never knew existed before\u0026#8212;but danger lurks wherever he goes. Conniving spell-casters continually attempt to control him, factions and fanatical groups are hunting for him, and a dark past is catching up with him... but that isn\u0026#8217;t the worst of it: There are those with incredible power who seek the four talismans, and they believe Anthyn and his group of adventurers are the key to finding them.\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Can I Find\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Corwyn Chronicles\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e Sources \u0026amp; Media?\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsite: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.CorwynChronicles.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.CorwynChronicles.ca\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CorwynChronicles/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/CorwynChronicles/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eInstagram: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jddresner/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/jddresner/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTwitter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JDDresner\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/JDDresner\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBOOKS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eA Goblin\u0027s Mind\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eChapters/Indigo:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/a-goblins-mind-extended-edition/9780993653254-item.html?ikwid=a+goblin%27s+mind\u0026amp;ikwsec=Home\u0026amp;ikwidx=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u00a0https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/a-gobli...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBarnes \u0026amp; Noble:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-goblins-mind-jd-dresner/1123877415?ean=9780993653254\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-goblins-mind-jd-...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAm\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eazon:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Goblins-Mind-Extended-J-Dresner/dp/0993653251/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Goblins-Mind-Extended-J-Dre...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eSword \u0026amp; Witchhazel: A Fraternal Tale\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.corwynchronicles.ca/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.corwynchronicles.ca/shop/\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/botophucket_01/My%20Art/A%20Goblins%20Mind%20FOR%20ADS%20-%20POCKET%20EDITION.jpg\" style=\"width: 163px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Links:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://writerscommunity.co.uk/community-articles/book-promotions/267-a-goblin-s-mind-extended-edition-book-by-j-d-dresner-jddresner\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out my author interview here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
