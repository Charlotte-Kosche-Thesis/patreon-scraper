Imagine lobbing those feelings and prayers aimlessly at the world, hoping someone might be struck by them, and in turn stuck with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking games is like that for me. It\u0027s hard; painstakingly so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so is needing help. \u003cstrong\u003eI can\u2019t do this anymore without you\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year I made my first game, \u003ca href=\"http://jillgamesh.itch.io/stealth\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSTEALTH\u003c/a\u003e, a sad story about a girl who got everything she ever wanted. I almost didn\u2019t finish it, because I was scared that it was a story no one wanted to hear. It took a lot of encouragement, but when I released it I was completely overwhelmed by how many people found it meaningful and powerful. It emboldened me to participate in my first game jam, where I made \u003ca href=\"http://jillgamesh.itch.io/cybernetic-ghost-symphony\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCybernetic Ghost Symphony\u003c/a\u003e, a video game peculiarity about finding connection. I want to make more games revolving around intimacy, because I think there\u2019s a lot there to explore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to build brave spaces in my games\u003c/strong\u003e, where players are asked to be vulnerable, to feel things that are not always safe. I will not shy away from pain in my games, but I will never ask you to go somewhere that I\u0027m not going with you, and I will always be mindful to create in a way that is responsible and accountable to the impact my words may have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create more\u003c/strong\u003e. I want to show you more of the dark places that we share, but don\u0027t yet know it. I want to make more games that are representative of trans girls/women, that show the world we are human and that we love/yearn/fuck/bleed like humans do; more importantly, I want to make games that will be found by the trans girls/women that need to find them, to have something, anything that reflects their pain back at them in a beautiful way, to give them a way to process that pain in a world that refuses to give them that space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create better\u003c/strong\u003e. I want to have more time to work on composing music and making art for my games. I\u0027ve dabbled in pixel art in the past, but haven\u0027t had the time to really commit. I\u0027m also suddenly finding composing music (something I\u0027ve always wanted to do but found inaccessible) is something I\u0027m pretty good at, if a bit rough around the edges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only thing I ever want to ask of players is their openness. I never planned to be paid for making cool things, but I can\u0027t make anything if I\u0027m dealing with insecurities about housing, tuition, food, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so,\u00a0this Patreon is me being vulnerable with you. Asking you to value my work enough to use your limited resources to support it is the scariest thing I\u0027ve done so far in my creative life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I must ask... Will you take my hand and be vulnerable with me?\u003cbr\u003e"
