    "summary": "The phrase starving artist is used with such a light-hearted attitude that people often forget the truth behind it. No, I\u0027m not literally starving. Let\u0027s not get dramatic! I am, however, an artist of various mediums like graphite pencil, colored pencil, watercolors, and oil paints. Additionally, I\u0027m an indie author. I\u0027ve published a few books on my own. One of those books is a novel set during the American Civil War and I\u0027m working on the second book in my trilogy now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of artists and authors out there. I\u0027m no better or worse than my fellows, yet what makes me different is my living circumstances. Funding my art, whether fine art or written art, is extremely difficult because of my disability - a condition that does not allow me to work. I was born with a congenital condition called Arthrogryposis, which makes it impossible to use my hands for anything, so I use my mouth to type, paint, and everything else.\u00a0Any money raised here at Patreon would be used for research materials and publishing costs for my novels, while the fine arts area would be funded to purchase better quality pencils, markers, paints, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to utilize Patreon so I can better my artistic position and generate more consumer-based income that will end my need for donations. In other words, I\u0027m working toward independence. In addition to publishing more books, I\u0027d like to create enough new art to open an Etsy store for selling prints, greeting cards, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering me!

     "about": "From my website:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJessica Jewett is an author, artist and a spiritual intuitive, or often referred to as a psychic medium. Her birth name is Jessica Jones but she takes her professional name, Jewett, from her maternal line. The name she chose to use professionally is to remember and honor the strong women whose blood carries that name \u2014 women like nineteenth century Maine author, Sarah Orne Jewett. At 30, Jessica has accomplished more than most twice her age with the publication of several fiction and poetry titles, success as a commission portrait and landscape artist, and now as a spiritual intuitive with public readings in such venues as Hot 104.5 The Beat of Knoxville. She comes from a 300-year genetic line of various types of intuitives going back to France and has been an intuitive herself from birth. Her areas of expertise include Tarot reading applied to a variety of areas and individual questions, past life readings; she have skills as a physical medium when the situation arises, and she also does spiritual counseling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtistically, Jessica began her expression through paint and pencil before she could read. Family, friends and teachers quickly recognized that her paintings and drawings surpassed her peers in skill and precision. She grew up winning numerous awards in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as Northwest Georgia and Atlanta, having no trouble competing with able-bodied artists. Her unique approach, using pencils, brushes and other tools in her mouth, amazes and inspires all who meet her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJessica\u2019s interests are inspired by her background and are present in her everyday life. She spends a great deal of time both researching the nineteenth century and her family\u2019s genealogy. Her heritage is a typical American mixed bag of German, French Huguenot, English and Native American (Oklahoma Cherokee, Choctaw on her father\u2019s side and possibly Lakota on her mother\u2019s side). She is a member of the expansive Jewett family, which was among the first families to come to North American shores in the late 1600s, settling Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire. Her family tree includes such notable and intriguing figures as General William Tecumseh Sherman, General Pershing, Sarah Orne Jewett and John O\u2019Connell, who was Jesse James\u2019 embalmer and coffin builder in St. Joseph, Missouri. Her family has fought in every American war since the Colonies were settled, and Jessica aspires to become a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Daughters of the Union.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving in different regions such as Colorado, Missouri, Texas, Georgia, Wisconsin and Tennessee, has afforded Jessica the opportunity to be exposed to different people and traditions. She believes there is a story waiting to be told inside of every person, which is why she keeps several different writing projects going at the same time. The nineteenth century, with an emphasis on family dynamics, social culture and sexual politics, is her favorite subject to write. She also has a great passion for paranormal studies, such as reincarnation and investigating haunted locations, and they often highlight her written and artistic themes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA unique woman with an unconventional perspective, Jessica Jewett has a great deal of creativity and insight to share with the world.\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "Writing historical fiction isn\u0027t easy and it requires about three times as many man hours doing research as it does actually writing the book. My main area of research is the American Civil War as well as the French Revolution and Edwardian periods. All of these periods require a lot of reading to fully understand. Books aren\u0027t cheap and neither is paying for historical society research. Meeting this goal will assist me in finishing my current American Civil War novel.",
