I\u0027ve been involved in photography for years now, ever since I was a teenager\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I got a part-time job as a photographer I was captivated with capturing every beautiful moment I could. That split of a second, when the shutter fires, captures for eternity that special moment. This has taught me to see the world from a totally different point of view.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jantanski.com/pat/szk07.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jantanski.com/pat/szk08.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the years I have expanded different passions thanks to photography. For several years I was a director of bodypainting contest, cooperated with cultural foundations and organizations. At the moment I help people to break their complexes by charity work at Development of Medical Make-Up Foundation \u201cKamufla\u017c\u201d, where we help children and adults with skin changes, such as scars or malformations. Short make-up class increases their faith in themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3.purplecdn.com/i/p/967/96776-a1463823658639.jpg?1463823627\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a photographer, I constantly look for new challenges and new fields where I can check my skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jantanski.com/pat/Crep03.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jantanski.com/pat/Crep04.jpg\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor that reason I\u2019m now going back to my model photography and combining all the aspects of my previous jobs with my hobby as a \u003cem\u003erecreational\u003c/em\u003e diver with the hopes of developing my underwater photography. I am hoping to start using models, for artistic images, taken underwater. They will then be posted regularly online and available to buy as prints. I also hope to have an exhibition at some point, showing this work off. \u003cbr\u003eSo, to make my dreams come true I started youtube channel where I will upload my \"How to ..\" videos, showing every step of photography. You might find them interesting as I try to introduce in it some basic and intermediate knowledge every photographer should have in my opinion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know you must get lots of requests asking for support, but what I have planned is a totally unique idea in the UK, but I can only do this via help from the likes of yourselves. \u003cbr\u003eThanks again for checking me out, and I hope to see you on my patron list!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jantanski.com/pat/Under04.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eModel : Olga Krasova\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jantanski.com/pat/Under02.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eModel ; Dagmara Adamiak\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jantanski.com/pat/Under01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eModel ; Irena Szeszko\u003c/em\u003e"
