    "summary": "Listen: writing is my everything. I bleed ink, I breath words, and this ink-stained, hatchet-hacked heart becomes turgid--swells and swoops and swoons--at merely the thought of putting pen to paper since before I can remember.\u003cbr\u003ePut simply, not being a writer is not an option. I consider myself extremely lucky to have found my passion so early in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because I\u0027d love deeper connections with readers, ones in which we can support each other through reciprocity; an organized platform like Patreon seems like an ideal place to organize myself, my readers, foster and expand reciprocity--and give my readers some super awesome sneak peaks as well as give them a say in what they want to see (or not see) in my work as a wordsmith.\u003cbr\u003eWriting isn\u0027t necessarily a financially viable profession--unless your famous, or dead (those two rarely seem to be mutually exclusive when it comes to art). Right now, as a disabled individual, my income isn\u0027t the spitting image of sustainable or gainful. Creating is the center of my life, and continuing to do so--while still being able to pay the bills, put gas in my junk-heap of a vehicle, care for my dog, engage my students with the time and attention they deserve, etc. Ultimately, \u003cbr\u003eI wish to fund a collection of poetry, short stories, essays, a novella--or all three! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also like to be able to eventually offer my tutoring students a more comprehensive, one-on-one education; where I currently work as a tutor caps out at eight hours per week, and I\u0027m given several students at once--which means very few are getting the time and attention they, and their hard work, deserve; all of which I\u0027d be able to offer if I was able to offer private, freelance tutoring.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA thousand thank yous to my supporters, patrons or otherwise. You slowly sipping my poetic puddles and gnashing your teeth into who I am and what I do? That means the world to me. Believe that.\u003cbr\u003e"
