    "summary": "Years 1-17 I grew up in an abusive home. Years 18-21 I turned to drugs, and any vice the world could offer to help me forget my childhood. When I turned 22, I felt as numb and empty as a person could. Because of patient and openminded people, I turned back to the faith I was raised in and I began to actually feel again. For the first time in my life I was truly happy. I decided to continue on this path and chose to give up two years of my life to share a message that had brought me the most happiness I\u0027d ever felt. Two days after I got home, I didn\u0027t want that happiness to end, so in a small effort to continue to share the message I had been for the past two years, I changed all of my social media to, \"James The Mormon\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFour years later after a divorce and feeling broken again, I chose to pick up a hobby I\u0027d had since I was 17. As an outlet I would post amateur rap videos to my social media, and those that followed me chose to call me, \"James The Mormon\" as an artist, and it just stuck. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruthfully I never thought members of my church ever would embrace Hip-Hop regardless of how edited, or clean it was. My hope was to make positive secular music so that those not of our faith could see Mormons in a more openminded way. My hope was that regardless of one\u0027s faith, it was possible to listen to a song and either feel motivated or edified. I\u0027ve never veered from that goal, and I never will. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an attempt to more effectively \u0026amp; widely share our content with those around the world that are not of our faith, we sought out reputable publicists to help us accomplish our real goal; to have this music heard by the world. After nine months of phone calls and emails to everyone we could think to reach out to, one firm actually called us back. We couldn\u0027t believe that the same publicist that manages Beyonce called us back. Not only did they call us back, but they loved our story, they saw all the work we\u0027d put in, and how a community in a state/religion that has never before been in the spotlight for Hip-Hop was making unprecedented, independent headway. Although they had never brought on an independent artist, they were willing to take us on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile it is extremely flattering and we are so grateful that they were able to take us on as a client, it\u0027s quickly depleted our savings. We understand this is the cost of doing business, however, we burnt through what we saved from shows and streaming revenues. We are constantly working hard to make positive music and release music videos in 2018. To be able to reach the most people, we would love to continue working with our current publicist, but we need your help. If you enjoy our music, videos, or other content and would like to support us, it would honestly mean the world. Thank you for helping us change perspectives, open minds, and spread love.\u003cbr\u003e"
