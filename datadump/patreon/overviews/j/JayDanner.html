    "summary": "Hello My name is Jay, I\u00a0 am\u00a0 always learning, and seeking to understand the best way of doing things. A few years ago I became aware of the Electric vehicle Revolution and began following along with the advances in technology , the adoption rate , and obtained electric cars I could test . I concluded that \"Yes\" Electric vehicles are taking over and are the best choice, even at today\u0027s prices . Furthermore, it dawned on me that\u00a0 over the road transportation was this revolutions first stop.\u00a0 Electric vehicles are simpler by design and have far greater performance and efficiency.I predict that all forms of transportation will be effected.\u00a0 I decided my place would be with boats, preferably live a board\u0027s. I formed a business to build boats, Currently working towards research and development.. I found a 41ft Viking Sport Fish that would be just perfect to start with. The help you give to me will go to making this goal a reality. Together we can do our part to Free the boating industry from fossil fuels and protect our waters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Thank you for your support my friends.\u003cbr\u003e"
