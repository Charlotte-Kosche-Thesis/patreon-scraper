So, if it\u2019s in the newspapers, public theology has something to say about it. Likewise, I am a theologian \u003cem\u003efor \u003c/em\u003ethe public, not just for those from a particular religious background. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write and offer speaking, teaching, and facilitating for workshops, conferences, and other events as well as sessions for individuals and small groups for spiritual coaching and theological conversations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve worked as a consultant, researcher, project coordinator, advisor, minister/chaplain, teacher, and manager around issues of religion, collective memory, social justice, reconciliation, theology, ethics, community engagement, and education for the last 20 years in the U.S., UK, Former Yugoslavia, and Northern Ireland. I\u2019m currently based in Dorset, England.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn and raised in the Deep South of the U.S., I learned early on about negotiating boundaries related to race, gender, identity, politics, and faith. After university, I worked for two years in post-war Sarajevo, Bosnia and Hercegovina undertaking crisis response, humanitarian aid, reconstruction, and educational efforts. I then returned to the U.S. to go to seminary where I ministered in local churches and also worked a year in Croatia working on inter-faith dialogue, peace, reconciliation, and conflict transformation issues. I then moved to Northern Ireland to do peace work and to complete my Ph.D. in Theology and am now based in Dorset, England. \u00a0My latest publication is my book\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wipfandstock.com/safeguarding-the-stranger.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSafeguarding the Stranger: An Abrahamic Theology and Ethic of Protective Hospitality (Pickwick: 2016)\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that thought and belief informs\naction; what we think and believe determines what we do and how we\nbehave.  Theology does not exist in a vacuum.  There\u2019s good theology (healthy, life-giving)\nand bad theology (unhealthy, destructive). \nI like identifying bad theology and formulating good theology.  When we believe that our faith is exclusive\nand for a \"chosen few\", efforts at solidarity for others who are\nsuffering are rebuked or punished.  When\nwe believe that our faith calls us to welcome and provide hospitable space to\nthe stranger, our actions of providing sanctuary set up relationships of\nreciprocity that counter the violence and exclusivity that surrounds us,\ncreating stronger, healthier, vibrant, cooperative communities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m not just a blogger putting my ideas out into the ether of the interwebs (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that per se). I seek to be in conversation, to engage with people who have deep questions and innovative ideas, and to find new ways to communicate about spirituality, theology, ethics, and what it means to be human.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWHAT MAKES MY APPROACH UNIQUE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGender-inclusive language for God\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 To me, God is male, God is female, God is neither. As a feminist theologian and activist for LGBTQI inclusivity, it is important for me to make space for the feminine, as well as masculine, characteristics of God without assigning a gender identity. God-talk is difficult enough as it is without muddying it up with gendered pronouns and social constructs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHonesty\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 I have no formal denominational ties, and, therefore, I answer to no one and can speak and write without having to tow a \u2018party line.\u2019 As such, I have no agenda other than seeing the world become a better place for everyone. Also, you may occasionally see colorful language used. I think the occasional use of expletives can be holy; so while I certainly self-moderate, I do not self-censor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIrreverence\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 G.K. Chesterton wrote in his collection of essays, \u003cem\u003eAll Things Considered\u003c/em\u003e (1908), that \u201cit is the test of a good religion whether you can joke about it.\u201d Humor and irreverence are spiritual values for me, and being unable to find the humor in scripture, or to laugh \u2013 whether it\u2019s a belly laugh or satire \u2013 at religion, church, and the ways we as humans try to relate to God and each other is a good test as to what we\u2019ve perhaps made into idols.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoubt as a spiritual value\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 I don\u2019t seek to know all the answers, but asking the questions is still important. Certainty is often an illusion and I find I\u2019m a kinder, gentler person when I embrace the not-knowing. I think curiosity (rather than cleanliness) is next to godliness, and doubt is essential for healthy curiosity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWHY AM I ASKING FOR SUPPORT THROUGH PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have a side-gig as my day job. \u00a0I\u0027d prefer to be doing this type of work - writing, teaching, speaking, conducting workshops, providing spiritual coaching and theological conversation sessions - as a full-time job. \u00a0This is where Patreon support comes in as it enables me to supplement my income in a way that makes the movement toward this work becoming full-time more of a reality. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all know that our current context is increasingly secular, with the rise of the \"spiritual, but not religious\" or \"no faith\" people growing each year. \u00a0And yet, people long for safe places to have significant conversations, to ask questions about faith, religion and theology and why it matters with someone who has no agenda other than seeing the world be a better place. \u00a0I have no denominational affiliations, no desire to evangelize or recruit new believers. \u00a0I am simply interested in delving deeper; indulging curiosity about God and the world around us; working to support social justice around issues of gender, race, sexuality, and violence; and helping to create safe places for people to explore. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support you can give to make this happen will be greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can visit my website and more information about my work at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jaymereaves.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.jaymereaves.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you would prefer to give a singular donation rather than a recurring one, please \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/send-money-online\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evisit Paypal\u003c/a\u003e and use my email address jaymereaves [at] gmail.com.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e"

     "description": "I\u0027m trying to build up my work as a public theologian, doing speaking, teaching, and lecturing for workshops, conferences, and bespoke events as well as offering more spiritual coaching and theological conversation sessions.  For every $1000 contributed, it pays for me to dedicate 3 days per week to write and publish more, post more content on my website and social media, pay overhead costs, and have greater availability for sessions and events.\u00a0I\u0027ve\u00a0also instituted a system whereby workshops, sessions, and other things I do are available either for free or at a subsidized rate for those who need it and your support enables me to do more of that type of work.\u003cbr\u003e",
