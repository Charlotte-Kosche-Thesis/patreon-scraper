    "summary": "I am a writer and musician. I have published two books of poetry as an \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Janey-Colbourne/e/B0189YDGFE/\"\u003eindependent author\u003c/a\u003e and am currently working on two non-fiction books about how humanity relates to the rest of nature. This is a crucial time in our evolution and the collective choices we make in the next few decades will have an irreversible impact on future generations. I have a particular interest in environmental humanities as I believe exploring this intersection of science, arts and humanities is one of the ways we can move forward and restore balance in our approach to life. I have a background in science, languages and the arts. I trained as a medical herbalist and have studied shamanism. My work is philosophical and political at times but also intended to be lyrical and inspirational. My music is a mixture of spoken word, song and electronica.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently recording a new collection of spoken word, songs and music. I write a blog at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://heartseer.wordpress.com\"\u003eheartseer.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e and am quite active on my Twitter account\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JaneyColbourne\"\u003e@JaneyColbourne\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0raising awareness for nature and environmental issues, human rights and equality. I have written on subjects such as nature, health, shamanism, capitalism, politics, feminism, disability and neurodiversity. I write from the heart, but also seek to provide informed and well-researched information in an accessible manner. My work appears diverse and yet it is diversity that unites it in a common thread. Diversity is what makes life rich and embracing diversity is paradoxically what will bring us to a true unity of acceptance and harmony, rather than the forced and oppressive homogeneity of modern capitalist culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeally I would like to earn a full time income from my creative work. I believe I have something worthwhile, important and highly relevant to share with the world. I wish to speak for the disenfranchised; for more-than-human nature, for those living in poverty, the disabled and those who suffer discrimination. I want to continue to be accessible to those who cannot pay for my work and to share more widely my vision for a better future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI put out a lot of work for free and a living wage would allow me to continue this on long-term basis alongside working on my books. I have had good feedback from my followers, readers and listeners, but am finding it a very slow process to get more widely known in order to make a full time living so that I can continue to provide creative works. Support via Patreon would help me to continue working and also invest in promoting my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA quote\u00a0from a review of \u0027Growing with Gratitude\u0027, my second poetry book:\u003cbr\u003e\"She is a writer with great depth and insight into the essential nature of existence and has that rare capacity to write from the soul whilst also being grounded in the real world.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
