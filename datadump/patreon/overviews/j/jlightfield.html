    "summary": "Hi there, if you have been thinking about making your town or city suck less, then you\u0027ve landed at the right place. I\u0027ve spent the last 10 years or so, trying to make a small Connecticut town become cooler, more vibrant and well, a place that is with living in. Whether you are thinking of creative placemaking, tactical urbanism, or just plain old neighborhood activism, this is where you will find how-to guides, videos and podcasts about how to make a place better.\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010 I co-founded Norwalk 2.0, after stepping down from chairing the Norwalk Zoning Commission and Arts Commission. Working within government, as in being appointed to serve on boards and commissions, is one way to be a change agent in your town or city. But sometimes being on the inside, means less time for doing stuff that makes a ding in the universe. So, following a long career in tech startups, I launched a non-profit startup. At Norwalk 2.0, we raise money writing grants, and asking for support from people, corporations, and foundations. It is the traditional way that non-profits go about raising money. But all that time, could be better spent sharing how to do what we do, anywhere in the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObstacles and challenges to making something happen in a town or city are somewhat universal. Rules and regulations, apathy, fear of change, all play a role in just about every community. Knowing that someone else may have solved a problem you\u0027ve identified is a good way to prove your case to make it easier for you to achieve your goal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of the stuff that I will post here will be not only, things Norwalk 2.0 has done, but also things other communities and fellow change-makers have done. More importantly this will be a place you can ask questions about your projects and get help figuring things out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027ll Use the Money For:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy initial goal is $6,000/month. That money plus grant income will be enough to keep me going, indefinitely. Here are some costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHosting. Yep, there\u0027s a website that I\u0027ll need to support the usual spikes in traffic and downloads. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMailChimp. I\u0027e been using MailChimp to email updates to the subscription list, but the more your list grows, the more the fee grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFacebook and LinkedIn post \"boosts\". When I announce a new post either on Facebook or LinkedIn, it needs to reach as many of our followers as it can. Both platforms share for this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMe. I have minimal expenses, but I still need to pay rent, food and keep the lights on and the Internet accessible. And these days the storage costs of stuff like digital files, and gear to make videos, photos, and plans keep growing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the just the basics. If there\u0027s demand for other stuff, I\u0027ll update what the $ are going towards.\u00a0"
