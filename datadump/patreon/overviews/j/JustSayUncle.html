     "about": "My first big break in cartooning was signing a development deal with \u003cstrong\u003eKing Features\u003c/strong\u003e in 1993. The deal, for a strip called \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"The Alden Reid Show,\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e lasted a year and was a clinic in how to deal with frustration. My editor frequently lost my weekly samples or kept me busy trying to figure out what size noses would look best on my characters. Had they not been paying me, I don\u0027t think I would\u0027ve lasted the full year. In the end, my editor decided against syndication, commenting, \"Your strip is about a teenager. Teenagers don\u0027t read newspaper comics.\" A few years later, King would find great success with \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Zits.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e I pressed on\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n  Putting together an entire submission packet is an unbelievable amount of work, especially when you\u0027re working a day job on an assembly line, like I was. Eventually, I was offered another development deal with King. I kept my nose to the grindstone, convinced that if I jumped through every hoop put in front of me, I\u0027d eventually come out on top. As the year wore on, my editor\u0027s notes on my strip became less frequent. Phone calls weren\u0027t being returned. Like a jalopy on the way to the junkyard, my tenure at \u003cstrong\u003e\"The House That Popeye Built\"\u003c/strong\u003e ended with a sputter and a wheeze.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n  Several years later, I approached my local paper, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Kenosha News\u003c/strong\u003e, with an idea for a strip that revolved around a multi-generational Kenosha family. I did a few samples, and they liked them. I\u0027ve been supplying jabs at city council members and commentary on local news stories for nearly ten years now. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n  For me, getting a shot now with \u003cstrong\u003eGoComics\u003c/strong\u003e is comparable to having played minor league baseball for a decade and then being called up by the New York Yankees. Seeing \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Just Say \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUncle\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e on the same page as \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Peanuts\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e makes me feel exactly how every rookie must\u0027ve felt, the first time they put on the very same Yankee pinstripes that Babe Ruth once wore. There is a pride in stepping up to the plate in this stadium that\u0027s always with me. It\u0027s probably the greatest thing that I\u0027ve ever done, or ever will do, the only rub being that it doesn\u0027t pay much.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n  My love of the comics is firmly rooted in \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Peanuts.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e As a kid, I used to snip the dailies out of the newspaper and glue them into spiral notebooks, creating my own comic books. There is a warmth and comfort that I\u0027ve always felt in Schulz\u0027s work that has never been duplicated. I suppose that\u0027s what I\u0027m ultimately striving for in my own work. These days a lot of strips are centered around animals or characters that are \"edgy.\" For what it\u0027s worth, I\u0027m more than happy to go in the other direction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://s809.photobucket.com/user/Dan_Pavelich/media/Uncle_zpsxnxporjo.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026amp;o=2\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i809.photobucket.com/albums/zz11/Dan_Pavelich/Uncle_zpsxnxporjo.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
