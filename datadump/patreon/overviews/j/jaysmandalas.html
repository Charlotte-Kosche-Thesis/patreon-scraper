    "summary": "I have been weaving Ojos de Dios yarn mandalas ever since the late 1960\u0027s, after seeing an amazing similarity of such work from both Huicholi natives of Mexico, and Tibetan lamas. Since then I have held workshops in the United States and India, and given away many thousands copies of the free instructions offered on\u00a0 my website, \u003ca href=\"http://ojos-de-dios.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOjos-de-Dios.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 I also founded the facebook group, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/ojosoftheworld\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOjos de Dios, yarn mandalas of the world \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough these websites, I continue to post instructions and tips on a regular basis, and answer questions from facebook posters. Now in my life I want to spend more time writing up my experiences and spreading my knowledge through blogs, expanding and updating my instructions, and write an e-book that chapter by chapter tells the story of my creative life with yarn mandalas, and includes detailed tips on creating them. Also I want to travel to countries where my fans live and hold workshops and give private lessons to my patrons.\u00a0 Training apprentices to keep my jaysmandalas.etsy.com shop running is also an important goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read for free the start of my book at \u003ca href=\"http://ojo.guru/book\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eojo.guru/book\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

This applies to anywhere in the world, once I have an income from Patreon pledges of at least $500 a month. Travel is dependent on my health and ability to get a visa to your country. Travel to Russia is a problem because of visa requirements, but if I cannot travel to Russia, or another country with visa problems, I will pay for YOU to travel to my home in India, where, once my pledges reach $500 a month, I plan on spending at least 3 months of every year. Anyone pledging $20 a month will have the option of, instead of me traveling to you, I will pay for you to travel either to India, or to my home in Asheville NC, USA, whichever is closer. Please accept that it may be as long as 2 years from the time my pledges reach $1000 before I arrange to travel to your country, depending on the number of people that pledge this much. I am currently setting a limit of 25 for this pledge amount and rewards. You will also receive updates to my book and instructions and access to my Patreon blog. As much as possible, I will travel to places in the order in which the pledges are received. Of course, pledges from the same country, or from two or more close together countries, will be combined into one trip when feasible.\u00a0 The only exceptions are: $20 Pledges from people within North Carolina will be honored within 2 years of total pledges reaching $100. Pledges within other parts of USA, Mexico, or Canada will be honored within 2 years of total pledges reaching $200. \u003cbr\u003e",

Again, I think I would have problems getting the proper visa for Russia, so consider this before pledging. Other countries I would only hold workshops if I can travel on a work visa, so also consider this before pledging this amount. I would do my best to get a work visa, but I can\u0027t guarantee my ability to do so.\u00a0 Also, please note, my ability to travel to workshops is, like with the $20 option, dependent on the total of all pledges reaching $500 a month, which may or not happen, and then I reserve the right to schedule travel to any particular country for as late as two years after pledges reaching $500 a month.
