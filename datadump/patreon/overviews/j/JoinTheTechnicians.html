I\u2019m Jeremiah, a maker who\u0027s lucky to have such an incredible group of intelligent friends who love sharing their knowledge as much as I do! Together, we form a powerful team dedicated to teaching you how to build fantastic gadgets and experimental devices. \u00a0The best part about being an educator is seeing all the amazing creations you make from the content we share. \u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you can imagine, making clear detailed tutorials and quality video content takes lots of time.  Time that we currently must spend working to keep the lights on here at the shop.   We would absolutely love to spend our days sharing everything we\u2019ve learned in our many diverse areas of expertise, but can\u0027t do it without your support.  When you choose to help us create powerful new videos with your pledge, you enable us to help you take your creative experimenting to the next level! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As we grow and earn the support of generous patrons like you, we can and will devote increasingly more time on creating new content.  We give away most of our content for free. So for those who love what we do and just want to support our mission to spread knowledge, you can chose to help make every viewer\u2019s brain a little brighter by pledging to \u201cBe First to Receive Video Content.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And for those who want advanced content and tutorials that are too dangerous to share publicly.  You can choose to make a pledge per video release with \u201cAccess to pretty much everything.\u201d  I sincerely hope you feel that we have earned your support."
