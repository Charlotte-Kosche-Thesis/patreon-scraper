Here goes nothing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am obsessed with abandoned places. And I am always taking photos of them and living in them in my mind. (Well, sort of.) I\u0027m creative about 90% of the time (and the other 10% is sleep) and always coming up with scenarios in my head that strike me as a great story. Growing up, I went from wanting to be a firefighter and a million other things until I landed on \"writer.\" For years, my free time was spent writing. And one day, photography took over and I very quickly was able to switch gears. And I always said I would make a new kind of book. One filled with photos and words. One with \u003cem\u003emeaning.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I want to share history, I want to share facts, I want to share \u003cem\u003efeelings.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and that is what I will do!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith pledges from my patrons, I will be able to follow my dreams to write my books and take my photos! All proceeds go directly to the process of taking photos, writing, and publishing! Thank you so much for your kindness and your help! Become a patron today to see what my first project is!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: if you decide not to become a patron, but are still interested in following my whereabouts and how far along this process I am, please feel free to find me on:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/jillthephotog\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/jillthephotog\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/jillthephotog\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jillthephotog.wordpress.com\"\u003eBlog\u003c/a\u003e, my own\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jillthephotog.com\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e, or send me\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:jillthephotog@photographer.net\"\u003ea message\u003c/a\u003e!\u00a0"
