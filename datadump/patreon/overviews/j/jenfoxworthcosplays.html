I only just started doing this seriously this year, on a whim, as something fun, that I turned out really really loving, and strangely enough, it appears ALOT of people really like what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should one support this particular cosplay patreon? Well, for one, even though I started doing it just for fun, it has expanded, and I\u0027m doing more then one character now, and it\u0027s taking time and money to keep it up. If I\u0027m going to continue bringing people this content, I still have to be able to support myself and my kids while doing it, since it\u0027s taking that out of my regular work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two kids and am a single parent, and work almost constantly, so if I want to keep this up, I\u0027m going to have to start including it in my work as well. Which I\u0027ve already started doing to some degree, this is just another step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecial guest appearances/content may also show up, since I have a few friends who are extremely lovely VA\u0027s as well. My son also does cosplay as well, so he will make some appearances too, fan favorite so far is his Mini-Flug!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you cannot pledge, I do invite you to follow this page, because you will still get updates, and see lots of free stuff I post too! Tis not a paywall, all final cosplay images will be released for free for viewing. The behind the scenes, extras, and WIP things and maybe a few quick things here and there will be what will be included as extra content for patrons.\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to tip/support without using patreon, you can do so here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/jenfoxworth\"\u003ehttps://www.paypal.me/jenfoxworth\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main work is commissions and etc. That patreon can be viewed here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/jenfoxworth\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/jenfoxworth\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
