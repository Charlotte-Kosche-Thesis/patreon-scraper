    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page. I\u0027m James D. Fawkes, writer and hobbyist artist, and I\u0027ll be in your care. Pleased to meet you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReading and writing are my two greatest passions (although I\u0027ve been known to enjoy video games a time or two, as well), and I\u0027ve spent the past twelve years on the fanfiction scene in some form or another. Ever since I first picked up \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u0027s Stone\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0as a child and discovered the beauty of a good story, it\u0027s been my dream to become an author and turn my passion into a career I could live off of. It\u0027s my hope to use this Patreon page to fuel that passion until I can publish my first official novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I\u0027m not selling my fanfiction - that\u0027s outright copyright infringement, and very, very illegal - so it\u0027s always free. Supporting me as a patron is more like passing a tenner off to a street musician who\u0027s playing your favorite song. You know he has dreams of making it big, but until he does, you\u0027re gonna go up to him every month and drop a few bucks into his instrument case, because you think he plays well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you write?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m mostly doing fanfiction, although I plan to get my original fiction published eventually. As for genres, my favorite is fantasy, although I \u003cem\u003ehave \u003c/em\u003ebeen known to enjoy a good sci-fi, every now and again. To get more specific, Wainscot fantasy, like \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter, Bleach\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eFate/stay night, \u003c/em\u003eis what I like best, but I do like High fantasy like \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eDark Souls\u003c/em\u003e, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that vein, what I like to write about is themes of heroism and themes of the utility of power. I like to write about characters who have lots of power, but struggle because it can\u0027t solve their problems. I like to explore the idea of what it means to be a hero, of characters who are constantly fighting their own doubts and fears, of characters who struggle against society and their roles in it, against the plotting of intelligent villains, and especially against the reality of their own limitations. If, in the middle of all of this, there happens to be a couple of superhuman fighters tearing up the landscape, that\u0027s just a bit of fun and awesome amongst all the darkness and gloom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all, I don\u0027t write \u003cem\u003echaracters\u003c/em\u003e, I write \u003cem\u003epeople\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, that shows up in \u003cem\u003eMiracle of Zero\u003c/em\u003e, which is about a Shirou more in line with an Arthurian Romance protagonist than a shounen protagonist being summoned by Louise de La Valliere and all the butterflies that cause and are caused by that. There\u0027s also \u003cem\u003eAn Essence of Silver and Steel\u003c/em\u003e, a crossover between \u003cem\u003eWorm\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eFate/stay night\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0wherein Taylor Hebert basically gets the powers of a Kaleid Liner (\u003cem\u003ePrisma Illya\u003c/em\u003e).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI understand that a lot of fanfiction authors are doing this, now, but for the moment, it\u0027s a little unavoidable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned above, I want to be a writer. More than anything, that\u0027s what I want to do with my life. Unfortunately, people only want a writer if he has tons of experience in the field he\u0027ll be writing for (I once saw a data entry position at a hospital that required a \u003cem\u003enursing degree\u003c/em\u003e) or for the purpose of writing manuals, neither of which is in my wheelhouse. If I had it my way, I\u0027d be working on the writing team for one of my favorite game studios, like Bungie or Bethesda, but most of their recent openings have also been a little out of my league.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it was just a matter of getting my feet under me, something like this wouldn\u0027t be necessary. I do, however, have student loans to pay back, for as useless as college turned out to be. If I do get a good job or I manage to get picked up by a publisher, then I\u0027ll probably close this down and offer everyone my most heartfelt and sincere thanks for their love and support. Until then, however, if you enjoy my writing, if you enjoy the stories I write, if they bring you joy and happiness and tug at your heartstrings, and if you want to see \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e, then please, consider becoming my Patron, even if it\u0027s only for a dollar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if fulfilling the goals and milestones I have listed here helps me establish an interactive platform to connect with my fanbase that I can keep using once I get published for real, then all the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why should I support you, James?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, early access to everything, for starters. \"Timed exclusivity.\" Once we reach a certain number of patrons (and I figure out how to make it work), the \"what\u0027s next\" poll will be available, too, where you can tell me what you\u0027d like me to work on next (chapter-wise), so if you\u0027d like to see me work more on one thing than the other, you can let me know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons also get complete and first access to my original fiction - the stuff that I self-publish, anyway. Patron-exclusive character portraits for the Eternityverse. In-depth, Patron-exclusive encyclopedia pages for the Eternityverse. Entry into special event raffles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we get up to it, there will be the Fantasy Writing Seminar, wherein I will discuss the process behind building a convincing fantasy world. There will be Patron-exclusive AMA (Ask Me Anything) interviews.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why use a monthly pay model?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause writing contains a few uncertainties. Like with any art form, there will be highs and lows - times where I\u0027m incredibly productive and times when I barely scrape the minimum. A monthly pay system offers the most stability, both to me and my patrons, so that you\u0027re not paying more than you expect to when I have a particularly productive month or two and I\u0027m not suffering for it when life decides to kick me in the shins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, as most of my readers are well aware, \u003cem\u003eMiracle of Zero\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is taking longer and longer to write, because the chapters are fighting me every step of the way, so I\u0027ve gone two, three, or even more months without posting anything for it. On the other hand, I blitzed through the first two arcs of \u003cem\u003eAn Essence of Silver and Steel\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in a little over two months; if it\u0027d been a per item model, I\u0027d have made a couple hundred dollars right there, which probably would have been a nasty surprise for my Patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn \"Chapters-in-Progress via Google Docs\":\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRather than posting a link that every new eligible Patron must go searching for, access to Chapters-in-Progress is given through invites. Those of you who are eligible, please check your email for these invites, and if more than two days have gone by without receiving them, let me know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
