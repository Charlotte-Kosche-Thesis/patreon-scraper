    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eJoin Mai Squad ~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s mind-boggling how we live in a time where the internet can connect us all in a very progressive way.. I am entering a new chapter where I am constantly challenging and evolving myself through artistic expression. Now, through Patreon, YOU can be a part of my journey. I want my true supporters to feel personally connected with me and this is a great way to show my gratitude for your amazing, positive support. Check out the sweet rewards I have in store for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am at a pivotal stage of my life where I\u0027ve had incredible opportunities to pursue my passions. Ever since I was 8 years old, I\u0027ve been relentlessly working hard to create a life where I can inspire people around the world to live positively whether it be through my music, poetry, or personal experiences. I\u0027ve created travel vlogs and inspirational videos in hopes to encourage others to go out and live their best life. For many young people, my videos have been a source of positive motivation to evolve into their greater self. From spoken word poetry to teaching meditation, I am constantly inventing new and unique content to create a movement of awakening people to realize their highest potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy soul purpose is to heal and teach people about positive self-discovery, while accepting that suffering is necessary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy music and poetry demonstrate the polarities of life.. depression, the courage to rise from the ashes, the chaos of living in a materialistic society, a glimpse of hope for generations to come.. Every child knows the song \"twinkle twinkle little star\", but why? I want to revolutionize children\u0027s lullabies and create new songs for our children to sing that bring to light difficult situations and how to gracefully face adversity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you have probably seen in my evolving vlog work, I have started the path of cinematography. I have multiple scripts for films and television series in the works and it would be AMAZING to have your support in bringing them to life!! My scripts and ideas are new, innovative concepts no one\u0027s ever talked about or discussed before because some topics are seen as \"taboo\" or \"unattractive\". Nowadays, I see a lot of movies and television not being creative or \"staying safe\" with their content. I want to make content that \u003cstrong\u003eDEFIES THE NORM\u003c/strong\u003e; content that \u003cstrong\u003eDEVIATES FROM THE EXPECTED\u003c/strong\u003e; content that will shake up society and make them think. I believe art is the way to build a better future; documenting ALL ideas and perspectives is crucial. I have a fresh outlook on the environment and personal experiences (being a first-born generation in America from parents who immigrated from Vietnam) and a vision to capture the struggles of humanity without sugar-coating the truth. I also want to bring a different style of comedy to life: quirky,\u00a0 wholesome that is entertaining to all ages. There isn\u0027t enough of quirky, wholesome comedy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that strengthens the connection between you and me! This is an opportunity for me to thank you for your support by giving y\u0027all awesome monthly rewards. In a nut shell, YOU are becoming a huge part of my artistic journey by supporting me to continue with my creative endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose to be a patron for as long as you\u0027d like and you may cancel at anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am SO beyond blessed to have you on this journey with me.\u003cbr\u003eMuch love and respect to you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003eJeannie Elise Mai\u003cbr\u003e"
