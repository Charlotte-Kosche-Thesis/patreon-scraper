    "summary": "Becoming a parent to 3 siblings transracially adopted through foster care has not been an easy transition, or one that supports 2 full-time, out-of-home working parents. We are over 3 years in \u0026amp; it\u0027s unimaginably difficult for us to meet everyone\u0027s needs as our lifestyle requires tons of built-in flexibility and intentional living.\u00a0We anticipated being strapped for resources, time and energy in choosing to raise 3 kiddos with lots of unique needs and so here we are, making more big choices.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLike these:\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe radically changed our diets back in Nov 2017 in order to reset circadian rhythms, sleep better as a family and aid in overall healing our kiddos from within. We\u0027ve seen\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fostermoms.com/blog/how-we-got-our-3-adopted-kids-to-sleep-through-the-night11/12/2017\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eremarkable results\u003c/a\u003e and remain on that path despite its many challenges.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are fixing up our house in the next 3 weeks and putting it on the market with the hope that we can finally move to a safer neighborhood with a public school that offers top-notch, comprehensive special educational supports for all 3 of our kiddos. We were unable to make this happen last year and funneled any financial support given to us into paying for private pre-school for 2 of our kiddos who are benefitting tremendously from the individualized instruction in a healing environment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAfter 3+ months of actively searching and interviewing for a corporate job that was a good match for our lifestyle and my broad skillset, I decided to pull the plug on that and have been working overtime behind-the-scenes to get my own photography and web-based business off the ground. (I\u0027m also working part-time at a grocery store to feed my family).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eAll of this to say, we are in a fragile financial place working toward long-term stability.\u00a0Our community has shown up for us before and we are so grateful for the ways you continue to encourage us, inspire us and in the past, financially supported us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eI am looking for 50 patrons to support my work with a $10/month pledge for the next year as I get my business off the ground.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople write to us daily and express a wish to do more - say more, act more, give more time, help out financially. We are thanked for sharing our lives openly and consistently encouraged to \"Keep going.\" Well, friends, \u003cstrong\u003ethat is my goal\u003c/strong\u003e. To keep going. To keep growing. To provide our kids with the things they need. This next year is going to be a rough patch as we stretch toward something bigger and better while balancing financial insecurity. I am here, once again, asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
