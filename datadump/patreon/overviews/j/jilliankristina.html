    "summary": "Some of you may know me as Jillian Kristina, others by my Instagram handle, @root_down. Some may not know me at all, in which case, I\u0027m all about writing, tarot, nature, energy, astrology, and above all, ReWilding my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve been following me at all, you know that it\u0027s been a raw, emotional, sometimes beautiful, and always a radically, brutally, liberating and transformational process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to move my main writing platform from Instagram to Patreon for a few reasons, beginning with my word for the new year:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy word for 2018 is Commitment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe theme for 2018 is Service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the year we step into ourselves. Commit to ourselves. Commit to each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything in our lives has been leading up to this. All the awesome. All the shit. All the victory. All the breakdown. Every second of unraveling. Every ounce of becoming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all boils down to this:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s OKAY. To be ourselves. To do everything everyone told us we couldn\u0027t. Or shouldn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is our collective middle finger to every condescending eye roll. To every stagnant attitude and energy. To everything we\u0027ve absorbed that was never ours to carry. To every paradigm we never - even for a second - remotely fit into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe creation of this space is a testament to my personal Commitment to MySelf. My Life. To taking the reigns, to believing, to releasing; to smashing the energetic tethers that I\u0027ve white-knuckled for a lifetime. Here, I will Commit to writing, to sharing, and to healing - myself and anyone else who feels like they\u0027re reading between these curated lines and feeling what the fuck is actually up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere, I will Commit to my Wild. My crazy, unorthodox, primal, most raw and true and straight-to-the-throne-room-of-our-hearts ideas, messages, and practices. It\u0027s through this Commitment to myself that I hope to funnel that resurrected energy into work that fuels, flames, and evokes the Wild within us all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough this Commitment, I will provide Service. This Service will create a Win/Win scenario: Financial support for my work, my livelihood, my 200 yoga teacher training pursuit (first immersion this October!!), and new creative literary and intuition-building projects that are in the works; and perhaps most importantly, the gift of time and monetary flow it takes to grow these seeds in a sustainable, presence-fueled process, so they become the best, most un-rushed, most effective, and most liberating ReWilding tools they can possibly be...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor You. For Me. For ALL of Us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you, for being here. Thanks for continuing to put one radical foot in front of the other, despite all odds, adversaries, and challenges. And thanks for sharing in this journey with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
