I have been hosting a podcast called Beyond the Playlist with JHammondC for a while now and I have really enjoyed all of the conversations I have had with so many wonderful and talented people.\u00a0I have done more than 300 episodes of Beyond the Playlist. I also co-host Soundography with Brian Ibbott\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I love giving creative people from all walks of life the chance to gain more exposure and talk about the things that they love to do. I love working with the audience to make the show better. If you want that kind of show too please consider pitching in. If everybody in the audience gives just a $1 a month, That would be amazing! Give 25 cents a show, or $3 a month. If that could happen, the show could really grow, improve, and add more content. I would love working to live up to those kinds of expectations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many things that I want to do to help others get their work noticed and share the good work of independent artists of all kinds.\u00a0"
