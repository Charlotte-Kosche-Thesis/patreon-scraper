    "summary": "Dear fans and perhaps soon-to-be patrons,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHi! I\u0027m Jesse, and I\u0027m a composer for film and video games. I also occasionally write solo material and do some piano covers of bands like Animals As Leaders, The Bad Plus, and Tigran Hamasyan. A year ago, I discovered the creative work of Wade Dyer, and after speaking with him at length about my fascination with his work, I\u0027ve been to writing orchestral and soundtrack music to accompany his science fiction setting,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://fraggedempire.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFragged Empire\u003c/a\u003e. Whether you love his game or love orchestral soundtracks, this project is for you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo! With that in mind, \u003cstrong\u003eit\u0027s my goal to bring you guys two orchestral soundtrack pieces a month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0So far it\u0027s been limited in scope to Fragged Empire, but in 2017, it may expand to more of Wade Dyer\u0027s work in various fantasy, swashbuckling, and Lovecraftian settings that he\u0027ll be releasing! And Patreon is how I\u0027ll be able to achieve it. Instead of a giant Kickstarter project with a huge budget and a one-time $50 commitment on your part, Patreon is a way for you to support what I do \u003cstrong\u003eby throwing me a buck or two whenever I put out a video or a piece.* You can even set a monthly limit!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re interested, check out the different reward tiers for awesome stuff related to the project! However, don\u0027t feel obliged to give me money. My\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/sempreconspirito\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e will always be up and running for free. If you can spare some money to help me, and want to stamp your seal of approval on my work, it would mean the world to me. Either way, I\u0027m fortunate to have you as a fan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nJesse\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.jessewdjames.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.jessewdjames.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*For more details on how Patreon works (becoming a patron, privacy, payments, etc.) you should check out \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003ethis handy-dandy FAQ page\u003c/a\u003e."
