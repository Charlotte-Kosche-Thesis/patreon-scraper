    "summary": "Hey gamers! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the longest time I\u0026#8217;ve been creating gaming news videos and other content for \u003ca href=\"http://mmohuts.com/author/jamesbl0nde/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMMOHuts.com\u003c/a\u003e, but as you know, due to unfortunate, out-of-my-control circumstances I can no longer work for MMOHuts, only along side them with no monetary exchange. I still want to create great content for you guys. However it does mean I\u0026#8217;ve had to find new financial stability in the form of a new full time job to support my family, especially since, in a few weeks, I\u0026#8217;ll become a new father. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe new full time job is getting me by, but with my wife unable to work I have to work long hours just to stay afloat, leaving less time for content creation. I plan on working even longer hours creating weekly news videos for you guys that you know and love, and slowly add in more content, but I need all the support I can get. YouTube isn\u0026#8217;t as lucrative as it once was and this is a fresh start on a new channel so it will take time to grow large enough to generate even supplementary income, which is my goal\u0026#8230; cause feeding ones family is good!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more support I can get the more time I can put into creating content. That being said I\u0026#8217;d like to give those who support me a chance to be more involved in what I\u0026#8217;m creating. If things go well here I plan to create rewards for contributors along with new styles of content. I don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute any more to my content than simply watching my videos. I definitely appreciate that by itself. But if you feel like contributing more, it\u0027ll all go back into creating more stuff\u0026#8230; Your support would mean everything to me and my new family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
