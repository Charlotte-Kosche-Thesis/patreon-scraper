    "summary": "Ever since my first real review: \"why mom should let me rent GTA\", I have been interested in game critique. Videogames are something brand new, a completely novel medium where creative minds can tell stories and craft beautiful worlds to play in. Or just get a 3-kill-streak, nuke that world from orbit, and tea-bag its corpse. This might be why games need an ambassador.\u003cbr\u003eI have always been obsessed with explaining why I am such a rabid gamer; I want others to understand my obsession and maybe even convince them to share in it. Heck, if I have spent the equivalent price of a small fleet of micro-buses on videogames, you should too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support Mr. Black\u0027s video reviews at the JamesBlack47 Youtube channel?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUltimately it boils down to: do you like my content? \u00a0Would you like to see it more regularly? Would you like to see it improve and grow and expand? Would you like to see some stuff that not everybody gets to see? If any and all of those questions could be answered: \"yes\", then you might be in the right place my friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom a more pragmatic angle, I\u0027m told that my videos make people really think about games. I\u0027m told that they give a fair representation of their subject material (cough cough, Crimefest 2015), I\u0027m told that I bring to light some things people would never have seen or considered. Isn\u0027t that the kind of content that there should be more of on Youtube? Or, just, creative work in general? If you share my Mother\u0027s opinion of my work, then you should definitely toss some cash in the hat. If only to IMPROVE THE INTERNET AS A WHOLE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will your support help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, even though people enjoy my reviews, it is very difficult to justify taking time to do reviews when there are student loans to pay, rent due and a larder to be filled. So often, a review gets put off in lieu of working more hours, which does not fulfill me as much as what I consider my \"real\" work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me on Patreon will allow me to get more reviews out, and help me turn what has so far been an intermittent hobby into a real career. I will be able to justify the time it takes to do a proper review to myself and to my checkbook. I will continue to do reviews for free, on Youtube, but getting tips for doing it gives me a whole new level of validation and motivation. Having someone I don\u0027t even know pay me for what I do, because they think it has value, is the dream of every working artist. I hope to reach that dream, and hopefully, Patreon will be the way to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus you get t-shirts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd potentially hamburgers.\u003cbr\u003e"
