So you\u2019re holding my rookie card or you\u2019ve explained to a friend, \u201cYa, he\u2019s called JTrain. It\u2019s stupid but he\u2019s kind of funny and, for whatever reason, he gives some pretty good advice.\u201d What I\u2019m saying is, we\u2019ve probably connected in a number of different ways. And that\u2019s why we\u0027re here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019d like to do more with you guys and this platform allows me to do that. I\u2019d like to answer more of your questions. Write more rants about dating and relationships and Ford commercials. I\u2019d like to make more videos and write more coffee thoughts. Consider this site the JTrain Country Club. Come on in and take a dump while you read about a new wine called \u201cFit Vine\u201d (it\u2019s a wine that gets you in shape I guess and that bothers me). Or check out bonus episodes of the JTrain Podcast with special guests and interviews. Or send me a question that you know, for sure, WILL get answered. This is where all of that stuff is going to happen. This will be our place to talk about the luxury issues that you\u2019re afraid to bring up at brunch. Rest assured my podcast will remain free, but by supporting me monthly through one of the rewards I\u0027ll be able to do what I love and create more for you guys. Thanks in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- JTrain\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
