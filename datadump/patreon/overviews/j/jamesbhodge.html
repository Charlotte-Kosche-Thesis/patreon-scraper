    "summary": "James Hodge is a stand up comedian. He also makes viral videos and hosts podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis funny political rant videos have been viewed over ten million times on Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, as well as sites like World Star Hip Hop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe hosts two podcasts, The Big Time Pod where he talks about, well... everything. Plus, he hosts a sports podcast with retired tennis pro, Mark Zanetto, call Fundamentally UnSound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see James headlining shows all over the world and occasionally catch him opening for Dave Chappelle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy a Patreon page? Because the thing that makes James so great is he doesn\u0027t have to answer to anyone trying to influence his point of view. No TV networks or executives, sponsors, or Hollywood money backing him means you get complete and unfiltered honesty. Because he answers to no boss, James has complete control to speak truth to power. No punches are ever pulled.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron you are supporting an honest voice who refuses to remain silent. As a patron you may not always agree with James, but you know hes speaking truth as he sees it and that, especially in these strange days, is invaluable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow what is James gonna do with your money? Cover hosting and tour expenses. Buy video and editing equipment to improve the overall quality of his work. Also, he has four damn kids and they gotta eat while Dad screams about asshole presidents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love to you all. Become a patron if you can, or come see James perform live, or share his videos online, or just tell a friend about James and his many projects you enjoy, or, if you\u0027re really feeling saucy, do all those things!\u00a0 \u00a0"
