At the same time, we\u0027ll be giving you more content, and making our bond with you even stronger than it already is.\u00a0 Releasing songs roughly on a monthly basis allows us the chance to shine the spotlight on each new JOLLY song, and give you insight into its meaning, creation, and the JOLLY process.\u00a0 This is a much more intimate way to experience JOLLY\u0027s music.\u00a0 But don\u0027t worry, this does not mean the end of album releases for JOLLY.\u00a0 At the end of each cycle, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ewe will be releasing the full album in CD and possibly even vinyl formats\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (if you guys want it).\u00a0 So if you\u0027re the type that prefers listening to full albums (and you have the discipline) then resist the temptation to listen until the album is complete and you have the entire track list!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the incentives that Patreon allows, not only will we be able to provide \u003ca class=\"skimwords-link\" href=\"http://skimlinks.pgpartner.com/mrdr.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fskimlinks.pgpartner.com%2Fsearch.php%2Fform_keyword%3Dsheet%2Bmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esheet music\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca class=\"skimlinks-icon-link skimwords-link\" href=\"http://skimlinks.pgpartner.com/mrdr.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fskimlinks.pgpartner.com%2Fsearch.php%2Fform_keyword%3Dsheet%2Bmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s.skimresources.com/img/cbuddy2.png\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px -3px 2px ! important; float: none ! important; width: auto ! important; height: auto ! important;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, lyrics, and tabulature, but now we may also give you behind the scenes videos/podcasts that shed light on the content as well as alternate/acoustic versions of the songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh yeah, and this helps us make our new stupid animated series,\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e \"The JOLLYSHOW.\" (coming soon)\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal we\u0027ve set out to achieve from day one is finally here.\u00a0 All we need is your help.\u003cbr\u003eWe are here to create for you, and that\u0027s all we ever wanted to do. \u00a0We are FAMILY.\u003cbr\u003eJOLLY loves you.\u003cbr\u003e"
