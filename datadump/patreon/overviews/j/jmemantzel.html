    "summary": "I originally started documenting what I\u0027m doing to show others that it can be done. \u00a0Growing up, I heard many people tell me that chasing my dreams was stupid, too dangerous, or impossible. \u00a0...that they\u0027re called \"dreams\" for a reason, and should stay in my head.\u003cbr\u003eWell, I decided to go for it, and document it all so one day a kid just like me could get a different message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat message is... \"Don\u0027t just follow your dreams. \u00a0Run them down with everything you\u0027ve got! \u00a0As far as anyone knows we only get one chance at this life and no one is going to hand you the life you want\u00a0so go for it, and never give up!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently sold my home, packed up my little family, and moved to a part of the world where I didn\u0027t even speak the language. \u00a0I\u0027m building a new life here from scratch, and I\u0027m in way way over my head.\u003cbr\u003eI almost stopped documenting my life/projects/philosophy so I could focus completely on the task at hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was amazed at the number of people who encouraged me to keep going. \u00a0Somehow without really knowing it the original idea behind the documentation was working. \u00a0Now you guys are telling me that I don\u0027t have to do it alone. \u00a0...that all I have to do is ask for help. \u00a0Its a difficult thing for me. \u00a0...asking for help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help. \u00a0In all honesty I\u0027m already committed to the life I\u0027m creating here regardless of how difficult it gets. \u00a0I\u0027m currently paying $85 per month on fast internet on a secluded island so I can upload videos regularly, and in HD. \u00a0...which I haven\u0027t historically done. \u00a0I\u0027m on a shoestring budget working with 2 cameras sent to me by people I\u0027ve never met (Thanks so much) and using a computer that someone else sent me (thanks so much for that, too). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have no mailing address... being on a tiny island in the ocean. \u00a0I\u0027ll keep documenting things as long as I reasonably can. \u00a0If you guys can cover the internet I\u0027ll keep posting. \u00a0With a little more I can hold off longer before I have to get a job doing something less interesting. \u00a0Anything over basic survival funds will go directly into the projects I do, and I\u0027ll do my best to share that with everyone in a useful/entertaining way. \u00a0...and if someone sends like a million dollars or a pile of building materials I\u0027ll totally build a walking fortress science school. \u00a0;-) \u00a0...no, seriously. \u00a0...I might be doing it anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t pretend to have all the answers, but I do know that I have a pile of e-mails from people telling me that my videos have made a positive difference in their lives. \u00a0Help me keep going because there\u0027s some kid out there right now who just needs a little nudge from some lunatic on the internet who says crazy things like \"You can do anything!\", and \"Never give up!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for everyone\u0027s support through all my ups and downs... emotional, financial, helpful items, and most of all thanks for doing everything you can to make the world awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJaimie\u003cbr\u003e"
