While he\u2019s always looking for objective data, Jeremy has been an avid shooter since childhood and loves getting behind all types of handguns, rifles, and shotguns. His safes are full, his ammo shelves are sagging, and he\u2019s making YouTube videos while also holding down a \u201creal job.\" Jeremy lives with his wife and two little girls near Austin, TX.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u0027s the point?\u003c/h3\u003eWith rare exception, reviews of guns and gear are little more than advertisements. Most publications -- whether online, print, YouTube channels, etc -- make their revenue from the very companies whose products they\u0027re \"reviewing.\" Negative findings often get swept under the rug, and the consumer is left holding the check.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy going to Patreon, Jeremy is looking to cover the costs of thoroughly testing guns and gear without the conflict of corporate dollars. And producing videos. Honest, informative, fun videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeremy highlights the most relevant information so viewers can make informed decisions. His videos contain objective\ninfo along with subjective shooting experience so that anyone\nwho watches prior to encountering the firearm for themselves will find no surprises.\n\u201cYeah, Jeremy was right, this safety \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e\nspongy, the slide \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e cycle uniquely\nsmoothly, and the recoil impulse feels particularly sharp.\u201d\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy become a Patron?\u003c/h3\u003eInformation: Get the truth about guns and gear without the corporate influence. Your funds directly fund the channel\u0027s ability to test objectively, thoroughly, and honestly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGear: Jeremy\u0027s patrons will win gear, parts, swag, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInfluence: What do YOU want to see more of? Test more of? Do more of? Patrons have influence and Jeremy is listening. From interviews with industry types and other creators to product coverage at SHOT Show to muzzle brake testing, suppressor dB testing, ballistic testing, \"x vs. y\" comparisons and more, Patrons have a direct line to the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"
