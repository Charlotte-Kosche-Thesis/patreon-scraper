It\u2019s an easy way to be a Patron of the ARTS - the whole idea is to give us creative freelancer types some degree of stable income, which makes it a breakthrough in arts funding in the 21st century (imnsho).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePledges for my page start at $3 per month.

Long story short, a long-term legal struggle (involving relatives) that I\u0027ve been administering has ended. On one hand it\u0027s good, because removing that burden frees up my psychic and creative energy. On the other hand - I\u0027ve also lost the financial support that came about through the situation. As a result, I need to replace a big chunk of monthly income ... soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe chunk I need to replace is reflected in my goals for this project, which are built around the amount I need to make my house payments plus allowing for maintenance, taxes, other not-fun but recurrent expenses. I\u0027ve also pegged the goals to cover the small percentage that both Patreon and PayPal will take out of the earnings they deliver to me. I\u0027m not complaining - these websites don\u0027t run themselves for free - but I do need to account for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this all works out ... I\u0027ll be able to maintain my house payments, which relieves me of the fear/anxiety/burden of being homeless or looking \u0026amp; moving and all of that. Moving would mean downsizing which means giving up the studio and creative workspace I\u0027ve established. But staying in place, with the payments covered, will free me to do what I\u0027m here to do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do in return for your patronage?\u003c/strong\u003e The Patreon model is based on exchange: in return for support from Patrons like you, Creators like me are expected to give back to the world (and hopefully make it a better place) through our art. I love this! It fits perfectly with my vision of being able to create art and craft products that spread a little bit of love, compassion, and healing into a world that badly needs it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically, for this project I plan to create art and craft items that express a healing theme, such as Love \u0026amp; Compassion (the first of the series), Protection \u0026amp; Wisdom, Growth \u0026amp; Vitality, and so on. I will offer these items - shawls, jewelry, and fine art pieces - for sale at my online shop,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.zibbet.com/jan4insight\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJan4insight Handmade Gallery\u003c/a\u003e on Zibbet. As part of your patronage rewards, when the items are completed \u0026amp; available to purchase, I\u0027ll announce them here in my Patrons-only posts at least 1 day before I share them to the public (that\u0027s what I mean about \"first dibs\" in the Rewards column!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, about that Color Healing - yes, it\u0027s a real thing! Whole books have been written on the topic, and I\u0027ll share my thoughts in posts such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/12486004\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e - along with sneak-peeks and previews of the items I\u0027m creating under this project :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore about the Rewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I think of the Rewards gifts as a \"thank you\" for your patronage - a way to make my gratitude a little more tangible than just words on a screen (and those words, of course, are heartfelt!).\u00a0Rewards are an integral part of the Patreon model, and are pegged to levels or tiers of patronage support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can select any dollar amount for your monthly pledge; you don\u0027t have to be limited by the stated levels. If you choose an amount between tiers, you\u0027ll get the reward below your amount. For example, if you pledge $35/month you\u0027ll get the reward for the $25 tier.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLevels that offer tangible rewards (cards, prints, canvases) will ask for your shipping address when you sign up. That\u0027s because I have to physically mail the reward to you, and I need to know where to send it!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSending the rewards takes some time on my part, so please be patient. I estimate most rewards will be sent within 30 days after your first pledge is paid, which is the 1st of the month following your signup. The art canvases offered with the Level 5 reward tier may take a little longer.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast Word: as always, that belongs to LuvLee the Cat!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/53149458@N08/7007473206/in/album-72157629464283623/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"265\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7251/7007473206_12d730fb1b.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeer Patrons of Meowmy \u0026amp; me, Fank Yoo bery much (times elebenty hunderd) from da bottoms of our heart! \u00a0\u2665 \u2665\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
