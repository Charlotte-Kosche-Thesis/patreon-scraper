I want to bring that world to you far more often that I have in the last few years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could use your help. I\u2019m launching this patreon to help cover the socks, pantyhose, paint, googly eyes, clay, material, glue sticks, hair, and other tools and supplies I need to make the funny come to life for you.\u003cbr\u003eYou might be familiar with some of my videos (feel free to check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/JackieHern\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e!) Usually, I make my videos to help promote the comedy adventures of my friends but I\u2019d also like to start making my own stories and that will take a bit more time and resources. If you read over my goals, you will see that I don\u2019t intend for patreon to become a permanent basis for supporting the financial end of my puppet/claymation dreams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I reach my final patreon goal level, I\u0027ll be in a place to reach out to others with mad comedy writing, visual effects, videography, art and design skills to start collaborating on some short films.  You will have supported that project\u2019s foundation. Please consider dropping a few bucks my way each month for a while, and I will do my best to come up with some creative rewards for you."

     "description": "I\u2019ll be able to purchase the stop animation software I need and start focusing more on the clay animation work that will make America happy again.  It will also cover the extra supplies and tools I\u2019ll need and I\u2019ll be able to bring in someone to help with the project. I\u2019ll purchase a decent camera, tripod (I won\u2019t rely on old microphone stands and duct tape to keep the camera in place). I\u2019ll finally be able to get decent light set up and will produce green screen sock and clay work to collaborate with other artists.  At this level, I will be reaching out to comedians, videographers, visual effects artists, and graphic design artists to collaborate on a some short animation films using a wide range of animation mediums.  At this point, I think it will be time for a kickstarter, for us all",
