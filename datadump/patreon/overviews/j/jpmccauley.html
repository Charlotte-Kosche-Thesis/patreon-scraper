    "summary": "Hi everyone, I\u0027m J. P. McCauley and I\u0027ve created a comic book called Ether Tribes.\u00a0 Ether Tribes is it\u0027s own universe, like Star Wars or Middle Earth. It begins with a kingdom of people that live in giant trees and bind themselves to elemental spirits for survival. The spirits grant wondrous powers but demand a price not measured in coins. If you like monsters, high flying action and moody protagonists then you\u0027ve come to the right place. If you like transhumanist fiction then stick around for the long haul as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt can be a complicated thing to design a universe and there\u0027s a lot to consider. Fear not, we\u0027re gonna peel this sucker like an onion, a little bit at a time. Enter Mathias, a troubled and violent boy who will mature into a true shaker of events. As he grows, his world will get more complex and his problems more intense. My goal is to finish his origins in around ten issues and then introduce three major characters with their own origin stories (with about ten issues dealing with all three). We\u0027ll then bring them all together for an epic quest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe video I\u0027ve posted is the first issue of the comic, cut and spliced into a still frame animation, so you can get a feel for what the comic is like. Every update I will post ten new pages of the comic. I would like to do two updates a month but that requires full time dedication. Your support will allow me to reach this goal. If you love comic books and want to be a part of building a new universe then join me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see more artwork from me then check out my website \u003ca href=\"http://jpmccauley.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://jpmccauley.com/\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eI work with Ryan Robbins on the videos. He does the music and editing. We plan on doing more so check out the youtube page \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHYRL7-NaTVlB5pvtivj6tA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e for future updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS- remember, if you sign up you get access to all my previous posts. That\u0027s two comics so far. For 3 bucks you\u0027ll get the pdf\u0027s, epubs, and the score from the video as well. Look in the Activity section to find them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePSS- I\u0027m planning for the future now. I\u0027ve already written the screenplay (155 pages) and have the stories lined out for two sequels. My end goal is to see this fantastic \nmadness on the big screen. I welcome you to be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
