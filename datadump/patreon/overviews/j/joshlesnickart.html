It helped get a lot of cool careers started, no big deal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I did a few chapters of a new webcomic called \u003cstrong\u003eYou Suck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://everybodysuperhappy.com/patreon/ys-circle.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt was much better than my other comics... but alas not as known, as getting people to learn about new webcomics isn\u0027t as easy as it used to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, while not focused on a single project in particular, I\u0027m as active as I can be, doing a lot of things with the help of other artists these days, slowly learning the process of game creation, applying for animation job after job after job, but mostly just sticking with lewd and cutesy comics and pinups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://everybodysuperhappy.com/patreon/pet%20elf%20cover.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://everybodysuperhappy.com/patreon/photoshoot%20first%20photo.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://everybodysuperhappy.com/patreon/polly/polly%20the%20demon%20hunter%204.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still got more things in my head to create, and to do so, I\u0027m gonna need everyone\u0027s help.
