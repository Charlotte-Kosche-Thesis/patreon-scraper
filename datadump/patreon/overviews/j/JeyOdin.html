My co-worker wanted to become a supervisor, and that was the advice she got. However, I took it to mean something else entirely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryday I would wake up, go to work, come home, and then draw until I feel asleep. I realized that if I really wanted to make comics my career, I was going to have to work non-stop.\u00a0Drawing is fun so it\u0027s not a burden, but making ends meat sometimes can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon so that I could reach out to my supporters and ask for more support.\u003cbr\u003eEverybody who\u0027s been with me this entire journey knows I won\u0027t ever give up on this dream, so please become a patron of mine and help me do the job I want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
