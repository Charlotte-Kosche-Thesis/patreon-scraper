    "summary": "When I fell in love with Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) in the year 2000, even with my academic background, I never thought it would be possible to create a scientific version of NLP. Yet, today creating a scientific version of NLP is very much possible. In fact, I am already working on it in my collaboration with the Aubrey Daniels Research Institute for Behavior Analysis (ADRIBA) of the VU-university of Amsterdam, ranked #73 in The Times international university ranking. You can read all about it here: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://abcnlp.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eABC-NLP\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNevertheless, in my opinion, the work is not going fast enough. The reason is that my regular NLP training work as a Licensed NLP Master Trainer eats up a lot of my time. For that reason, I came up with the idea of taking one year to train less and focus more on developing the scientific version of NLP. And I am asking you to help me with it. When you become my patron, at whatever level, you make it possible for me to drastically reduce the number of training programs I do in 2018 and 2019 and instead develop scientific NLP, do the necessary research and write the scientific NLP books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be four books. The first will be about the brain, the Neuro part of NLP. The second will be about language, the Linguistic part of NLP. The third one will be about learning, the Programming part of NLP. The fourth one will be about Personality Neuroscience, an important, but overlooked aspect of mankind which details more about the hardware of the brain. These books will be written anyway, but it might take up to a decade unless we find a way to speed things up. Becoming a patron here today speeds things up considerably!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I want you to get at least as much out of this as I do. For that reason, there are great rewards for all levels of patronage. Just, check out the possibilities in the right sidebar. And if you have any questions, please let me know. I love getting deeply involved in things and I am looking forward to your contributions."

     "about": "Joost Gerard van der Leij (Hilversum, March 29, 1971) is a Dutch philosopher and author in the field of Ennegream and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). He is best known for the links he established between the Enneagram on the one hand and the personality disorders of the World Health Organization (WHO) ICD-10 classication and the theory of psychological personality the Big Five on the other. Joost van der Leij is the grandson of the famous Dutch cartoonist Pieter Kuhn, creator of the Captain Rob series.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBiography\n\u003cbr\u003eJoost van der Leij discovered during his philosophy studies at Utrecht University that he preferred work above study. After a three years period of study he was offered the opportunity to work for Professor Jan Bransen of the Department of Philosophy teaching first year students. After his studies Joost van der Leij made a transfer to Pink Roccade starting out as an IT programmer but promoted within one year to manager with his own department. During the Prince 2 Project Management Expert course offered by Pink Roccade Joost van der Leij came upon the concept of the Enneagram as part of the people management section.\n\nIn 1997 he started his own IT business. In 2000 he was given the assignment by the Stichting Maatschappij \u0026amp; Onderneming (SMO) \u2013 The Society and Enterprise Foundation \u2013 to create an online game for 12 to 14 year old kids to virtually experiment with harddrugs, softdrugs, alcohol, smoking and gambling. The idea behind this game was that if young people would have satisfied their curiosity in a virtual way, they would be less inclined to abuse of stimulants in real life. Professor Rijsman of Brabant Catholic University has done research on the results of this project. By playing the online game youngsters proved to have a better insight into the dangers of smoking and drinking. In the case of harddrugs, softdrugs and gambling no significant improvement was found. This project was publicized in the book \u201cVirtueel genieten \u2013 Communiceren met jongeren over genotmiddelen\u2019 (Virtual enjoyment \u2013 communicating with young people about stimulants) of which Joost van der Leij is co-author.\n\nThe well-known psychologist Ren\u00e9 Diekstra had indicated during the project that it was of great importance to take the personality disorders of the participants into account because this would be a major influence on their addiction problems. Ren\u00e9 Diekstra advised to include the WHO\u2019s D-10 classification of personality disorders in the game. Study of this classification made Joost van der Leij realize that it consisted of exactly nine personality disorders and that it would be possible to link these with the nine personality types of the Enneagram.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt that same time Joost van der Leij took a course in sales training in the U.S.A. with Dr. Richard Bandler, co-founder of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). This training was such an inspiration that he decided that very moment to stop working in IT, to switch to giving trainings himself. After having been trained by Dr. Richard Bandler for a number of years in NLP Joost van der Leij is now a certified NLP Master Practioner and NLP trainer as well as Neuro-Hypnotic Repatterning (NHR) and Design Human Engineering(DHE). In 2004 he in fact ended his IT business and founded The Institute of Unconventional Wisdom in order to concentrate on finding and integrating unconvential wisdom and to consequently pass this on to others.\n\nWork\nJoost van der Leij developed two methods. The Neurogram\u00ae is his personality teaching based on the Enneagram, the Big Five, the WHO\u2019s ICD-10 personality disorders and neuroscientific research into the influence on personality of neurotransmitters and brainstructure. Neurosophy\u00ae is his philosophic program making an amalgam of modern philosophy and the latest insights of neuroscience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBibliography\n\u003cbr\u003e2001: Virtueel genieten \u2013 Communiceren met jongeren over genotmiddelen, uitgeverij SMO ISBN 9069621835\n2007: Onbeperkt Jezelf: gelukkig worden met NLP en het Enneagram, uitgeverij Andromeda, ISBN 9789055992140\n\u003cbr\u003e2007: Klein Boekje Hoop: met welke wonderen mag je rekening houden, uitgeverij Andromeda, ISBN 9789055992287\n2008: You, Unlimited: mind reading the masses with NLP, Morgan James Publishing, ISBN 9781699373572\n\u003cbr\u003e2009: Brein Training: NLP op z\u2019n best, uitgeverij Andromeda, ISBN 978905599553\n2009: Onbeperkt aan de slag: excellent ondernemen met NLP en het Enneagram, uitgeverij Attrakt, ISBN 9789460510083\n\u003cbr\u003e2009: De Tao van Joost: bereik alles zonder iets te doen, uitgeverij Attrakt, ISBN 9789460510205\n2009: Het Neurogram\u00ae: je persoonlijkheid neurologisch verklaard met het Enneagram, uitgeverij Attrakt, ISBN 9789460510298\n\u003cbr\u003e2010: Word wie je bent: zelfontwikkeling met Neurosofie\u00ae, uitgeverij Attrakt, ISBN 9789460510489\n2011: Memento Mori: overleef de dood, uitgeverij Attrakt, ISBN 9789460510564\n2011: Neurosofie\u00ae: het filosofisch fundament voor persoonlijke groei, uitgeverij Attrakt, ISBN 9789460510618\n2012: De Logica van Onzekerheid: de subjectieve Bayesiaanse filosofie van Bruno de Finetti, Philosophicon, ISBN 9789460510670",
