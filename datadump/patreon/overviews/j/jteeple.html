    "summary": "My name is \u003cstrong\u003eJessica Teeple\u003c/strong\u003e. I am the owner and primary creator of \u003cstrong\u003eBlack Hat Comics and Novels\u003c/strong\u003e, a group intended to make it easy for fiction creators to publish their fiction in a way that is \u003cstrong\u003eaccessible\u003c/strong\u003e to any member of the public and as \u003cstrong\u003erelatable\u003c/strong\u003e as possible. That is to say, we publish fiction on a \u003cstrong\u003eminimally and flexibly formatted\u003c/strong\u003e website and the price is up to the reader -- including paying nothing at all. We also have a policy of change;\u00a0creating \u003cstrong\u003emultiple editions\u003c/strong\u003e of work as we learn and grow. That is to say that a book you write now would not have been written the same way ten years ago, nor would you write it the same way ten years from now. There was a time when this sort of change was common, and we believe that embracing it can only help guarantee\u003cstrong\u003e the most enjoyable works for our readers\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorks are offered for \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e to increase \u003cstrong\u003eaccessibility\u003c/strong\u003e. However, of course, \u003cstrong\u003ecreators work hard\u003c/strong\u003e and want to get \u003cstrong\u003epaid\u003c/strong\u003e. Our current system is a \u003cstrong\u003ePayPal\u003c/strong\u003e button on every page which will pay the creator of that page\u0027s content. (Currently, I am the only creator in the group, but we are open!) My girlfriend made me aware of \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, so we will soon be adding this as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is it important to pay for content if you can?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, foremost, people like to be paid for their work. Personally, however, I can tell you that I\u0027m currently an unemployed farmer; all money that comes my way is likely to go into my farm or my education. Sometimes even just the money I spend on my url ($27 a year) seems like a lot. I don\u0027t always have the budget to sacrifice toward adding more content to the site.\u00a0With your money, I can guarantee you that \u003cstrong\u003ethe first thing I would do is turn around and pay artists to add visual content\u003c/strong\u003e. As much as I want to be paid for my work, I want even more to make my work as enjoyable as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange, you can expect bonuses like exclusive content, peeks at my research, Q\u0026amp;A sessions, and more. I want to work as closely with my readership as possible, and Patreon is one way to do that!\u003cbr\u003e"
