    "summary": "Greetings Jordan Page fans!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon site. \u00a0If you clicked on this site you are considering becoming a patron of my art and activism, and for that alone I am grateful. \u00a0My life for the last 10 years has been possible because of grassroots support, so this seemed like a logical next step for me. \u00a0Everything I have done has been fan-supported. I am lucky enough to have been counted among what many call the Liberty Movement in America, which is really just an amazing group of people who are awake to what is really going on in the world. I was very fortunate to have been invited to perform at many historic events with Congressman Ron Paul and through my many travels have developed a vast network of inspiring people who have connected with the spirit of my songs. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bitxwy6okn4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI consider myself a passionate activist, and have dedicated my time, efforts, and talents to educating people on the truth about government, natural law, gun rights, immoral wars, the false left/right political paradigm, the war on terror, cannabis freedom, libertarianism, jury nullification, bitcoin, the war on drugs, vaccines, the federalization of police, the pharmaceutical and prison industrial complexes, the poisoning for profit of our air, land, and water, and the psychopathic establishment that is robbing us blind while manipulating our reality until we cannot see our own chains. \u00a0I have found that in the battle against these forces, music is a powerful weapon and an agent of transformation. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt is not easy making a living playing music no matter who you are, but it can be really tough for independent musicians, especially ones who take on the heavy subjects like I do. Somehow I\u0027ve made it work over the years, with incredible support from God, my wife, kids, family, friends and especially my fans who consistently show the love. \u00a0I\u0027m at a place now where I\u0027d like to finance some new music projects and am in need of some tour support to continue spreading the ideals of peace and freedom through song. \u00a0Being a husband and father of six beautiful children is the greatest joy of my life, but it ain\u0027t easy and it ain\u0027t cheap! Touring is getting harder and more expensive to do, and this election cycle has been like the twilight zone!\u00a0\u00a0I\u0027ve been wanting to get a new album made for several years but have just not had the financial resources to do it, but everything happens for a reason. \u00a0I have 3 albums planned already and just need help getting it done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_M_IO25xHg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always had a devoted following and I am ready to take our relationship to the next level. What I\u0027m proposing is a monthly donation to help keep the lights on and to accrue enough resources for my next recording projects. \u00a0In return, I will be able to produce more awesome music for you, to plan more concerts all over America, to produce new music videos, and through this patreon platform will be able to offer you exclusive and personal content, as well as communication from me directly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot every artist\u0027s music is attached to an ideology and a culture of common belief in a cause. Most bands today are making music for music\u0027s sake and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that, at all! \u00a0But if you are looking for something more; if you\u0027re looking to be part of something, if you\u0027ve been following my music for years and want to help me continue to open people\u0027s minds to liberty, and if you just identify with what I\u0027m saying in my music, then I would be humbled to have your patronage. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not talking about huge numbers here, unless of course you\u0027re loaded and want to shower me with gifts! ;-) For most folks I\u0027m talking about small regular monthly donations, at whatever level you are comfortable. \u00a0There are a list of rewards to the right that correspond to different levels of patronage. \u00a0This is a new experience for me, and will allow me to more directly connect with the people who believe in what I\u0027m doing and are inspired by the music. \u00a0That\u0027s what its all about anyway!! \u00a0I too, want to be inspired, and I have so much music to share. \u00a0I appreciate your love and support that have brought me this far and look forward to what\u0027s next!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ryedesign.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/jordan-page-610x405.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMake sure to visit my \u003ca href=\"http://www.jordanpagemusic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWEBSITE\u003c/a\u003e"
