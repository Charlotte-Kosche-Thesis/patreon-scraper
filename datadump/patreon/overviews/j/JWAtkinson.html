    "summary": "My name is J.W. Atkinson, and I am looking for help creating high quality genre fiction. Signing up here gives you access to my monthly short stories, as well as my backlist (at no extra charge).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am an author of science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy.  In 2005 I won the York University President\u2019s Choice Award for a short screenplay, and I wasn\u2019t even in the creative writing program.  I am currently working on editing my first urban fantasy novel.  It is the start of a series, planned to be published along with the following two novels in the first quarter of 2018. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/dhX9Hf \"\u003eStay up to date with what is going on here.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy wife and I welcomed the final member of our family of six into the world in September.  With my wife on maternity leave and the budget set to the penny it leaves me with not enough money to set aside to hire editors, cover artists, etc..  When my 3 other daughters were born, this was usually the time when I would pick up a second job or work some construction jobs to help make some extra money.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would much rather spend that time writing, which is where your support comes in.  With it, I will be able to focus my attention on writing and fulfilling a lifelong dream.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy stories are about people with real problems.  And they just so happen to be in really awesome settings with spectacular things happening to them.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Do I Want?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like you to invest in my writing business so that I can be more productive and publish the best possible product.  Self-publishing has so many different avenues and I could write and release my stories on a shoe-string budget, with no editor and stock art covers but this seems like bad business.  Why would I publish a book with the cheapest editor I could find (or my mother) or just using online editing tools?  I personally wouldn\u2019t want to purchase that story, so why should I expect others to.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to be held accountable for my writing, so I am not asking for money per month,  rather I would like to offer you something in return; at least one short story per month (if I write more you will not be asked for more money).  This is on top of the work I am doing for my novel series.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow Will Your Patronage Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLike I said before, this is a lifelong dream that I am working towards hiring professional editors and cover artists for my short fiction, allowing me to produce high-quality stories for you.\u003cbr\u003eAs you can\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaybe you are not in a position to support me financially.\u00a0 You can still help by sharing my patreon campaign on your social media accounts.\u00a0 The more people coming to my site the greater the chances of finding the support I need.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll patrons from the $1/short story will receive a monthly calendar outlining my writing schedule as well as that month\u0027s short story.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThinking of contributing more than $1, you\u2019re awesome.  I have some great rewards with a lot of value for whatever works for you (such as time on Google Hangout, ebooks, a yearly anthology of all the short stories, signed copies of books, and I can even bring your idea for a story to life).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the more I make, the more you get (even for $1 pledges).\u00a0 So share this with everyone your mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, best friend, frenemy from high school who you check out on Facebook from time to time.\u00a0 Who knows they might love my work too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
