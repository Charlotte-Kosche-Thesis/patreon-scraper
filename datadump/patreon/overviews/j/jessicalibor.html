So my goal is to have enough funding so that I have the time to create without limits.\u00a0 I want to see what I am capable of!\u00a0 And I want you to see, too!\u00a0 Your money will go towards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Painting supplies like brushes, paint, canvases, and gold leaf\u003cbr\u003e2. Costs of hiring a model to paint\u003cbr\u003e3. Framing costs\u003cbr\u003e4.
