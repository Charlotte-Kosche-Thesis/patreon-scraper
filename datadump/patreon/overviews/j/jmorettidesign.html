You see, I\u0027d always loved to draw, and suddenly I\u0027d found something that was a lot easier to do (and more enjoyable, at least to me) than acting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8e396f_5abdcb1ec2354e3ba10db3f8cac08416~mv2_d_2550_3300_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_342,h_442,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/8e396f_5abdcb1ec2354e3ba10db3f8cac08416~mv2_d_2550_3300_s_4_2.webp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Photo of the type of Illustration work I do- an elephant-themed commission).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt gave me a sort of high to be a \u003cstrong\u003epart of the collaborative creation of a story from a visual standpoint\u003c/strong\u003e, where I didn\u0027t have to direct a show by telling actors what to do, as much as \u003cstrong\u003eshape the picture of the story with color and space\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5526c715e4b0bb57d90452d0/55d66d3ee4b0d6e151369506/55db6699e4b009ac6e41716f/1440473544105/S6_9.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(A photo from my design of \u003cem\u003eSaint Joan\u003c/em\u003e at UNCSA).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ended up getting my M.F.A. in Set Design from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem North Carolina. There\u0027s a part of me that wouldn\u0027t trade that education for anything in the world, but it is not easy to make a living as a visual artist in such a niche trade. UNCSA was an amazing institution; faculty are top-of-the-line professionals, and their courses teach skills that are directly useful to anyone pursuing a career in theatre arts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5526c715e4b0bb57d90452d0/55d66d88e4b05d580d9c8a7b/55dbbf10e4b0f52d9d436489/1440464662878/elixir+524.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(A photo of the opera I designed at UNCSA, \u003cem\u003eThe Elixir of Love\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I\u0027m an extremely hard worker, any of the faculty who had me at the time can tell you that I probably succeeded at school due more to pure determination than raw talent. My tradition of working hard and with determination has continued to this day, eight years after I graduated. I\u0027ve been fortunate to work at such places as the \u003cstrong\u003eKennedy Center in D.C., Two River Theatre Company in N.J., The Macy\u0027s Parade Studio \u003c/strong\u003ein the greater N.Y. area (where I designed the Thanksgiving Day Parade floats and balloons), and most recently at\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eLaika Animation Studio\u003c/strong\u003e in Oregon. After spending three and a half years in NYC working my fanny off as both a commercial designer (for Macy\u0027s) and a freelance artist, I moved to Portland, Oregon for a dream job as a set designer at Laika Animation Studio. Due to an unexpected gap in film production, less than a year later, I was unexpectedly unemployed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5526c715e4b0bb57d90452d0/55d6250de4b0f5f10add408c/55d62629e4b0f7482bcc2b64/1440097833666/piratebooty_color_upload.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 637px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Photo of a float concept I designed for the 2014 Macy\u0027s Thanksgiving Day Parade).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJumping back into a freelance theatre career outside of New York has been... challenging. However, I\u0027ve been very busy since being laid off and soon began painting scenery and designing in the Portland theatre scene. I\u0027ve even given it a big shot to try to break into the high-paying world of commercial design in both New York and in Portland. \u003cstrong\u003eBut what I\u0027ve realized is that my true talents and my passion are with theatre arts and visual storytelling.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0And bringing the art of visual storytelling to the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5526c715e4b0bb57d90452d0/55d51d6be4b0e0ffdf4d2769/55d6135ce4b0af8587fa9c67/1440521952433/182759_562183987408_1019896359_n.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 648px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Photo of scenic art I painted for a production of \u003cem\u003eGuys and Dolls\u003c/em\u003e at Ohio Light Opera).\u003cbr\u003eSince my lay-off, I\u0027ve plunged head-first into theatre design jobs, theatre design assistant jobs (remotely, and through my previous connections to otherdesigners), painting scenery for local theatres, and taking illustration commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8e396f_886c623390ec4cd2a8aa1660cda0f4c8~mv2_d_2519_3142_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_354,h_442,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/8e396f_886c623390ec4cd2a8aa1660cda0f4c8~mv2_d_2519_3142_s_4_2.webp\" style=\"width: 320px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Photo of an illustration commission).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e At any given time, I have between three and five different employers. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd I love my work.\u003c/strong\u003e But still, while I\u0027m able to make rent and eat and pay my bills on time, I\u0027m unable to really save money to afford things like\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003ePaying off my student loan debt\u003c/strong\u003e, for which I\u0027d need an extra $1000 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cstrong\u003eSave up for a car.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m very limited in Portland as far as the jobs I\u0027m able to take because I do not have a car. I did not need a car in NYC, but Portland does not have quite the same kind of infrastructure for public transit. Also, many local jobs are an hour or so away by car, and I would love to be able to expand my connections to the art scenes here (such as Oregon Shakespeare Theatre in Ashland, for which I could possibly do painting work for).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003cstrong\u003eSave up to get a new Macbook Pro.\u003c/strong\u003e I don\u0027t need tell you- Macbooks are expensive. But I do need one to do my job, which often has me running programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, Vectorworks and Sketchup all at the same time. My current computer is from 2010. You heard that right. I\u0027ve kept her really clean and taken great care of her, but she can\u0027t keep going forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see the issue. My partner and I met at Laika and are extremely hard-working individuals, but there\u0027s a part of us that believes that we will never be able to afford a house. My logic has always been that if I work hard enough, that it will pay off. And I continue to work hard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you end up supporting me, know that you\u0027re supporting more than the immediate material results of the work I undertake, but also t\u003cstrong\u003ehe dreams and goals I\u0027d like to expound upon to contribute to the greater arts community\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, I had the experience of teaching children at Two River Theater Company\u0027s summer theatre program in 2016 and realized that I LOVE teaching. I mean, these were middle school boys and girls and I had them designing scenery and creating their own concepts and shows. I want to be able to bring the knowledge I\u0027ve gathered through my education and experience over the last eight years to the Oregon arts community. Whether this is through teaching the exact skills I\u0027ve learned, or in supporting new works through design, I feel that I have a lot to offer with a little support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8e396f_76ede7986e524f36a1c2684d511c0b8a~mv2_d_2400_1500_s_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_707,h_442,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/8e396f_76ede7986e524f36a1c2684d511c0b8a~mv2_d_2400_1500_s_2.webp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Photo of a children\u0027s book illustration I created for \u003cem\u003eThe Curious Little Fox\u003c/em\u003e, a project at SVA).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo thank you for learning a little about me, and thanks in advance for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
