It means a lot to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years, I have been covering rallies, marches and other events about \nmarriage equality, \u201cStop and Frisk\u201d, Immigration, Occupy Wall Street, \nMexican/Latino community, Black community, Muslim community, Asian \ncommunity, LGBTQ community, HIV/AIDS events, YoSoy132, International \nWorkers Day/May Day, Indigenous community, Palestine, animal rights, \nCaribbean community, Ayotzinapa, Black Lives Matter,\u00a0Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera, etc. I have \nthousands of pictures in my site:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.javiersoriano.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.javiersoriano.com/\u003c/a\u003e and more than 280 videos on my Youtube channel: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JavierSoriano1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/JavierSoriano1\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cover events that usually the mainstream media doesn\u0027t cover.

If you are just showing up here for the first time....Something about Patreon: You donate $1, $3, $5 or more dollars monthly. You get rewards. Your money helps me to cover different rallies, marches and other events. My videos on Yourtube are ads free. No commercials. Together we inform our fellow citizens about things that are important for us. Sites like kickstarter is a one-time deal, Patreon is more of an ongoing commitment (you can pull out at any time, so it\u0027s risk-free).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can $1, $3, or $5 dollars do? Maybe $1 dollar can not do\n much, but if 3 THOUSAND people DONATE $1.00 dollar, then it\u2019s not $1 \ndollar, they are $3,000.00 dollars.
