    "summary": "I got involved in creating these portraits due to do the early death of my beloved friend, Buster. \u00a0He was a beautiful german shorthair that I kept for my son and he grew into quite a character. \u00a0I\u0027ve never known a dog to have such a personality. \u00a0When he died of cancer I was devastated. \u00a0My husband suggested that I draw a picture of him and so it started. \u00a0Although my specialty medium was in graphite I thought I\u0027d tackle another medium and chose pastels, something I\u0027ve never been able to master. \u00a0When I finished I was in shock. \u00a0I showed my husband, A very educated and talented artist himself. He claimed I had missed my calling. (for years I had been making a living at performing and teaching music.). I fell in love with pastels and fell in love with dog portraits. \u00a0My years of teaching music now added teaching art and has grown from there. \u00a0But my biggest goal as I head toward retirement is to create a livable income through my paintings."
