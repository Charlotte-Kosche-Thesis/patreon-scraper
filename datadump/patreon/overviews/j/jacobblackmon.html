Some may know me as \"Prodigyduck.\" I am a prolific illustrator who delights in bringing to life my imagination through role-playing games and art. Whether it\u0027s sci-fi and fantasy monsters, heroes, or even a mundane aardvark, I love to draw it. I intend to keep illustrating for years to come.\u003cbr\u003eEven if I am unsupported, I will continue to provide art and display it onto my deviantArt page, Facebook, and Tumblr. However, with the support of my fans (like YOU!), I can do so with less stress to my finances. Additionally, I will be able to create more content that is my own, rather than only drawing commissions from game companies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
