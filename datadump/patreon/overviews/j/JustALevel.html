Everyday I am working on wands, sculptures, drawings, and writing that I would like to share with you all. My artwork is very heavily influenced by fantasy, literature, pop culture and film.

Your pledges will go to materials I couldn\u0027t get with just my shops income and open a variety of options for new pieces.\u00a0Each month I will have a theme I am working around in my projects. All of you at any tier can suggest the theme and I will pull from that pool of ideas. When the theme is picked I will put together some pieces and send them out to those in the $30 Tier (Shipping is included in this, open to International patrons!).\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NOPJrCY.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to give back to budding new artists and give very real advice to your creative journey (That would include things like: \"Is fan art acceptable to sell\", \"How much money do I need to get started\", \"How effectively could I use my art degree\", \"How do I become a full time artist\", etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JYazgBj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIf you become my patron, a HUGE thank you from the bottom of my heart.
