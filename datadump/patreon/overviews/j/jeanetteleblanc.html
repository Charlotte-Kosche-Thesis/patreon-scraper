    "summary": "Words. Witchery. Whiskey. Wolf. Wild. Claiming my howl, shaking the paradigm, seducing the muse. Raised by the ocean and forged in the fire of the desert. Single mama. Queer femme. Writing the world on fire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth: Starting this page was hard for me. Incredibly hard. You see, I\u0027ve somehow bought into this model of starving artist where my committment to my work must also mean financial struggle. Asking and receiving? Not easy for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWords are like breath for me. They fuel and feed me. They are the water and the wine and the earth beneath my feet. They are the sun and the moon and the stars above. The whiskey and the heat and the grief and the all and the everything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo absorb and to create. This is my contract with the universe. This is what I live for. Taking in the wild and raw beauty of this world and letting it spin and swirl and alchemize until it is ready to be born into something new and ancient and eternal and impermanent - all at once. The words come and they are released and they take on a life of their own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur stories are important, life-saving, revolutionary.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am here to write. And I am here to help you tell your stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is the way and the truth and the only thing I know for sure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother truth: I haven\u0027t been writing near enough. As a working artist struggling to make peace with the reality of this intersection of art and commerce I must inhabit - as writer continually dancing in the liminal space between inspiration and reality, as a woman finding my place in a world turned upside down. I\u0027ve not been upholding my end of my contract with the muse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis changes now and here. Because this space is where I extend my contract with universe and muse and create a new one with you. \u00a0One where I step into my own uncomfortable relationship with asking AND receiving. One in which I promise to face the doubts and demons and blocks that keep my fingers from clicking these keys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA contract in which I promise to show up and write. To share all the pieces that have not found a place of belonging. To share my journey in transforming my beloved Wild Heart Writing Workshops into beautifully printed books that you can see and touch and hold in your hand. To share, for the first time, the fictional characters that have been calling to me for the past few years, creating living scenes in my head that are written fully formed and alive - despite my instance that I don\u0027t write fiction. To dive deeper into my role as teacher and facilitator of story - ordinary, extraordinary story. YOUR story and my story and their story and our story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know exactly how this looks quiet yet. But I know it feels important. And I can\u0027t wait to step into this space, with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exo.\u003cbr\u003eJ.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
