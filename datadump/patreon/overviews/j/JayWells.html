    "summary": "I have been through many incarnations as an artist, and at one time or another, I\u0027ve fallen in love with every facet of art: from comics and illustration to mechanical drafting to graffiti and street art. I am mostly known for my vibrant, weird, quirky, sci-fi infused collision of pop art and graffiti, but expect the unexpected when it comes to my work. I have not been allowed to pursue art through traditional avenues such as art school, so I am largely self-taught. For me, art is less of a lifestyle, and more of a personality trait.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I have enjoyed the support of many wonderful clients, customers, fans, and patrons, and it would be impossible for me to have gotten by without them. When the world fails me, art is often the thing that saves me, so everyone who has supported me as an artist has been extremely important, and I never forget their kindness. Because of this I feel like my art has evolved from a one-way communication into a dialogue with my audience, and I very much enjoy breaking down the traditional barriers which keep the audience separate from art. I also enjoy bringing a bit of weird color to an otherwise dull world! \u003cbr\u003e"
