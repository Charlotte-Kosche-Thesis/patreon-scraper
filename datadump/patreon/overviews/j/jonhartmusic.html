A lively percussive performance, combining a mixture of catchy and emotive songs always leaves audiences wanting more. Performing original material is central to Jon\u2019s philosophy as an artist, however he has been known to throw in the occasional Pink Floyd cover. Jon\u2019s style falls between Newton Faulkner, Jon Gomm and Sting.",

This has actually proven to be harder to write than I thought - as all second albums are apparently.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://jonhartmusic.com/album/87869/reborn\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Reborn\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0was all about a new musical direction in restarting my music career. And\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jonhartmusic.com/album/486398/set-adrift\"\u003e Set Adrift\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0was a fun boat adventure with the awesome Daryl Kellie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this album is all about my current state of mind and digging down deep into why the I\u0027m the way I am ..... whoa, that\u0027s deep Jon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYup, as songwriters and creatives some of us tend to come from a dark place, but why is this? This is the reason why it\u0027s taking me so long to write because digging deep can reveal things or bring things to the surface I buried a long time ago. I\u0027ve been reading a lot about mindfulness\u00a0this past year and writing this album has become some sort of therapy - making me understand who I am, where I\u0027m from, why I do the things I do etc. A with juggling parenthood, work and well....life, keeping grounded from anxiety, stress etc can be tricky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first single \u003cstrong\u003eLost at Sea \u003c/strong\u003e(video below) was written this for all my family, friends and fans who are suffering (or who have suffered) from mental illness. I released it during the festive period (2017), which can often gloss over any problems, and then come crashing down in Jan, or it can highlight the problems to those already feeling down and make them feel alone. It may seem like a very dark place at times and you can easily get lost in your mind (hence lost at sea), but there is light, there is hope and there are people around you who can help....including me: I will always have an ear open for friends who need it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second single will be called\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Mother\u0027 \u003c/strong\u003e- all about my birth mother.\u00a0Now, for most this will probably be in a major key, but this track has a mix of major and minor as it\u0027s \"complicated\". I wrote the song\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/0cLkB_6T9ZU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0027Father\u0027\u003c/a\u003e for my Dad on Father\u0027s Day four years ago, when I become a Father. He\u0027s my role idol as a father and how I father my children. But my mother suffered a damming mental illness, which crushed her world quite frankly. All my family have different views and opinions about this, but this track is simply from my point of view as her oldest son (me and brother). It\u0027s probably the hardest song I\u0027ve had to write as my upbringing was mixed (nothing serious compared to others around the world) but it\u0027s made me who I am. I get choked up every time I perform Father, I know when I finally to perform this track, it will be daaaaamn hard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third single will be called \u0027\u003cstrong\u003eThe lines between\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027. Whilst I was writing/recording \u0027Reborn\u0027, I was a frontman for a Drum \u0027n\u0027 Bass Rock band \u0027Opinaut\u0027. I really miss those days of jumping around like a madman and belting out gravely\u00a0vocals. So I wanted to create something with power, darkness and mystery. This is all about dealing with anxiety.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry, the whole album won\u0027t be all doom and gloom. There will be some nice tracks dedicated to my son (my daughter got a track on Reborn so he rightly deserves one haha), my beautiful wife, the joy of mindfulness and much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will fund string arrangements (with film composer Rupert Cross), mixing, mastering, duplication and PR. I want to be completely honest with where everything will go. If you would like to fund something particular i.e mixing/mastering for a particular track, then please do get in contact and you will be credited for that track. You\u0027ll be credited on the whole thing anyway :^)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eif you like this idea and would love to know more then please PM me at jon@jonhartmusic.com.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN ADVANCE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake care\u003cbr\u003eJon x\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCrHY32cwQo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",
