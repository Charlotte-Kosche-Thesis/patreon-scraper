This is where you can support my racing coverage (\u003ca href=\"http://jeffgluck.com\"\u003eJeffGluck.com\u003c/a\u003e and the Untitled Jeff Gluck Podcast) by becoming a patron through small financial contributions on a monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of the support here on Patreon, I was able to become an independent journalist in January 2017. I now work directly for those who pledge each month -- the people I fondly refer to as my \"bosses.\" After all, they\u0027re the ones who have kept my career going by providing me a living while still sending me to the racetrack!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy racing coverage \u003cstrong\u003eis not subscription-based or hidden behind a paywall.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Anyone can access it at JeffGluck.com. So the purpose of this Patreon page is to allow people to make ongoing contributions in order to keep the coverage going. Along the way, I post occasional updates here about my plans, have \"staff meetings\" (live video stream for patrons only) and sometimes poll my bosses on their opinions on where I should go next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis has been the best experience of my career, and I absolutely love working for all of you. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope to see you at the track!\u003cbr\u003e"
