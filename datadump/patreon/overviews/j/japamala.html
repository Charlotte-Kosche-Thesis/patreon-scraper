    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eWho am I?\u003c/h1\u003e\nI\u0027m a self-taught programmer that\u0027s been making and contributing to various tools for showing what\u0027s going on in the game\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bay12games\"\u003eDwarf Fortress\u003c/a\u003e in a graphical manner since 2009. It\u0027s how I learned to program, in fact.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love the game, with all the depth and complexity that no other game I\u0027ve played has achieved, but it lacks a bit in the presentation department, which means that so much of what goes on in the game is either never seen, or is hidden behind textual descriptions that are fine for digging through, but fall short of showing a complete picture at once.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s why I\u0027ve started Armok Vision\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat is Armok Vision?\u003c/h1\u003e\nAt its core, Armok Vision is a 3D frontend for Dwarf Fortress. It runs alongside the game, as a separate program, giving both a layer of safety, and its own resource allocation, meaning that if something goes wrong, it doesn\u0027t bring down the game, nor does it use up the already cramped memory limit of a 32bit game.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe ultimate goal of Armok Vision is to show graphically every aspect of Dwarf Fortress, as well as provide a more user-friendly graphical interface for playing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhy am I asking for money?\u003c/h1\u003e\nProgramming a project of this scope takes a lot of work, and a lot of time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI enjoy doing it, and will continue to work on the project in any case, but if I get a bit of spending money on the side, it will allow me to put more focus into the project, as well as, should funds allow, buy things for the project that I wouldn\u0027t otherwise be able to justify spending money on (Like better sky systems, for example, or VR goggles)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/h1\u003eThere isn\u0027t really that much I can do on an individual basis for a project like this, due to its nature, but I\u0027ve put together a few incentives down below in any case.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always open to suggestions, though."
