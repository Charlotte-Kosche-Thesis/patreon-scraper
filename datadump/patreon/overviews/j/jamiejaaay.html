    "summary": "Welcome! Consider patronage on this page like it is a digital tip jar. There is regular public content and regular patron-only content posted every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJamie is a multi-medium weaver, working primarily in acrylic and blended wools, creating unique pieces with a contemporary Coastal Salish style aesthetic. He is transgender and a settler (hwunitum) living as a guest in Coast Salish (xwulmuxw) territories. He is of Scottish, Scandinavian, Slavic, and Jewish ancestry. He has found his family in the Pacific Northwest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJamie first began learning cedar bark weaving from a Haida weaver named Todd \"Giihlgiigaa\" DeVries, of whom he was a student for two years, beginning in early 2013. Through the teachings of Haida style cedar bark weaving, Jamie was able to develop his own artistic signatures, and to connect to the cedar tree and the land on which it grows. He does not offer cedar weaving for sale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter establishing his signatures in Haida style cedar bark weaving, Jamie met a Squamish weaver named Norma \"Kwenkwelut\" Gonzales, with whom he lived for two years, until late 2016. During this time, he learned about Coastal Salish style wool weaving, and quickly developed his own signatures in this art form. He now independently creates wool weavings for ceremonial purposes (in support of indigenous governance), as well as for custom requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA significant majority of Jamie\u0027s weaving is currently made in service to Squamish and Sto:lo communities. This page has been created to provide an outlet for him to offer his work to his supporters outside those communities, for whom he is very grateful."
