I am always trying to improve the lessons and how I make them, and have learned a lot along the way. \u00a0I have also been very fortunate to have a lot of positive feedback and support from all the people interested in my lessons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep making and improving the lessons I need to be able to have more time for both production and research. For me to invest more time I need to spend less time on other work that I do and that means that I will earn less money. More secondary goals are to build a better website with a better overview of the lessons and also acquiring more equipment for the production (lights, stands, lapel mic etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I tend to publish about 4 Guitar Lessons to my YouTube channel. Each time I do so, I share that lesson here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of lessons I publish that month determines how much you contribute. \u00a0Since I only publish one per week it is a maximum of 5.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does it give us in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me via Patreon you are directly helping me make the weekly lessons as good as possible and you also get a chance to give me input on what topics I choose and how I demonstrate them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me the Patreon page can be a way of giving something back that can help you further in your journey exploring Jazz Guitar. I try to offer additional material, new things I am checking out, peeks behind the scene, early announcements and other exclusive content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also hoping to use the patrons as a community. A place where we can not only hang out but I can also get feedback and evaluate ideas for new videos. Since you are the people who really want to support the lessons and help me making the content it seems logical that your feedback should help shape it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
