     "about": "\u00a0Joe Seamons was raised in the backwoods of Northwestern Oregon in a house built by his parents. There, he was exposed to local folk music of sawmill workers, loggers and fishermen whose music reflected the character of the region. As he heard these songs in living rooms, around campfires, and at cider pressing parties, Joe also attended public school in the small nearby town of Rainier, Oregon. Consequently, he was exposed to the artistry and fierce environmentalist passion of his community\u2014as well as the quiet conservatism of the nearest town\u2014one full of paper mill workers and longshoremen. Living between these two cultures opened Joe up to the hear the outsider perspectives of the great early blues artists, whose music he discovered as a teenager and now interprets professionally. After performing and teaching Northwest folk music in Portland, OR for 10 years, Joe moved to Seattle in 2014 to work with his musical partner, Ben Hunter. Together, they developed the Rhapsody Project, which brings together diverse communities around the common ground of social, communal American roots music.\u003cbr\u003e",
