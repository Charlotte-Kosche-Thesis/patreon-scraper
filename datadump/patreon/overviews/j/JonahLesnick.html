    "summary": "It\u2019s fair to say I\u2019ve always been a child of the internet. \u003cbr\u003eWhen I was in highschool I would spend much of my free time alone in my room wearing a spiderman mask, sitting at my yamaha keyboard, taking song requests from random strangers on chat-roulette. Since then not too much has changed. \u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 I stumbled upon a livestreaming website called YouNow.com. I made the tough choice of leaving my spidey mask behind, grabbed my keyboard and guitar and hit the \u201cgo live\u201d button. In my first broadcast I had maybe 6 or 7 viewers, but I had the BEST time getting to connect with those people. I was sold on livestreaming but I never could have expected what would follow.\u003cbr\u003eIn under 6 months I had surpassed 100,000 followers on YouNow. I became partnered with the platform around which point YouNow would ask me to represent them in interviews, press releases, and even series pilots. \u003cbr\u003eSoon after I was picked up by a few social media tours where I had the opportunity to perform around the country, record my first album Extrospection and even open for Demi Lovato at Citi Field for DigiFest 2015.\u003cbr\u003eWhile in the process of recording my second album, I learned some harsh lessons about the music industry, working with the wrong producers and ultimately the project fell through. This was a very humbling experience and I decided to take a break from social media in order to further educate myself about production. I enrolled in a program through Berklee College of Music where I received a Master\u0027s certificate in commercial songwriting and music production. The following summer I began (and still am currently) working as an audio engineer at Platinum Sound recording studio in midtown NYC. At Platinum I\u2019ve had the opportunity and privilege of working with and assisting some incredible people such as grammy winning engineer Serge Tsai, producer Jerry Wonda and legendary artists like, T.I., Mario Winans, Kendrick Lamar, P. Diddy and Mary J Blige.\u003cbr\u003eThe path of a music producer so far has been full of excitement, creativity, and instability. I still have A LOT to learn, but I finally feel confident enough in my knowledge and experience as a producer as well as a live broadcaster to return to social media and share my experiences with you all again, and I\u0027m looking to my awesome Patreon supporters to help fund that process!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s what I\u0027m doing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be livestreaming at least\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e3 days a week at 5pm EST \u003cbr\u003eRight Here-\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/superdope\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/superdope\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic Monday\u003c/strong\u003e - using Abelton Live 9 we\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eproduce a brand new original song\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003etogether \u003c/strong\u003efrom scratch.
