    "summary": "I started jasminelholmes.com in late March 2017, but I\u0027ve been blogging in spurts since I was 17. Over the last ten years, I\u0027ve published one book, and I\u0027ve written a number of articles for sites like CBMW, Desiring God, The Gospel Coalition, and more. The journey to my blog started with my marriage to my husband, Phillip, who, in addition to working in the finance world, is a tireless creative. He\u0027s worked in content for over five years and loves it. He built and maintains my website as well as edits all of my articles. So the blog that you see is an act of teamwork.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy hope for this blog is that it would be an encouragement to women of all kinds \u2014 single, married, stay-at-home moms, working women, and everyone in between. I want to bring you fresh content on a regular basis: mostly articles, with a smattering of product reviews, book reviews, movie reviews, and more. I want this blog to be as varied as the interests of its readers, but the primary focus will continue to be Christ-honoring content that edifies my eternal family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupporting My Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027ve started writing more, many people have asked how they can support this work. This is where Patreon comes in. Patreon is a way for content producers like me to be linked with content supporters like you. Furthermore, we want to avoid splattering the blog with ads that distract readers with what they came for \u2014 quality articles. I love being sponsored by organizations and small businesses I believe in, but I want quality, original content to remain king.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to ask you to prayerfully consider supporting me as a writer by becoming a patron. Any monetary support that you can offer will contribute to my writing career as well as our little family. As a patron, you will also have a unique voice in helping me brainstorm topics to write about, giving me personal feedback on story ideas, and being the first to know about major updates through the patron-only stream. Your support will help me continue writing (non-fiction and fiction) and bless my family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering becoming a patron of my blog. Though I\u0027m not a fan of calling it \"rewards,\" as a token of my gratitude, I will try to provide exclusive benefits to all of my patrons. I want to start off by offering all donors access to a monthly video where I\u0027ll be talking about everything that I\u0027ve written on the site and some writing updates. You\u0027ll be able to offer questions, comments, or concerns and provide new ideas. In the past, I\u0027ve done some of this on my Facebook page, but moving forward, the bulk of my live interaction will happen here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve updated my goals. So far, my Patrons have been incredibly understanding of my busyness as a young wife and mom, a teacher, a writer and a conference speaker. We\u0027ve dialed our chats back from every week to every month, and I\u0027ve enjoyed having a Facebook Live session with them to talk about everything from upcoming conference topics to publishing woes to a bad hair day. We\u0027ve really made a community, and I would love for you to take part. It helps me keep my blog going, but it also helps to encourage me that there are folks out there who want to read this content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to monthly chats, Patreons will also have access to previews of articles before they go live. I value your feedback!\u003cbr\u003e"
