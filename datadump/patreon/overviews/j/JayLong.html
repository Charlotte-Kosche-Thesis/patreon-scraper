    "summary": "I am excited to announce that my first book of poetry and prose will soon be available online through all the major retailers in paperback and digital format. Look for it late August/early September. Originally released on November 3, 2015 as a limited edition signed hardcover, the first print was limited 1,000 copies. A number of copies are still available. You can reserve your copy today on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://jaylongwrites.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJay Long Writes\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA LITTLE HISTORY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I can remember, I have loved to write and tell stories. There has always been something special about \u003cem\u003epen and paper\u003c/em\u003e. As a child I remember sitting next to my mother with a yellow legal pad and black felt pen mimicking her \u003cem\u003ecursive writing\u003c/em\u003e. Even today I prefer writing by hand to electronic means. I keep a \u003cem\u003espiral notebook\u003c/em\u003e in each room for anytime an idea may arise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy love for words started when I discovered music. As a teenager anytime I\u0027d get a new album, I\u0027d immediately open up the lyric sheet to read the words even before I listened to the song. My love of poetry began after reading Robert Frost\u0027s \u003cem\u003eThe Road Not Taken\u003c/em\u003e in my college English class. It truly changed my life, as I felt I had always carved my own path, even at a young age.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt age 23 I wrote my first screenplay titled \u003cem\u003eAshes to Ashes\u003c/em\u003e, about a police officer who enlists the help of a close friend to create a drug empire after his partner was gunned down during a drug raid. While I had no real knowledge of how to market my work, and living on the east coast, I tried a few query letters and continued to write. That same year I started writing my second screenplay, but as life and responsibility took over, I put my writing to the back burner and changed my priorities until recently. In December of 2013, I created a Facebook page to share my writing. Since that time, the \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/writerjaylong\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriter Jay Long page\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e has attracted tens-of-thousands of fans. I enjoy connecting with fans and sharing pieces of myself with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY GOAL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have decided to make a real push to write full-time in 2015. I created this Patreon account as an online \u003cem\u003e\u0027tip-jar\u0027\u003c/em\u003e to help support my writing each month and to help me achieve my goal. With your support, I will be following my dreams and traveling down a path that was carved out many years ago. I love hearing that others connect and can relate to my writing. I hope to use this account to better bring you more writing each day, as well as, open up the possibilities of professionally recording many of my more popular pieces. I also would like to create a blog series to help other upcoming writers with the many struggles they face when creating a platform and continuing their dreams.\u00a0 and continue to create and share parts of me with the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e makes it safe and easy for fans and followers to contribute to your favorite artists.

I grew up in the awe inspiring Hudson Valley area. 60 miles from the greatest city in\n the world and smack dab in the middle of tranquility and grace. I have \nhad a passion for writing since I was a small child. And being near the \nHudson River and water has always helped me find my voice. I find \nclarity there and a simple no cost way to re-align when things get a bit\n askew.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Although it doesn\u0027t always happen this way in real-life, writing allows for the \u0027perfect\u0027 ending to any situation. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n Story telling, expressing feelings through words and making people \nlaugh are what I am best at.
