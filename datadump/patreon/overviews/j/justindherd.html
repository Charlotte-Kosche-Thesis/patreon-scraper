Rather\nthan throw in a lump sum into something you might never see, your support would\ncome with each video I release. For example, if you pay $2 per video and I\nrelease 3 videos in June, you\u2019d have supported me with $6 that month! But, and\nthis is the cool part, you can limit the amount you pay out. So if you put you\nonly wanted to pay $4 a month, then when I release that 3rd video,\nyou still only pay $4 at the end of that month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRegardless of whether you support me or not, my videos will\nstill be free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/50153de424ac88637fa8c4e1/t/599b2dbbe4fcb5c1da34f591/1503342013529/why_patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges directly contribute to\nthe growth of my channel, including the ability for me to do more videos on a\nregular basis.\u003c/em\u003e I currently work a full-time job,\nas well as am a full-time single father.
