I\u0027m a singer and audio mixer who enjoys recording and putting together covers of Vocaloid, Anime, and Western mainstream music. \u00a0I first started recording back in 2008 when I bought my first mic and have loved it since!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I also voice act, direct, and write scripts on the side, at the moment I mainly specialize in adapting Vocaloid music into English while retaining the original meaning (also known as translyrics) and adding tight rhyme-schemes to be sung either by myself or other talented vocalists. \u00a0Not only is it fun and exciting for me, but it\u0027s also extremely rewarding being able to release these adaptations and connect with fans and supporters that I\u0027ve been so thankful to meet along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k74/Obivionfog/Patreon_Header2_zps5xi90btn.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePatreon is an exciting service that allows musicians, artists, writers, vloggers, etc to connect with their fans and work together to create even more exciting new content that would be wouldn\u0027t be possible otherwise!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron, patreon will send me a small donation at a value you set whenever I release a new adapted cover. \u00a0Since I add each release personally, I have a lot of control over what gets charged, so not every single Youtube video I upload will apply (that would be way too much!). \u00a0There\u0027s also a very handy feature that lets you limit how much patreon will charge you per month, just in case I\u0027m having a very productive month. There\u0027s also no contracts or formal agreements, so you can stop being a patron at anytime! If anything sounds confusing, check out Patreon\u0027s FAQ that has all sorts of helpful info:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003ehttp://www.patreon.com/faq\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k74/Obivionfog/Patreon_Header3_zpsbdbzpews.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWhat I\u0027ve decided to use my Patreon for is a donations/tip jar type of thing. \u00a0My patreon will not be used as a personal income source, be used pay bills, feed my addiction to League of Legends (though tempting-), or anything like that. \u00a0I\u0027ve always loved to record new covers and write English lyrics just for myself and supporters and I\u0027ll definitely be continuing regardless if I have patrons or not. \u00a0What donations will instead go towards audio upgrades and things that will help me create even higher quality works then what I currently can do (more detailed goals are listed in the left-hand column). \u00a0Additional donations may also be used towards licensing audio plugins, collaborations with artists/animators, and more, lots of exciting possibilities!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I couldn\u0027t possibly ask for donations without giving you guys something nice in return.\u00a0Instead of charging fans for mp3 downloads or other features I believe should be accessible for free, my patrons will have access to different content that I haven\u0027t regularly been sharing before such as work in progress clips, early demo\u0027s, clean subtitled pv\u0027s, HD lossless audio downloads and more! (it\u0027s thanks to your support that I\u0027m even able to host the large lossless audio files, thank you!). \u00a0They\u0027re just little extras that serve as a giant thank you that I can\u0027t possibly put into words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for stopping by my Patreon page and supporting me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: Due to the gray-area and debatable use of arrangement copyrights (including re-arranges), personal anime covers and works I contribute to TYER are excluded from my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e"
