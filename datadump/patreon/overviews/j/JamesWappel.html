Here is a link to my blog:\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wappellious.blogspot.com/\"\u003ehttp://wappellious.blogspot.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I have made thousands of blog post tutorials and countless live painting classes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all requires a tremendous amount of time and effort, at least 2-4 hours per day (aside from all the normal work that I do).\u00a0 I want to expand on these classes in the form of Facebook live painting sessions, among other things.\u00a0 In order to take the teaching and instruction to the next level, I will need the assistance of those who follow the blog and my other social media outlets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon could help to provide more types of figures, tools, etc., which are needed to pass on these lessons that I learn every day!!\u00a0\u00a0"
