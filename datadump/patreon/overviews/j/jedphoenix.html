    "summary": "Welcome to this,\u00a0the Jed Phoenix Patreon page and home to the Phoenix Army.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u2019s it all about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePassion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt could be said that finding a sense of tribe and feeling like you belong to a supportive and nurturing group of people is what life is all about. If you\u0027re a misfit, freak or weirdo who doesn\u0027t easily fit into the mainstream, discovering that there are people like you in the world can literally be a life saver. Over the past two decades of running my UK made alternative punk and fetish clothing brand, I\u0027ve met a huge number of people from the queer, kink and goth scenes. And being part of these subcultures, seeing what can be achieved, how people can come together - for festivals, for entertainment, for support - it is truly fabulous. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePunk\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy does this Sense of Tribe have a 21st Century Punk vibe? Well, partly because I believe that Punk is far from dead. To me, Punk symbolizes a revolutionary attitude, one of Do It Yourself. It\u0027s grassroots, experimental. It\u0027s about using resources wisely and being creative. Punk is about being open to difference, embracing it, and being true to yourself rather than conforming to the \"norm\". Punk isn\u0027t always polished. It\u0027s sometimes fast and loud and dirty. In a world of filters, fillers and \"perfect selfies\", how refreshing to have something that\u0027s a little more raw and honest?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhoenix Army\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of my Punk ethos is pacifism. So why have a Phoenix \u003cem\u003eArmy\u003c/em\u003e of Patrons?\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eRather than being \"an organized military force equipped for fighting on land\", this Phoenix Army is \"a large number of people or things\". It\u0027s a place for people to feel\u00a0camaraderie with others who are from a similar subculture. It\u0027s a place where creativity can rise from the ashes of the bland, the beige and the safe. It\u0027s where you can step into No Man\u0027s Land knowing that there are folk there who have got your back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eParticipation\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt would be impossible to do what I do without others. It\u0027s through selling my garments at various pop up shops since 1999 that I\u0027ve met a large number of people from various different scenes. I\u0027m going to need help in bringing these amazing peoples\u0027 voices and stories to life. I\u0027m going to need people to interview, and people to watch and share the interviews. I\u0027m going to need feedback, suggestions and pointers. In return, you\u0027ll be entertained, enlightened perhaps, by the vlogs, interviews and behind-the-seams videos that I upload. There will also be written blogs, photos and podcasts (if I can ever figure out how to create an audio post successfully!). The aim is that this platform, Patreon, will be the HQ of the Phoenix Army where we can bounce ideas around too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatronage\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027ve already clicked on the Become A Patron button, thank you. Thank you for your trust that I can step out of my introverted and socially phobic comfort zone to do this. Your support motivates me to do you proud. Seriously. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions or comments, or you want to help in a different way, please do get in touch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
