    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m James Edward Mills and I\u2019m the creator of the blog/podcast series\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.joytripproject.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Joy Trip Project\u003c/a\u003e. I\u2019m basically a freelance journalist who specializes in telling stories about the business, art and culture of the sustainable active lifestyle. If you\u2019re not familiar with my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.joytripproject.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eweb site\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/joytripproject\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook page\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eyou might have seen some of my work online, in the pages of publications like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://adventureblog.nationalgeographic.com/author/jamesmills/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNational Geographic Adventure\u003c/a\u003e,\u003ca href=\"http://www.alpinist.com/doc/ALP40/40-wired\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e Alpinist Magazine\u003c/a\u003e, Rock \u0026amp; Ice and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hcn.org/author_search?getAuthor=James%20Mills\u0026amp;sort_on=PublicationDate\u0026amp;sort_order=descending\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHigh Country News\u003c/a\u003e or maybe you\u2019ve heard my voice on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ttbook.org/book/james-mills-african-americans-and-national-parks\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNational Public Radio\u003c/a\u003e. I tell stories about people who work and play in the outdoors while creating incredible works of art or profound expressions of the human experience through social activism or environmental conservation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2008 it\u2019s been my pleasure through the Joy Trip Project to create a wide variety of compelling stories. But as you can imagine an enterprise like this doesn\u2019t come cheap. That\u2019s why I hope to get your support through this ongoing Patreon campaign. With the help of your regular financial contributions I can bridge the gap between paid gigs writing for magazines and web sites and the occasional sponsored reporting assignment. You\u2019ll be able to help keep the content I produce free of advertisements and paid promotions. With a regular source of income I\u2019ll be able to focus my attention on content creation and less on fundraising. Without that distraction I\u2019ll finally be able to create a regular production schedule and bring you the stories you\u2019re looking for. You\u2019ll also help me to commission the valuable work of professional photographers, filmmakers and musicians that help make the Joy Trip Project both interesting and engaging. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs mainstream media keeps cutting back on their budgets to pay freelancers like me I am incredibly grateful for the support of fans like you who want to encourage the creation of more stories about the exciting adventures and humanitarian initiatives around the world that you love most. Your contributions can help keep me on the road and in search of the latest projects and personalities in the field. I am personally inspired every day by the amazing work being generated by outstanding individuals in the interests of science, philanthropy, art or sheer adventure. And it\u2019s my great privilege to bring you their stories week after week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy supporting the Joy Trip Project you\u2019re also helping to discover new ways to keep yourself enthusiastic  and motivated for your next adventure. You\u2019ll be able to stay up to date on all the latest films, books and ongoing expeditions across the planet. And as a patron of this project you can help encourage others to create exciting new projects of their own. For as little as a dollar a month you can help me tell the great stories of our times. Don\u2019t wait! Become a patron of the Joy Trip Project today!\u003cbr\u003e"
