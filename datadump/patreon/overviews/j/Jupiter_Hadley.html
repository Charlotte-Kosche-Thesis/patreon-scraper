I pour most of my time into covering indie games each and every week. I feel that covering game jams specifically is so needed - to bring light to these small gems hidden in the piles of jam games. I do not cover all of the popular indie games as individual games on my channel, but instead I show off hidden gems that may have gotten lost in the ever growing indie scene. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to use Patreon to fund the coverage I currently do will enable me to continue to make content and \u003cstrong\u003esurvive\u003c/strong\u003e. YouTube does not pay as much as one would think for the number of videos I create, so I rely on Patreon and freelance writing to keep myself afloat.
