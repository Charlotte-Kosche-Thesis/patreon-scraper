    "summary": "Hello! My name is Julie! I started seriously getting into cosplay in 2011, but I\u0027ve had a passion for dressing up in character ever since I was a child! I love many different fandoms. My nerdy passions include (but are not limited to) the Lord of the Rings, Dragon Age, Halo, Yu-Gi-Oh, Rooster Teeth, and Mario! I suffer pretty badly from social anxiety, and oddly enough, I\u0027ve found that the best way to cope with it is through cosplay! I have met some pretty amazing people through cosplay, and even though I may be terrified to go out and see them on a daily basis, once I\u0027ve donned a costume, I\u0027m a whole new person! Costumes give me the strength and inspiration to become a little bit more like the people I\u0027m dressed up as.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also found that livestreaming on Twitch can sometimes help with my anxiety. However, there are some days where I just sit in front of my computer, cursor hovering over the \"stream\" button, and I just can\u0027t find the strength to go through with it. I\u0027m not explaining my situation for any sympathy, I merely want people to know that even though I want to stream everyday, and even though I have dozens of costumes that are ready to do photo shoots for, that this is an ongoing struggle that I have to deal with every day, and I\u0027m trying to get better! I will make a strong effort to answer every message I receive as well as stream more often for you guys. I truly love you all and I cannot thank you enough for all of the support you\u0027ve given me even without Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to start a Patreon because I personally am supporting four cosplayers through this site, and I love all the little extra goodies I get every month from them as well as seeing them on a more personal level. I\u0027m hoping that through Patreon, I can give the same to you guys! I also believe that on some level, Patreon will help me with my anxiety. Weird, I know, but I feel like this will give me the opportunity to be more active with you guys and help me overcome my fear of talking to people! Please don\u0027t think that supporting me here is a necessity. This is here just for people who want a more direct relationship with me, and want to throw a little extra support my way. Thank you so much for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my love,\u003cbr\u003eJuliexKitten\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/juliexkitten\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/juliexkitten\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/juliexkitten/)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/juliexkitten/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliexKitten)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/JuliexKitten\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/juliexkitten/)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/juliexkitten/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStore:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://juliexkitten.storenvy.com/)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://juliexkitten.storenvy.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
