Both poetry, esoteric academia and fiction works are in process!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who appreciate my work and wish to support my creativity, I love the idea of being able to develop a symbiotic relation in which my patrons may be offered exclusive, limited edition material and a series of rewards in return for their valued and essential support. I am also very keen to engage in a process of dialogue with my patrons ref future publications and reward requests too! e.g. I am intending to run a limited edition handwritten print of my poem \u0027Is Mise Erin\u0027 as a few folks have expressed interest already in that. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for enabling me to do what I love and to share the fruits of that love and passion with you and with the rest of the world \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can see the books in my heart and mind, just awaiting the time and space for my pen to translate them into words on a page, and to bring a little bit more of my magick to the world...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBooks I have currently written and published may be bought by messaging me directly through here-enjoy! \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours in Light-Life-Love and Liberty\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn-Paul Patton\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
