    "summary": "\"Dangerous Ideas\" is a video channel designed to share the hard lessons I\u0027ve learned in my career in order to make work and life easier for YOU on your way to the top. This is my private teaching hub. Each week I will be making videos and posting them here just for you. It\u0027s a classroom atmosphere where we are free to express our ideas about what it means to be creative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I have realized the role I play to you as teacher or guide. I\u0027ve had people write to me who have either quit their job (GASP!) or left another career to pursue their true Creative Life because of my writings and videos. I take this seriously. \"Dangerous Ideas\" is designed around the concept that there is NO professional development without PERSONAL development. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to continue to help you become stronger and braver in your actions and work and learning.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI believe that being \u0027Creative\u0027 means a way of applying your thinking and seeing onto various surfaces and in various forms and in your WAY OF LIVING-- and not just the visual arts. My audience includes artists, designers, sound engineers, publishers, entrepreneurs, teachers, students, seasoned professionals, printers, health care professionals, filmmakers, a blacksmith and YOU. SO... these lessons ware applicable to anyone willing to put the effort to live their creative best. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Dangerous Ideas\" deals with the practical difficulties of just BEING creative. From seemingly simple ideas like, \"Why doesn\u0027t my mom understand what I do for a living?\" to larger ideas like bringing your own perspective and voice into your work, dealing with co-workers, attracting your audience, and trying to sell good work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome proposed subjects are:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Why Is It So Damn Hard To Be Creative?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Creativity Is Dangerous Because It\u0027s Supposed To Be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Why The Truth Is Your Strongest Tool.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 No, I Don\u0027t Draw Pictures For A Living.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Why Your Job Sucks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 How To Get To The Damn Point.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Why Your Creativity Matters.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Ain\u0027t You Got Nothing To Say?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 How To Show Your Damn Work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Why I Don\u0027t Practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep in touch!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jamesvictore.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=804f61cff25ccc918943bcffd\u0026amp;id=10028804d6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclick here to subscribe to our newsletter!\u003c/a\u003e This is where we let you know of all the special projects we are working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what our audience says:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Thank you, James for everything you put out.
