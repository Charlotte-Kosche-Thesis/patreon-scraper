For a monthly amount of your choice, you can subscribe to receive exclusive access to work that I\u0027m not sharing anywhere else and/or that will not be published for a long time. Please don\u0027t feel obligated in any way - I\u0027ll be posting a lot of free content too, and I\u0027m honored by any reading or listening you do!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFree content will include posts on life and culture from the slightly screwy perspective of a Christian llama-farming theatre artist with obsessiveness and sensory defensiveness issues and a love for neuroscience. I\u0027ll also be posting a host of other things like original songs, flash fiction, allergy-friendly recipes, and the occasional stupid poem.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you come across a public post \u00a0you really like, please feel free to share a link to it on your Facebook page or send it to a friend - it would be very helpful to me as I try to connect with more people! Please just make sure your sharing includes or links back to this Web address. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for visiting my page, and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(p.s. -- In case you were wondering, the little dude up there is an alpaca, not a llama.
