You might find all my public art here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/jaleo/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/jaleo/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m more known for my friendly art,\u00a0humility and for giving people always a nice treatment. I actually draw all sort of things too, from doodles and sketches, to traditional inks and digital coloring, clean art, motorbikes and cars, humor and comic panels, or adult art (\"yiff\") and I don\u0027t discriminate when it comes to genders and orientations, it may be art for boys, for girls or for those who like both genders, or just all too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, it would be a big help if anyone would like to contribute and give me a hand. I\u0027ve been through rough times the last years, been having lot of bad luck and not very nice experiences (which, I\u00a0hope you understand that, if my mood is low, or I\u0027m under a lot of stress or have depressions, it gets harder to get motivated to draw and I won\u0027t have any inspiration). I\u0027ve always tried to compensate it by drawing for my fans and sometimes my customers as well, but it\u0027s hard to live with only that, specialy in a country with so very little chances to succeed and go on. The money would be mainly used to pay bills or taxes, feed my pets too, but specialy to help me pay my classes for the degree I\u0027m\u00a0coursing now (2 more years if everything goes fine!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be very\u00a0grateful to those who decide to contribute and give me a hand. It may help to keep my chin and mood up, for I would keep drawing for your delight and fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance, and I hope you enjoy (or have always enjoyed) with my art!"
