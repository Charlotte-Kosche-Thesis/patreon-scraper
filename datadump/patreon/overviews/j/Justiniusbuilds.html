    "summary": "Hello, my name is Justin. I\u0027ve been collecting, building, and painting scale models (seriously) for about 6 years now. I started a youtube to document my progress as a builder, but quickly found myself making tutorial videos to help others. In a few short years my channel transitioned almost exclusively to tutorial styled content, and in 2018 I\u0027m making a big push to keep a large majority of my content geared towards helping modelers who want to improve their skillset. This year I\u0027ve spent significantly more time working on keeping the clarity of my content at an all time high, including better video editing, video narration, and other smaller things to make my content easier to view. Patreon will help me afford new supplies to improve the content on my channel, such as new camera equipment, supplies to try and review, and more. While patreon will be a great way to support me, and the content I create nothing I create will be locked behind patreon. meaning all the videos i produce will be available on all of the normal platforms they already exist on.\u00a0"
