We never would have made it this far without your support, so thank you thank you thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you\u0027re here to talk about the BENJAMINS, BABY! Why do we need your hard-earned cash? Well, here are some things to know about us here at \u003cem\u003eJust One More\u003c/em\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are a fitness and nutrition podcast \"for normal people who want to be more awesome\".\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are 100% independent. The entire show is created by two people: Joanna and Daphnie. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe have never made a dime for making the show. That\u0027s over 120 episodes for FREEZIES!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe provide that we think is really valuable: science-based talk about fitness and nutrition that isn\u0027t influenced by us trying to sell you a product. In today\u0027s world where the diet industry is worth $64 billion dollars, we think that\u0027s pretty important.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo support that mission, we haven\u0027t taken on advertisers. It may happen someday, but we always want to be extremely careful to not compromise the integrity of the show just because someone offers us cold hard cash.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt does, however, cost money to produce the show, and it will definitely cost money to take it to the next level. We would like to be able to cover:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHosting fees for the year \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaying the musician behind our awesome theme music (Hi Hannah!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInvesting in PR to find more fantastic listeners like you\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaying ourselves at least a little bit to help offset the time we put into the show. As \u201cheart-centered\u201d creators, we\u2019re willing to put a lot into this project, but our hearts can\u2019t pay the rent unless YOUR hearts help us out :)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get out of it? First of all, you help make sure we can keep making the show! But also, you get access to special Patron-Only Cool Stuff. Check it out in the sidebar on the right!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd seriously, thank you for pledging. We really, really love making the show for you and can\u0027t wait to make it even more awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eJoanna \u0026amp; Daphnie"
