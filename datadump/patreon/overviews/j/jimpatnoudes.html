    "summary": "A little about why I do what I do, and why I will never forget.\u003cbr\u003eMy older brother worked at one of the Chicago stock exchanges when the planes hit the World Trade Center. I remember him scrambling home, frantic, on one of the packed trains of people fleeing downtown as \"there were still aircraft unaccounted for.\" Meanwhile, my twin brother was just finishing up navy bootcamp. From there he would be sent to the USS Cole, a ship that had been attacked in Yemen almost exactly one year earlier by suicide bombers, killing 17 and injuring 39 more.\u003cbr\u003eI once shook John McCain\u0027s hand on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (now the Chicago Board of Trade). It was from that very same spot I watched as America unloaded \"shock and awe\" on an innocent nation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was surrounded by hundreds of traders and brokers from firms like Deutche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Merrill Lynch, our eyes locked on the gigantic telescreen, each ooh-ing and ahh-ing, some even joining in a growing chorus of applause as the bombs lit up the night sky broadcast to us live on CNN. In their defense, most of these patriotic men and women, myself included, were under the illusion presented to us by the Bush administration that Iraq had ties to Al Quaeda, and Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was in bootcamp a year and a half later; hoping to serve as my brother and uncles and grandfathers before me had. I was awarded distinction as my squadrons blue jacket sailor of the year, and had been at the top of all my naval training programs. I then deployed halfway around the world in humanitarian and peace building missions in South East Asia. I would go on to fight the war on terror between the Horn of Africa and Yemen, literally helping search for pirates and gun smugglers.\u003cbr\u003eI returned home in 2010 during the height of the crash, to a city that could be called \"Anywhere, USA.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve seen the story a thousand times before, once proud industrial manufacturing city, known for it\u0027s steel and large power plants. Proud Union Homes, strong middle class, and a bad side of the town across the tracks. \"Being taken over by Mexicans\" they\u0027d say, \"that and those damn gangbangers, with their rap music and pants falling off their asses.\" Little do they know those communities have been neglected by lower wage jobs, lack of opportunity, and an educational system that has abandoned them. Instead of investing in schools and infrastructure or tools for a sustainable future, politicians decided to spend our treasure, human and otherwise, on war and destruction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do what I do because I feel like I owe it to the people who have given me so much, and who are in danger of losing everything.\u003cbr\u003e"
