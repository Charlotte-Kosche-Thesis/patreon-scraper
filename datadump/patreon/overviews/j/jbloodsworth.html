    "summary": "Hello!\nIf you are a new friend: welcome. If you are an old friend, welcome back. Sit\ndown; let\u0027s have a cuppa. \u003cbr\u003e\nBrisbane based theatre company, CR Productions, has been making theatre since\nMay 2013. Anything you have seen from CR has been either written, directed, or\nproduced by me, Jay Bloodsworth. (Hi, nice to meet you!) When we began, I was\nnineteen, boot-clad and heart-heavy. I had\nbeen told so many times that no one would want to see our work because we\nweren\u0027t \"famous\". Wasn\u0027t that the point? Getting that big\n\"shot\", that opportunity to show people that we had what it takes, by\nworking hard on our craft and putting it out there? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFlash forward nearly five years and that need to prove myself has evolved and changed by\nincorporating feminism into my work. I moved around. Graduated acting school. Made more art.\u00a0 Partied hard like everyone should in their\n20\u0027s. Fell pregnant. Fell out with my closest friend. It was a fight I deeply\nregret but it pushed me to do something I had never done before. Perform a\nWHOLE SHOW completely solo. That show proved to me that I still had so much art to\ngive. I had such a huge life before my son was born. Surely my art wouldn\u0027t just let me go? It was a love affair I\njust wasn\u0027t ready to put to rest. Met my idol (Amanda Palmer!). I had a BABY (Which is about the best and most humbling\nthing I could have done for my art); in my shower. (Yes, on purpose. And on video!) I believe that motherhood should not mean\nwomen have to give up their passions.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy son, Jude, was seven weeks old during the auditions for Short and Sweet\u0027s\n2017 show \"Love At First Slice\", performed in August 2017 at the\nBrisbane Powerhouse. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this age of tricky Facebook algorithms, I wanted\nit to be easier for our fans to have access to content between shows. I plan to expand the kinds of art I am\nproducing and sharing with you guys (Special Effects Makeup! Draft scripts! Performance\nart videos! Featured artists! Ukulele!) \u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in. By becoming a patron, you pay a monthly amount of your choosing (each tier has different rewards!) to gain access to ALL of our content in one place, and sent directly to your email inbox. This patronage gives us a budget which allows me to pay for our actors, venues for rehearsing and performing, better film equipment, props and costumes, merchandise, and spend more time working on content to share with you. Making art is what I do, and Patreon makes it possible for me to deliver that art to you INSTANTLY. I also want you to have a voice about what kinds on content you are \nseeing! What kind of content are you enjoying, what needs to be axed?\u003cbr\u003eTELL ME! I am all ears. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re backing me at $1 or $50, YOU are responsible for making this happen and I am eternally grateful. THANK YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJay xxxxxxxxxxx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
