    "summary": "AHOY, THERE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Jherek Bischoff, a composer, arranger, producer and \nmulti-instrumental performer. I have released two solo records in the \nlast five years, \u003cem\u003eCistern\u003c/em\u003e (2016) and \u003cem\u003eComposed\u003c/em\u003e (2012), \nand while that may seem like a decent amount of output, it\u0027s actually \nonly a small percentage of all of the music I actually make. I work hard\n all day nearly everyday on numerous projects \u2014 many of which are only \never performed once. Some of these projects include: arrangements of \ntunes by Nick Cave, Lou Reed, Marianne Faithfull and others for tuba \noctet; my own tunes arranged for a bassoon quartet; and a full evening \nof George Martin music arranged for a large chamber ensemble. I\u2019ve also composed music for three large scale theater productions! \u003cbr\u003eWhen I mention these projects to people, they tell me they would love to hear them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are probably hundreds of similar projects like this from my past, not to mention projects that I am currently working on. The majority of these projects don\u2019t exactly fall inline with what a record label might consider a logical next record for me, so they recede into the night, and I am on to the next project. To see this work that I have invested so much time and energy into fade away can feel somewhat defeating as an artist. This is all work that I am proud of, and I would love nothing more than to be able to get these types of projects out into the world to share. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked with my dear friend Amanda Palmer for many years now, and have had the privilege of collaborating with her on several Patreon projects. Through this, I have witnessed firsthand how incredible Patreon can be. For instance, Amanda and I happened to be chatting the day after the legend David Bowie passed away. During that phone call, we decided that I would arrange five of his songs for string quartet and record them in LA, then I would send the tracks to her to add vocals, then we would release the project within one week. Through her Patreon, Amanda was able to pay me and the musicians very well, pay for the artwork, and all of the other production costs through her awesome Patreon fan base. That project became, as you may have heard, \"Strung Out In Heaven: A Bowie String Quartet Tribute\", a project which was able to reach a broad audience outside of Patreon. It also led to our collaborations with Anna Calvi, Kronos Quartet and others, performing at the David Bowie tributes at Radio City Music Hall and Royal Albert Hall. A lot of new listeners came to know me and my music through this project, and none of that would have happened without the power of Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany folks over the years have also asked how best they can support me directly, and some have even urged me to start my own Patreon. The ability to make and release art as and when you envision it, directly to your listeners, is an incredibly powerful and fulfilling opportunity.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW IT WORKS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, you can support my work directly by pledging a dollar amount of your choice for each new thing I create. In exchange for your support, you will have access to the Jherek Bischoff community where you will be the first to learn what\u0027s in the works, receive updates, and will be able to interact with me and other Patrons. There are also additional levels of support that include song downloads, sheet music, and even personal dispatches from yours truly.  \u003cbr\u003eIf there are ever any times when I\u0027m feeling particularly prolific and want to share more than one thing in a month, you can cap your support amount at whatever amount you are comfortable with so you never pay more than you are comfortable with. It\u0027s completely up to you, and you won\u0027t miss out on anything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT IT\u2019S FOR\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days I primarily make chamber music, an art form which is quite ambitious and can also be quite expensive. Historically it was funded through patronage. The process includes composing the work, recording musicians, mixing, mastering and pairing it with artwork and/or promotional material. Your support will enable me to continue to do the work I love, while also enabling me to hire other people to help me bring these projects to life. Hooray! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so excited to get started and hope you will come along for the ride. We can make so much incredible art together! I\u2019m really looking forward to growing my music and getting to know you all a little better. I sincerely appreciate your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out my dear friend Amanda Palmer\u0027s Patreon \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHUGE THANKS to Olga Nunes for her beautiful work on the animations and editing the video above. \u003cbr\u003eYou can check out her work \u003ca href=\"http://www.olganunes.com\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT ME\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJherek Bischoff is a Los Angeles-based composer, arranger, producer and multi-instrumental performer. In his 30-odd years, he has collaborated with the likes of Kronos Quartet, Bang on a Can, David Byrne, and Neil Gaiman and has performed in venues and festivals around the globe, including Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Adelaide Festival and Tasmania\u2019s MONA FOMA. His work as a composer has garnered commissions from Kronos Quartet, Lincoln Center, and St Ann\u0027s Warehouse and has been performed by Seattle Symphony, Adelaide Art Orchestra, Wordless Music, Stargaze and yMusic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis critically-acclaimed releases include 2016\u2019s ambient orchestral album \u003cem\u003eCistern\u003c/em\u003e, 2012\u2019s orchestral pop album \u003cem\u003eComposed\u003c/em\u003e, and a co-release in 2016 with longtime collaborator Amanda Palmer, \"Strung Out In Heaven: A Bowie String Quartet Tribute\". In August 2016, Bischoff was the artist in residence for Times Square\u2019s Midnight Moment, where his video for \"Cistern\" was broadcast every night on Times Square\u0027s electronic billboards, culminating in two live performances in the middle of Times Square. Bischoff\u2019s work for film and television includes the documentary film \u003cem\u003eThank You For Coming\u003c/em\u003e, Starz\u0027 \u003cem\u003eBlunt Talk\u003c/em\u003e, and Netflix\u0027s \u003cem\u003eWet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp\u003c/em\u003e.
