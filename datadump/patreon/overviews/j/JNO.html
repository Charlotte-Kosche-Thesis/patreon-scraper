    "summary": "What\u0027s up guys and welcome to my the Patreon Page. First of all I\u0027d like to say thank you for taking the time to read this and watch my Patreon video (I need to do a new one as the page is changing.) This Patreon Page has been set up in my pursuit of being able to dedicate myself full time to content creating around Fantasy Football and Football on Youtube, with future aspirations of a Second Channel and a Twitch stream. I currently have a full time 38 hour job and and a lovely 2 year old daughter with another due on March 5 2018 but still trying my hardest to build a great Football and Fantasy Football Community based around our love and respect of the beautiful game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to achieve this goal as soon as possible I need your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003eBUT ONLY IF YOU CAN!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eI\u0027m a family man, with bills, debts and\u00a0responsibilities. So the last thing I want is for anyone to become a Patron who cannot afford either the amount they are giving or any amount at all. I\u0027d be much happier if you use that money for yourself, your family and your personal life. There\u0027s plenty of ways you can show your support with comments and likes on my videos which are just as valuable to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut if you can afford a cheeky $ or two, then this is another way in which you can support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUnfortunately for me to either get a part time job, or a job closer to home both of which would allow me to dedicate more time to my Youtube Channel and Community, I need money. My channel is a long way away from earning me a living from ad revenue on youtube. As an example, the month I am writing this, anywhere between $10 to $30 depending on the amount of traffic in that month. Meanwhile I\u0027ve spent at least \u00a33000 on channel related improvements (extra camera battery, charger for battery and some graphics work since I started my FPL Today Channel..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWITH YOUR HELP \u003c/strong\u003ethere are so many possibilities. Whilst the ultimate goal is to become a full time content creator on Youtube, your support can do more. It can help me improve my content with better equipment or help me provide more for you all, like live stream chats before big games. If we take a look at my first Patron Dheeraj, his $5 dollars a month allows me to update one graphic for my channel a month at a much reduced cost. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what can you expect if you become a patron. Well I want to do something a little extra for you guys, so depending on the success of this page, you can expect me to look into giveaways, live chats and access to me on discord and more. I want to show my appreciation for my patrons as soon as possible. The discord is being set up as I speak in fact, so I look forward to speaking with you guys in there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far, well done. And thank you for your time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMILESTONE GOAL UPDATE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81ea81664244aeaeed6621a0502b538070821c46/17_96_1593_956/master/1593.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=901752e4ed6ff6d33765d7a2c87845ac\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve relaunched my Patreon page, and my first Milestone Goal is to try and reach $50.
