It\u0027s a humble little beginning-- my aim is one video game review each week, and two streams, along with discussion about what makes games great, what to get hype about, and all the things that you need in order to get the most out of your electronic entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been passionate about gaming since I was a very young child-- there\u0027s nothing quite like the feeling of losing yourself in a game. That bit of playful competition, the challenge, the risks and the rewards. I\u0027ve always been excited to share the joy I\u0027ve found, the fun I\u0027ve discovered, and I want to help everyone else find a little bit of levity in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still a noob about all of this online production, but I\u0027m hoping that with the right guidance, boundless curiosity, and a little bit of a helping hand, I can make a little place where anyone can come and play for a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome on in, step on up and have some fun. If you\u0027re here to join the neverending quest, thank you! I\u0027m ready to see where the dice take us next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll see you next game."
