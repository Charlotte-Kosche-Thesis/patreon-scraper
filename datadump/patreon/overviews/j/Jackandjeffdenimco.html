The inspiration behind the name comes from the combination of my parents last names (Jackson/Jefferies) along with my love for denim. We are a\u00a0handcrafted menswear and accessories company designed to fill the void and to bring a new face to fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Mission\u003c/strong\u003e is to produce and provide handcrafted products of excellent quality, design, and functionality to the consumer. And to inform the consumer that a name on a label doesn\u0027t make the clothes a success, but they do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Motto\u003c/strong\u003e is \" Don\u0027t Follow Trends, Make Them.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMaker/Big Cheese\u003c/h3\u003eHello there! My name is William and my obsession with the fashion industry started in 10th grade where I first learned screen printing and I began making t-shirts for family and friends. After high school, I embarked on a mission to gain further knowledge about the fashion industry attending Bradley Academy for the Visual Arts (AiYork) and the Art Institute of Philadelphia, graduating in 2007 with a Bachelor of Science in Fashion Design. During college I secured internships at \u003ca href=\"http://www.seanjohn.com\"\u003eSean John\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.undrcrwn.com\"\u003eUndr Crwn Footwear \u0026amp; Apparel\u003c/a\u003e, as well as doing some freelance work for \u003ca href=\"http://www.shopelusionclothing.com\"\u003eElusion Clothing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor\u00a0the past several years I, like most college graduates, have been working outside of the field I had obtained my degree for.

The donations that we receive will go towards supplies and tools such as a more high powered sewing machine(s), pattern making and grading supplies, as well as a continuous supply of fabrics, notions (zippers, buttons, etc). Three rewards will be offered for every goal that is reached and will consist\u00a0of Thank you cards, recognition of contribution on our website, as well as some pieces in the upcoming collection.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to turn Jack \u0026amp; Jeff Denim Co into a lifestyle brand that focuses on the quality and functionality of our products and not the quantity. We believe that slow fashion is better than fast fashion and with the quality that we want to achieve with our products, you won\u0027t have to throw away your clothes by the end of the week or month.\u003cbr\u003eWith your contribution, we will be able to cover our startup costs and production runs.
