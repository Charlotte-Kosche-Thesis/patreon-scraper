    "summary": "Hello! My name is JudgePikachu, and I\u0027m a self-taught\nartist and animator!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been drawing for about seven years now,\nand have enjoyed every moment of it. At the age of 11, I started my own YouTube\nchannel and in 2011 produced my very own original animated YouTube series known\nas Alcatraz. With the help of many talented artists and voice actors in the\nYouTube community, I\u2019ve been able to continue creating, directing, and\nproducing episodes through the years. The animation can be found here: \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/pB1H77\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://goo.gl/pB1H77\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEver since then, I\u2019ve been\npassionate about animation and storytelling. Most of all, I\u2019m passionate about\nbeing able to use animation to help benefit young children. Watching cartoons\nlike Steven Universe, Gravity falls, Star vs. The forces of Evil, and Adventure Time in today\u2019s industry have inspired me to\ncreate something that will help encourage kids to love who they are, and chase\ntheir own dreams!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I\u0027m studying screenwriting, with animation on the side, but after I finish my associates degree I\u0027ll be taking even more classes specifically in animation as I push my way into the field!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, college is expensive, and I\u0027m paying for it out of pocket currently as both of my parents are separated and neither can afford to help me. Just a few extra dollars a month could really help me pay for meals and gas. If I make enough, I could even drop a few hours at my job and spend that time working on Alcatraz! So, if you have the extra money, I\u0027d really appreciate the help \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eJP\u003cbr\u003e"
