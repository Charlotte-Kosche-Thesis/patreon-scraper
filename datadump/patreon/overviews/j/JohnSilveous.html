    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eAbout me\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is John Silveous. The last time I wrote for pleasure was early high school and the writing was fan fiction. Since graduating\u00a0with a BS in Information Technology I am applying and interviewing for a traditional job but, like many other people it is very difficult to find a job. Recently, I feel inspired and motivated to write for pleasure again. After sharing a short story with friends and family and getting positive feedback from them, I decided to start a Patreon. This Patreon will keep me motivated to keep writing and it could be a way for others to support my writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the series\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe series is called The Perpetual Universe. This series is short stories of superheroes in a sci-fi universe. The stories are about interesting characters and what happens to them in the same universe. Discovery, conflict, friendship, honor, sacrifice, and world destroying power are all inside the stories. The first story in the series is called \u201cThe Freeing of Elja,\u201d and it will be available to everyone. The stories will mostly be in chronological order but not completely. It has no set end and will continue as long as I feel I have stories to tell in this universe. My goal is to have one short story per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals and Higher reward tiers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want the community and fans to be involved with shaping how the rewards and goals of the Patreon are made. I want your opinion on what you want from this Patreon. I will attempt to give the community what it wants within reason.

The shackles on her ankles and wrists scar and pierce her. Her skin has lost almost all of its red coloring. Dried sweat and dirt cover her short red hair as it slumps on her forehead. Elja takes a few breaths. The short breaks between shocks is one of the single joys she has ever experienced in her life. The joy is short-lived as the electricity comes racing in through her shackles. Pain, her obligated best friend, builds in her body and as the pain builds her body temperature rises. Higher and Higher her temperature goes as it causes her skin to glow. The shackles absorb the heat and Elja knows her fate. It has always been the same, she was born to be used. Elja can barely hear the rough voice of the guard outside the door say,\u003cbr\u003e\u201cHeat up all you want. You\u2019re just a little battery.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYea, this duty sure is easy, she isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d The second guard said to the first guard.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even scream in pain very much, I\u2019ve been here a while and it\u2019s easy.\u201d said the first guard.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cHey, how much does Captain Riot come down here? They told me he is the only one allowed in,\u201d The second guard nudges and asked the first guard. The laughs and bellows come out of the first guard as he says,\u003cbr\u003e\u201c Never, he never comes down here. As long as she is alive and the equipment is working, leave her in there.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo barrels, two firing crystals, one large energy core, one trigger, and etched in red letters the name RIOT. It sits on a desk where a light talk device sits. Light talk devices use light waves to communicate from star system to star system. Captain Riot is on the light talk with someone.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOf course we still have her, she\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d said Captain Riot.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate her power, or underestimate the appeal of her power,\u201d a calm but firm voice responds to the captain. \u201cYou will drop her off soon, don\u2019t fail Edric Mitch.\u201d The conversation ends, and captain Riot says to himself as he puts his hand on his gun,\u003cbr\u003e\u201cMy name is Captain Riot.\u201d Captain Riot is the captain of the ship called \u201cThe Greed of the Murderers\u201d which is part of the secret group inside the Chrome Brotherhood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElja\u2019s body is tense and taut. The electricity running through her body, singeing every nerve. Suddenly, Elja hears a thud noise and then a suction noise, this noise was unlike the noise of asteroids hitting the spaceship. Outside, Melso Cheung and her team just landed on the ship and planted a Insta-door on it. Elja can hear as the Insta-door cuts through to make an air locked door, she wonders who will die when these people come and try to take her. Melso checks the area and then five other soldiers come into the ship after her. Three go to secure an escape ship while two watch her back. Melso creeps along the wall when she hears a patrol coming from the T intersection before her, and in a haste she enters a room. Five pirates stare at her and the barrels of their guns move to welcome her. Melso\u2019s battle instincts engage, her right thigh and calf tense and flex as they jet her towards the two pirates in front of her. As she soars towards them she moves her broadsword up to her chest, flat side facing them. Just before the sword reaches them, she moves her left palm up to the end of the blade and slams the sword into their chests. She bulldozes them up against the wall and the cracking and breaking of collar bones and ribs penetrates the room. She twists her wrist so the edge of the sword is against their necks. With one movement she swirls on her right foot to face the entrance and blood splashes her neck and back. One of her soldiers is starting to fire at the pirate on her left while the other is firing at the two to her right. The pirate on her left is shot down before he can fire. The two on her right open fire at her soldier. One pirate is shot and killed while the other hits her soldier in the left shoulder. The pirate takes aim again while the soldier is cupping his wound. He pulls the trigger, the shot is fired. At that moment the other soldier tackles his wounded partner to the ground. The shot hits the wall where the wounded soldier was. Melso\u2019s sword plows through the pirate\u2019s back and comes out his stomach just under his ribs. He is lifted slightly in the air and Melso tips her sword down and he slides off her blade. Melso surveys the five dead pirates and walks over to the soldiers. Both soldiers look at Melso expecting her to be a leader and heal the wounded soldier, but she only says,\u003cbr\u003e\u201cGet to the ship. I\u2019ll heal you when I complete the mission.\u201d The two soldiers head off to join the other soldiers while Melso continues to head towards Elja.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe captain\u2019s voice comes over the intercom system.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAttention crew. It seems we have some intruders that have already killed some of our friends. Show them our hospitality and show them a pirate\u2019s welcome.\u201d Elja hears the captain\u2019s message and thinks, Will the guards outside my cell die or will they be good enough?I hope they die, I\u2019m sick of this cell. A few minutes go by and Elja is listening like a wolf hunting.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWho are you?\u201d A guard shouts into the darkness. \u201c.... Who are you? I\u2019ll shoot\u2026. fire!\u201d Elja flinches as the sound of the shots echo in her cell.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cShe has some kind of shield. Fire around. Fire around,\u201d said the guard.  The sounds of shots thundered against the walls of Elja\u2019s cell.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cStay back. Stay back. Don-\u201d the guard\u2019s voice is silenced. Elja feels a relief and a stillness in the cell. The cell door opens and in front of Elja stands Melso Cheung. Elja sees another person, for the first time in months, a tall and dark walnut shaded woman, Melso. Elja looks at Melso and sees her white hair in a high bun, her small brown eyes evaluating the room, her mouth stern and motionless and her hands swinging a sword. As Melso cuts the last chain connecting Elja to the wall, Elja expects to feel the shattering embrace of her body against the floor, but to her surprise Melso catches her. Elja can feel tight formed muscle on Melso\u2019s shoulders and neck as her arm rests on them. Melso\u2019s arm felt like a robust hardened constrictor around Elja\u2019s back. The intensity of the muscle mass hurt Elja slightly. She could tell that Melso was trying to be as gentle as possible but Melso was so muscular that she couldn\u2019t help but hurt her. Melso and Elja meet up with Melso\u2019s team at the ship and take off into space. While on the ship, Elja, feeling like a prisoner, sits next to Melso. Melso looks at the shackles around Elja\u2019s wrists and ankles. Melso puts her hands around the shackle on Elja\u2019s left wrist and a green glow comes from her hands. When Melso takes her hands away, there is a break in the shackle. Melso slowly pulls the shackle off as the pins inside are ripped out of Elja\u2019s skin. The pins have embedded themselves into Elja\u2019s wrist. Melso then puts her hands over the fresh wounds on Elja\u2019s wrist and her hands glow a golden-yellow. When she removes her hands, only old scars remain on Elja\u2019s wrist. Briefly, Elja feels cared for but quickly her mind reminds her that she needs to look well cared for and healthy to get the highest price. She assumed this group had stolen her just to take her to some market to sell her, after all, Elja knew her worth as a thing and could see how that would be a quick way to make plenty of Bii. Melso does the same to Elja\u2019s right wrist and both her ankles while they fly to a secure ship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce they arrive on the ship Elja expects the same routine. They will forcibly strip her, bathe her, put her in some showy clothes and then have her wait until the auction where she will be sold.  Melso escorts Elja through the ship to a room. Melso opens the door and says to Elja,\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThis is your room, you have your own bathroom, food generator, bed, and computer access to all non-restricted files. If you have any questions or need anything, there is an intership communications device on the desk.\u201d Elja enters the rooms only a few steps and is in disbelief because she has never seen anything like this. She has only been thrown into cells or chained to walls. As Elja stands in disbelief, Melso shuts the door and goes to finish her mission report. Elja eventually makes it to the bed where she sits on the very edge. She is terrified that this is some trick and that as soon as she does anything they will come and punish her for some unknown offence she has committed. Slowly her body starts to relax on the bed and as she lays there about to fall asleep she still feels anxious that at any moment she will be brought back to the tortuous reality that has been her life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA familiar gun with RIOT in red letters sits on a desk. Captain Riot is on the light talk.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYes, several of my men were killed. She was stolen.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDidn\u2019t I warn you? You are so incompetent you failed.\u201d Barabbas Steele says, \u201cWell you won\u2019t get any pity or pay for failing this job. In fact you won\u2019t get any more jobs from the princess or anyone that is in debt to the princess, which is everyone, so you might as well fly what is left of your ship and your crew into a black hole.\u201d\u003cbr\u003eCaptain Riot pulls up a picture to his face and thinks to himself. You did this to me. I\u2019ll make you pay for this. He slams the picture on the desk. The picture is a security camera shot of Melso saving Elja.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
