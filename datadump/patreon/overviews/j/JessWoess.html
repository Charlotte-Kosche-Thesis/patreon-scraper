To make it my full time job would be a \u003cstrong\u003edream \u003c/strong\u003ecome true. So this year I am setting a goal to try and do this. Become a full time musician. This is where you come in! Pledging will help me cut back on my hours at work, or even quit, giving me a ton more time to work on more covers, new music, my band and heaps more cool content for you guys!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will be featured on your patreon page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027s asked and I listened!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAvailable in the Legends tier bundle you can now \u003cstrong\u003edownload all 3-4 angles of my latest covers\u003c/strong\u003e - allowing you to focus on the hand you want, for however long you want!! Whether you want to see more of my right hand technique or what my fingering was for a certain chord or lick it\u0027s all there!! This tier also includes \u003cstrong\u003etabs\u003c/strong\u003e as well as the \u003cstrong\u003esettings\u003c/strong\u003e I used on my \u003cstrong\u003eamp sim!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOh and my patrons will also see my covers before everyone else!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also just want to note that I am very new to this site, and don\u0027t quite understand it yet, so I\u0027m always looking to improve where I can, so tier ideas, price and any kind of suggestions are always welcome, I want you to be getting the best from me as you possibly can!
