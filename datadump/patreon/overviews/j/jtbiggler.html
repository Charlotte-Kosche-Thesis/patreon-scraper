    "summary": "Who is Jelly the Biggler? JT Biggler is a pen name and an alter-ego. He is a freak and the subject matter he writes about is not fit for public consumption but, in the shadows, under the covers, in the dark of night, and on the fringe ... there it can be consumed ravenously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis tales cover everything from straight up romance to vanilla sex to dominance and submission to non consent to incest, and sometimes, some extremely taboo and over the top sick shit. No one fan will, or should, like all of it, but, hopefully, all will like some of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a patron of JT Biggler, at any level, means you get to make requests, share ideas and kinks, and suggest where stories should go. While he can\u0027t guarantee he will be receptive to all suggestions and ideas, he will consider all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJT Biggler thanks you again for reading, and hopefully for supporting JT Biggler. If you have any suggestions for rewards that would motivate you to become a patron that are not already offered please let JT Biggler know. If it is within his power he will aim to please.\u003cbr\u003e"
