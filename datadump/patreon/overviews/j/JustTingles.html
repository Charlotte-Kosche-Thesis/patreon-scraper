Just Tingles!\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll see DAILY uploads on my ASMR channel!\u003cbr\u003eI create ASMR videos that focus on trigger sounds such as tapping, crinkles, scratching, mouth sounds, breathing, tongue clicking, ear massage videos, ear tapping, ear cupping, fizzy sounds, hair mousse videos, drawing videos, page turning, book tapping and some sound experiments with other ASMR triggers. I also enjoy whispering videos and breathing sounds. ASMR role plays are something that will be found here extremely rarely.",
