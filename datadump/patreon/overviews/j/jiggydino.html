Most of what I\u0027ve done in my past has been drawings and I have been attempting to get better with those drawings.  But I do want to do more with that skill and have to some extent.  While I generally find that the satisfaction of a finished project and the feedback from people who enjoy what I do to be good enough of a reward, we don\u0027t live in a world where I can live off of that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter some failed attempt to \"get a real job\", doing something with art sometimes feel like is the only thing I can do.  But at the very least, Patreon could be a way for me to get some amount of money while I figure out how to get a better income.  Unless something weird happen and I get to do that with Patreon.  Which I don\u0027t envision that happening for a really long time, if ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do or want to do isn\u0027t limited to drawings. I\u0027ve already done some comics (of various ratings...), and am currently am working on a variation of the comic format right now. Sometimes referred to as \"interactive story telling\", or casually named \"Quests\" on tgchan. I\u0027ve dabble in animation (recent example up top) and have started playing around Game Maker, with the intent to eventually make games, which is one of my current ultimate goals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/3ccc049f731c99a00112fc3675dde9c8.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere is a gif of what I managed to do so far in Game Maker. \u00a0Nothing great in the grand scheme of things, but I\u0027m starting out, gimme a break!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat I\u0027ve done, am doing, and planning to do\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, this Patreon page is centered around the Quests I\u0027m running on tgchan since it\u0027s what I\u0027m focusing on right now:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2 Frames Quest:\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://tgchan.org/kusaba/questarch/res/701048.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFirst Thread\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tgchan.org/wiki/2_Frames_Quest\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWiki\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nShark Quest:\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://tgchan.org/kusaba/quest/res/732068.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFirst Thread\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tgchan.org/wiki/Shark_Quest_-_Jiggy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWiki\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut if you support me on here, you\u0027ll also be supporting any other drawings I do really.

Even my first games, I intend to release them somewhere on the Internet for free. I might one day make a game that I\u0027ll try selling somewhere like Steam, but that is in the very distant future. Patreon is meant to mostly be a way for people to support me if they choose to do so. If someone like what I do and wants to throw a dollar my way every month, this page is meant to make that possible.
