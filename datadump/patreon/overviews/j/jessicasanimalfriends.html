    "summary": "First and foremost, welcome! My name is Jessica, and over the past few years I\u0027ve made it my mission to give permanent homes to disabled, special-needs, adopted, and surrendered reptiles, amphibians, and other small pets. It started with three adopted rats in April of 2013, and now I have an animal family of over 30. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years ago I started the Instagram page Jessica\u0027s Animal Friends. At the time, I had no idea where I was taking the page. I mostly just wanted to be a part of the animal community there. Over time, the page become a place to give and receive advice about the care of various species. I was able to share the tales of many animals: Louie, the escaped or set loose pet rat who made my garage his home before living in my bedroom; Ree, the crested gecko that wouldn\u0027t grow; Ron, the axolotl with a prolapsed cloacal, and more. But I think the most significant aspect of the IG page was that it helped me discover Enigma Syndrome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnima Syndrome is a neurological condition that leopard geckos with the enigma morph are at risk for. It is induced by stress, and it causes balance and coordination issues. Many geckos that are born with ES are culled while those who receive it later in life as a result of a stressor (i.e. being bred) suffer from a decrease in their quality of life. They often require hand-feeding, assisted sheds, and other special treatment in order to not only survive but thrive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow in 2017 I have made it my goal to educate people across various platforms about the care requirements, behavioral tendencies, and so on for a plethora of species. I also have made it my goal to share the lives of my 30+ animal friends, both the good times and the bad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this time more than half of the animals in my family are special-needs, and that number is only looking to grow.\u00a0As a patron\u00a0you will be supporting my ability to educate and interact with pet owners, but more imporantly you will be supporting my ability to bring more special needs animals into my family. For that I am forever grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your interest in me and my animal friends. I do this for them, but people like you make it that much more fulfilling. As a patron you will support not only my passion and my hobby, but the lives of various animals as you learn about their unique circumstances and personalities. Thank you, truly, from them and from me.\u00a0"

     "about": "I am a 22 year old recent college graduate with a passion for animals. For the past 4 years I have been taking in special-needs, rescued, rehomed, and adopted reptiles, amphibians, and small animals. Of course, it takes a lot of time to take care of the animals, many of which have neurological disabilities and require hand feeding and other special care. Every week I spend no less than 10-15 hours caring for them, which includes feeding, cleaning, handling, and tending to the pet room where they all live. My goal is to spread awareness about bad breeding, which results in birth defects and disabilities in animals today, as well as how to properly care for the 33 animals in my animal family.\u00a0",
