Clearly, I have father issues.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eDo you know how to make God laugh?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2026 Tell him your plans. I\u2019ll tell you what, he fell off his throne laughing at me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHe had other plans for me. \u201cSeriously, God \u2026 sales?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, sales it was. And, guess what? I was (am) damn good at it. So much so, that I decided to teach about it. I set up shop in 1998 and as they say, the rest is history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY CHALLENGE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is, that selling can never hold my attention, exclusively. I suppose my father\u2019s genes run strong in me and I\u2019ve always had an interest in philosophy, spirituality, being an author and what it takes to be human (and spying).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, in tandem with my sales career, I\u2019ve been journeying in the realm of spirit, arcane knowledge, philosophy and humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow I speak and write about this journey too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt might not be apparent to you, because you\u2019re seeing one side of the coin, but this journey has caused brand confusion (yes, it is a thing).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat am I? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe guru that goes on spiritual retreats and comes off the mountain sharing his wisdom?\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOr am I a hard-nosed, pragmatic and persuasive sales professional, teaching others how to be that too?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eI\u2019ve tried my best to marry the two philosophies with limited success.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost people that want to learn about sales don\u2019t really want to get into the human/spiritual/philosophy side (although, I believe that if they become better humans, they\u2019ll become better sales people too).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn my typical long-winded way, what I\u2019m saying is that my sales and marketing work in Patreon is separate from my philosophical/spiritual/human work. Essentially, I\u0027ve separated my brands into two segments: The \u003cstrong\u003emonk/warrior\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003etrader (sales professional)\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work on\u00a0Patreon is about sales and marketing, that\u2019s it.

The Spartans feature prominently in the keynote. I think it will be awesome if I can actually be at the battle sites to give deeper meaning to the keynote.
