    "summary": "Hi, my name is Jordan Indiana Gonzalez, and I like to make music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually, I love making music, and it\u00a0has always been an integral part of my life. From starting out singing along with CD\u0027s in the car as a child to learning to play the guitar to developing into the artist that I am today, music has driven me and inspired me in a way that few other things have. Through this passion, I\u0027ve learned that I can speak to people and connect with them on a level in which I never had thought possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, as of November 2014, I decided that I want to pursue a lifelong dream of mine to be a professional musician. Since then, I have released an EP (entitled \"Everything - EP\"), written more songs than I have in my life prior, and worked hard to improve my musicianship and my live act. I continue to strive for improvement each and every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has been an incredible journey so far, but it\u0027s just getting started.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027d like to invite you to join me on this journey.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this page is to provide an opportunity for you to help support me as I continue to write music, record, make videos, perform live gigs (in person and online), and pursue my dream. The page will continue to evolve as I produce more content and can add more ways that you can connect with me. If you have any ideas of things you\u0027d like to see from this page, please let me know! I can\u0027t guarantee that I\u0027ll be able to implement all ideas, but I am always interested to hear from you as to how I can improve on the content I put out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Jordan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Right now, this particular reward is a one time thing for each patron that gives at this level until I can figure how much time I can devote to something like this.
