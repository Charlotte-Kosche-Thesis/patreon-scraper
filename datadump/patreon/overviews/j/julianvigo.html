    "summary": "Hi. I am Julian Vigo, a scholar, filmmaker, artist, and activist\u00a0who works on public space and performance, disappeared bodies, cultural violence, social hypertrophy, women\u0027s rights, neo-colonialism, and the vast problems created by market capitalism. A specialist in critical anthropology, political philosophy, cinema, postcolonial theory, and media studies, I have spent much of my career as a professor at universities across the world\u2014from New York University, Universidad de las Am\u00e9ricas, Universit\u00e9 de Tunis, to the Universit\u00e0 di Bologna and beyond\u2014where I have taught anthropology, comparative literature, performance studies, cultural studies, critical theory, philosophy of science, postmodernism, and performance studies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, throughout my career in academia I witnessed the growing conservatism within the university where students were transformed into \"clients\" who are enlisted within a debt structure resembling that of indentured servitude and I witnessed first-hand

factors,\u00a0I chose to leave academia and conduct my scholarship outside those halls. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010, I went to Haiti and researched the vast conflicts of interest of UN and international NGO interventions within sites of \"disaster\" which turn neoliberal interests into a machinery aimed at keeping a wealthy elite afoot in posh jobs overseas where the economic incentives create a neo-colonial theatre. \u00a0The result of \"humanitarian efforts\": \u00a0the mis-en-sc\u00e8ne of saving the dark-skinned \"other\" was inevitably cast with the white westerner as the \"force of good\" reproducing older\u2014if not terribly flawed\u2014paradigms of power within countries whose population knows very well how to move forward without the intervention of the transnational educated elite coming to cash in on international relief funds. \u00a0My book,\u00a0\u003ca
