    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR VISITING MY PAGE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello there beautiful people of the world!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Jackie G. I\u0027m an author, vlogger, and motivational speaker. I believe that real friendship, conversation, authenticity, and love can nudge the world a bit. My mission is to create more of that. Whether that looks like a book, a speech, a YouTube video, or a conversation with a friend. I want my life to be lead by that purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce a week I create a video that is basically a personal journal entry. I share stories, lessons, insecurities, fears, anxieties, and even celebrations. They\u0027re a way for me to invite you into my process in the highs and lows of life, which is the purpose of relationship. It is my belief that what this world, and particularly the internet lacks is real genuine conversation about things that matter. There\u0027s a lot of meaningless crap on the internet, right? There\u0027s also a lot of angry people trying to prove a point while they live from a place of bitterness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission is a tad different from that. I believe what this world needs is more people talking about REAL things, things that matter, from a place of openness and healing. From a place that doesn\u0027t want to fight, but wants to mend. From a place that wants to love, not hate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that people are starved for real conversation, for real relationship and that is what I want to help bring to the table in my videos, books, and speeches. I want to be as vulnerable and authentic while sharing my story and process in these videos with the hopes of inspiring people to be honest with themselves and realize that they can do the same thing. Some of these conversations WILL get hard, but that\u0027s okay. A huge thing that I have learned is how to embrace the natural tensions that life throws at us because there is light on the other side. I\u0027m learning how to wade through the discomfort and not run when things get hard. So I figured hey, might as well start on the internet and go from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to destroy the illusion that we need to have it all together in order to be okay, accepted and good enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eBy pledging to my videos...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027re helping me establish a YouTube video ministry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will have access to exclusive video chats, updates, and early video viewing opportunities!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALSO...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt every milestone crossed, we will, as a family, decide where to give a portion of the money. For example, right now at every $250 mark we cross we then adopt a new child from Compassion International. We have our first child, Emmanuel, and are working towards raising enough for a second. Once we grow, I hope to then incorporate different non profit like organizations to support monthly with the coffee chats funds. So in the end, it becomes a type of non-profit for non- profits. Supporting my videos is in a way, like supporting a modern day missionary. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALSO...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote book! SO excited about it. So. Excited. It\u0027s a memoir of my life, a story about my journey finding freedom, grace, and faith in a really crazy world. It\u0027s about how I went from painfully insecure without an ounce of self worth, to where I am today! To purchase my book as a hard copy or kindle version, click here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2ubgNZ7\"\u003ehttp://amzn.to/2ubgNZ7\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we have the power to make a difference!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nOkay, let\u0027s do this.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
