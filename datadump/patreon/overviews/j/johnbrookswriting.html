I\u2019m a writer, child sexual abuse survivor-activist, and climate change activist among other things of course.\u00a0In addition to \u2013 and related to \u2013 CSA and climate change, my concerns include personal and\nsocietal journeys of healing and enlightenment. Welcome to my space on Patreon, where, if you choose, you can support my writing for just one dollar a month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen my father raped me when I was a child, his hands were around my neck, choking me to silence whenever I would start to cry out so I wouldn\u0027t wake anyone else in the house. (He came to my bed in the middle of the night to do it.) He choked me until I passed out, and when I came to after he\u0027d finished, he told me he would kill me if I ever told anyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, through my writing, I\u0027ve told the world. See, for example,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X19LQ9T\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy autobiographical novella, \u003cem\u003ePreludes: A Story of Child Sexual Abuse from a Child\u0027s Perspective in a Middle Class American Family\u003c/em\u003e, available for free download at the Amazon Kindle store\u003c/a\u003e (this is the link for the US Kindle store) and other ebook stores. This bearing witness to my experience and survival of child sexual abuse, and to my recovery, as an adult, from its effects, is a central component of my quest, through my writing and other aspects of my life, for enlightenment, and of my efforts to contribute to the creation of a better, more enlightened world.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a child, I was deprived, literally, of my breath and my voice by my abuser in his efforts to enforce my silence about the abuse. That\u0027s why now, for me, writing can feel as essential as the act of breathing. Through my writing, I seek to give \u2013 whether literally or metaphorically,\u00a0directly or by extension\u00a0\u2013 breath and voice to the survivor that lived at the heart of my child self; to children suffering sexual abuse even as I write these words, and you read them; to the challenges and healing experienced by CSA survivors worldwide; to people suffering various other injustices experienced on a daily basis by the oppressed; to aspirations for a world free \u2013 or as free as is humanly possible \u2013 of oppression\u0027s myriad forms; and to an exploration of humane and enlightened pathways towards the realization of such a world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd I seek to give voice to the feelings and experiences of people worldwide with respect to the ever-heightening, global environmental crisis, the acutest component of which is, of course, global warming.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll the while, I explore various dialectics \u2013 of despair and hope, escapism and engagement, and others \u2013 that are part and parcel of the human condition.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut to accomplish these objectives through my writing, I need adequate supplies of time and energy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u0027s where you \u2013 through your backing me on Patreon \u2013 come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Brief aside: \u003cbr\u003eNot sure how you got here, so if you haven\u2019t already and would like to get to know me and my writing better, \u003ca href=\"https://johnbrookswriting.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eplease visit my site \u2013 johnbrookswriting.com\u003c/a\u003e .
