    "summary": "HELLO\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHello world, my name is Jerry and I play the bass.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a professional bassist that currently performs on the projects of others.  Those projects include performing on Broadway, having been on Billboard\u2019s top ten, performances with notable jazz and pop artists, as well as being a really neat person.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWHAT IS THIS?\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell I\u2019ve been and continue to be so fortunate to have worked with amazingly talented and successful artists.  But through all this, I have supported others within their visions.  I haven\u2019t been able to focus on my own creations.  So that\u2019s what this is.  I have dreams of composing, improvising and performing, as well as using this project to expand my abilities as a musician and artist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPutting together an income as a freelance musician is time consuming.  I can\u2019t turn down paid work, to pursue my own unpaid project.  Turning toward my electronic community, I have committed myself to year long project of producing a work each month and sharing it with the public.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m looking to gather an audience and a group of patrons.  I\u2019m just beginning this journey and I\u2019m having a great time and producing wonderful music.  But the reality of life is that I do need an income to survive.  If my own creations don\u2019t provide income and require a lot of my time and resources, these creations will be the first to get cut from my workload.  I want to migrate into a life where I have patrons and an audience that not only will enjoy my works, but will also support me so I can continue to create more works.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI would love to have a life of creating music my way and having the support and income to continue.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBECOMING MY PATRON, THROUGH PATREON\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, the structure of how musicians and artists earn an income has greatly changed over the last few decades, and will most likely keep changing.  Patreon is a simple way for patrons to identify themselves and create an income for me, so I can focus on being an artist and creating.  It\u2019s easy.  If you like what I do and would like to see me able to continue, you can become a patron for as little as one dollar a month.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nTHERE\u2019S A PLAN\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis year I\u2019m committed to creating a new video once a month.  I\u2019ll spend the month creating the concept of the new work, practicing the skills needed, and ultimately record the finished work.  At the same time, I will communicate with my patrons. \u00a0I\u2019ll also start making educational videos for the newly formed community.  This is the first phase.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf the interest and income grows, I plan to use the patron\u2019s support to produce live solo performances, to grow to live performances with a band, to recordings and videos with the band.  I also have a vision for a few mobile apps and would like to create an internet based center for my performances and an educational series.  The educational component would include information for bassists, as well as all musicians.  And I currently imagine a curriculum taking a bassist from purchasing their first instrument, to a competent artist creating the music that they enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nREWARDS\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut wait!!  If you support this one bassist now, you\u2019ll get more than a warm feeling in heart.  As I continue down this path, I\u2019ll create a library of answered questions and direct education.  Patrons donating more will have access to that content.  There are also tiers that offer private lessons and even directly inspiring one of the performance videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTHAT\u2019S IT\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo that\u2019s it.  All you have to do, is to check out my videos.  If you like what I do, become my patron.  I need support, in order be able to continue creating.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to visit.\u003cbr\u003e"
