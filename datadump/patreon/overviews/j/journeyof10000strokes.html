    "summary": "A Journey of Ten Thousand Strokes is a video series designed to teach kanji (idiographic characters of Chinese origin used in the written Japanese language) in a thorough and methodical manner. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach video will showcase one kanji. The examination will include the composition (i.e. stroke order, graphic etymology etc.) meanings (specifically a comparison of the Heisig \"keyword\" against the meanings listed by Denshi Jisho) and phonetic readings (with examples for each standard On and Kun reading, using high frequency words or phases whenever possible).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first 2200 videos will cover kanji in the order they are listed in the 6th edition of \"Remembering the Kanji\" by James Heisig. \u00a0The reason for this is that Heisig orders the kanji based upon structural components, which facilitates teaching the writing and recognition of each kanji in such a way that minimizes the need for rote memorization. However, whereas the Heisig method centers upon artificial mnemonic constructions, I plan to focus on the context of the spoken Japanese language and Japanese culture to aid in learning and remembering the kanji.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is specifically a course in the kanji directed toward people who have at least a passing familiarity with or are already in the process of learning the Japanese language and, therefore, is not meant as a general course in learning to speak Japanese. \u00a0That being said, I welcome questions (about the Japanese language) from patrons and viewers, since I would like to address common points of confusion or curiosity, either where they might fit in the kanji videos or in supplemental (Patron Exclusive) videos. \u00a0Topics I am currently considering for Patron Exclusive videos include postpositional particles and preparation for the JLPT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven under optimal conditions, reaching my goal of creating at least 3000 videos in this series will take several years to complete. The financial backing of people like you is essential to providing the financial security to allow me to devote the significant amount of time in production that this project requires. \u00a0I have set up my reward levels to correspond to US bill denominations. \u00a0To potential patrons, I ask \"What is the largest bill whose absence you would be unlikely to notice if you misplaced it?\". \u00a0That amount is how much I humbly ask from you to do this work. \u00a0If even one dollar is more than you can spare, please share this pitch with others; it really does help."
