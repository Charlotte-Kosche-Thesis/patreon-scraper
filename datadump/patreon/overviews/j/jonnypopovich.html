    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ahoy folks! My name is Jonny Popovich and I\u0027m a painter and street artist. I started painting murals while traveling outside the U.S. and I love it and want to keep doing it. The connection with local communities, the scale, the traveling, the inspiration people find in public art, beautifying outdoor spaces, are all super gratifying. Now I want to go bigger, better, and with greater impact. I\u0027ve found that sufficient support for street art can be unreliable, so I think Patreon is perfect. What I want to be able to do is paint any wall I choose (given permission), without depending on a single individual or employer for all the costs or supplies. I\u0027ve approached building owners who are interested in having my artwork but are unwilling or unable to pay me, or had people approach me asking to paint a wall somewhere but have no budget for it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Even highly accomplished street artists can still be stifled.\u00a0An article in the New York Times profiling Greek street artist\u003ca href=\"http://ino.net/\"\u003e Ino\u003c/a\u003e described how \"even when a piece is commissioned, it is hard for an up and coming artist to make any profit. Clients can be happy to pay for paints, but they don\u0027t always include a fee for the artist\u2019s work. Despite being a famous artist, Ino had paid for the piece himself, a cost that exceeded $1500.\"          If there\u0027s a wall I want to paint, and I have permission to paint it, but nobody can pay me, I want to be able to do it anyway, renting a lift for $600 per week to reach 25 feet, and $400 worth of supplies to complete the project, for example. It probably won\u0027t happen overnight, but lots of other artists on here are totally doing it, and patrons like you will help me get there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your involvement through Patreon can help me paint more murals, in more places, with more creativity, freedom, and collaboration. I think it is simply smart, and perhaps even neglectful to not use it. It\u0027s also a way to forge a new community (aka you guys) and create more accountability for myself. Maybe patron could vote on imagery, or direct me toward certain causes, or come help me paint sometime (that\u0027d be cool!). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If I work in a smart way at this, and, of course, create things that people value, then it could be amazing if I eventually make a living, through Patreon, traveling and (and writing) and painting murals. Thank you for your interest and support!"
