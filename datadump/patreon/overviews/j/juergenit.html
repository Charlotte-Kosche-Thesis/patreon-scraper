    "summary": "Hi! We\u0027re two brothers making a podcast about the popular and relevant TV show, the Secret Life of the American Teenager. Sam has been a huge fan of the show for years and wanted to spread the gospel of Brenda Hampton far and wide, so we thought the best thing to do would be to make a podcast where we share our favorite moments from each episode. If you\u0027re a fellow fan of Secret Life and this all sounds good to you, great! Stop reading here, please!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi again! It\u0027s actually very bad and every week is agony. This podcast is killing us. I haven\u0027t seen my family in forty years. We made a deal with the devil for eternal youth and now we have to watch and discuss every episode of this putrid show. Don\u0027t think too much about the timeline of these events. The point is, we need your help. Hosting costs money, as does the therapy we both need because of the show. Anything you can give is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, dumb nonsense aside, that\u0027s pretty much where we\u0027re at. We\u0027re gonna do this damn podcast to the bitter end, and would be very grateful for anyone helping with the cost of hosting. Anything past that would just ease the significant mental and emotional burden this show is placing upon us. Thanks, and stay horny!\u003cbr\u003e"
