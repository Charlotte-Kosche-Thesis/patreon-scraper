    "summary": "If you have found your way here then you probably have a fair idea of what I do. I am an artist. Put another way, I am a person living with artism. I have known I had artism since I was a child, but it was only upon reaching \u0027adulthood\u0027 that I realised the implications. People with artism suffer in regular jobs. I have never been unemployed. Since the age of 17 I have been going to work, doing a good job, earning a salary. But by the age of 39 I realised that I could not continue to treat my Self this way. I was almost entirely dead on the inside. I had not drawn a picture for 7 years. I couldn\u0027t feel my heart.\u003cbr\u003eSo I jumped off a ledge into the unknown with only my artism to catch me. And it sort of has. I draw now. Sometimes for 18 hours a day. And my work gets an enormous amount of praise on \u00a0Twitter and Facebook. And occasionally I sell a piece. But mostly I am caught in a daily struggle to ensure that my art is not created at the expense of my children, which makes paying a framer impossible, which in turn makes mounting an exhibition impossible, which in turn makes selling more work even more difficult. So I am asking people to put a pound where their like button is, I\u0027m making my Facebook page private, I\u0027m not throwing my work around as if it was of no value anymore. Please consider my position, and whether you feel that my artwork is worth a pound a month, and if you do, sign up and be my patron. Thank you"
