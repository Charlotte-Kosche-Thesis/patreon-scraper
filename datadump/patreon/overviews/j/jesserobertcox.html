Scott of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.accursedfarms.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAccursed Farms\u003c/a\u003e. Ross would report on games which have shut down or will be shutting down; games which can never be played by anyone ever again because the online components required for the game to be functional are no longer active.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter YouTube announced changes to channel monetisation in January, 2018, Ross made the difficult decision to discontinue the Dead Game News channel and began to only report on the more interesting stories on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6KZTTnkE-s2XFJJmoTAkw\"\u003ehis main channel\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have begun to report on dead games myself on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCize2lbXPHBxcY1W4KBKHdw\"\u003emy own channel\u003c/a\u003e (under the new title \"Video-Game Executions\"), ensuring people are still being made aware of games being shut down after Ross stopped doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat about Chronolines?\u003c/h2\u003eChronolines is a series in which I take look into the chronological timeline of events that occur in a video-game franchise. Throughout the course of a franchise\u0027s lifespan, many games may be released, and several of them may take place before the events of a game released previously (typically in the form of a prequel), or even occasionally during the events of another game. It is my goal to sort out which order important events occur, and to deliver them to you in an informational synopsis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho am I?\u003c/h2\u003eI\u0027m Jesse Robert Cox (not THE Jesse Cox of the Co-optional Podcast), and I have been helping Ross with Dead Game News since mid-2016. You may have heard or seen my name mentioned in several of Ross\u0027s Dead Game News videos. I\u0027ve helped Ross by providing him with news on dead/dying games, creating and managing a spreadsheet\u00a0detailing dead games, their publishers, their shutdown dates, and other relevant information (\u003ca href=\"https://lilpea.github.io/\"\u003ewebsite based off of it here\u003c/a\u003e), and creating and managing the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/deadgamenews\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDead Game News Twitter profile\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that Ross will only be reporting on the more interesting stories related to dead games, I\u0027ve taken the job of reporting on dead games on my own channel, as well as produce other informational content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy patronise me?\u003c/h2\u003eBecoming a patron guarantees I continue to put out videos. If I earn enough money through Patreon, making videos could become a full-time job, and I would be able to have more time available to work on Video-Game Executions, as well as producing other videos of different topics. Whilst I will try my best to be able to report on dead games even if not a single person patronises me, the money really does help and will go directly to necessities like food, board, or ways to improve my channel."
