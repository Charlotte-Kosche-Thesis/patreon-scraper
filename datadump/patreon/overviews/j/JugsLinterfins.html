I create comedy gaming content on YouTube with my friends. With each video, our main goal is to make you laugh. YouTube has always been a very time consuming hobby. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t do most of the things that I want to do on the channel because of time and money. I have higher priorities, like college and work, but I would love to make this one of my top ones. You can help me make that change.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is a platform that offers a way for you to support your favorite content creators. In return, you get special perks set up by the creator (right) and help build towards overall milestones (left). You can choose to donate once, or every month. Remember that even $1 can really help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo what do you do exactly and why should I care? \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eCurrently, the JugsLinterfins channel is filled with gameplay videos that are released every other day. In the past, I\u0027ve done machinimas, live streams, and Halo vs. Mario. Those 3 things take up a lot more time than a normal recording session for a gameplay video. There are SO MANY other shows and videos that I want to do as well, but I just can\u0027t right now because of time. There are quite a few of us, but I do nearly everything for the most part. The others join me only for commentary, and that\u0027s all I really ask of them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow me to eventually make all of these different things. Having the channel be 99% gameplay makes it feel boring. Hitting certain milestones would allow me to add variety and make variety a regular thing. It would also help me increase the overall quality of everything you see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is the goal?\u003c/h3\u003eI want to be able to spend more time working on videos for you all. With that, I want it all to be at the highest quality that I can possibly make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to have JugsLinterfins generate a sustainable income to allow us to focus on doing videos daily and have multiple shows set up on a weekly/monthly schedule. The money would be going towards a few different things (see below).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo not feel that you HAVE to become a Patron. Taking the time to watch our videos, leave feedback, or share the videos with others means so much to me. I love hearing from you guys and I\u0027m glad I get to share some fun times doing a hobby that I love through another hobby that I love. Money is a pain in the butt as well as time, but you know what the goblins of Azeroth say: \"Time is money, friend!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is the money being used for?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEquipment:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0This includes better computer parts, microphones, recording/editing software, cameras, Patron-requested games, and various other things to improve quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePayment:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027d love to hire people to do animations of funny moments for the channel. I\u0027d also like to get people to help with channel art, website stuff, music, and much more. In order to do that, I\u0027d probably need to pay them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGames:\u003c/strong\u003e Most games start at $60 nowadays (which is debatable if you bring the DLC and Season Passes into the conversation). As a gaming channel, we kind of need these. I\u0027d also be able to get additional copies of multiplayer games for the other guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTravel:\u003c/strong\u003e None of the people I record with live anywhere near me. To get to the nearest one of them, it would take me about 23 hours by car (nonstop by the way, I know from experience). It would be great to get a chance to visit them more and do more videos while all in the same room!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEveryday Living:\u003c/strong\u003e This seems like a given. College uses up a lot of money, as you may know. A fair amount of this money would go towards me staying alive and with a home. Both of those things are kinda important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*If you don\u0027t want to do a one time donation through Patreon, you can also donate through Paypal. If you have questions about anything, a bunch of my contact info is on my website. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoals and tier rewards are all subject to change!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
