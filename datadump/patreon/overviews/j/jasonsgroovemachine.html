    "summary": "Oh hey, didn\u0027t see you there. My name is Jason. Hi.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may know me from the various video hosting sites I\u0027ve been on over the last decade or so here in this big ol\u0027 internet. I make videos you see.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make videos about video games, music, review, random blog stuff, and sometimes I even do a little video here and there to teach you how to do something.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to take a minute and tell you a little about myself and why I\u0027m here on Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I\u0027m a musician. Part time anyway, and when I go out to a gig there\u0027s never a cover charge but I always put out a tip jar. I don\u0027t really think that what I do should be exclusive to any specific group of people, but if someone likes it enough to wanna drop a buck or two into my tip jar, that is super awesome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is my digital tip jar. I don\u0027t charge access to any of the things I work on, but if you like what\u0027s happening, maybe you wanna support a buck or two each month to kinda help me out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a full time job, I teach music on the side, I perform, I\u0027m a bit of a handyman and after all of that I make the videos that I do here. I\u0027d love be able to do less of the other things and more of this. Let\u0027s be honest, you probably don\u0027t really get anything out of my 40 hour a week job, but maybe a 15 minute video about changing a battery in an NES cart is right up your alley.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is... this is the stuff I really love doing and would love to do more of it, but unfortunately that\u0027s just not possible right now. I hate not having fresh new content. Especially when it\u0027s because I\u0027ve put in 50-60 hours a week working somewhere other than here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not looking to replace any income with this, heck no. That doesn\u0027t even sound plausible for me. But I\u0027d like to maybe cut down 3-4 hours somewhere else and devote that time here instead.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t offer a ton in terms of rewards for support at the moment, but that\u0027s gonna change when things have picked up around here. I\u0027d eventually like to do some t-shirts, mugs, stickers... who knows what. The sky is, just about, the limit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for taking the time to check this page out and reading all of my jive here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere was a video that was going to go up but... as I said... time constraints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou stay classy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the way, have you lost weight?\u003cbr\u003e"
