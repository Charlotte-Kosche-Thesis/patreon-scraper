I make fast paced and entertaining build videos on my \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/jackmanworks\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e that are made for everyone, but with the ultimate goal to get the younger generations excited about making again. My educational background is in civil engineering through college but also woodworking and carpentry through a vocational high school. Very few people these days are lucky enough to have the hands-on learning experience that I had so I\u2019m trying to pay it forward by translating what I know into very easily digestible videos where people are entertained while they learn (whether they realize it or not) and often laugh at my own expense. Enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of the summer of 2016, woodworking and video production is my full time gig! Your support helps me keep the lights on in the shop and keep this thing dream growing and my questionable sense of humor flowing. I\u0027m not sure yet what the end goal is, but I\u0027m indebted to you for helping me and pushing me to get there. My wife is in the military, so with the change of stations my shop scenery is going to change for you every few years! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you ever have any feedback for me, feel free to share. As my patron you are first in line in my mind. Like the rewards I offer? Let me know! Hoping for access to different rewards? Let me know! Like my videos, this page is always evolving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m flattered just by the fact to you wandered over to my Patreon page. Thank you for watching and engaging in my content, that already means more to me than a hardwood pallet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace \u0026amp; Love \u003cbr\u003e-Paul Jackman\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(note: all Patreon rewards will be shipped/sent after 2 completed months of support)\u003cbr\u003e"
