    "summary": "Welcome! Thanks for checking out Jane Dope. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLaunching in winter 2017-18,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jane-dope.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJane-Dope.com\u003c/a\u003e is a culture and lifestyle website with daily content related to women, cannabis, and women who love cannabis. Jane Dope delivers high-quality, honest content ranging from current events in the cannabis industry and interviews with women breaking the \u201cgrass ceiling\u201d to personal essays on how cannabis impacts the lives of women around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore women are enjoying marijuana than ever before, and it\u2019s not just for teens hotboxing the bowling alley bathroom or hippies dancing around a fire at a festival. Some moms prefer a joint over a bottle of wine in the evening, some women prefer CBD oil over prescription painkillers, and some women just want to come home, order some Thai, pack a bowl and watch Roseanne reruns.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m saying is, women and weed are everywhere, and that\u2019s probably not going to change anytime soon because weed is great and maybe our world wouldn\u2019t be in such disarray if we all did a few bong rips, right? Cannabis is changing our society in a multitude of ways involving criminal and social justice, mental and physical health, business and entrepreneurship, and more. Let\u0027s talk about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we need money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs anyone who\u2019s ever worked in web publishing knows, it\u2019s not easy to create quality, consistent content on a regular basis without the help of sponsors, ad campaigns, or venture capitalists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron in these early stages, you\u2019ll help support the diverse voices I hope to highlight on Jane-Dope.com right from the beginning. (And if you\u0027re interested in becoming one of these voices,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v4Qyu_ZzVXRKYry_LSMpGVr1Vh7XybedUuwZ8odl7Q0/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efind out how to write for us here\u003c/a\u003e.) The website is content-based for now, so rather than invest thousands into a design, marketing, or merch, all of the initial funding will go toward creating quality, uncensored content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may experiment with discrete advertisements and affiliate links to help expand the scope of business. However, aside from the fact that depending on ads and affiliates for revenue can inadvertently lead to a decline in quality content and user experience, it\u2019s also challenging to find ad programs that want to work with a site that talks almost exclusively about weed. With all of those factors in mind, I\u0027d rather give the power to the people who are interested in supporting this project and the voices behind it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace, love, and bong rips,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMandy Jane\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Instagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/janedopeblog\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e @janedopeblog\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/janedopeblog\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e @janedopeblog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
