Even if you don\u0027t want to donate/back/sacrifice your hard earned cash, thanks for just giving it peeps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, my Patreon is here to support my life, through my content. If you don\u0027t know already, the majority of my content is created through Twitch, but I am trying to create more for YouTube, and other platforms too, so whereas Twitch Subs/Bits etc contribute towards content on that platform, Patreon supports my life and the content I can create as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I only have two tiers of contribution: JestFriend, and JestMate, both have Discord Access, Thank You\u0027s on Twitch \u0026amp; Patreon Exclusive Content, but JestMate also has the bonus of a Birthday \u0026amp; Xmas Card every year as well as priority on Character Names in videos games such as Darkest Dungeon \u0026amp; X-Com!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThirdly, my goals are set up in a way that may seem weird at first, but I like to be completely honest about where your contribution is going! Each of my goals cover 1-5 of my monthly outgoings, because idealistically, Patreon would be used to support my life and making Content Creation more and more of a primary focus in my life, the more I have coming in to cover those kind of costs, the less I\u0027ll need to rely on a \"real\" full-time job, and can switch my focus to more and more content creation as (hopefully) my income from it increases!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I hope you enjoy my content, and please never feel pressured to contribute financially, just knowing people are checking out my content at all is huge to me! The main places to find me are Twitch \u0026amp; YouTube, both of which are linked to on this page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJester \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
