We will share success methods of living an abundant life, having successful families, gaining self confidence, developing community and personal success through Orisa/Voodoo, in a non  proselytizing pushy way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdupe for joining our Juju Power family, we hope that these teachings in Juju serve you like they served us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy are we doing this?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand that people are searching for ways to face the challenges of this life and want to solve problems so they can create smooth roads for their individual, family and community success. People want to be successful at work, in love, with family, have good relations (aya dara dara), good health (ilera), feel powerful and live abundantly. \u00a0It\u0027s been our passion to help empower people through Orisa/Vudu and help preserve our culture for the good of all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s start with the name Orisa/Vudu, coined by the late HRH Oba Oseijiman Adefunmi Ikini, the visionary and illustrious founder of Oyotunji village iba\u0027ara t\u0027orun (South Carolina, USA). The name Orisa Vudu\u00a0 also reflects the journey of great Olorisa like Akoda Medahochi Kofi Zaanu Sangodele and Oluwo Chief Adenibi Ajamu who educated us both to Yoruba, Fon \u0026amp; Ewe traditions. \u00a0I felt that the name also worked for us and connects us to Voodoo as well as Ifa reflecting our multi ethnic African heritage. \u00a0Orisa/Vudu has helped us to grow as a people, raise families, create long standing businesses and institutions, and become more powerful and tranquil. It has helped us survive in the US, a country with one of the bleakest anti African histories and records of genocide against indigenous people. \u00a0With help from the inherent genius of Orisa Vudu \u0026amp; Mind Science we have been able to create our dreams safely, avoid calamity, and grow exponentially in character and intellectual and metaphysical capacity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site is another avenue for us to continue to share this bounty of Orisa/Vudu and Mind Science with people on an ever widening scale. \u00a0While it\u0027s our passion to share, Ifa and Yoruba culture teaches that you can\u0027t get something for nothing. \u00a0So this platform is an easy, reasonable and economical way for you to get access to these invaluable teachings that we learned the hard way through blood, sweat, tears and enthusiasm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\nyou want to make a donation to support this mission and ensure that this will\ncontinue, please click here:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations\u0026amp;business=akin1131%40bellsouth%2enet\u0026amp;lc=US\u0026amp;item_name=Ile%20Eko%20Asa%20Yoruba%20Ni%20New%20Orleans\u0026amp;currency_code=USD\u0026amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted\"\u003ehttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations\u0026amp;business=akin1131%40bellsouth%2enet\u0026amp;lc=US\u0026amp;item_name=Ile%20Eko%20Asa%20Yoruba%20Ni%20New%20Orleans\u00a4cy_code=USD\u0026amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
