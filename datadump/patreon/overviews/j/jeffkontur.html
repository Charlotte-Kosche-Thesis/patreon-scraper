    "summary": "In December 2017, I finally made the plunge and realized a long-held dream. I quit a very secure and well-paying job, piled my stuff into storage, put my house on the market, and set off on the adventure of a lifetime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far it has been rewarding... fun... eye-opening... and certainly educational.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve gotten to see the pyramids in Egypt and dance tango in Argentina. I have plenty more adventures planned. At each step of the way, I plan to document my experiences with photos, videos, written insights and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I quit my day job and the steady, reliable paycheck that comes with it, a little bit of each day is devoted to efforts toward building a new income. At times it is slow going though I am mostly in Third-World countries. That means I can live on a lot less.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, I just keep putting as much value as I can out into the world. If you find value in the stories I have to tell, the most important favor you can do me is to pass the word along to others. The next best thing is to help support my crazy adventure.\u00a0Even very tiny donations will go a very long way for me. Even a few pennies will be very gratefully received.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for caring. Thank you for stopping to check out this Patreon page. Most of all, thank you just for being you. \u003cbr\u003e"

Although my copywriting business was still in its infancy, I had faith in my ability to grow it from the road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I failed to count on was being robbed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only did I lose most of my possessions, but also my ability to earn money. My computer was my livelihood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaking a longer, more philosophical view of things, I believe I can still make it. What I need most is to buy myself some time while I recover from this setback.",
