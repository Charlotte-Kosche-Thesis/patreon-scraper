    "summary": "I want to offer a vision of the future that is unabashed in being grounded in the streets and accessible to ordinary people rather than the wealthy elite of Silicon Valley and and the Oxford-Cambridge union. I want to talk about how technology can improve and empower EVERYONE, not just the people who already have more than enough power already. And unlike other so-called \"progressive\" transhumanists, I\u0027m much more interested in talking about how technology could end violent repression and brutality, or poverty and hunger, than I am having ivory tower symposiums about the merits of augmenting dolphins or the esoteric rights of as yet non-existent entities while real people continue to suffer and languish every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a well-off techie who\u0027s only interested in living forever and to-hell-with everyone else, then I am NOT the futurist writer for you. If on the other hand, you want to see a vision of the future that is unapologetically universalist, collectivist, feminist, queer, motivated by love and justice and hell bent on offering a whole NEW vision of human existence rather than a tweeking around the edges for those who are already privileged and ascendant, then I am here to be your voice, and the horse you should be backing in this race to define our narrative, before it\u0027s too late."
