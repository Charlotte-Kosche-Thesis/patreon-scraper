Well, this description is here to explain it, so let\u0027s get into it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/L4Jk1MO.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no secret that making quality content in any media form is tough, time-consuming work. However making stuff for YouTube has and always will be my passion! However, with the amount of time I put into creating content like what you can see below, there are simply times where things like school and such can catch up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://my.mixtape.moe/kmunmp.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, despite that, that\u0027s not why I\u0027m making a Patreon page. Whether or not you guys support me on Patreon, I\u0027ll always love all you guys for simply just watching and enjoying my stuff! No matter how this goes, I\u0027ll always continue to make the best content I can, I just see Patreon as a way where I can make better, more consistent content, and even give you guys a whole bunch of rewards, with minimal money costed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027m just starting with Patreon, this is really going to be an experiment for both myself and you guys! If you\u0027re cool with the system of rewards, goals and such, then I\u0027ll be happy to keep Patreon as an ongoing thing, but if it\u0027s clear you guys wanna see things continue as they are now, no problem! I\u0027m happy going either way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VTbPg6n.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, aside from my ever-lasting grattitude, I\u0027ve put up a whole bunch of rewards that I feel are a fair justification for the asking price! Just one dollar is enough to get you a fairly large bulk of the rewards, such as the \"Patreon Supporter\" role on my Discord server, Your own personal credit in with every new video and even exclusive early access to my biggest projects! And all that is just for the $1 tier!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/34pwsZM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDEFINITELY NOT! \u003c/i\u003eAside from seeing videos at most a few days after supporters, absolutely no content I ever make will be restricted from you guys who decide not to support me on Patreon! You all being entertained by my content is so gratifying for me, and restricting anything from anyone would be the last thing I\u0027d ever want to do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gQfbSb0.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks a lot for taking the time to read through my Patreon page! Whether or not you decide to become a patron, I still love all you guys for watching my content, and please don\u0027t feel pressured to pledge anything! Only pledge if you really feel like you\u0027re able to, and it will cause no consequence! I\u0027d find it amazing if any of you decided to support me here, but I reason with you, \u003cem\u003eplease \u003c/em\u003edo not feel the need to pledge anything if you\u0027re not 100% financially able.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, excited to see how this all turns out! :P Even if this ends up being a dud, rest assured I\u0027m excited to get my next video out, and I hope you all enjoy everything I\u0027ve planned for the future!\u003cbr\u003e"
