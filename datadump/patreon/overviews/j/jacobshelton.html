You can read the stories for free on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/minorphrases/\"\u003einstagram\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eor the minor phrases\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.minorphrases.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u00a0website\u003c/a\u003e, whichever suits you. You probably already know that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I would love for a sweet angel baby mystery investor to send me free money that\u0027s probably not going to happen and it would be weird. I\u0027d rather make things, be they the shorts stories that you know, weird little poems, or short films. I\u0027m hoping this can be a way for you to support art that you enjoy while keeping me from feeling like a creep.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour contribution will go toward me buying new photos, paying for hosting, and creating some new projects that I haven\u0027t told anyone about because they cost money. I may even use the money to focus on making my stories better, even though you and I both know they\u0027re perfect as is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
