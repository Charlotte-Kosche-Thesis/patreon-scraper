The series stars Dragozin Hector (Hector Park) and his black opal Queen Dragon mount Karalti, and their quest to make their virtual reality world, Archemi, a better place. The books are heavily inspired by the golden age of Super Nintendo RPG games, such as Secret of Mana and Final Fantasy 1-7. I will be posting all chapters of the books here for my patrons.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy other projects include the LILIUM universe and the Hound of Eden urban fantasy series.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFeel free to browse my public posts, or read on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tEver since I was a kid, I\u0027ve written and drawn at the same time.
