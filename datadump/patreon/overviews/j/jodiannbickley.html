Thankfully, I didn\u0027t - down to a bizarre turn of events that I can only put down to some sort of magic. Instead, I turned outwards and went on social media and I asked if anyone needed reminding of how incredible they are and a girl called Natt did. And with that One Million Lovely Letters was born. I set up my website and an email address and overnight, 200 people contacted me. Since that day, I\u0027ve written over 4000 letters to people in need of lifting up all around the world. I now have a team of seven volunteers who help me to keep the project going, chipping away at the letter requests in my inbox which currently totals over 12,000.\u00a0 Each letter is somebody\u0027s worst day and it has been an absolute privilege getting to write to each person. The project has reminded me and many others of their strength and makes you realise that however dark that storm gets you are never, ever in it alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QXxglvEMUQc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e(My TEDx talk back in 2013)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I first started the project in 2013, I have written a book called \u0027One Million Lovely Letters\u0027, I have given a TEDx talk, \u0027Jodi\u0027s Lovely Letters\u0027 was a BBC documentary in July of last year and I ran an exhibition of letters at Centrala, Birmingham last July. When I first started the project I realised quite quickly that what I was doing didn\u0027t fit into any of the arts funding boxes after many failed attempts. I had to look elsewhere, which is when I found Kickstarter - kickstarter launched me off the ground and provided me with an office to do my work and the ability to expand the project so now I have eight volunteers and all the stationary they all need to get through the letter pile. Kickstarter helped me see that where the project started from wanting to help other people, people in turn wanted to help me with it back. I have never, ever asked for someone to pay for a letter, that was never what the project has been about so obviously money has been really tight. I was gifted stamps by the royal mail which meant I could breathe a little but nobody could of guessed what the project would turn into which is why now I am turning to Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting letters is my job, every day I open an inbox that is fill to the brim with peoples life stories and it\u0027s an absolute honour to be able to write to the people who have the courage to write into the project. On August 1st, I leave the country with my husband and two children to live around the world which is all explained here (\u003ca href=\"http://Backpacksandbabies.com\"\u003eBackpacks and Babies\u003c/a\u003e). We both have jobs where we aren\u0027t required to be in an office every morning, he works remotely as a Software Engineer and I write my letters and books so we thought, why not show the girls around a little bit! As a Patreon, I will be posting pieces of our adventures exclusively here to let you be part of our adventure too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur lives our changing, but one thing that won\u0027t be - is my letters,\u00a0Having a monthly Patreon wage would give me breathing space to be able to write my letters and deal with all of the admin that running a worldwide project entails as well as organising my volunteers and recruiting more! For the last five years, my letters have brought me and so many others happiness and I would love if I could carry on the project until I was 110. In return I will fill your inboxes with loveliness and keep you up to date with all of the adventures, I really hope you like what I do and consider contributing to my project! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nfwka9N7m0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(A video I did as part of my exhibition last April, it\u0027s a letter to my 16 year old self)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
