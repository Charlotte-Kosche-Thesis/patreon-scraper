    "summary": "Hi, all, and welcome to Jeremy C. Schofield\u0027s Patreon page. Thanks for considering being a part of what I am doing as a creator of fiction and a blogger as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little background: once upon a time I was a musician and a database developer. In my 30s, life took a dramatic (and unexpected) left turn into adult-onset epilepsy. This was followed quickly by drug-related obesity and clinical depression. For a very long time, I wasn\u0027t \u00a0sure there was a reason to stick around to see what other bad news life had in store for me tomorrow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe good news is, I have spent the years since then learning to build a life around my weaknesses. The better news is, in losing everything else, I discovered a new passion - writing. I create fiction, help\u00a0those with disabilities, and educate those who want to understand what life with a disability is like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays, I update my blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jeremycschofield.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMisdirected\u003c/a\u003e once a week, talking about life with epilepsy after bariatric surgery. I also spend my time writing novels, blog posts, and contract writing for some additional funds (SSDI doesn\u0027t pay much.) And this is where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first novel, Inheritance, was published on September 1, 2017. It simply would not have been possible without the support of my Patrons - thanks to each and every one of you! My blog,\u00a0Misdirected, already has over 200+ regular readers a month. I would love to be able to expand that number exponentially, in order to talk to even more people about the fact that life does not have to end due to an adult-onset disability of any kind. In order to do that, however, I need some assistance. Every dollar put in via Patreon represents time\u00a0spent creating my own content. That time represents new fiction, new blog posts, and communication via avenues that I simply do not have time to explore at present. Turning writing into a full-time endeavor represents my ultimate goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by, and thank you for helping out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Jeremy\u003cbr\u003e"
