I embrace my ancestors; the Celtic Druids and apply their wisdom which is simply loving nature to see the patterns, the micro within the macro, and creating from the most tested system of all; Nature.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve committed the rest of my life to my highest good; creating solutions synergistic with Nature to create shelter, food, clean water, artists, scientists, community, inventions, and ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere is power in ideas, the spoken word, and the will to manifest something greater than ourselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to see this patreon account be the start and end of my journey to become an inventor, repay the woman that gave me her entire being through trials no one should have to endure with a home, and to build scalable ecopreneurships that can be used everywhere to bring healing and wholeness in a world hurting and broken far longer than we came into it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA new age is here where truth travels faster than lies, where ignorance is a choice, and the crimes of the past will come to the light. \u003cbr\u003eWe have everything we need to protect the planet and begin exploring the stars, the only question that remains is will we do what is needed?\u003cbr\u003eI am and I will, your support will give me the tools to build for the first time in my life and each step forward will bring more momentum and greater positive change rippling out forever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom my entire being; thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs above, so below.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eJameson Arthur Dargen"

     "about": "I was born and raised in Fargo, North Dakota by an amazing woman with a heart and work ethic I can only compare to the mentors and heroes I\u0027ve found through books. I\u0027ve always had a diverse amount of interests fueled by curiosity and it has proved to be my best strength despite being difficult to fully utilize in the current American system but perfect during my time at Oceti Sakowin/Oyate, Standing Rock. I remained there from November 16th to February 23rd, unintentionally becoming the last person arrested after climbing on top of the construction rooftop. It was also during this last year realized I came from a lineage of helpers; nurses, pharmacists, and missionaries of Caracas, Venezuela as well as Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota, and I found my spirituality inwardly and outwardly for the first time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went to the prayer camp with a very heavy heart after guiding my father on his path though lung cancer for 9 months and originally intended to only drop off supplies and help for a couple days then be with family in Florida. Instead I had found a true home among the most diverse community the human race had ever seen as hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life and every corner of the world came together with over 600 flags being flown with one vision; \u003cbr\u003eprotect the water. Being able to wake up each day and help someone, anyone, brought a source of healing I wouldn\u0027t have found anywhere else. It was a hard winter but I had grown up in it, living in a constant surveillance state with daily false claims of raids or unknown claims of infiltrators kept people on edge, and I focused on seeing things from a calm perspective regardless of what was going on around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally focused on construction work the first couple weeks there but then saw the opportunity to learn from experts of really any vocation directly and the idea arose that if I did so then I could bring that to future communities. I began working to assist the medical teams during times of crisis, had a brief stint at security to get a donation thief banned, gathered and organized deserted gear in frozen tents, dug moats to control flooding, built wind powered sump pumps, kept the Oceti Oyate sacred fire, built yurts/tipis/wigwams/lean-to\u0027s, participated in community meetings, prayed at the front lines, and then each night came back to the warm kitchens with some of the most amazing people I\u0027ve ever met. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCalling this place a dream is the closest I can do to give it justice and I hope to see the best parts of Standing Rock resurface in Water Protector camps as well as self sufficient communities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seek to use creative and scalable solutions to alleviate suffering by focusing on our basic needs; food, water, shelter, truth, compassion, and health through a number of projects.\u00a0These projects include\u00a0but are not limited to; \u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreating modular shelters from recyclables\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGifting smartphones with pdf\u0027s/books/articles to connect and empower in the 21st century\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSelf contained organic smart farms with funds allocated from its inception to help a cause in need\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProviding affordable solar systems to the masses, equip and unite the next generation of truth tellers/journalists\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreating a platform for artists to become full-time activists through their work, protecting natural resources,\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePromote unity among the indigenous across the world\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHosting a weekly technology show with Renegade Media\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWriting a blog/doing a vlog on current projects on Patreon\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work as a rickshaw driver to make ends meet but these projects are where my heart and mind are at. While some may view the idea of a full time activist as something to scoff at I believe it to be of the utmost priority to protect the planet as well as maintaining if not improving the quality of life of the next generations while promoting innovation and inspiration at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThrough these experiences I\u0027ve found myself connected to like minded artists, video editors, web designers, solar technicians, builders, permaculturists, and so much more waiting for the opportunity to bring positive change. \u003cbr\u003eTo connect them is to amplify them and that is where I believe I can best serve when the opportunity comes or is created as I save up after losing everything this year on a few occasions. \u003cbr\u003eThank you for hearing my story, I hope you\u0027ll be a part of the upcoming chapters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJameson Dargen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
