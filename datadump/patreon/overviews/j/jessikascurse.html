    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/logo.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eJessika\u2019s Curse is a hand-painted RPG experience currently development. It will feature deep turn-based combat, erotic Battle-Lust animations and good dose of geeky humor.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe consider Jessika\u2019s Curse to be a rare undertaking. The team behind this Patreon wants to do something Western adult game devs rarely see a need for: to create a game that is excellently designed and passionately brought to life. We want the game to be fun yet challenging, be filled with pervy scenes, and do it while looking great!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/combat_design.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbove -\u003c/strong\u003e our current interface for combat. Things are still developing but it should give you a good idea about our direction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT JESSIKA\u0027S CURSE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/lareina.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\nThe core of Jessika\u2019s Curse will be turn-based combat that marries classic Jrpg concepts with elements from more recent inspirations such as Darkest Dungeon. All characters in the game and all their moves and Battle-Lust interactions will be animated by hand in Spine: 2D, and the tests we\u2019ve done so far promise that the game is going to look very sweet. In Jessika\u2019s Curse you move horizontally like an old-skool sidescroller, but like some of the modern interactions of such games we will feature portals that allow you to travel up and down. This opens up 4-way exploration and subsequently enables the dungeon crawling feel we are big fans of. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe backgrounds themselves will feature a ton of thematic assets that allow us to make each section feel unique without breaking our backs (not to mention our budget). Different fore, mid and background elements can be placed by the level designer to create unique sections that have the same theme but are never repetitive. We then bring these sections to life via parallax scrolling and background effects like lightning and rain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCombat and Battle-Lust\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want success in combat to require a good dose of preparation and smart configuration, but will also design it to allow personal preference and playstyle to thrive. Each character in your party can equip a limited amount of skills from her pool, and it\u2019s up to you to figure out what combinations get the job done. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/goblin.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\nIn battle your girls will have the typical lifebar you need to keep healthy for them to stay alive, but there is also a second variable that is pivotal to your success - Lust. The world of Jessika\u2019s Curse is a sexy and seductive place, and many attacks don\u2019t assault your party\u2019s health but target their lust instead. If a girl\u2019s Lust becomes too high there is a good chance your commands will be ignored in favor of less constructive things (those boobs aren\u2019t going to squeeze themselves...). The times when this happens it will be done via lavish hand-crafted animations.  When Lust gets to maximum levels enemies will use a special Lust cinematic to knock the girl out in fitting H-game style.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/ogre.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBack to town\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eMost levels will be too hard for a single playthrough, your girls simply can\u2019t resist temptation that long. To succeed you\u2019ll have to make it to a save point, and decide if you want to risk going on or if you want to travel back to town to rest and restock. Both options have their perks, but also their downsides.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve implemented this system for a variety of reasons. Most games with battle-sex elements require you to lose to get to the fun bits. This makes sense from a storytelling perspective - in a moment of weakness your enemies seize their chance - but not from a game-design one. Our game is designed to be challenging to the point that Lust animations are bound to happen, even if you are doing well and everything is going to plan. That means that losing, when it occurs, isn\u2019t something you have a weird love-hate relationship with - it\u2019s a natural part of the game that comes with a very sweet positive!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOn the topic of enemies\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEpic enemies are always a desirable thing in games, but in an erotic game they bring a certain something extra to the game. While we\u2019re not too deep into enemy design yet, the two-headed giant on the left shows what we intend to do if we reach the support level that allows us to animate bosses and sub-bosses with Battle-Lust animations. The bigger and nastier they are\u2026 well, I think you guys get what I\u2019m hinting at.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT JESSIKA\u0027S CURSE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe world of Jessika\u2019s Curse is shaped by its manipulative and twisted Deities. No one seems to be able to agree as to how many of these unique Deities there are (\u201cThe Red King is just another aspect of the Lord of Murder!\u201d), but one thing is certain - they consider mortals little more than amusing pieces on a game board.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/bridge.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbove -\u003c/strong\u003e The backdrop for the game\u0027s opening scene. You can view the animated version \u003ca href=\"https://gfycat.com/CapitalAmusingBadger\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe presence of these mischievous, and often downright wicked, chaotic elder forces has shaped the world of Avernia in a variety of ways. The Order of the Rose is a do-good sisterhood of those devoted to Lady Evangelindra, the sacred virgin. Little do they know this sacred virgin is none other than the seductive Goddess of Lust and Pleasure - Lustranae. The proud men of the First Watch, protectors of the land and virtue itself, are the unknowing puppets of the cruel Lord of Defilement. And then there are the bandit clans that believe they take from the rich and give back to the poor, but in the end only feed the Deity that hold sway over them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe world of Avernia is filled with many Gods and ideas, but when one pulls the veil of deception back only one thing remains - Chaos!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the world look like\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt first glance Averina will look like your average High Fantasy world. We\u2019ve got your typical Humans and Elves, greenskin races like Orcs and Goblins, and epic near-extinct species like dragons. This is by design since it allows our type of setting to shine. Once you start delving deeper into the the history of the world and the characters you find that temptation and corruption are everywhere; every noble idea holds an undignified and heavily corrupted version of itself in place. The taint of Chaos is everywhere.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/concept.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019re still very much figuring out how we want to depict the game world visually. We already know we are inspired by freaky hentai and darker games like Kingdom Death: Monster. Part of where we go will be up to you guys; how much does the taint of chaos and corruption entice you? Do we want to explore a brothel that turns out to be a den of men-devouring Succubi? The benefit of crowdfunding is that a game can adapt and grow in an organic co-creative fashion. We\u2019re full of ideas, but we\u2019re also listening.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe adventurers\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIn an erotic game the playable party has to be more than intriguing or interesting from a combat-perspective. Anyone that has played some H-games knows what is going to happen to these characters in time, and we designed the cast with just that in mind. There\u2019s something to cater to everyone\u2019s needs (not to mention the eclectic enemies we have in store for you)!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/jess_profile.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/amalia_profile.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/mouse_profile.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hype-creations.com/jess/melaina_profile.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM US\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy now you\u2019ve gathered that the production values we are aiming for are fairly high. We want a game that looks and feels good despite being erotic, and we\u2019ve spent quite a bit of our own cash to demonstrate the concept. Right now we need support however; churning out hand-painted art, turning those pieces into animated assets and coding the framework is an expensive combination. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo yes, we\u2019re going to ask you pledge without an actual early demo or test build. But we\u2019re not going to ask you to do it without painting you a picture of our approach.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/419208345711542273/440824388095574017/planning_milestone_3_crossed.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSTRETCH GOALS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMany crowdfunding games on Kickstarter have unlockable goals, and while the funding model on Patreon is vastly different we wish to do something similar.
