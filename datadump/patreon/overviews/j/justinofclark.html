Or not. I don\u0027t know your life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPoint being, I write about games. A lot. Mostly, as a reviewer i.e. one of those people you yell at when CrotchShooty IV: Revelations gets a 5/10.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://opencritic.com/critic/1331/justin-clark\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSee for yourself.\u003c/a\u003e Good stuff.

More than just editorials, but full fledged long form reviews for stuff I haven\u0027t been tapped for by an outlet, franchise retrospectives, research pieces going behind the scenes of games, personal pieces about being black in what\u0027s not always the most diverse field on the planet, maybe even streaming old titles for shits and giggles. Anything that strikes my fancy about games that doesn\u0027t fit in the category of bigger websites. Thus, Welcome To Class Real. A blog I intend to make as a repository for my objectively damn fine games writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\tYou know that old guidance counselor cliche about finding a job you love so much you\u0027d do it for free? That\u0027s been me the last 15 years with writing. I love what I do and have gotten to do, and have gone to pretty extraordinary lengths to keep doing it. Including doing it as my second/third/fourth job to make ends meet. Recently, job #1, which keeps me knee deep in roofs over my head, has become enough of a strain that staying there will have some serious effects on my mental and physical well-being. The goal has always been to be writing about games 24/7. Now, it\u0027s less of a dream than an imperative. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO, WAIT, WHAT YOU\u0027RE SAYING IS, GAME JOURNALISTS AREN\u0027T RICH AS FUCK AND STRUGGLE TO EAT JUST LIKE NORMIES?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI KNOW RIGHT I\u0027M JUST AS HORRIFIED AS YOU ARE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY ENTIRE WORLDVIEW IS SHATTERED HOW DO I FIX IT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHelping to support good writing wherever you see it is a start, for behind every great online writer is the menial-ass day job keeping them alive. Coincidentally, I am also a good writer, who will, for a start, be writing whatever comes to my enormous head a few times a week. Should anyone who passes through my site and digs what they see drops a few bucks on it every month, not only does the writing get to happen more often, but I\u0027ll be able to do so much more with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLIKE WHAT EXACTLY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nWell, like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRetry:\u003c/em\u003e High profile titles due for reappraisal\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMatchmaking:\u003c/em\u003e Recommendations for games or other media to pair with a recently released title\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eDebug:\u003c/em\u003e Interviews and articles with creators on their work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eBranching Paths:\u003c/em\u003e Deviations from the expected for developers/series\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAchievement Unlocked: \u003c/em\u003eThe games that broke new ground, for good or ill\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eStage Select:\u003c/em\u003e The great stages/moments of gaming, examined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLatency\u003c/em\u003e: Tackling a well-received game Ive never played for the first time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eCritical Damage:\u003c/em\u003e Examining the high profile failures of years past\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eRandom Select:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0New reviews of older games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eNow Loading\u003c/em\u003e: \u00a0Occasional bits and blurbs about\u00a0a recent game\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWHAT DO I GET OUT OF IT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFor one thing, no ads. The only things running this place will be Patreon and my own overinflated sense of self-importance.  Past that, though, all the other special goods are in the sidebar. But really, I\u0027m of the mind that damn good games writing will be the reward, especially the kind I\u0027d like to make. What may be a few times a month can turn into a \"whenever I damn well feel like it\" endeavor."
