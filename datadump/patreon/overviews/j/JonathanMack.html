    "summary": "Most people seek a life of comfort and security -- then try to find some time to make their art. By choice and by necessity, I\u2019ve had to do it differently. As a wanderer with no permanent home and few possessions, I read and write for hours each day, while trying to live as simply and cheaply as I possibly can, mostly in India and Mexico. I\u2019ve kind of made an art of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo my delight, it appears that this unlikely life is starting to bear fruit. I was a 2016 Lambda Fellow in Fiction; my story \u201cThe Right Way to be Crippled and Naked\u201d is the title story of an anthology of fiction about disability; other stories are popping up in places like Denver Quarterly and QAE. Thanks to the support of Patreon, which has enabled me to have a simple, safe, quiet room of my own, I\u0027ve at long last been able to create a manuscript of stories, a long essay about running away, and a novella.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy choosing to support my work, you are helping me in the most basic ways: with food, shelter and freedom from fear. I am doing all I can to read and write and look as deeply as I can. I think I\u2019m getting close. Please help me to keep going. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRespectfully,\u003cbr\u003eJonathan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. I assume that most people visiting this page know me either from my travels, from Facebook, or from my blog \"Guttersnipe Das\". Although I may still share snippets of work on FB or the blog, most of my work will now appear first here at Patreon. The first project I seek to complete is a long essay, \"Running Away Cannot Be Praised Enough: A compendium of everything I know about running away\", followed by a full, revised version of my peculiar novella \"Artifact Panel, or, About the Angel\", which I shared at the 2016 Lambda Retreat for Emerging LGBTQ Writers. For a more comprehensive description of my work and goals, please click on the post, \"What I\u0027ve Done, What I Do, What I Aim To Do\". Questions are very welcome. Just send a message. Thanks again."
