There were criticisms, but they were all wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fastest way to go up in this business is believe whole-heartedly that everybody is a moron except for you, and I knew that already. I have a degree now.\u00a0Anyone who doesn\u0027t have at least a degree is the scum of the earth and should be beheaded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should be done publicly on one of YouTube\u0027s LA stages, one after another.\u00a0I know I\u0027m just in the gate, but you can close it now. Fuck the rest of them, they had their chance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d be spitting on them through the gate for taking that one semester off to see the world and constantly Instagram their food instead of dedicating their time to the wonderful and intoxicating system of education, where it belongs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am one of the glorious master race of university graduates; tall, muscular -- leg day certainly wasn\u0027t skipped -- bronzed skin slightly glazed with sweat and oil, and long, luxurious manes of blonde, perfect hair, flipping around as we mate with equally immaculate female specimens, degrees in hand, and produce offspring that will pave the way forward to interplanetary colonization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone without degrees will be left on Earth.\u00a0Rather than finance destroying the planet, we\u0027ll simply leave the dead weight to die.\u00a0None of them will have a clue what to do because they\u0027re all retarded.\u00a0Governments and economies would come to a grinding halt, and they\u0027d all run off into their houses, starve, beat off, shit their pants and die.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the way forward. Through the power of cinema, I will show you all the way. If you don\u0027t pledge anything for my sake, please do so for that of all the talented Hollywood filmmakers out there who will learn so much from viewing my quite literally flawless content, and may finally learn to build the tools they need to finally tap into their true potential as a direct result.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the deal -- if I don\u0027t get $600,000 by the end of the month, a bunch of guys from a crowd I shouldn\u0027t have got mixed up with are saying they\u0027re gonna break my legs. Let\u0027s leave it at that -- don\u0027t worry about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t be satisfied until I\u0027m getting paid a hundred million dollars to sit in my director\u0027s chair with a latte in a small, green box every day, shouting angrily at my actor to deliver his lines to the appropriate blinking LED.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to sound like a dick, but I think I might actually be the greatest human being who ever lived."

     "about": "I was born in Glasgow, Scotland. I moved to Canada when I was about four. Crawled all the way here, yeah. Floated on a glacier and took my first steps once I hit the Yukon. I grew up and remain in British Columbia to this day. It\u0027s alright. Bears everywhere, though. On the road, in the yard, under the sink. Can\u0027t get shy of them. You can try to run, but it\u0027s not easy in an incessant snow storm. Best thing you can do is keep your hockey stick on you and show them who\u0027s boss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople call me sarcastic. Yeah, I\u0027m sarcastic. That\u0027s me all over. You sure got me pinned down. Yeah.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI fucking hated school. I grew up with some real asshole teachers and a tsunami of jocks, many emotionally abusive and some physically, which boiled a black cauldron of hatred of the institution in me by the time I hit sixth grade and kept the hate bubbling hot throughout my post-secondary education, at times unfairly I admit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t think I really have a problem with authority, as people have said to me. I\u0027m perfectly willing to take sound orders, way less to think about than being in command. It\u0027s nice. There have been a few scenarios in which I was out of line, but what I really have a problem with is bullshit, and I\u0027ve been bombarded by it since as early as I can remember.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAuthority itself has sometimes taken bits of shrapnel from me unjustly, as it\u0027s so closely associated with bullshit. People enjoy abusing power, and I think that\u0027s always been one of Arby \u0027n\u0027 the Chief\u0027s central themes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what the uniform, label or privilege, there\u0027s a human being under it who\u0027s behaviour and actions are susceptible to base drives and emotional imbalance, and everybody\u0027s fighting their own battle in life. I like exposing that fact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never been a problem to deal with, though. Disputes that I\u0027ve had have mostly ended with affable, light-hearted discussion, and I\u0027ve always been open to reason. I\u0027m an angry guy, but I put a cap on it. I\u0027m typically quite good at hiding it. I probably come off as an asshole sometimes, but every day I wake up I tell myself not to be. I unleash my rage through writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a reserved, straight-edge kid in school who\u0027d always avoid being rude or provoking a fight, hoping it would eventually stop me being pushed around and fat-shamed, but it didn\u0027t work.\u00a0I was also graded exceedingly well at creative writing, grammar and spelling at an early age -- not that the bullies gave a fuck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI felt frightened almost every day. The constant emotional pressure sharply increased my empathy and sensitivity to the feelings of others, while at the same time making me more and more bitter until I\u0027d become the tragic abyss of cynicism I am today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always spent a lot of time in school day-dreaming, painting pictures in my head because I was so ludicrously bored. I was a rabid Calvin and Hobbes fan, so -- pretty much that. Raptors in the staff room, etc. I quickly stopped caring about grades, though I remained a B-average student for the sake of my family\u0027s pride. Not for me. I always considered grades simply as a rating of my interest level. Got a \u0027D\u0027 -- so what? Just means either I didn\u0027t care enough or didn\u0027t like the teacher, in which case it\u0027s their fault for not being cool. Sounds arrogant as fuck, but it still puts a smile on my face.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn intermediate school, my teacher pulled my bloated binder out from my cubby hole during class, walked to the front of the room and asked me if it was properly organized. I weakly responded \"Yeah,\" knowing there were more than a few loose papers stuffed between the couple that were actually on rings. Can\u0027t remember how the exchange went down word for word, but he said something along the lines of \"Oh, really?,\" then proceeded to zip open my binder, pick out each loose paper and toss them onto the floor one by one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat my inner hell-raiser wants to have done is cross my feet up on my desk, sit back and tell him to pick up my papers, since he was the one who decided to throw them onto the ground. Seems fair. What did I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI scrambled onto the floor, picking up my papers one after another on all fours at the instructor\u0027s feet in painful, embarrassed silence. Most of the kids stayed quiet, a few chuckles. I was also overweight from a plentiful diet of chocolate chip cookies, and the crack of my ass was probably showing. Great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo this day, it bothers me that I didn\u0027t stand my ground in that scenario. From that day onward, I decided to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t name names, I\u0027m not out to tarnish any reputations; but if that instructor happens to be reading this: Eat shit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started realizing that the line between childhood and adulthood is an idealistic mental construct and not a genuine transitional period. No matter what their age, people could be idiots undeserving of either authority or respect. From then I realized the importance of questioning authority.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also believe in non-violence, contrary to what my content may suggest. However, I understand violent, mischievous behaviour, and I like to write about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m convinced that it\u0027s the constant day-dreaming and the empathy from abuse that forged me into a writer and director. I\u0027m glad some good came of my painful experiences, but I still don\u0027t consider them justified. Just trying to make the best of this shit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say director, even though I can hardly call myself one, really. I know where to put a camera, that\u0027s about it. Real directing for real movies involves many critical people and problem-solving skills which I don\u0027t necessarily possess, but I\u0027ve been working on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I graduated high school, I made a stupid video with the Halo 2 Master Chief figurine and the Microsoft Sam text-to-speech synthesizer from early versions of Windows, making the figure bob around and call people retarded and gay online on the Halo 3 multiplayer beta release, intended to satirize the hostility of the gaming community at the time. The video went -- and I hate this word -- viral.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was then contacted by at-the-time small entertainment network Machinima, offering me a contract under which I\u0027d get paid for continuing to make game-related videos. I accepted, I was stoked. I was working retail in the electronics department of a supermarket at the time, and while I loved the people I was working with and sometimes got to talk to customers about video games, I couldn\u0027t turn down the opportunity to get paid doing what I loved most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI launched Arby \u0027n\u0027 the Chief in 2008, and throughout the early seasons I was getting a ton of views. It was pretty exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the time production had ended on the show\u0027s third season I retired as showrunner, feeling burned out. Machinima, eager to keep the series going due to the scale of its viewership, began a spin-off series with the suffix \"In L.A.,\" which was written and produced in-house and poorly received. I assisted in writing for the string of episodes\u0027 latter half at the company\u0027s request, but I consider it poor work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntent on restoring the show to its former glory, I took back the creative reigns as the showrunner and produced a fourth season, which was received positively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was also a major turning point for me in my story-telling skills -- something clicked for me while writing the episode Digital Fruitcakes. It\u0027s difficult to describe, but I suddenly had a much broader understanding of story structure, and became very familiar with the concepts of set-ups and pay-offs. I knew where to put them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fifth season was another major turning point in my story-telling abilities, but at the cost of polarizing the audience with a sudden, drastic shift in format and emotional tone. One half appreciated the new emphasis on character development, season-wide arcs, flash-forwards and numerous dramatic moments, and the other felt that the show jumped the shark from its classic antics, cursing and trolling between just the two toys and sometimes the odd guy on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeason six followed roughly the same structure as season five sans a flash-forward to the finale in the premiere episode, but with a bit more effort put into meshing the show\u0027s early comedic style seamlessly with the dramatic narrative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show took a bleak turn in season seven, featuring an ending that polarized the already relatively small audience again. However, I still did my best to make it funny when I could and stand by it, considering it my best work to date in terms of theme, character development, cinematography and overall story structure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConvinced that I was done with the show for good and that I had done my best to give it a jarring but satisfying end, I attempted to launch a new show for air on the Machinima network -- a twisted, satirical video game review show called Chemotheraplay, starring myself bashing beloved video games, claiming to be the cure for \"the cancer killing gaming\" while embodying it. You can check it out on my creations page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a troubled negotiation, the pilot was purchased, but not aired. Additional episodes weren\u0027t ordered. I left the company soon after, following a dispute I won\u0027t go into detail about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve now just completed a four year film production program, and now that I know how much making real movies sucks and how loved Arby \u0027n\u0027 the Chief is, producing an eighth and final season through the exciting revolution of crowd-funding with full creative control sounds like a swell idea to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if I\u0027m gonna do it, I need a bit of help. If I\u0027m going to expand, I need a lot of help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I don\u0027t want to hold my content hostage. I just strongly urge you to donate whatever you feel my content is worth to you. If that\u0027s zero, so be it. I\u0027m well aware that I won\u0027t make everybody happy through what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you decide, I hope you enjoy what I put out.\u003cbr\u003e",
