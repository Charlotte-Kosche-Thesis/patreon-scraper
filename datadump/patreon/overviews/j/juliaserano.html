    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eTHE SHORT \u0026amp; SWEET VERSION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write about gender \u0026amp; sexuality, social norms \u0026amp; assumptions, feminism, queer \u0026amp; transgender issues, and activism more generally. Over the last few years, I\u0027ve been making many of my writings on these topics freely and publicly available by posting them on either Medium or my personal blog. So if you like what I write and want to see even more, then please support me by becoming a patron! If you do, in addition to my gratitude, you will receive sneak-peaks of my in-progress and/or unpublished essays, stories, \u0026amp; books!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE MORE HEAVILY DETAILED \"LONG-READ\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an author, I am best known for my books\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.juliaserano.com/whippinggirl.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhipping Girl\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.juliaserano.com/excluded.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eExcluded\u003c/a\u003e, although I also regularly write stand-alone\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.juliaserano.com/writings.html#articles\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003earticles and essays\u003c/a\u003e. Occasionally my writings will appear in mainstream media outlets, although that format isn\u0027t especially well-suited for me, as they tend to only publish queer and transgender \"101\"-type articles, whereas I prefer sinking my teeth into \"201\" and \"301\"-level topics. Also, I like to write more lengthy, thoughtful, and nuanced pieces, whereas Internet-driven media is more geared towards quick responses and cut-and-dried opinions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor these reasons, I publish almost all of my essays on either\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://juliaserano.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e or on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@juliaserano/latest\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e (both of which are free and without ads). I am also working on several book projects at various stages of (in)completion, but they usually take years to bring to fruition. Occasionally, I\u0027ll receive a royalty check for my previous books, which is always nice, but they don\u0027t generate anywhere near enough income for me to make ends meet (as I\u0027m more of a niche author rather than a \"bestseller\").\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you appreciate the work that I do, I am hoping that you\u0027ll support me by becoming a patron! Your patronage will help allow me to focus on writing the types of essays and books that I want to write, rather than what mainstream media outlets and publishers are willing to pay me for. I will thank you by giving you exclusive sneak-peeks into what I am working on, excerpts of unreleased or soon-to-be published material, plus other goodies! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you know up front what your dollars will be helping to fund, my writing output tends to fall into one of two general categories these days:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNon-fiction\u003c/strong\u003e: If you are already familiar with my books and essays, then you will be helping me create even more work along these lines! I am not especially prolific: rather than write up my immediate reactions to personal and/or current events, I like to sit with my thoughts for a while, and try to figure out what is being overlooked, or what could be said better or framed differently. Sometimes I post a couple essays per month, other times once every couple of months, depending on the circumstances. Recent examples of this kind of work include:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@juliaserano/how-to-write-a-political-correctness-run-amok-article-9b828d443018\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHow to Write a \u201cPolitical Correctness Run Amok\u201d Article\u003c/a\u003e;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@juliaserano/detransition-desistance-and-disinformation-a-guide-for-understanding-transgender-children-993b7342946e\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDetransition, Desistance, and Disinformation: A Guide for Understanding Transgender Children Debates\u003c/a\u003e;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@juliaserano/free-speech-and-the-paradox-of-tolerance-e0547aefe538\"\u003eFree Speech and the Paradox of Tolerance\u003c/a\u003e;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@juliaserano/debunking-trans-women-are-not-women-arguments-85fd5ab0e19c\"\u003eDebunking \"Trans Women Are Not Women\" Arguments\u003c/a\u003e; and the many pieces collected in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://juliaserano.blogspot.com/2016/07/activism-language-and-differences-of.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eActivism, Language, and Differences of Opinion (a compilation of essays)\u003c/a\u003e or my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.juliaserano.com/TSetiology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTrans Psychology\u003c/a\u003e webpage.

I am nearing completion of the Kat Cataclysm debut novel \u003cem\u003e99 Erics\u003c/em\u003e - you can watch/listen to excerpts from two chapters from the book: \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/143753148\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePosers\u003c/a\u003e\u201d and \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDbuoevFJbE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePoetry Slammed\u003c/a\u003e\u201d - I have made a few other book chapters available here for Patreon subscribers only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a bonus, I sometimes create\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.juliaserano.com/music.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003enoise-pop music\u003c/a\u003e - I will make some of my songs freely available here as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor those new to Patreon, here\u0027s a brief explanation\u003c/strong\u003e: This is different from sites like Kickstarter \u0026amp; Indiegogo (where you make a one-time donation to a specific project). Here, you would be agreeing to make a smaller recurring monthly pledge to help sustain my art/writings/work more generally. Just pick the amount you want to pledge each month, enter your payment information, and that\u0027s it! You will then have access to some or all\u00a0of the patron-only posts on this site, which will include lots of free, in-progress and/or unreleased writings and material.
