This project is about bringing back music that has been often passed over. Beautiful, rare works from composers we know well like Bellini and Wagner, to lesser known composers, such as Paderewski and Pacini. Many times this music isn\u0027t able to be staged due to problematic plot-lines, complicated casting, or sometimes it has just been over-looked! I wish to bring this music out to the forefront and encourage music-lovers to seek out new horizons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an operatic soprano, I am lucky that my career has already afforded me the opportunity to sing some of my favorite roles- from Verdi\u0027s La traviata to Mozart\u0027s heroines such as Fiordiligi, Pamina, and Donna Anna- on wonderful stages all over the world, from Mazatlan, Mexico, to Warsaw, Poland, to Naples, Florida! I have been lucky to have won numerous awards and competitions, including The Jenny Lind Competition, The Marcella Sembrich Competition, The Connecticut Concert Opera Competition, CareerBridges Foundation, and many others.\u00a0Please check out more about me at \u003ca href=\"http://www.juliaradosz.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.juliaradosz.com\u003c/a\u003e !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works . . .\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon works like a subscription, in which smaller sums ($1- $100) are donated per content-release. \u00a0So, whenever I \u00a0release a new recording (no more than once a month!) , I will receive your donation. \u003cbr\u003eTo get started, click on \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.whelon.com/images/PatronButton.png\"\u003e\u00a0 at the top left corner of my page.
