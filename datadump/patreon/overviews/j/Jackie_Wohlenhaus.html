    "summary": "Between Failures is a slice-of-life webcomic following the (somewhat under-motivated and decidedly sarcastic) staff of a chain store. The primary protagonist is Thomas Blackwell, but it cuts to follow many members of the staff. It\u2019s often compared to clerks. (It\u2019s actually a lot more like Empire Records, which the author totally suggests you see.) The main focus are the characters and the shenanigans they come up with to keep themselves entertained.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever had a job where you felt abandoned by the people in charge you\u0027ll feel right at home with these people. They\u0027re just looking for something meaningful to do in the times between. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic doesn\u0027t get real heavy, or try to beat you over the head with a message.\u00a0 It\u0027s just the adventures of some fun people.\u00a0 You might find some wisdom sprinkled in here and there though.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also use the comic blog as a journal of my life, and dumping ground for extra thoughts not necessarily related to the comic.\u00a0 A lot of people seem to enjoy them as much as the comic itself.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
