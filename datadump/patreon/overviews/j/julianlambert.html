Producing videos on a weekly basis requires a degree of commitment and time. Currently moments are snatched here and there, but with 50 patrons I will be able to pull back on my teaching (currently 40 pupils) and devote more time to this project. I want to further improve the quality of the output and work more on tutorials, which take substantially longer to plan, record and produce compared to a relatively straight forward performance video.",
