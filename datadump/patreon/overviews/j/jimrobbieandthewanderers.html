These musicians, Tango and Charlie, and the robot, Jim Robbie, travel around a surreal post-apocalyptic wilderness, and new United States, trying to play music. Along the road they meet mad scientists, vampires, fairies, and all sorts of strange folk. The gang manages to get their noses where they don\u0027t belong and either sort out problems or make them worse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA \u00a0podcast, Jim Robbie and the Wanderers comes out every 2nd and 4th Saturday. We started releasing on the 10th October 2015, and don\u0027t plan to stop anytime soon. One of our main goals with the podcast is to have a diverse cast and crew, as well as a diverse world for the show. For example, to allow the most ease of access to our show, we\u0027ve made sure that the show is available across multiple platforms, and that the scripts for the episodes are available to those who want or need them, for whatever purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why are we on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile running a podcast on volunteer work is entirely possible, we want to make this podcast the best it can be. Currently Ileana \"Iri\" Sheremet, the creator, if paying for sound editing and the hosting of the website and show out of her own pocket. But she, we, dream of being able to stand on our own two feet, make sure that we can pay everyone working on the show, maybe one day cover their volunteer hours too. But we don\u0027t just want to pay people, was want to be able to travel and bring our show to cons, we want to do a live show or two, create merchandise, and we want to release albums with the music that the gang is constantly trying to play. And all of that we want to do at awesome quality. We even plan on having a comic book to go along with the albums, or separately so that everyone can share in the experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are our goals?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst and foremost the money will make will go to paying our actors, writers, musicians, the sound editor, and the producer and to covering basic expenses. We\u0027re working on Iri\u0027s salary currently, and being paid with food, and enthusiasm.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$75 will pay basic hosting for our podcast and website. We\u0027ll be able to branch out a bit more and reach a wider audience.\u003cbr\u003e$175 will start paying our composer Rosemary Derocher.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$350 will cover basic costs, Rosemary Derocher, and our lovely sound editor Laura Bramblette.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$500 should pay everyone, and cover hosting costs all together.\u003cbr\u003e$700 would do everything listed above as well as allow us to upgrade our recording equipment!\u003cbr\u003e$1000 would allow us to afford a stand alone studio where we can work on the show in quiet! Without nosy kitties or doggies interrupting.\u003cbr\u003eAND ONCE WE HIT $1500 we can expand into more substantial merchandise such as: hoodies, hats, shirts, and other nifty little items like possible art books and albums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are the Cast and Crew?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIleana \"Iri\" Sheremet runs this whole organization, she create the show, produces the show, directs the episodes, voices Tango, runs the website and uploading schedule, coordinates plots and the writers, and tries desperately to organize everything else.
