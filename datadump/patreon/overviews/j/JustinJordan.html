    "summary": "Hello There!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Justin Jordan, and if you\u2019re here, you probably know me\nfor my work on books like LUTHER STRODE, SPREAD, and DEAD BODY ROAD at Image,\nor JOHN FLOOD, DEEP STATE and SOMBRA at Boom Studios. Or possibly Thanos and\nDarkseid: Carpool Buddies of Doom. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOr possibly for my cat, Miss Thomas Waits. She\u2019s amazing. She loves ham.\nSupport this Patreon, and she gets more Ham. Which, right, brings me to what\nthis place is. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been freelance for five, going on six years now. A\nfunction of this is that my income is erratic. I didn\u2019t, for instance, have any\nincome from October 2015 to March 2016. While this worked out fine, it IS hella\nstressful. So part of what this Patreon is meant to do is smooth out my income\nsome. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, beyond that, I want to use it to make comics. So the money that comes in\nwill largely be used, barring me needing it to feed the cat, to help me make more\ncomics and get more people reading the comics I\u2019ve written. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich brings me to what you get out of this deal. This place is going to have a\nfew things. At the most basic level, you\u2019ll get sneak previews of my upcoming\nwork, and you\u2019ll get access to my complete script archive. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s right. Every script I\u2019ve ever written, as well as every pitch. Even for\ncomics that never actually, you know, happened. So a complete look underneath\nthe hood at what I do and how it\u2019s done. Plus, you get to see projects as I put\nthem together. If you\u2019re familiar with what I do,you know that\u2019s a lot of stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I have bigger ambitions. I\u2019m also going to teach you how to make comics, or\nat least, how I make comics. If you\u2019re in for the long haul, I hope to be able\nto distill everything I\u2019ve learned writing hundreds of published comics and\nteach it to you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, I hope you join me. I think it\u2019s going to be pretty\ncool."
