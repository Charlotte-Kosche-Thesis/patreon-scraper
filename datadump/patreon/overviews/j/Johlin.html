    "summary": "Hello fellow patron of the arts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am J\u00f8hlin, a music producer based in sunny California. I have been creating music for many years, and now feel ready to share it with as many people across the world as I possibly can! I produce many different types of music, but it is mostly all rooted in electronic music in one form or another. I hope you find a piece of my work that speaks to you in the way we all know art has the power to do. This brings up the question as to what exactly are you doing here? Well, if you become a patron you only have to pay $1.00 currently for any song I post on here. If you buy into my music, you will be directly helping me reach my dream of doing music as a full time career, and I cannot express how happy that would make me, and how thankful I would be to you for helping be an instrumental part in my success. Please, give my work a listen, leave your thoughts, feedback, questions, concerns, or anything in between. If you would like to contact me you can also always send an email to johlingm@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic is a language everyone can undsertand, so let us have a conversation together, you and I.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest regards to you,\u003cbr\u003eJ\u00f8hlin :)\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am J\u00f8hlin, an electronic music artist from California, and I have been producing music for many years. I used to be signed to a record label based in Germany, but have found that being an independent artist seems to be what I was meant to do. It enables me to be in more direct contact with my followers, as well as have full artistic control over what I do, instead of having to appeal to what any label would want me to do otherwise. This way my music can be as genuine as a possible, and those that listen can get to know me more personally simply through what they hear. My plan is to be as transparent as possible with making sure my fans know what is coming up next, and keeping them up to date with what I am currently working on. I hope you find my music interesting, and engaging to listen to, or at the very least worth your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest regards,\u003cbr\u003eJ\u00f8hlin\u003cbr\u003e",
