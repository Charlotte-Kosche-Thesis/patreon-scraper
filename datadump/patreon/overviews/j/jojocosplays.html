It truly means the entire world to me! \u0026lt;3\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://groggits.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/about.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWell, I\u0027m a Northern California cosplayer who loves all things nerdy! I started playing video games when I was fairly young and that kinda sparked my interest in cosplay. As I got older, I tried to get into it, but at first didn\u0027t make a big deal about it or anything. A couple of years ago, I got really hardcore into anime and it was game over! I jumped right into cosplay full speed ahead and never looked back! I realized how much I enjoyed becoming my favorite characters and how amazing it made me feel! Not to mention how awesome it is to see how happy people get when they get to see their favorite character at a con!  I like to be super creative and I\u0027ve always wanted to find something that I truly love to put my creativity into, and once I started cosplaying, I realized that it was what I wanted to do! \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eAs I\u0027ll still be posting on my other social media sites, Patreon is a way for those of you who would like to give a little extra support, to get a little extra something something in return! Even if you only pledge $1 a month you still get access to behind the scenes, progress shots, etc. that my other social media sites don\u0027t get! Now if you\u0027re the kind of person who enjoys more, such as, budoir shoots, prints, personal gifts, more interaction, etc. I have higher tiers for you guys as well! You can find all of my tiers listed on my page and what goodies they come with so that you can choose the tier that sounds best to you!\u0026lt;3 Patreon is a good way for me to be able to grow as a cosplayer with you guys!

To be able to go to tons of conventions to meet all the amazing people in the world that are into the same nerdy shit as I am! I\u0027d also like to be able to make every costume from scratch! As I\u0027m sure you guys know, those kind of things can tend to be pricy! With patreon, I feel like I can reach those goals and some day be able to go to specific cons you guys wanna see me at so that we can all hang out and have a great time! \u0026lt;3 With reaching these goals, I\u0027d also be able to put out more and BETTER content for you guys, which would be absolutely amazing\u0026lt;3\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
