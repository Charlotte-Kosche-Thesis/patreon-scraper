    "summary": "Hi! So, a little bit about us. The two of us have known each other since elementary school, when we bonded over our love for mischief, witty humor, and the guitar. Through the years, we\u0027ve been in countless concerts, theatre productions, and live performance situations, where we cut our teeth as performers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been collaboratively writing music, performing covers, and taking part in other shenanigans for over five years. Currently, we are full time college students while simultaneously working in the film and audio recording industries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur musical tastes are what some people might call eclectic. Joe\u0027s been heavily influenced by artists from Rush to Foo Fighters to Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. Gus, on the other hand, draws some of his inspiration from The Beatles (With Sir Paul being the supreme music man), Billy Joel, and Green Day. Our music ranges from simple piano ballads to loud pop punk productions. We believe that in order to put out good music, we first must take in good music, and those influences can often be heard in our songs."
