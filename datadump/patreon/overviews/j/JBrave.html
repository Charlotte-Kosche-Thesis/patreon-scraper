I am a former counselor for homeless and at-risk youth, a father, and now a full time independent conscious Hip Hop artist touring the world spreading messages of love through music. My mission is simple, through the depths of my vulnerability I intend to inspire others to be the greatest versions of themselves. I know we have all been sent here to express something only we can uniquely share that will help make the planet a better place. If I can help remind others of their truth and awaken the innate part of us that feels the rapture of being alive then I have succeeded. I am here to serve, and the best way I have found to do that is through music. With your support and contributions I will deepen my capacity to live my purpose and highest calling in life. I am so grateful you\u0027ve chosen to connect with me! I am devoted to my path and so appreciate your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to work with some of the most disadvantaged people in Los Angeles who are living day to day in the streets. Many of them between the ages of 14 - 24 who have run away because of\u00a0 physical and sexual abuse, identity and sexual orientation challenges with their families, and by enduring some of the most difficult personal tragedies you can imagine. Many have turned to gangs, prostitution, and find themselves in and out of jail and the foster care system. It was in this place that I learned the true value of service, activism, and unconditional love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have since taken my strong desire to help others into the realms of music, and have been performing professionally for the last 11 years. I am the founder of the group Luminaries, have thrown 100s of conscious minded gatherings supporting the arts, am visioning a transformational festival called \"Benevolence\" and am now offering workshops and one on one courses under the theme \"Discover Your Sacred Offering.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy whole life is dedicated to serve others, and with your support here on Patreon it will provide the fuel required to continue. I am so grateful for your contributions, thank you so much for being on this journey with me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "The\n time has come to recognize who and what we truly are. J Brave aka Javis\n Huggins is the embodiment of a dream fulfilled. Born in Inglewood \nCalifornia, he endured the hardships of inner city life and meager \nbeginnings. He grew up in a B-Boy home that often hosted local dance \nbattles amid the influence of Hip Hop in the mid 80s. The second \nyoungest of ten children, his brother\u0027s shenanigans and drug dealings \npaved way for his home to be raided twice by the police before the age \nof nine. His father passed away when he was 11, and he found solace \nplaying basketball while living in the South Bay. A few years later \nafter buying his first CD, Tupac\u0027s \"Me Against The World\" he began \nwriting lyrics. Deeply inspired by the song \"Dear Mama\" he realized that\n Rap can be a tool to inspire and create change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYears\n passed and J Brave\u0027s music stayed dormant until he took a spiritual \npilgrimage to the Egyptian Pyramids in 2001. Nothing short of a mystical\n experience, J Brave returned home and began to share his poetry at open\n mics. Eventually, he attracted the opportunity to produce his own night\n at the famed underground Rasta themed venue the Fiyah House in \nHollywood. J Brave soon moved to Venice Beach, then started working full\n time as a counselor with  homeless and at-risk youth. A role that would\n last nearly 10 years, he worked closely with young people who were \nliving in the streets, shelters, abandoned buildings while assisting \nthose struggling with addiction, gang ties, prostitution, and those in \nand out of incarcerated facilities. This work taught him the true power \nand value of service, and turned into activism as he became a steward \nand supporter of the South Central Farm. After a long political standoff\n that turned into encampment on the land, he was arrested on the day the\n Farm was sieged by Police in 2006 for nonviolent activism \u0026amp; \nprotesting. The same year turned out to be the most emotionally \ndifficult and shadow filled part of his life. He faced pent up grief \nfrom his father\u0027s death and childhood trauma, lost 3 close friends that \npassed away, and he found himself very depressed and withdrawn. \nFortunately he transmuted the sadness by embracing Vipassana meditation,\n enrolling into Landmark education, and becoming an avid member of the \nAgape community in Los Angeles. He found strength in learning about \nyoga, veganism, and holistic health practices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nJ\n Brave founded the internationally renown Hip Hip collective the \nLuminaries. He has toured the world spreading messages of peace, love, \nand unity throughout his travels. Most notably, his  band is finishing \ntheir documentary film \"When The People Lead\" about their delegation to \nPalestine \u0026amp; Israel. He\u0027s produced events in the Los Angeles \ncommunity for over a decade including the 5 year running Luminous \nMovement weekly, Ecstatic Dance LA, and is currently in the visioning \nprocess for a flagship festival called Benevolence. His debut solo album\n \"Amethyst\" has peeked the ears of music lovers, and his single \"Sacred\"\n is approaching viral video status. His greatest gift is his ability to \nbring people together and remind everyone of their divine nature. His \nmusic continues to inspire across genres, as his intention precedes all \nlabels. He strives to use Hip Hop as a tool for transformation while \nsharing his personal stories of resilience through adversity. J Brave is\n a shinning example of a person driven to make a difference. Motivated \nby his own awakening, he is passionate about uplifting the masses, \nspeaking against injustices, and rekindling our connection to nature so \nwe may live in a more loving world.",

Weather you are into music, dancing, painting, visual arts, movement, or really any creative modality, this curriculum can be applicable for you. At \u00a0some quintessential moment in everyone\u2019s life, we all ponder one of \u00a0humanity\u2019s great mysteries and ask ourselves, why am I here? Within us \u00a0of course, embedded in the very fabric of our being lies hidden the \u00a0answer we seek. Through mindful practices of realization, intention setting, and affirmative sharing, you will start to release any resistance, and begin to come into alignment with who and what you truly are. You will remember the greater reason of what has brought you to \u00a0earth at this magnificent time, while gaining awareness of your unique individual creative expression. Inside each and every one of us is something beautiful waiting to emerge, and your sacred offering is the key to the healing of your life, and to the co-creation of a brighter \u00a0world.\u003c/p\u003e",
