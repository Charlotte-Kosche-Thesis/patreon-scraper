I want to visit anime conventions and do panels on light novels, as I\u0027ve noticed many of their programs lack them. I\u0027d like to improve the equipment I use for my videos, so I can do more ambitious projects which my current gear is incapable of handling. And I\u0027d like to hire someone to do original art for my channel, so it can develop a unique identity. In short, this is about improvements, and spreading the fandom of light novels!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate you taking the time to check this out. Your desire to help keep my channel going and to grow the light novel community is amazing.\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
