I started this channel with the intention of reaching my goal of being able to take the time to learn and become knowledgeable about the subjects I like as well as become an authority on what I focus on most. I have been into and helping people with computers since the early 90\u0027s and would like to finally get to a level I am happy with in this area. I have experience with many things in this life and can give a valid opinion on the things I will be doing. What I don\u0027t know about with your help I will be able to research and learn all needed to give you the information and entertainment you are looking for.\u00a0"
