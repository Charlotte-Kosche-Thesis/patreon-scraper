I met dollies started when I was a little girl. My mother give a Barbie girl. You don\u0027t know, I was look like a naughty boy at that time. But, It\u0027s amazing! When I touched these dollies I was fall in loving! So I think these angels might have magic. I also have many interesting stories with my dollies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s about 2005, I knew Blythe. It was also my dear mother that gave me my first Blythe as a birthday present. I love her! She looks so different between others. And then, I began to know many other dollies. They are all so beautiful and cute.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI loved handmade things when I was a child, especially doll\u2019s fashion. When I got my first Blythe, I tried to make her clothes. I wanted her to dress her the way I imagined for her.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy first sewing and knitting teacher must have been my grandmother. I remembered that I was about 4-5 years old. I usually watched her sewing and knitting for me and my family. She taught me the basic skills of sewing and knitting. Then, I learn it all by myself with some books and I gradually acquired more skills.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy studio looks luminous, cartoon style, colorful and filled up with my dreams. Apart from doll outfits, I also have my handmade works and paintings on display\u2026. plus many fabrics and any other materials.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI work of doll fashions everyday. It\u2019s my favorite moment in life, so I never feel tired or bored doing it. I like to listen to music and the radio while working. Usually I do sewing and fabric works in day time, and hand knit works at night because I can knit sweaters and watch my favor TV or movie at the same time!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEverything in my life gives me inspiration for my fashion designs! For example, if you skim over my works, you will find some designs about cats. I love cats and I have a lovely one. I think cats will be an important element in my works forever.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
