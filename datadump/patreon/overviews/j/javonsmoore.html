I am an artist raised in Detroit, Michigan. Growing up, I\u0027ve been inspired by many artists in my family which includes;  my father an entrepreneur and DJ, mother who danced and sang. The rest of the family are civil right activist, songwriters, musicians, Graphic Designers, Cosmetologist or really creative. I\u0027ve always had a fascination for the arts because of the artistic energies that surrounded me. Ten years ago, I picked up my first camera. Since then I\u0027ve traveled all over Michigan; its Canadian neighbors such as Ontario \u0026amp; Quebec and moved to California; living in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Being from Detroit, I was privileged enough to have my basic needs met. Since moving to California, my eyes have opened to the struggles of a starving artist. As a photographer, you are known for having expensive lenses, upgrading equipment, props and other resources, paying that special subject, building a team and so much more.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other day, I lost all of my images after a photo-session.  There was a way to recover them but that\u0027s costly and I don\u0027t have the extra money to pay for the problems that I encounter.  I am looking for patrons to invest in my art so that I can built a team and get my name out there and most importantly, make some money. If you can help it will be greatly appreciated.
