For instance, the first releases in the line focused on near-future careers, such as police detectives and rescue workers.

There are also story hooks for using them as NPCs or for using your own PC as a member of each supplement\u0027s career or group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor historically based supplements I\u0027m also including references to famous exemplars. For instance, if I do a Wild West outlaw supplement, I\u0027ll list information about Billy the Kid, Jesse James and other famous criminals of the era.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons supporting me not only get access to the supplements before anyone else, but the privilege to vote for what comes next, as well as other extras, depending on level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent eras planned for the supplement line include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNear-Future Urban\u003cbr\u003eMedieval Castle and Manor\u003cbr\u003eWild West America\u003cbr\u003eSamurai Japan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I\u0027m not limiting it to that.
