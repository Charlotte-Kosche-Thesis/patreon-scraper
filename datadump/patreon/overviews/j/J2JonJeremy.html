I record Let\u0027s Plays \u0026amp; Game Playthroughs on Youtube in a variety of different gaming genres. FPS? Sure, I\u0027ve done that. 4X? Yep, done that too. Grand Strategy? Oh, you betcha. MMO? Even MMOs! If it catches my fancy, it goes up on the channel. And I\u0027ve appreciated and continue to appreciate the support of those who\u0027ve watched.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon says that I should tell you why you should pledge your hard earned money to yours truly and what I\u0027ll be doing with said funds. It\u0027s simple, really. If you support a cause, you can become a patron to it. If you support a political organization, you can become a patron to it. If you support a creator, you can become a patron to it. Why does someone choose to support something? Because they believe in it. And I appreciate the hell out of anyone who feels strongly enough about the content that I put out that they\u0027d want to monetarily support it. Take a look at the posted goals as for what the funds will be used for. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to reach out to me here on Patreon if you become a patron, on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/j2jonjeremy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e or social media!"
