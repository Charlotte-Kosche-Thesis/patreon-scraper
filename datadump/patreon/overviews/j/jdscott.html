My name is JD Scott \u0026amp; I write stories \u0026amp; poems \u0026amp; sometimes also edit lit mags, hand-make zines, and brew perfumes on the side. I\u0027ve been told my work is lyrical, experimental, literary, political, excessive, monstrous, Southern Gothic, Florida-af, fairy-tale-y, video-game-y, parabolic, meandering, bratty, teenaged, fabulist, occult, queer, absurdist, imagistic, and just kinda offbeat \u0026amp; weird, tbh.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve had my poems published in literary journals of renown (e.g.: \n\u003cem\u003eDenver Quarterly\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ePrairie Schooner\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNinth Letter\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSonora Review\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Pinch\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eBest Experimental Writing\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0anthology, \u003cem\u003eBest New Poets \u003c/em\u003eanthology) and I have been awarded a number of accolades such as writer residencies (The Millay Colony, The Edward F.

My publications are scattered about online magazines, print magazines, chapbooks, zines, and anthologies, so this gathers them in one curated place for you. Occasionally there may be unpublished work from The Vault, but I consider anything from this category a finished, polished piece.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2461\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0DRAFTING TABLE\u003c/strong\u003e \u2461 \u2014 Straight from the drafting table: unpublished poems and stories (flash and long-form) that are freshly written. You get to see what new material I\u0027m working on and working through.

I\u0027ll most likely try to mix this up so it\u0027s varied from whatever I\u0027m posting from The Vault + The Drafting Table that month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2463 \n\u003cstrong\u003eCDGC\u003c/strong\u003e \u2463 \u2014 CDGC is the code name for my in-progress first novel. If you\u0027re familiar with the magical girl genre (Sailor Moon, Madoka Magica) or Super Sentai shows (made famous by the Power Rangers in the U.S.), then you are familiar with some of the tropes I\u0027m trying to engage with in my novel. CDGC is a coming-of-age magical boy (there are magical girls too, but they\u0027re ghosts\u2014it\u0027s, \u003cem\u003euhh\u003c/em\u003e, complicated) novel set in the subtropics of Tampa. It\u0027s a concoction of lyrical literary fiction, YA genre, magical realism, and a swampy Southern Gothic\u2014and also deals with themes of identity (sexuality, gender, race). The novel is very much so at a drafty, blueprint level with vignettes and chapters constantly moving around, but I will be posting a chapter once a month starting at the beginning. This is my first attempt at writing a novel, so it\u0027s very raw.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2464 \u003cstrong\u003eBook Talk\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u2464 \u2014 This post category is for backers at the $3+ tier list.

With this tier I will send you \u003cstrong\u003e(2)\u003c/strong\u003e perfumes in the mail each year (once every 6 months after you back this tier), which includes access to perfumes I\u0027ve retired from my website. Most of my scents are gender-neutral but I can help you pick a more masc/fem scent depending on your tastes.",
