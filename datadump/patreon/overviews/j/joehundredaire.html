    "summary": "I got into the world of fan fiction over a decade ago, when the owner of an archive I was highly active on as a reviewer noticed that I delivered feedback that was more literate than most and invited me to begin collaborating with her. From there, I struck out on my own... and posted a few things that make me cringe when I look at them today. But like everyone else? I got better. And I continue to get better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting is an art form that occupies a unique position within the fan community. It is unlike any other form of creativity insofar as that it is largely frowned upon to receive payment for your work. Fan art? Commission it if you\u0027re like me and can\u0027t draw a stick figure. Cosplay? Commission it if you can\u0027t create it yourself. Search for Dr. Who on Etsy, and it coughs up 15,966 different items for sale. Try to find someone to write you some Eleven/River fic? You\u0027ll have a much harder time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDo we deserve to be any less recognized and compensated for the joy we bring others? I\u0027ve long held the - rather unpopular - belief that no, we shouldn\u0027t. In the past, I\u0027ve used GoFundMe to help defer the cost of the illustrations that I commission from artists for my work, but that was just money passing through me to another individual. In eleven years, I\u0027ve written over a million and a half words of fiction spanning a dozen fandoms, and received nothing at all in return for what I\u0027ve given others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2014/311/2/2/paragon_elsa_by_lexikimble-d85lrzc.png\" width=\"650\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough I\u0027m not going to lie, I\u0027ve got absolutely no regrets about getting someone to draw me a picture of Elsa as an N7 Fury from \u003cem\u003eMass Effect 3\u003c/em\u003e...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d like you to help me change the status quo, though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs an individual with a degenerative neural condition, I\u0027m not lucky enough to be able to curl up anywhere I can find space for a notebook and scrawl my thoughts onto paper. I am completely reliant on electronics to record my thoughts and it\u0027s not always practical to pull out my laptop, if I can even bring it with me. Thanks to iCloud, all of my stories are constantly hovering just out of reach when I\u0027m away from my laptop. I would love to have an iPad, so that I can write even more and therefore deliver more fiction to my readers. I\u0027d like to be able to invest more in artists both familiar and new, to bring that thousand words that an image is worth to more of my work. I\u0027d love to buy up entire seasons of TV shows on iTunes so I can watch, rewatch, pause, and rewind to my heart\u0027s content. I could even buy up new shows and movies that I\u0027ve been curious about but been unable to justify the expense of on my budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI could.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut only with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: For those of you who love the art that accompanies my story and are eyeing the top tier, my girlfriend is running a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/skottichan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatreon of her own\u003c/a\u003e. Considering one of her funding goals helps pay off a purchase she made on my PayPal Credit and I get her existing iMac if she can fund a new one before it dies? I figured it was worth a bit of cross-promotion. ;)"

Outside of \u003cem\u003eIron Man 3\u003c/em\u003e, I don\u0027t yet own anything out of Marvel\u0027s Phase 2 and so I\u0027m writing off of memories that are up to two years old at this point. If I pull in a mere $20 a month here, I can fill my collection out by February, and even pick up both seasons of \u003cem\u003eAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0- in HD even - before \u003cem\u003eAvengers 2\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0comes out.",

But if I start pulling in roughly $160 a month on here, I can meet my above goals while still putting away enough money to buy a larger capacity iPad Air in roughly six months. And I\u0027ll need the storage space, because you wouldn\u0027t believe how much reference material I have squirreled away for each of my stories.",

     "description": "I\u0027ll be the first to admit that my knowledge of certain corners of a few fandoms that I work in is weak. Marvel\u0027s Earth-616 is the biggest offender in that regard, because I\u0027m a relatively new fan of their comics given that the Avengers just celebrated their 50th birthday. Even if I could locate and buy all those back issues - and find time to read them - storing them would be completely infeasible. Heck, I\u0027ll even admit that I haven\u0027t read anything out of Earth-1610 since Ultimatum dropped and I set an issue on fire after seeing Blob eat poor Wasp. So I want to get myself onto Marvel Unlimited, their digital back issue service. Through it, I\u0027ll be able to read up on anyone or anything I need to deliver the best stories I possibly can.",

     "description": "There are a lot of interesting television shows out there these days, and not enough time to watch them all. Lord only knows why my cable provider doesn\u0027t seem keen on supplying me with a DVR even when I offer to pay more, and having to wait three months for an episode on a major network to repeat during winter break isn\u0027t really feasible for a writer. An extra $25 a month would help me begin diving into all new fandoms; my buying power would slide up to $45 a month in between when I finish my Marvel collection and when their next movie hits store shelves.",

     "description": "Yes, I am ranking this after my iPad because as it stands, I\u0027m currently paying for my pills while I cannot afford to pay for an iPad. Long story short: I need medication to keep my hands steady and my body violently (read: projectile vomiting) rejects the generics. So my insurance makes me pay a hefty price for pills I won\u0027t puke. Not fair, but that\u0027s life. If I can reach this tier? It becomes an avalanche: I can pay for my pills with Patreon money, which frees up $100 a month I currently spend out of pocket, which means I can buy my iPad and media faster, which means I can permanently remove those goals sooner...",

This goal falls into the same category as above: I currently pay for it out of pocket, but if I can meet this particular goal, I can reinvest money and use it to permanently eliminate lower tiers. Or I can afford to get out of the house for a weekend for a local comic con, meet some fellow geeks, and get all sorts of new story ideas.
