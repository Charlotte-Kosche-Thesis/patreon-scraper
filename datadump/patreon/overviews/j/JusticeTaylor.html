    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eI like to call myself an image maker.\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eI like to paint pictures, whether it\u0027s with collages, photography, or marketing. But not with actual paint, ironically. I suck with paint.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you don\u0027t know my story already, I grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \u0026amp; Clayton County, Georgia. When I graduated high school, I left Philadelphia to head to sunny ol California to go to school at California College of the Arts. But the main issue with that is that I never wanted to go to college and it was expensive as FUCK (+$50,000 a year. I was starving by second semester, lol) and had no meal plan. So I left second semester to find out what it was that I wanted to do and to experience life outside of a classroom.\n...And to avoid crippling debt while I had the time, ha.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince then, I\u0027ve had tons of misadventures and growing experiences, but they\u0027ve all helped me finally decide on what I want to do and have helped me solidify my vision.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the moment, I am the quintessential starving artist. I\u0027m homeless and broke most of the time, haha. BUT, I love what I\u0027m doing. I love figuring out what works and what doesn\u0027t in this process of being a creative business man, I love working under myself, and I love finding my own niche and discovering what exactly is the unique thing that I can give to the people (you guys) that actually means something to you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, in order to do this, I need money to sustain myself and support my projects. Living in San Francisco as a creative is a pretty fucking tough challenge.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo! I\u0027m opening my Patreon as a tip jar of sorts!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can become a \u0027patron\u0027 of mine which allows you to donate an amount of cash of your choice per month (from $1 - $500+ if you\u0027re feeling generous). This way, you can keep seeing more of the content that you love from me, at an amount that works for you, while also giving back and helping me make a living.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you appreciate the work I\u0027m doing and you\u0027d like to help, don\u0027t hesitate to donate! :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, check out my instagram at www.instagram.com/ozero_rogue . That\u0027s where I post most of my stuff."
