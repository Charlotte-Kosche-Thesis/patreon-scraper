I work in any medium I can get my hands on and I have tried pencils, pens, markers, acrylics, oils, watercolors, soft pastels, oil pastels, and even sumi-e ink! My two favorite mediums to work with are colored pencils and acrylic paints, with oil paint and watercolor coming close behind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m really hoping to do is be able to spend more time perfecting my caricature and fantasy work, especially in larger sizes. I\u0027d like to start doing some fantasy art in acrylic paints, and really developing my style in digital and colored pencil as well. Here are some examples of the style I\u0027d like to develop and share with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.joannamarieart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0845-300x400.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.joannamarieart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mermaid-300x400.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.joannamarieart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sith-370x400.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027d love to do is focus more on a character, a story. Currently, I\u0027m doing commissions randomly here and there, but backed by Patreon, I\u0027d start working on the art stories I\u0027d really like to!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe best part of art is being able to share it, being able\nto bring someone else\u2019s idea to life, or bring them to life in a drawing. I\nwant you to be able to take a special part in that, as well as get some sweet\nprizes! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecoming a patron will mean that:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI can work on art more regularly and create more pieces.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly goals will help me to stay on track with regular\nwork.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI can better serve my fans by producing work \u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e want to see.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for being awesome, and I can\u2019t wait to create with\nyou!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Joanna-Marie-Art-Fine-Art-Portraiture-90094398969/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eView my work on Facebook!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
