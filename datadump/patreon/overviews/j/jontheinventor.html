Not regular because I don\u0027t work to a schedule when I\u0027m creating things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, enjoy my new logo. I used it as material reduction holes in my latest print, then seeing how it looked printed, decided to make a larger one in a pentagonal medallion. This also printed quite nicely, so I\u0027m using it as my new logo. It\u0027s in the banner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can make a living designing things and sharing them on Patreon, that\u0027s good enough for me, if money was no object that\u0027s what I\u0027d be doing anyway!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m a designer of obscure technology. Many design concepts from history and fiction have been rejected for one reason or another, and many of them simply too soon. A few missing pieces, some materials we didn\u0027t have at the time it was first tried, some things that exist now thanks to the previous attempt\u0027s failure. My designs are based on these. I believe there are many technologies we\u0027re missing out on that we should logically have in abundance. My many designs have been freely available on my blog, but a total lack of interest has left them unused. I aim to actually prototype all of them. For that I need resources. Being a tortured inventor, I have difficulty maintaining a \u0027normal\u0027 job in this society. And even if I could, it would likely be a wasted life. Enter Patreon. A fantastic opportunity to get the resources I need to prototype and refine my designs, to know, without doubt, what will work and what will not. The resources to dedicate myself to the persuit of understanding.\u003cbr\u003e",
