    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I and what is the War Elephant?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Jon Davis and I\u0027m a Marine veteran\nof the Iraq War, teacher, and have also been a writer since 2011. Currently, I\nrun a blog and recently started a YouTube channel called the War Elephant. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOriginally, my work centered on writing about everything\nmilitary, from veterans\u0027 issues, warfare and international conflicts, terrorism,\nmilitary technology, and what it\u0027s like to be part of the US military. Since\nthen, my blogs and videos grew to also cover domestic politics, understanding Conservatism,\nChristian news and views, the unravelling education system, and lighter topics,\nas well. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll of this combined is why I started my blogs and my YouTube channel, the War Elephant. I wanted to create a single space dedicated to\nrepresenting people like me, those often overlooked by traditional media and\nculture at large. Through crowdsourcing and putting my funding out to fans,\nI\u2019ve been able to broaden my reach from just a few blogs and Quora answers, to\nbe able to reach tens of thousands every day, and now with the start of a\nYouTube Channel, my hope is to one day reach millions. But to do that, I will\nneed much more help.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy day job is as a teacher in Oklahoma, a state\nof beautiful sunsets and infamous for its terrible teacher compensation. Did I\nmention I\u2019m also married to a teacher and also have a new baby? So where ends\ndidn\u2019t meet, I turned to my talent. In spite of how much I write, \u201cthe craft\u201d\nis not an easy to turn a living, even for relatively famous writers,, which I\nam far from being. The work is infrequent, low paying, and irregular. You have\nto exploit every contact you can to try to sell the idea of an article, which\nyou may not sell after spending hours of work. Even if you do get a bite, it is\nnever for very much. It can take a writer years to develop a fan base worthy\nenough of gain the clout of demanding decent pay, \u003cem\u003eif \u003c/em\u003ehe has a good relationship with editors, and \u003cem\u003eif \u003c/em\u003ehe has a strong venue, and \u003cem\u003eif \u003c/em\u003ehe is willing to write about only\nwhat he is told to by his editors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nInstead, I decided to use Patreon. Patreon\nallows my fans I already have to support my ability to keep creating directly.\nPatreon allows you to donate a small amount, like a tip to the girl who made\nyour coffee, every time I publish a piece. Each month, I submit about 8 pieces\nfor pay from patrons. That doesn\u2019t include the dozens of smaller works you may\nknow me for, just the eight big ones each month. And there is even a limit if\nyou want it. You can set a monthly cap, so that you never go over your budget (\u003cem\u003eAgain no, all of my answers on Quora don\u2019t\nget charged on Patreon!)\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatronage allows me to keep the lights on for\nmy family (\u003cem\u003eCough! New baby girl!\u003c/em\u003e) with\nregular payments that encourage me to be able to create meaningful content and\nstay independent, meaning I get to write what I want because my words are\nalways my own. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOf course, for that, I need patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s in it for You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough Patreon, fans of my writing and fans of\nmy show can also be part of making what I do better. This isn\u2019t just begging\nstrangers for money for something that only benefits myself and my family. If\nyou love the content, if its growth and spread are important to you, then\ndonating allows you to help me make my greatest work yet. Once I\u2019ve\ntransitioned to video, the subjects I touch will have access to millions of new\nviewers and represent vast contingents of people who have never had a voice for\nthem. With absolute sincerity, patrons alone make it possible to do all of\nthis. They are just as crucial to making that happen as myself, and the team\nthat supports me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo acknowledge that, my rewards for patronage\nare structured to give patrons access to helping guide the evolution the War\nElephant Channel. You\u2019ll find rewards that allow you to meet and network with other\nWar Elephant patrons, get exclusive bonus content to supporters of the show,\nreceive one-on-one time with me and the team, and other rewards in gratitude\nfor your support. You can review all the rewards by checking the Rewards\noptions to the right.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of the income from Patreon\ngoes directly to household expenses. As I said, a teacher married to a teacher in\nOklahoma means ends meeting isn\u2019t always easy. Patronage support gives my wife\nand me some breathing room to do needed repairs on our aged first home (nearly\n80 years old!) and helps give my daughter opportunities neither of us had\ngrowing up. Beyond that, it helps me stay supplied by providing subscription\nfees for hard to find information sources not available in all public outlets,\nas well as new gear and software. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThrough enough continued support, I\u2019ll be able\nto leave my current job and work from home, full time on creation, and be able\nto keep my work free to everyone. In the future, I want to expand to a studio, and\nbring on a staff full time to create even more content like videos, articles,\nand essays. For that, I\u2019ll need a lot of patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition, I try to give back 10% of every\nmonth\u0027s pledges to other Patreon creators, Kickstarter campaigns, and other\ncrowdsource opportunities I\u0027m passionate about and that I think my patrons\nwould appreciate too, most notably those created by and for military veterans,\nbut other passion projects done by people who are doing great things. I want to\nfoster creative communities for those like the fans of War Elephant and support\nthe good works they are doing. That means your pledges here also help support other\nprojects, artists, and entrepreneurs elsewhere at the brink of their careers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003etl;dr\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- Pledges per piece of content\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- You can cap your monthly amount\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- I make around 8 videos or articles per month on average\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- 10% of each month goes back to other great creators\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- If you\u2019ve read this far, you know you want to donate and are\njust looking for a reason not to. Take the plunge and hit that \u201cBecome a\npatron\u201d button already. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n- Thank you so much for checking out the page. Every little bit\nis appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
