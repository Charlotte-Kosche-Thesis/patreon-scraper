    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Jeremy. I co-founded the company that made \u003cstrong\u003eMurder Miners\u003c/strong\u003e. I helped design it and did the animations, character models, and other artwork in the game. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re working on the sequel now, \u003cstrong\u003eMurder Miners X\u003c/strong\u003e, and I\u0027ve also been working on my own game, \u003cstrong\u003eSuper Clash Bros,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003esince 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClash Bros is one of my childhood dream-games that I always really wanted to play, so I stubbornly (stupidly) went without another job so I could keep working on it full-time (over-time). I ended up borrowing a lot of money to do this after going through my savings from Murder Miners. But now I\u0027ve borrowed too much, so in order to stave off working contract jobs I\u0027m turning to Patreon to see if we can get something mutually beneficial happening here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m working 60 hours a week on Super Clash Bros (I\u0027m using a stickK commitment to enforce this goal). When Murder Miners X is ready for more animation/3D work, I\u0027ll work on that again too. These are the games I want to spend my time on. I really don\u0027t want to spend 30 of those hours working contract jobs, so anything you can pledge here is greatly appreciated. But also, I just want to know that people value what I\u0027m doing. That fuels me to put in more work on this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in case you didn\u0027t know, I\u0027m hosting a Clash Bros game night every weekend,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/Djcs4J4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejoin the Discord\u003c/a\u003e if you want to play!\u00a0Also the live-change-log channel there on the Discord is the best place to follow the game\u0027s progress. As soon as I change something for the next update I\u0027ll post there.\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027d have a tiny wage of $2.50 an hour but at least I\u0027m working on the game I\u0027ve always wanted to make, and with a few more loans and the dwindling income I get from Murder Miners it\u0027ll be enough to live on and keep me from having to do contract work or Uber driving while developing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I want to meet this goal first before adding online play is because I need to know that enough of you truly care about this game before I spend all the months of very complicated work involved with multiplayer networking.",
