    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003ejoINT. staff thanks all of our dedicated contributors, well-wishers, and beloved community. We have taken on a few forms and roles over the past 4 years. It\u0027s all been a beautiful, humbling, and enlightening journey. No regrets. With dear friends volunteering their creative brilliance and partnerships, joINT. has been more than fortunate to not only be able to publish some of the most talented Black creators throughout the world, but to also contribute to individual artist projects in our communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the coming years, we aim to continue as a paying publication for artists throughout the African diaspora. We also want to continue sponsoring arts funding for individuals and organizations that provide liberation-arts-oriented lectures, workshops, and other arts-based instruction to those who have the least access to these spaces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, this takes time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis won\u0027t all happen overnight, but it\u0027s very possible that we can reach our goal. To do this, we need consistent financial support. We would like to ask you to consider sharing our commitment to the creative development of emerging and marginalized artists and their communities throughout the African diaspora.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ejoINT. has made upwards of 6,000 friends between editorial staff and our public accounts. We have two modes of contributing to our fund: PayPal (via links at the bottom of each page of our website), and via this Patreon. Supporters can commit to one-time donations or monthly donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne-time contributions are great and they help us to survive. They help us to have money, on-hand, to dedicate to things such as business expenses and artist payments, all of which we contribute out-of-pocket. This is no small feat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMonthly contributions help us thrive. In the long term, if even just 1,000 of our friends contributed $1 or more per month, joINT. would have the ability to publish new and exciting work on a regular basis. We would be able to further support the work of independent Black artists and arts organizations (more soon...).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are incredibly grateful to all who have donated, thus far. Since re-launch, we\u0027ve raised $281. What that feels like is love and community. We feel you. We hear you. Send us your work so that we can help expand your audience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ejoINT. Staff\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
