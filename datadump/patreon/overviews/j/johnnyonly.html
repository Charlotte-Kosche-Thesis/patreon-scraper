    "summary": "Greetings!\u003cbr\u003eI am Johnny Only - creating live musical happenings for you and your children to share. \u00a0They have become a fantastic community for both kids and their grown-ups to bond, grow and network. Wouldn\u0027t it be cool if we could make them even better?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you like to partner with me to help make that happen?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis website offers you the opportunity to do that. It allows you to donate what you can afford per event and to cap the amount you give per month. \u00a0It goes without saying that you can stop your donations at anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt it\u0027s basic level, your pledges allow me to invest the time and money to maintain our weekly musical play-dates. If enough people get on board, we can make the shows better, more fun, more educational for your kids, and reach more young families like yours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will allow me to invest in better technology, hire professionals and most of all, to spend more time doing what matters to you and your children; creating music that makes your lives better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision is to provide music that allows kids to celebrate their childhood with their own music. Having their own music gives them a place in this world, -an identity that grown-up music can\u0027t provide. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParents tell me that my music not only helps their kids feel like they belong, but that it helps their kids developmentally. The kids learn about their bodies through simple motions that go with the songs. They develop diction and enunciation skills by singing along. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerformances provide a sense of community and belonging for grown-ups too. Parents are able to network and bond with other parents. Enjoying the songs at home with their kids strengthens parent/child bonds and offers a higher quality of social interaction than TV or Video Games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a parent, you have given me so many compliments and your kids have given me so many hugs, high fives and smiles, that I know my work is making a positive difference in your lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s work together to keep building on this. It will be an experience that will enrich you and your kids \u00a0for the rest of their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
