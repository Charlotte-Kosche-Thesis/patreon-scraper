    "summary": "Josep is a 30-year-old independent journalist who is currently focusing on the Catalan conflict. Unfortunately, the national and international media are being extremely biased towards the Spanish version of the facts which has already misled millions of people across the world who are, in many cases, confused about what is truly happening in Catalonia. Josep does not work for any mainstream media organization. He is instead challenging them while seeking the truth about what\u0027s happening in Catalonia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFreelance work is hard, completely unpredictable, and doesn\u0027t pay well. Because of that,\u00a0 Josep is facing serious financial challenges. He is an independent journalist with no alternative sources of income, and he needs some minimal funding simply to find future work and pay for necessities.\u00a0If you become a regular Patron, you will receive access to the new articles, photos,\u00a0and interviews that he will be producing from time to time. He sometimes needs two days, a week, or even more time to write a piece, depending on the complexity of the subject. You will also help him to be active in social media from where you will be updated on the latest Catalan news.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBear in mind that without your help, Josep won\u2019t be able to solely focus on his journalism, and will have to take on other types of jobs in order to pay for his bills and food. If you have any questions, you can contact him at this email anytime: josepgoded@riseup.net\u003cbr\u003eHe usually responds to emails within 24-48 hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. My Patreon feed, including all the\u00a0content, will remain open to everybody for now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
