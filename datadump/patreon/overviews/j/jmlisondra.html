I\u0027ve been painting for almost 17 years now. It\u0027s my life and passion since then. I went to Manila and work as web developer before and became a full time artist. I was happy then, because it supports me well. I have few collectors and clients that let me work with some commissioned paintings. And then suddenly one night a disease hits me hard that I thought I was gonna die.  I was having a heart attack, stroke or hypertension. My blood pressure was very high. But thanks God, it was just my first panic attack and that happens 2 years ago. It didn\u0027t ended on that night. It cripples me that It was hard to walk without a support and was dizzy all the time 24/7 for 2 months and really scared that I was gonna die anytime. I went back home which I need to ride an airplane. It was the hardest 4 hours ride of my life, 1 hour plane ride and 3 hours on a van. Imagine of being dizzy, scared, light headed on a plane 32,000 feet above the ground. I reach home and was really thankful to God for being with me all the time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot paint for 5 months for extreme dizziness. Doctor told me it was just all in my head \"anxiety\" and I don\u0027t want to believed him. I tried to paint sometimes when my strength comes back and lie all day on bed when it hits me back. One day I tried to paint using oil pastel on sand paper because I was bored and broke, and I let my father record a video while I\u0027m doing it. I posted it on youtube and one night I had 30 views. I was happy. Who viewed it? Who knows? Then the next few days I tried to record while I am painting using acrylic, it was entitled \"Acrylic Landscape Painting Demo\". My very first landscape painting video demo.  The next day I had 30 to 40 views and a comment. I forgot the name of the one who commented but she\u0027s one of the reason why I am here right now teaching you my technique. I posted another video and people likes it. They gave comments and I began to become busy. I enjoy replying to almost all the comments. I deleted bad ones, yes of course I have anxiety issues. After a month or two I started chatting and talking to other people, giving tips on messenger and emails. I began to lived again. I was hopeless and began to think positive thoughts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat was my story guys why I have a Youtube channel. I am happy teaching and sharing you the skills I gathered for 17 years of my painting experience. That was why I responded on most of your comments. Saying thank you is never enough how all of you helps me get through the bad times. After 6 months I received my first $100 from youtube. Wow! I was broke and youtube gave me that money! I just want to tell you guys that I am happy talking to you everyday even sometimes I need to use the google translator. You helped me get through my illness and I want to continue doing this for a longer time as long as God provide me the strength.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will try to upgrade my equipment including my video camera for a higher quality recording. Hopefully you can help me guys. My videos are still for free."
