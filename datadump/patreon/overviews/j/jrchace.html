These comics can have access to everything these devices can do, such as touch controls, 3d infinite space, sound, motion, programming, etc! The possibilities are endless! In fact, its a bit overwhelming! So overwhelming that the reason this sort of thing hasn\u0027t been explored more is because comics tried and failed at this once before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe comics failed its way into this digital realm when \"motion comics\" became a thing. When comics introduced animated panel transitions and voice acting it really stopped being comics at that point and started being film/video, just in the aesthetic of a comic book. Then that was about it with any big attempts at redefining comics digitally. Webcomics with gifs and complicated website design was the peak of digital comic innovation it seemed. Worst of all, most people cling to the page and panel format for dear life when traversing these strange digital lands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComics need to be \u003cstrong\u003eread\u003c/strong\u003e. Motion comics failed spectacularly at this. If there is any point in which you are \"watching\" the comic then it ceases to be one. The reader needs to be in control, or at least in illusion of being in control, of the realm of time surrounding the reading. That\u0027s why voice acting doesn\u0027t work. That\u0027s why seeing panels fly in and out doesn\u0027t work.\u003cstrong\u003e A digital comic still needs to BE a comic.\u003c/strong\u003e Many attempts transitioning comics into the digital realm have lost \"being a comic\" along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere needs to be a \u003cstrong\u003ereason \u003c/strong\u003efor comics to be on these devices too. It needs to utilize the 3d infinite space, or the sound design, or the programming. In my prototype and the examples above, the comics reinvent themselves in the media. Panels and pages aren\u0027t necessary, thus they are completely absent! Touch controls allow the user to read instead of watch their way through the digital space! Sound that isn\u0027t time sensitive, like looping background music and contextual sound effects, can live inside the reading without interfering. Best of all, these devices are portable and easily developed upon using user-friendly software such as Unity! We exist in a time where working on comics this way is universally available to us all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo I\u0027ve come to Patreon to ask for support in exploring this concept of Interactive Comics in my next project! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eAlignment: A Tabletop Story!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://noncontenthtml.webcomic.ws/files/thegroupfinal.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eAlignment: A Tabletop Story\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is similar to my prototype project \"Full Plate\" with using parallax scrolling and sound design.
