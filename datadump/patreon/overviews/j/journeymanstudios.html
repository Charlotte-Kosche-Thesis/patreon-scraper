    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Juan Felipe Calle (aka Phill), and I am the head writer for Journeyman Studios, which consists of Journeyman (the artist, aka Journey) and myself. \u00a0You can find Journey\u0027s art stream on Twitch, at \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/journeyman1029\"\u003ehttp://www.twitch.tv/journeyman1029\u003c/a\u003e. (I must warn you that his language on Twitch is raw and profane and funny). You can also go to\u00a0\u003ca\u003ewww.journeyman1029.net\u003c/a\u003e to buy affordable prints and original artwork. We also work with Jamie Chestnut, a fine artist who letters our comics and designs our logos. \u00a0You can find Jamie\u0027s work here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jamiechestnut/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/jamiechestnut/\u003c/a\u003e. Jamie also also has a twitch stream: \u003ca\u003ehttp:www.twitch.tv/jamiechestnut.\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOur main focus is producing comics that are\u00a0profane or strange or funny or violent or weird or thoughtful or juvenile, depending on the need of the story. \"Emerald Alley,\" available for a short time for free, is one such comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is cool about this is that you will be able to see Journey draw our comics on his\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/journeyman1029\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch\u00a0\u003c/a\u003estream. Journey is a multimedia artist who works traditionally, and he loves to interact with the audience, so if you watch him on Twitch, you can also interact with him on Twitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the stories are finished, and once we have a few stories finished (enough for a 32-page comic), we will publish the comic in print and sell that for an affordable price. The PDFs will always be available to those Patreon members who pledge at the $5 level or higher, and occasionally, we might make a PDF available for free to the public as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, we can finish one story every two to four months and Journey produces a lot of single pieces in art in that time frame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne more thing about support: Although we value financial support, we also value social support. If you like what you see, please follow\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/journeyman1029\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJourneyman1029 on Twitch\u003c/a\u003e, and please occasionally mention us to friends whom you think would like our stuff, and please let us know if you support us socially so we can give you a shout out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
