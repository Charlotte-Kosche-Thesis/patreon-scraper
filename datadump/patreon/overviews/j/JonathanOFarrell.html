I aim by the end of 2017 to have published two photographically illustrated poetry anthologies;\u003cstrong\u003e \u0027 Trinity \u0027 \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027 Seasoned in Change \u0027\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as utilising Patreon to showcase my work it also affords me a valued opportunity to support a currently very small number of creatives, thier work being particularly close to my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very humbled and honoured to been given the priviledge to become a \u00a0contributing member in\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://suddendenouement.com/2017/08/17/interview-with-jonathan-ofarrell/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Global Divergent Literary Collective\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe above link takes you to my debut interview with Jasper Kerkau.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy utilise this platform? As I am sure you realise it is one thing, to be authentic creative of \u0027 the usual \u0027 limited means \u00a0- it is quite another prospect to be flat broke, without the means and equipment to manifest ones artistic output. That means, for me, the all important camera equipment, frugal travel expenses, the odd coffee and of course, eventual publication overheads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is me and how I view my creative vocation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eI wish to explore the exquisite balance to be found from a meditative photography, aligned to a poetry of fewer words. These are my core themes: exploration, universal connectedness, revealed through landscapes / skyscapes / seascapes. To meet the gift of introspection that is our gaze, into the macro, nano, fractal. To savour the wild and cultivated world, out there and within us. And all this, nature, expressed physically, minimally and powerfully and \u00a0with humility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAs a further brief eye opener to my creative vision, inspirations and their manifestation, through my work, please allow me to share with you a few short extracts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThesee\u00a0are from the anthology introductions. Thank you, once again, for your kind attention and I hope, patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJonathan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027 Trinty \u0027\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Relationships, are they not, when we contemplate, feel and live them, just a perfect reflection of all nature? That is to say, at once complex, but when it comes to it, brutally and yet, exquisitely simple; perhaps as in \u2018 You,Swan, Waves \u2018? Certainly I\u2019m often trying, perhaps striving too hard - to feel my way into this big question, if not the answer.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThere seems a universal message, beyond the mere singular events, that inspires individual poems and the creative flow in me. She, for indeed that is how nature imbued hope, manifests; gently bids me feel the quiet, yet utterly tangible knowing, emanating from her loving nature, e.g. \u2018 Rippling Emerald Waters \u2018. This precious entity, call it also love if you will, is held in trust, by something greater - perhaps read \u2018 The Young Life: a Prayer \u2018. It is far more expansive and diffuse, than my immediate personalised, egoistic standpoint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027 Seasoned in Change \u0027\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u00a0Nature is very often the  substantive subject matter of my poetry . The stimuli for a specific poem might be relationships, other life challenge e.g. \u2018 The going out into the world \u2018 , even so, the writing nearly always ends on a note of hope, imbued by nature\u0027s indomitable life force. A key question is, what can I and you my dear reader, learn, particularly if we allow ourselves to be \u2018 seasoned \u2018 in the rhythm and message of her seasons?\u003cbr\u003e...\u003cbr\u003eHere is a fervent and fecund hope, even a prayer; what little scratchings do escape onto paper, that they somehow give reverence, to the tree and its gift.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
