    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIN SHORT: \u003c/strong\u003eI am writing and recording worship music. If you like my music and/or believe worship music should be free, please consider giving me a dollar, \u003cem\u003eor two\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eor three\u003c/em\u003e, for every worship song I release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE LONG STORY:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eAfter graduating university in 2009 with degree in music theory \u0026amp; composition, I began working with a producer on my first non-DIY studio album. The album came out a year and a half later with a legendary bassist, whom I paid extra for with some financial help, a virtuosic drummer, and one of my best friends as a guest vocalist. I played guitar and did all of the orchestrations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat was the beginning of my pursuit of a career in music. About a year later, I turned down an opportunity to go perform and tour in India. The reason;\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e I did not want to go unless I was taking the gospel with me. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s what my second album was for. I often say it is the most important record that I\u2019ll ever write. -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://johnny-newman.com/album/the-great-mistrial-or-go-to-dark-gethsemane\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Great Mistrial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e; an album that is explicitly about Jesus Christ, the Crucifixion, and the Great Commission. The finished record released on Easter of 2015, and was beyond my expectations in its power and message. But one more thing felt wrong; I was charging people money to have this album, a record with \u003cem\u003ea message that should be free to everyone.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA year later now, I\u2019ve made that album, as well as the entirety of my discography \u003cstrong\u003efree of charge to the public\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Johnny Newman, and I am an intercessory \u0026amp; missionary composer. It is my mission to write, record, and release intercessory \u0026amp; worship music free of charge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese songs are born out of a place of worship; behind a guitar or a piano, but always in front of His word.  I ask you kindly to help me in this missionary field. Give what you feel comfortable with, and if nothing else, pray for me to write meaningful and uplifting songs unto the Lord. Pray for my team of musicians to write and perform in a manner pleasing to the Jesus. And finally, pray for the hearts and ears of unbelievers to be touched by the Holy Spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, how does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon serves as both a conference room \u0026amp; venue for getting stuff done! And just like a conference room - everyone has a voice, everyone is heard. There is only one donation tier for just $1; however, you are welcome to give more if you desire. Still, if you donate $1,You are seen and I am just as blessed by your generosity as I am by someone who donates $100. You get all of the things, and it all goes towards the same beautiful goal of recording and releasing worship music \u0026amp; projects that are consistently \u003cstrong\u003ebigger\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cem\u003ebetter\u003c/em\u003e, \u0026amp; more \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eexciting\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re worried about getting charged too much or too frequently, you are allowed to cap you donations so that you never give more than you are comfortable with. Even so, I should be releasing a project around \u003cem\u003eonce a month\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI humbly ask you to give what you can and whatever you feel comfortable with. It is my passion to worship \u0026amp; serve Christ through the way in which He has gifted me - through music. There\u2019s nothing more than I desire than to sit as His feet and serve the shepherd and the sheep alike. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Johnny Newman\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd - not to leave it at that - if you\u0027re unsure about this, my entire discography is available at Johnny-Newman.com. So, if you\u0027re hesitant about supporting me in the \"long-haul\" check out my albums and name your price there (or download it for free if you feel so inclined). BUT, if you have more questions or ideas shoot me an email at JohnMatthewNewman@gmail.com, tweet me at @Johnny_Newman or even snapchat me at JNewmanMetal \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnward.\u003cbr\u003e"
