    "summary": "Hi Legends :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was reluctant to start a Patreon page for a long time because I felt that I could support myself through working a normal job and still continue to make content and do my animal rights work on top of that. But I have since had a revelation. \u003cbr\u003eIt happened while I was on tour in the UK. I realised that I needed to spend 100% of my time and effort on helping other vegan activists and spreading the vegan message. \u003cbr\u003eDedicating even 3 days a week to a job supporting someone else\u0027s business while animals are being tortured and killed by the trillion seems like a great injustice to me, especially considering all the work that still needs to be done. \u003cbr\u003eThis message is so important and its my calling to be on the front lines creating change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you guys wanna help me to be a full time animal liberation activist that would be appreciated beyond words and I would be forever grateful. \u003cbr\u003eMy heart is in the right place and I really want to make substantive change.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActivism I do:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Street Interviews\u003cbr\u003e-Educational Vegan Videos\u003cbr\u003e-Organise, attend and support Vigils\u003cbr\u003e-Vegan Outreach\u003cbr\u003e-Train Activists on how to be effective\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Public talks\u003cbr\u003e-Travelling around supporting activist events\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is your avenue to contribute if you feel like you can\u0027t do my type of activism for your own reasons. We are all in this together and by supporting me you are supporting vegan and animal activism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEach month I will do a patreon exclusive live stream where I will talk about the activism I\u0027ve done, discuss the activism I plan to do and also answer any questions and take suggestions you have regarding my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for standing beside me and lets all work together for a vegan world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(All donations are in USD) \u003cbr\u003eP.S:\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Can you give a one time donation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Here\u0027s what it says on the Patreon FAQ: \"The best way to support your favourite Patreon creators with a one-time pledge is to become a patron and simply remove your patronage after the first of the month once your pledge has successfully processed\"."
