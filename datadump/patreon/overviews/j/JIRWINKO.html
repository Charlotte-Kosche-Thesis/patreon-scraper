    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey Guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHey guys, welcome to the Patreon. A quick introduction for those of you who stumbled here on your own, or maybe one of my subscribers was kind enough to point you here. My name\u0027s Johnathan, but everyone online just calls me JIRWINKO, and I\u0027m a big hearted guy with a passion for all things videogames. In 2013 I set out to make my own YouTube channel, inspired by the likes of Boogie2988, Markiplier and many more. Since then the channel has gone through a couple different phases, much like a plant in bloom, until it\u0027s finally blossomed into the idea I wanted it to be from the start. I\u0027m still working on getting things perfect, but I feel I\u0027m improving each week. My content runs the gambit from uploading gameplay videos in the forms of Quickplays, Let\u0027s Plays, Long Plays, and the occasional montage to my weekly episodes of my self titled web show JIRWINKO\u0027s Game Den. I also dabble in pet projects in between, such as speaking out against violence in society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I On Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy day, I\u0027m an Environmental Service Assistant (aka, a glorified housekeeper) and while I enjoy doing what I can for the elderly and making their day brighter by talking to them as I clean, it definitely doesn\u0027t pay all that much. I only rake in around $1200 a month, and that\u0027s after pushing any opportunity at overtime I can get. I\u0027m not desperate for cash, I have a roof over my head, food in my stomach, bills covered so I don\u0027t want anyone to worry, this isn\u0027t a cry for help or anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, I made a vow that I\u0027d never monetize on YouTube to keep my videos going because with how obscenely long commercials can get on there, I wanted to keep them at a minimum. To this day, I still hold true to that. But I\u0027m at a point in my life where things are stable enough, I feel it\u0027s safe to try to climb. I want to make JIRWINKO\u0027s Game Den all it can be, and while I can do that with time I know I can get there quicker with the help of my viewers. Especially, with the help of my viewers.\u003cbr\u003e"

There\u0027s a long story for me, but here isn\u0027t the place; the summary is that I\u0027m a life-long gamer, that during the last couple years has started to expand into YouTube, writing for Hooked Gamers, and more recently starting up on Twitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I On Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor the most part, I can fund my passion myself. From game purchases to equipment purchases, that part is handled by the money I earn through my day job. But, right now I can only afford to do two giveaways a year and I\u0027d like to be able to do prize giveaways more often, but of more expensive items as well. 50% of every donation will go directly into the Giveaway Prize fund, while the other 25% will be placed into an \u0027Oops Fund\u0027 making sure prizes can still be handed out for some time after should donations slow down or screech to a halt. The remaining 25% will go back as a little extra spending money; I\u0027d rather make spare cash through Patreon than limbo my way through the YT ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first goal is $2000 per year via Patreon (That\u0027s $1000 towards the Prizes directly, $500 towards the \u0027Oops Fund\u0027, and $500 for myself.) yearly, as that will more than cover giving away a $60 title a month or lesser costing titles in a larger number (those will be decided based on what\u0027s hot, and what\u0027s not. I\u0027m not going to drop critically-panned titles as prizes, that\u0027s just ridiculous that I\u0027ve seen some other channels do that to their fans.)",
