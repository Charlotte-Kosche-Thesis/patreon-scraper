    "summary": "As everybody knows, broadcasting on Twitch can be a ton of fun. It can also be a hastle if you put a lot of time into it without proper funding. I do not currently have a job. I live with my parents and I broadcast 6 days a week. I have a lot of fun doing so but I would really like to get this Channel and Community to a point to where I can keep broadcasting all the time. This is where you guys come in. Currently as I write this I do not have a Sub Button or Partnership on Twitch, but I have heard from several people that they would love to support me monthly. Well, here\u0027s your chance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon page is going to be setup as a Sub Button-esque way to support me monthly. If you wish to support me monthly at any amount then by all means, go for it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will save whatever I can to save towards hardware upgrades to the cast, new games for the future and most definitely game giveaways!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your love and support over the last year and a half. It\u0027s been an amazing ride and I would love to continue the ride. With your support I will be able to continue this for years to come. Thanks for taking the time to read this :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoseph Delaney - JoeNumb3rs"

Over the last year I\u0027ve dedicated myself to achieving partnership on Twitch. Overtime I\u0027ve come to realize that there is more to Twitch than just Partnership. I have an amazing community that I am proud of and I would love to continually grow and support that community. With your help I will be able to make my broadcasting life become my American Dream. Thank you all so much for your support :-)",
