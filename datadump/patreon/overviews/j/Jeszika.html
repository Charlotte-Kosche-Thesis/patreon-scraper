I\u0027m an Imaginative Realist painter who has had a love for stories and mythology for as long as I can remember. Since I was first able to wield a pencil, I\u0027ve been creating stories and paintings to accompany them, ever with an eye towards the classical masters who have come before me. Creating illustrated books, filled with evocative stories and full-page illustrations that draw you into another realm, has been something I have been working towards my whole life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so excited to be hard at work on just such a project and to be able to share it with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/558e6d86e4b0f74ef3e7a1b7/t/5a5c999b9140b796c4041ccc/1516018092645/Book+Title.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/558e6d86e4b0f74ef3e7a1b7/t/5a5c9dadec212d764f074557/1516019123590/Banner+-+What+is+this+project.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"From Dark Expanse, the Stars\" is an illustrated book that will be filled with beautiful, full-page illustrations, stories and poems all themed around Egyptian Mythology.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving been fascinated by Egyptian Mythology since I was a child, I am so excited to be creating a book full of these paintings, exploring the different characters and myths. But, I don\u0027t want to just create a dry summery of the myths, with the same icons for characters that I have seen so often before. Instead, I want to breathe life into the characters, to make them three-dimensional beings that struggle and triumph\u00a0and fail. I want\u00a0to take the static stories from historical myths and weave them into a tapestry of new narratives and interactions that transports you to a world of sand and stars; of light and viscous shadows; of beings that exist beyond time, but for whom the stakes are beyond our imagining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/558e6d86e4b0f74ef3e7a1b7/t/59f00dcd7131a56b168ca0f6/1508904417582/Anubis+-+Discerning+Gaze?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/558e6d86e4b0f74ef3e7a1b7/t/5a5c9d9de4966b7d9b07f890/1516019106868/Banner+-+What+is+Patreon.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a wonderful platform that allows creators to connect directly with those who love what they are creating!

     "about": "Recently, I was asked what I love to paint. I replied that I love to paint the inner workings of the human mind - the psychology, the subconscious, the motivations and choices of the characters in my paintings. It felt wrong, because it wasn\u2019t a tangible answer such as I like painting portraits or oceanscapes. But it felt right because that truly is the heart of my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always had a strong love for scifi and fantasy, for mythology. In these genres, the parameters of reality are altered just enough to explore questions of human nature, ethics, and metaphysics from an angle slightly askew and thus yield interesting insights and questions. I think this is also one of the reasons I love Imaginative Realism so much - it allows me the classical quality of realism that I have loved since I was a young child, but also, that something more - that what if?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am extremely curious, love learning and I read and collect books at a rate that is almost obsessive without any intention of slowing down! It makes sense that I have come to love creating books as much I love reading them! I am one of the owners of Boneshaker Press, a company where we are hard at work creating beautiful books of art and story. (We are about to begin our 3rd Volume of Encounters with the Imaginary in early 2018!) I am also working on my own illustrated book - a collection of stories themed around Egyptian Mythology.\u003cbr\u003e",
