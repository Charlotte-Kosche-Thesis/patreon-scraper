    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Johann Hari and I\u2019m a British\njournalist and author. For the past seven years, I have been writing\ndeeply-researched books about what I see as some of the most important issues\nfacing us as a culture \u2013 addiction, depression, anxiety. I have been trying to\nunderstand their causes, and to explain to people that their pain makes sense, and there are places in the world I have reported from that are solving these problems. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI work really hard to get what I\u2019ve\nlearned to the largest possible audience \u2013 to explain to everyone that we need\nto approach these issues with love, compassion, and a determination to deal\nwith their root causes. I try to present the best research from around the\nworld, which I spend years gathering. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy TED talk, arguing that the opposite of\naddiction is connection, has (along with the animation based on it) been viewed\nover 25 million times. I have spoken for free to groups and medical providers\narguing for a more compassionate approach, and I had advised for free many\ngroups that work on these issues. I think there\u2019s evidence this is\nmaking a real difference \u2013 I have been contacted by a huge range of people,\nfrom Mexican politicians to British members of parliament, from protesters outside\nthe UN in New York to people working with homeless people with addiction\nproblems in Sao Paulo, who say they have drawn on my work. The most moving\nemails I get are from people with addiction or depression problems themselves, who\nsay this work has led to them taking action to fight for better approaches for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have set up this Patreon because\nI\u2019ve been contacted by quite a few people asking about two separate things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly:\nI explain in my books that for each of them, I interviewed over 200 people, and\nobviously the books only quote a small number of the conversations I had. I am often asked by\npeople if they can see the other interviews and what I learned. I\u2019m conscious\nthere\u2019s a treasure trove of amazing people, and the wisdom they gave me,\nsitting in my hard drive, that I\u2019m keen to share. (For each book, I could\neasily have written a book three times as long writing about the amazing people\nI met.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSecondly: I have been contacted by\nsome people asking if they can support and help out with my future books, and\nthe work I continue to do to get the message out about everything I learned for\nmy previous books. To be honest, I\u2019ve been reluctant to respond with a Patreon.\nMy books have sold well \u2013 but I\u2019m also conscious that each one takes around\nthree years to produce. I employ my own fixers and translators across the world,\npay for my own transcriptions, fund the creation of memes and videos to get the\nmessage out, and pay for an extensive fact-checking process for the final book.\nTo gain the deep insights I hope the books contain, I have to travel and spend\ntime in many different countries properly listening to a very broad range of\npeople. More than anything, money buys the time to listen deeply and think\nabout what I have heard.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I wondered if I could bring\ntogether these two requests here on Patreon. What I\u2019d like to do is to ask for\nyour support, and in return, I\u2019d like to continue to do a lot of outreach, and\nto start to post here, a few times a month for patrons, a few things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n(1) Exclusive transcripts and audio of the\ninterviews that didn\u2019t make the cut for Chasing The Scream and Lost Connections\nbut nonetheless contain lots of insights. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e(2) Previews of my interviews for\nmy forthcoming books. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e(3) The chapters for my books that\ngot cut for space reasons but I still think contain things everyone should\nknow. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e(4) A monthly update about what I\u2019ve\nbeen working on and the progress I\u2019m making.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnything you pledge will be used\nentirely to fund research for my forthcoming books and to get the message out\nabout addiction and depression. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt will also help with my future work. Because the most expensive part of\nmy work is the travel, I am usually researching and writing a few books at the\nsame time. At the moment, I am working on deeply researching three topics for non-fiction\nbooks that will come out some time in the next ten years. (I know it\u2019s a long\ntime frame, but I like the feeling of depth that comes from really talking to\npeople again and again about the most important subjects. The faster you\u2019re\nworking, the less value there is in what you have to say, in my view. To have\nsomething worth saying, you have to spend a lot of time listening to other\npeople.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThey are:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI am, with his co-operation,\nwriting a biography of Noam Chomsky, one of the most important and humane\nintellectuals of the past century. I have interviewed Chomsky over twenty\ntimes, and I have interviewed over 300 of the most important people in his life\n\u2013 from El Salvador to the Palestinian territories to Laos. I want to present a\ndeep portrait of one of the most important thinkers of our time \u2013 because I\nbelieve from his work we can find a crucial guide to how to live, and how to\nfind our way through many of the crises facing us. Talking to Chomsky and\nstudying his work helped me to correct many things I had misunderstood or got\nwrong in my own life. I have been concentrating on gathering information and\noriginal interviews that \u2013 because they tend to come from older people \u2013 would be\nlost if I waited too long. I think these interviews will, in time, be a valuable\nhistorical resource for more than just my book.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhy can\u2019t we focus? At the same\ntime, children, the middle-aged, and the elderly have all been losing our\nability to think and focus. A society that can\u2019t focus is lost in a kind of\ndigital dementia - and can\u0027t solve the most urgent problems. I want to understand the deep reasons for this crisis \u2013 and to\ngo to places that are finding solutions. I\u2019ve already interviewed people who\nhave blown my mind on this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do people change? How do we\nchange our minds, our hearts, our personalities? Can we change ourselves? Can\nwe change other people? These seem to me to be some of the most profound\nquestions about human beings, and they are being lost in an age of social media shouting \u2013 so I have been interviewing people who study and\nwork on change across the world. In addition to the leading experts, I\u2019ve been\nfollowing a rhino-whisperer in Zimbabwe, an African-American who gets people to\nleave the Ku Klux Klan in the US, a woman who converts pimps into allies\nagainst human trafficking in Mexico City, and a cult-leader in South Africa who\nclaims to be Jesus Christ (it\u2019s a long story). Change is possible - and I have been trying to figure out its underlying rules.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019d be really grateful for your\nhelp. Think of this as a tips jar. Anything you can give helps to boost my freedom\nto work on these projects and to spread the message of love and connection more\nwidely. It also means I will be able to write these books a little faster \u2013 and\nyou\u2019ll be able to read them sooner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf just a few hundred of you chip\nin two or three or ten dollars a month, that makes a massive difference. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m British, so I have an in-built\nhatred of asking for anything, and now feel the need to apologise profusely for\nhaving been so pushy and presumptuous, but \u2013 you know what I trying to say\nhere. Sorry, sorry, sorry. And thanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
