    "summary": "I believe that there is a story that needs to be told, and told often, in my case through song. It is about a world full of people who matter, who have been made in the image of their creator, and who were made with a purpose. The world tells us everyday that we are not good enough, or that we are all alone, or that we should be someone entirely different than who we were created to be. My music is about the journey toward realizing that God is good, that he is for us and not against us, and that he wants us to know him intimately. When you support what I do, you help me to spread this story, a story that many are waiting to hear. Thank you!"

I can\u0027t guarantee that it will be a chart-topper but I will give it my very best! Daughter is getting married? Uncle Bill owes you money? You love to crochet? Yeah...I could write a song about that. In order to do this you will have to answer some questions to make sure that I get the song right though (Daughter\u0027s name, how much uncle Bill owes you, your favorite crochet pattern, etc.).\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
