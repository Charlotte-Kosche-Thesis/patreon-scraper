    "summary": "Hello dear friends\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Jessica and I\u0027m a self taught  illustrator of whimsical otherworldly realms, I\u0027ve always loved to colour and spent most of my childhood with colouring books and a prized set of faber castell pencils. Over time as that passion developed so did my love and need to paint evolve. I\u0027ve always had mixed feeling about sharing my work online, I love what I do and it\u0027s a very personal and intuitive process, but on the other hand I also know it would be a shame to create something and never have anyone else see it. I feel this could be a  great way for me to push past that and share with you my passion for creating; the good stuff and the bad, (Like all those messy work in progress stages that no one sees, before the end result just magically appears!!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVirgos work much better with deadlines and structure, though I also feel this is a perfect way to interact on a more personal level. A way for me to give something back for all the encouragement over the years, a place where we can open ourselves up to community and discussion. The internet has opened us artists/makers up to this amazing community brimming with ideas and potential, so lets use this now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Currently I am only able to do this in my spare time but I would love the ability to put more time into my craft and make the transition to be a full time artist. All things, like the seed of a mighty oak tree, have humble beginnings, but it has to start somewhere. I\u0027m very excited to share this next chapter with you all and see where it takes us. With time and as I continue to grow/build towards my goals I will be able to offer more content. So my aim here is simply that, to share with you what I love the most in the hopes I inspire you to continue or even begin your own fantastical, creative journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA believer in fairies, magical creatures and the unseen I\u0027d like to \ninvite you to enter these mystical realms with me. Whether your just \npassing by or you\u0027ve been with me for years I have so much love, \ngratitude and thanks for you all. Thank you for taking the time to be \nhere, I hope my work brings a little bit of whimsy and magic to your \nday!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLove and light!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/e750e2f875df7feb3ff421fccafe7bc2/tumblr_p1pepwtjbo1r7shrko1_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/glass_fractals/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/glass_fractals/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/saffronlungs/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/au/people/Saffronlungs?ref=hdr_user_menu\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
