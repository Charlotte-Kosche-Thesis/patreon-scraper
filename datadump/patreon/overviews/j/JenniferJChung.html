Whether you\u0027ve been a long time supporter or just recently stumbled upon my life, thanks for even considering becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy parents were both artists: My mom a dance teacher and my father a comedian - turned musician - turned activist. As a result, I\u0027ve always loved performing. I started dancing and singing at a young age, started acting in musicals and studied theater, but growing up in the arts also showed me its struggles. It\u0027s hard for any creative to make a living doing what they love, and this is where Patreon comes in. As I continue on my journey as a musician and content creator, with your help, I can continue to do that. You\u0027ll come along with me on my journey as we embark on a life that I\u0027ve always dreamed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the life I\u0027ve always dreamed of you ask?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe only live one life and my goal is to create as much as I can: \u003cstrong\u003eauthentically\u003c/strong\u003e and not limit myself from possibilities. So many times I was pursuing my artistic life and felt cornered by financial duties. I hope I can create without the corruption of fear. I will continue to write music and perform, but I am also vlogging, acting, and writing. Perhaps in the future I\u0027ll create the podcast I\u0027ve always wanted to or produce the web series I\u0027ve been writing. WHO KNOWS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do know, is that my patrons will be the first to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help you ask?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePledge to become a patron in whatever amount makes you happy and doesn\u0027t burden you! I want this to be good times for all of us. \u003cstrong\u003ePlease note: \u003c/strong\u003eIf you do decide to pledge, at the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003every end\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0of the check out process, you can opt to add a \"monthly max.\" This is so that if you want to be charged $5/month, just say you want to \u003cstrong\u003esupport one time per month\u003c/strong\u003e.
