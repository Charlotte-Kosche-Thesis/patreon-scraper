    "summary": "I don\u2019t know what has brought you here at this exact moment at this exact time, but something. Something here. Something in the world or in the universe. Something, has brought you here. Some might say it\u2019s coincidence, while others may say it\u2019s destiny. But me, I would say life, emotion, or what I call connection has brought you here. Or maybe I told you, hey go check out my page lol!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomething I feel we lack in this world is connection, which is somehow ironic to me because there are so many outlets and platforms for people to connect. Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, etc etc etc. Yea, it keeps us up to date with the world, I guess. But does it really? Yes, due to these platforms, I\u2019ve gone vegan. Well, I eat vegan. I\u2019m more aware of what my family, my friends, my coworkers, my ex\u2019s, all of these people, what they are doing, but am I, am I really more connected? Are you more connected? Are we more connected?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo where am I going with this right? Well I live for connection. I breathe connection, in a world where it seems as though we have so many opportunities to do so, yet we just don\u2019t or can\u2019t. Well me. That\u2019s what I do. I offer connection. I create connection. Connection among people. Among humans. Among what I think of us as, beings. So what do I mean by connection? Well that\u2019s my term. Some might say I\u2019m creating happiness or love or strength, maybe bravery or vulnerability. Yikes. I know that may sound scary to some of you. Just hang in there. I call it connection because that\u2019s how it makes me feel. It makes me feel understood, felt, and connected. How? Well hey I could pull the I\u2019m a therapist card, but I won\u2019t. If anything you are probably really wanting to run for the hills now lol. I\u2019m not here to psychoanalyze you or \u2018fix\u2019 you. No, I\u2019m not trying to label you or judge. I have a purple hair for fucks sake. I offer connection by being truly present, something that does not exist anymore these days. I offer connection by being genuine. By being me, being myself. You might be thinking, yea, ok. Sure. But I mean it. I have the ability to transcend into others. I want to create connections through screens that are real. No I\u2019m not trying to replace Tinder or anything. I am merely creating a lane of connection that doesn\u2019t exist that I think we, as beings have been missing. We\u2019ve been needing, craving and longing for, for months, years, possibly a decade or two. Who might be in need of connection? You tell me. Do you feel alone? Or misunderstood? Have you recently moved, lost a loved one, or you\u2019re going through a break up? Maybe. If you feel like there\u2019s something missing? Maybe. Only you\u2019ll know. So if you\u2019re down. Down baby down (Marian Hill). Come join me in creating the connection you feel you\u2019ve been lacking or maybe even craving. All aboard. Strong"
