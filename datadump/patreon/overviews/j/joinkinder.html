Good morning!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough digital media, (young) people are constantly confronted with problems in the world. But it\u2019s too hard to choose a charitable organisation to support, because there are so many. It\u2019s unclear if donations will actually make a difference due to a lack of transparency, payment schemes are difficult and people don\u2019t know what happens to their data. The result: they do nothing at all, even though they do care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if trust in the charitable sector could be regained and the will to donate could be restored? What if we would fund only those solutions that actually help in tackling our world\u2019s biggest problems? What if we could help charitable organisations get back to business and downsize overhead costs?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eGOOD NEWS: KINDER CAN!\u003c/h1\u003eIt is Kinders mission to make operations of charitable organisations 100% transparent and get them to focus on the core business. In cooperation with Impact Centre Erasmus (Erasmus University Rotterdam) Kinder developed a \u003ca href=\"http://kinder.now-js.daan.dev.mobynext.com/foundation\"\u003edynamic academic vetting framework\u003c/a\u003e to identify the effectiveness of organisations, and every single one is vetted thoroughly before being added to the donating widgets.\u003cbr\u003eOnce they get the stamp of approval, organisations will not have to be distracted by time consuming private fundraising and marketing anymore, because Kinder does that for them. The main Kinder services are explained below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eKINDER WORLD\u003c/h1\u003eTo create awareness, reestablish trust in the sector and give people the opportunity to donate immediately, \u003ca href=\"http://kinder.now-js.daan.dev.mobynext.com/foundation\"\u003eKinder Foundation\u003c/a\u003e is setting up the Kinder World platform.\u003cbr\u003eThis will be a state of the art online media platform, created to reach the (young) public and meet their present-day ways of content consuming. The platform contains stories about the most inspiring and effective charitable organisations, updates about milestones and the impact they have had, but also feel-good content and stories on learnings/challenges in the world of doing good. The Kinder donating tools are integrated on the platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eDONATING WIDGETS\u003c/h1\u003eIn the online donating tools, offered on the platform and in a mobile app, users are presented with Kinder approved charitable organisations in several cause areas.\u003cbr\u003eUsers can pick new organisations to support anytime, there\u2019s no need to commit to recurring payments or to give out personal data. Amounts and frequency of donations are flexible. Users get informed about charitable organisations and updates from projects on their own terms, based on preferences and behaviour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eSECTOR IMPROVING TOOLS\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.kinderdonations.org/foundation\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://kinder.now-js.daan.dev.mobynext.com/foundation\"\u003eKinder Foundation\u003c/a\u003e stimulates charitable organisations that don\u0027t get included (yet) to improve their operations by creating and handing out tools (e.g. white papers, personalized advice, newsletters and assessments). This way, learning and sharing within the sector is stimulated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
