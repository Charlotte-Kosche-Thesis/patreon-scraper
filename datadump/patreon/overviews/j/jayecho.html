I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eJayEcho\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eI draw a little bit of everything and I\u0027m trying to make money for something!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/72GNqlL.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I mentioned, My name is \u003cstrong\u003eJay \"JayEcho\" Echols\u003c/strong\u003e. I draw various kinds of art and try to make a little of pretty decent. Main things I dig drawing are Anthros, Character Designs, and Game Assets. I\u0027m really excited about delving into concept art and comic art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the time I\u0027ve been on the scene making artwork though, it\u0027s discouraging kind of hoping that people see my art some day to actually spend money on me when I need to do commissions. Learning about \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e gave me the excellent idea of\u00a0trying\u00a0to make something actually fruitful with the assurance of consistent compensation. As much as passion is capable of making great stuff come to be, you unfortunately can\u0027t eat and save up for stuff with just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this where you guys come into play. Helping me out here gives me so much confidence and ability to invest \u00a0time into creating\u00a0projects\u00a0that\u00a0would otherwise interfere with my life. Things like learning to make games and comics for you guys can all be possible when I know for sure someone\u00a0wants them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo welcome~!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WBqSUOM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron I commit my efforts to providing my work to you guys in a exclusive manner. Many of you will receive personalized artwork from me, preview shots of my work, and even at some point an influence of what even comes into fruition for some projects as well. Best of all when I can work on some comics in time, You guys will be the first to see it for a while~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m super open to more suggestions like CYOAs, YCHs, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nGcBlUV.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig thing I\u0027m doing especially, \u003cstrong\u003eMonday\u003c/strong\u003e streams! Once I get used to it I\u0027ll have a specific time I\u0027m comfortable with. For now, the important part is that it\u0027s happening. So i\u0027ll see you soon and I\u0027ll make regular posts on what time the stream will be. So see you there~!\u00a0Here\u0027s the link!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than that folks, I\u0027m just a dude tryign to make it happen. You guys are a tremendous factor in helping me out and I appreciate you so much. Love you all and as usual manner calls for...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ir3B97Y.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
