The outdoors industry \nand outdoors social media tend to display a very narrow definition of \nwho is \u201coutdoorsy.\u201d We feature fat people, people of color, queer, \ntrans, gender nonconforming folks, people with disabilities\n and so on, doing what they love in nature. We also raise up \nconversations about mental health and the healing powers of nature. We \nall have a story. If you see yourself as an Unlikely Hiker, then you \nare. Welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis venture is building invaluable community, I think that\u2019s obvious to everyone who follows \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/unlikelyhikers\"\u003eUnlikely Hikers\u003c/a\u003e.

I\u0027m obviously getting a lot of opportunities and \"followers\" (I still hate that we use that word!) and I\u0027m beyond grateful! BUT the truth is community building efforts, interviews and even tv and radio airtime don\u0027t usually pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m spending extremely long days working on Unlikely Hikers, with no days off, for almost nothing. Obviously, this isn\u0027t sustainable and it has begun to affect my wellness. You wouldn\u0027t believe the hours I put into planning, researching and conducting group hikes alone! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created some monthly incentives for donations!
