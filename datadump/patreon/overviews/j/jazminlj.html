Thank u to Danica Lani \u0026amp; Amanda Palmer, my friends \u0026amp; family \u0026amp; community for giving me permission \u0026amp; encouraging me to share this..\u003cbr\u003eThis is my offering..for those who want poetry, or want to like poetry, like or love me,are here coz i asked them ( thanxs mum :P) are curious, are transforming the world or ended up here on a late night internet rambling..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t won any awards .im not very fussy about grammar.\u00a0 Ive been a spoken word poet for my 20 year career. The best financial kudos i ever had was a plane ticket from Perth to Newcastle Writers Festival where i slept on a mattress on the second story of a cafe with 7 other people (not on the same mattress)\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI have written poetry since primary school.Then I plagiarised myself in highschool for straight A\u0027s\u00a0 (sorry Mrs.Bastille) After a LOT of circumstances i started writing poetry again just before my Saturn return.. talk about therapoetry! It was such a profound experience for me to write my thoughts \u0026amp; feelings about\u00a0\u003cem\u003eeverything- \u003c/em\u003ethe good, bad, beautiful, ugly, mundane \u0026amp; extraordinary ( \u0026amp; my judgements of it all!) \u0026amp; for it to unravel from me in a cohesive way that transformed not only my experience into something that could be considered art, but also transformed my actual experience. To find myself in my own words- this was a (r)evolution! i figured i am not soo unique, maybe this poetry will touch or move or inspire or comfort others...\u003cbr\u003eDecades have passed .. i have spoken these words in community \u0026amp; church halls. at festivals \u0026amp; fetes, events \u0026amp; evenings, cafes, restaurants \u0026amp; pubs, in fields, on trains \u0026amp; in beloveds ears..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebut I have been afraid,, an often critical inner dialogue stopped me from sharing myself. Fortunately life offered me a bigger game \u0026amp; i had the generous opportunity to get perspective on that voice \u0026amp; realise its just a part of my psyche that was trying to stop me getting hurt.. unfortunately it was also stopping me experiencing life..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being here.\u00a0 Thanks for being curious \u0026amp; wanting to connect. May u find reflections of yourself, of your perfections \u0026amp; feel our human connection \u0026amp; the swelling of the heart at this recognisation, that we call love. coz love is what im about .. \u0026amp; if any or all of the above happen for u, even for a micromoment, this is a success. \u0026amp; if it doesn\u0027t u can be consoled that at least im not still taking drugs or selling them to (yr)children\u00a0 :p\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is a membership platform that makes it easy for creators to get paid\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Becoming a member of this Patreon community gives you access to inspiring content and poetry that I share with my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can change your subscription at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will allow me to spend more time on creating poetry, promoting \u0026amp; facilitating Biodanza, making raw chocolate \u0026amp; sharing lives that we love...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emay you be touched, moved, interested, inspired, comforted, reassured \u0026amp; even delighted \u0026amp; transformed\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
