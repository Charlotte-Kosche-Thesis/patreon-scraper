We moved a lot throughout my childhood and my 3rd grade year was spent in China\u00a0(as culturally foreign a place as an 8 year old could imagine). \u00a0In 7th grade I had a radio show at the local college, each week borrowing a backpack full of CDs and immersing myself in the world of contemporary music. \u00a0At 15 years old I went to a Grateful Dead concert, at 17 my first rave. \u00a0By 19 I was spending my college vacations touring the country, receiving a uniquely experiential education in the way that community comes together around live music. \u00a0Over the following 5 years I lived in London, San Francisco, and Brooklyn. \u00a0In each I observed the various ways that human creativity expressed itself and was put on display to shape (and be shaped by) society; from art museum to warehouse party, from medieval cathedral to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://burningman.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBurning Man\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt 25, I met the work of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRudolf Steiner\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and found a frame big enough to include the diverse ideas that had been forming inside of me. The notion that human consciousness itself was evolving fit with the phenomenon of my life. \u00a0I studied Steiner\u0027s insights and\u00a0traveled the world visiting the practical legacy of Waldorf Education, Biodynamic Farming, Camphill Communities and more. \u00a0Slowly the ground came up to meet visions that had always felt like they were visiting from the future. \u00a0A friend once joked that when we were in conversation he had \"Vuj\u00e0 D\u00e9\" - the reoccurring feeling that we were catching a glimpse of what could be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, approaching 40 years old, there is the feeling that the future is asking me to take another important step.
