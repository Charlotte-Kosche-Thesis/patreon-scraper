Been doing the thing since 2006. Being the youngest of three brothers, I soaked up all my brother\u0027s geeky habits and became one giant otaku mess. I\u0027ve always loved performing and was totally an attention whore growing up XD Cosplay was an amazing outlet where I could become the characters I loved and somehow showcase what I\u0027m capable of. I pride myself in creating all my own costumes and props. Self-taught and with a lot of scars to show for it, I REALLY enjoy what I do. When I graduated from high school, I didn\u0027t get to go to college right away because of immigration issues. So, I worked. I\u0027d walk to work every morning \u003cstrong\u003ewith big dreams\u003c/strong\u003e that motivated me to keep on walking (and cause I didn\u0027t have a car). Eventually, I began building myself up. I bought my first car, a camera, took photography classes, bought a computer, lights, editing software and anything and everything through my own sweat and money. All because I wanted to have the tools \u003cstrong\u003eto become someone one day\u003c/strong\u003e. I taught myself photoshop and as previously mentioned even took photography classes. Now I\u0027m even going to school so I can keep on learning and continue building the skills I need to not have to depend on anyone. BUT eventually, we all need a budget to get to where we want to go.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Qkx2G3F.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAs an artist, you\u0027re always looking for outlets to \u003cstrong\u003egrow\u003c/strong\u003e and expose your work to more people. I love what I do and want to be able to show my audience A LOT MORE. I\u0027m a really hard worker and I\u0027m known for creating every aspect of my own content. From setting up lights, backdrops, and taking my own photos; to post editing, compositing, and obviously making my own costumes. I\u0027d love to do more video work as well. All of the equipment I own, I\u0027ve had to buy myself. I don\u0027t get photographers and editors lining up to shoot my work, so I\u0027ve been doing (mostly) everything myself for years now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e Every dollar raised through Patreon would go to creating more quality content (photos, videos, tutorials, etc.). There are so many things I\u0027d love to create and share with the world, but the budget has not allowed it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what are my goals?\u003c/strong\u003e To create BETTER content. As mentioned, more \u003cstrong\u003ecomposites\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003evideos\u003c/strong\u003e. More tutorials and even be able to \u003cstrong\u003etravel\u003c/strong\u003e to other cities to get to meet the people that support me. A major goal this year is to release \u003cstrong\u003emusic\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve done some in the past but I want to take over the world this time. To do so, paying a producer is the first step. If monetary goals are met, expect tracks and even a music video by this summer. HELP ME GO ON TOUR TO THE ENTIRE WORLD!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jcsujRs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e guys in advance for everything. Seriously. For years I\u0027ve been surviving and motivating myself just through people\u0027s love and admiration. However, I really want to grow and expose the quality of work you beautiful people deserve. Every dollar will not go unrewarded. Check out the perks of supporting me on the side bar. \u003cstrong\u003eJoin me in making this world a better place, one hentai at a time!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DW97Ofz.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
