    "summary": "I never thought I would be a writer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a librarian by training, a mom, a soapmaker, and a small business owner. When my friend asked me to write an article about parenting and mental health for her online magazine,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thewildword.com\"\u003eThe Wild Word\u003c/a\u003e, I thought, well, why not put my big mouth to use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy big mouth has gotten me in trouble plenty of times, but now I use it to tell the truth in areas of our lives where we\u0027re not doing that enough. My goal in writing is to make people (especially moms) feel less alone, by telling it like it really is and sharing my authentic experiences. So often we feel like we\u0027re slogging through alone or we\u0027re doing it wrong, because our lives don\u0027t seem to match all the shining smiling Facebook pics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say we call bullshit on the perfect social media life, and share our authentic lives instead. For me, that includes plenty of adorable pics of my gorgeous kids--but it also includes raising an adopted teenage daughter with serious mental health struggles, wrangling our Little Dictator preschooler son who has super monkey climbing powers and a will of iron, trying to run a business, and at times struggling with my own depression.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to help create communities of moms that support each other, whether that be online or in real life. I think the more we tell our our stories and speak our truths, the more supported and empowered we feel. I am also passionate about being an advocate for mental health awareness and supporting parents of mentally ill and disabled kids.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a monthly parenting column, Behind Domestic Lines, in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thewildword.com\"\u003eThe Wild Word\u003c/a\u003e magazine, and my articles are also featured in Huffington Post, where some have gone viral (!). One of my articles was used in an NHS campaign on mental health awareness, and I\u0027ve also been published in a South African magazine. If you can relate to my writing and want to help support it, thank you so much. I promise to keep it real.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind my company on the web at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dancingbeefarms.net\"\u003eDancing Bee Farms\u003c/a\u003e, and my articles at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thewildword.com\"\u003eThe Wild Word\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
