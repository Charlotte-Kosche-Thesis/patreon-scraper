You let me bounce ideas off you, you provide feedback, and you cheer me on. Your very presence creates a much needed, a much valued sense of expectation that I\u2019m able to use to keep myself moving forward with projects, even if it\u2019s sometimes two steps forward, one hundred steps back. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR\u003c/strong\u003e: three tiers, $5 or less. Story Subscription tier is dropping to $3\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seem to have a few super powers, most of which I use for evil. Strong imagination? I find creative health conditions to entertain myself with.  (Because multi-day long heart burn is totally a sign of cartiac arrest, especially when accompanied by cramps in your toe, right?) Like the idea of making a hand-bound book? Berate myself instead because I can\u2019t grow the plant from seed, to render into pulp, to make the paper, and I can\u2019t DIY the glue, and have it all ready to go right now because obviously I\u2019m a horrible person. Enjoy my Patreon projects? Let\u2019s keep piling on the pressure and not feel free to drop things or set them aside when they don\u2019t work out because people are watching and they\u2019ll know you can\u2019t do any of this crap.  I can suck the joy out of any thing I\u2019m happy to be working on or experimenting with in no time flat. Super powers for the win.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are my plans for 2018? Mostly, to have fun with creating. Right now, what I\u2019m looking at are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLetters to Poseidon\u003c/strong\u003e. Back in the day, the first type of meditation I ever did was writing letters to Poseidon. Before I devoted myself to him, before becoming Serious About Worship, before I even had my yoga practice, I had letters. I\u2019m sporadic about them, but I miss them, and lately I really miss the sense of connection to him that they provided. I\u2019m picking them back up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[update 3/30/18: so far, the above isn\u0027t happening, and I don\u0027t know that I\u0027m going to even make it it happen.

I think this will be a nice challenge for myself, and I think it will be more sustainable, too. Much as I enjoy the few novellas I\u2019ve released in the last two years, I\u2019m also bored with that particular world and set of characters. (Are we supposed to admit that? I don\u2019t think so, but you know how I feel about keeping it real.)  I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019ll do my damnedest to make a single story not span more than two installments, and the minimum 2000 words is remaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003eI\u2019m making my #birthdaywritingchallenge into a \u003cstrong\u003edaily writing challenge\u003c/strong\u003e: ten minutes of writing (nearly) every day, without limits, without guidelines, without goals.

Learn the lesson, Jo: daily anything other than taking care of the critters and the house are not a thing I\u0027m willing to sign up for.
