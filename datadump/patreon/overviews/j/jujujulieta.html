Constant rejection from her real-world peers eventually led her to making great friends with the characters on her TV screen. She now dreams of creating TV friends for the many lonely kids who are just too socially inept to understand why teachers do not need to know they were supposed to check homework that day. She wishes she had more time to do and draw everything she wants, without having to sacrifice sleep.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
