If that\u0027s the case, you\u0027re most certainly not alone: I do too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly a few years ago did I realize how difficult it was to create these pieces of writing\u00a0that I had taken for granted. My favorite books weren\u0027t things that just \"happened\" overnight. Those stories I read growing up didn\u0027t just appear on paper in a quick month or two (or three, or four!) Those were created over years of hard work and dedication. Upon realizing this, I decided that I wanted to make something of my own. I wanted to put something back into that massive sea of material I had been taking from, and so I began to write. Or... more accurately, I tried to write. My goal was give something to the world that someone (someday) might pick up and read. I took the plunge headfirst, and I was \u003cstrong\u003eterrible\u003c/strong\u003e. Several years later, I posted my first story online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the guy who\u00a0rambled on with r/writingprompts to generate\u00a0\"\u003cem\u003eThe Snake Report\" \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eThe Dark Lord Gillian\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(\u003c/em\u003ewhile occasionally takes on a serious one-shot writingprompt for fun!)
