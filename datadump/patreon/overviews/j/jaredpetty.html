For a long time, I\u2019ve wanted to tell that great big story, and \u003cstrong\u003enow I\u2019m taking my shot.\u003c/strong\u003e I believe in it so much, I just quit my job to do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHop, Blip, and a Jump is \u003cstrong\u003epart-diary, part documentary,\u003c/strong\u003e a series of bite-sized videos highlighting gaming\u2019s beautiful and magical moments, with each episode\u2019s theme leading right into the next. Past, present, and future, we\u2019ll explore it all, and learn how the genius of one invention inspires another, and how each majestic moment in games moves us to make the real world a more wonderful place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHop, Blip, and a Jump is a \u003cstrong\u003ecelebration\u003c/strong\u003e of what makes this art form special, and \u003cstrong\u003ean escape\u003c/strong\u003e from the regular screaming and unfiltered noise of the internet. It\u2019s thoughtful, it\u2019s quiet, it\u2019s concise, it\u2019s informative, and it\u2019s inspiring, but I promise it will never be boring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really ever been anything quite like this series in the world of games, and I encourage you to \u003cstrong\u003ewatch the inaugural episode\u003c/strong\u003e to get an idea of where we\u2019re heading. It\u2019s the kind of project that\u2019s not a great fit for traditional ad-supported games media outlets, but that I believe matters. But it can only exist with your backing and your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew episodes of Hop, Blip, and a Jump will be released, well.. when they\u0027re done! I\u0027ll send each out as soon as the video quality comes together to meet the standards I\u0027m setting, but you can rest assured updates will be regular. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother part of Hop, Blip, and a Jump is \u003cstrong\u003eRed Dead Radio: The Red Dead Redemption Podcast with Jared Petty\u003c/strong\u003e. Every week we welcome a Wild Wild Guest and take a deep dive into the news around Rockstar\u0027s Red Dead Redemption 2 and visit the history of the Old West in popular culture: TV, film, books, games, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also continue producing \u003cstrong\u003ePockets Full of Soup\u003c/strong\u003e, because it matters deeply to me and I believe in it. Pockets Full of Soup is a \u003cstrong\u003estorytelling show\u003c/strong\u003e about the people who help make us who we are. Sometimes the stories are funny, sometimes they\u2019re sad, but they\u2019re always meaningful. Hosted by Jared Petty, Pockets Full of Soup asks a rotating group of interesting guests a simple question: \u201cwho are you thankful for?\u201d I will be producing fewer episodes per month to place a greater emphasis on production and keeping the conversations and guests as interesting as possible, but rest assured Pockets will remain a part of my life and yours for the foreseeable future.\u003cbr\u003e"
