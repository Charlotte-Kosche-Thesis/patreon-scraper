    "summary": "I write things, particularly fanworks for people to enjoy. My fandom of expertise is Overwatch but I can and will write many other things, especially by request. I write angst, fluff, SFW, NSFW, practically anything you can name and I always enjoy flexing my writing muscles with rarepairs. If you\u0027ve got a rarepair and it needs more love, I can be there. There are no pairings that I won\u0027t find someway to make work, it doesn\u0027t need to be romantic. I love challenging myself with other people\u0027s interpretations of characters and situations. Weird AUs and head cannons are fun to write and I love adding interesting unique content to the vast library of fanworks. Support my writing for a little, or if there is something you\u0027ve always wanted to read try a bit more and get something written specifically for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because I am a young man who is currently living with his boyfriend\u0027s homophobic family out of necessity. I want to turn my mild talent for writing into something constructive that might help me get the two of us in a much better place, not to mention deal with my student debt. I am trying to use the power of fandom writing to make myself and other people happy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support no matter how little would be amazingly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
