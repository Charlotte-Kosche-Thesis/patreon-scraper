     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003e Good Morning Patreaon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e        \u201c\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u2019s going to be an aquarium\u201d, I told them. When I was 15 I collected old tube televisions and tediously cut the glass with a Dremel tool. The speakers were hooked up to sound machine alarm clocks and would play the noises of the jungle or waves as fish swam on channel 5. I experimented with lamps of all kinds and amateur taxidermy. The howl of punk rock music filled the space and acrylic paint sealer held my hair into the proper spiked mohawk I wanted. Music and dance dominated my creative life. It would take years to harness the power in that kid and make him believe he was a sculptor. I was a vandal and a pissed off Mormon kid. That was my art school experience, my renaissance. \u003cbr\u003e\n        I served a 2 year Mormon Mission which tempered the vandal. I wanted to be a teacher and great story teller. I got my Bachelors degree in Speech Communications from the University of Southern Mississippi. While living in the Florida Keys, I worked as an aluminum fabricator and welder. Somewhere along the way I got married then un-married. The frustration of the hopeless romantic was channeled into art and writing. In 2006 I used a plasma cutter to cut the words \u201cMohawk Steel\u201d into a scrap piece of iron at the USM art department. About that time I was getting serious into Rock Climbing and decided to move to Las Vegas to climb and work. After popping a pulley on \u201cThe Pearl\u201d in the Kraft Boulders at Red Rocks I was comforted by the charm of a wild eyed Venezuelan climber who moved like nobody I\u2019d ever seen. When I think back to meeting Gustavo Moser, he was more an omen or a stone carving of a monkey that I wished into carnation.  He and his crew invited me to deep water solo in Mallorca, Spain in September of 2010. My life has never been the same since, I was not afraid of failing anymore. Life became about climbing and sculpture. I wanted to make my mark. Within weeks Ben Watts and I started an Art Gallery in Columbia, MS. It began with bottle trees and industrial furniture. The pieces got bigger and the clients more prestigious. \u201cThomley\u2019s monumental commissioned works include a 10,000 pound, 33\u00adfoot Yeti for RAMP Sports in Park City, Utah; an 11,000 pound, 30\u00adfoot Whomping Willow Tree for a London client on property in Bunker Hill, Mississippi; an 900 pound, 8\u00adfoot Comedy/Tragedy mask for William Carey University in Hattiesburg, Mississippi; and a 6,000 pound, 9\u00adfoot ICONIC for Jones Companies corporate offices in Columbia, Mississippi.\u201d \u00adLegends Magazine May, 2015. \u003cbr\u003e\n      As the sculptures got bigger I entertained fewer and fewer clients, leaving more time to go climb. Soon I was back with Gustavo, this time in the jungles of Venezuela hiking up a remote mountain in the Amazon. The Ayuan Tepui is a mystical and beautiful place of dreams that inspired films like Avatar and is home to Angel Falls. We spent 18 days bouldering and climbing rocks, making maps and being thankful. When we came down from the mountains and got back to Caracas we found ourselves in the middle of civil war. The most creative experience I have ever had was establishing climbs on incredible rock atop a country hellbent to destroy itself. If you want to read more, you can find it in Climbing Magazine June, 2016. ??? This adventure was a sculpture; the crew, the food, the planning. The photography was world class beautiful. It reminded me how much I love to teach and how important it is to live your dreams out loud. There was a shift, a decision to share. I allowed myself to become vulnerable like I was on the Tepui. \u003cbr\u003e\n      The transition from folk to fine art was really interesting. In 2013 I began collaborating with glassblower Daniel Bell. He is a childhood friend who really took interest in the story I would call \u003cem\u003eAnthem\u003c/em\u003e. This is where the sharing begins: I have a lung disease called Cystic Fibrosis. Since I could remember I have lived summer to summer waiting to run out of breath. It has impacted my every decision, and especially my art. I was chosen as the Festival South featured artist for 2015. In June of 2015 \u003cem\u003eAnthem\u003c/em\u003e opened at Oddfellows in Downtown Hattiesburg. This series of blown glass and steel lung sculptures were a triumph over a disease and celebration of friendships. \u003cem\u003eAnthem\u003c/em\u003e was a very vulnerable and humbling experience. The film also called \u003cem\u003eAnthem\u003c/em\u003e directed by Benjamin Smith was winner of the Audience Choice award at the Festival South Film Expo in June, 2015. It was also accepted into the Austin Film Festival \u0026amp; DocUtah Film Festival. \u003cbr\u003e\n      The next step in the \u201cPhilosophy of Touch\u201d was to have easier access to blowing glass. This was the best way I found to capture breath for my Anthem sculptures. It also made my imagination run wild as the possibilities were endless while mixing glass and steel. In Jan 2016 I bought a Mobile Glassblowing Furnace and Daniel moved back to MS for a few months to help build a Hot Shop on my family\u2019s Christmas Tree Farm. We opened the business in October and by December it was a runaway train. The biggest stretch of the imagination was turning my welding shop into a beautiful pop-up restaurant where we threw a wild week of sold out Valentines Dinners with Chef Katie Dixon. We really had a great time creating an experience for people that was one of a kind. The whole night was a sculpture- it was storytelling, fire, fine food \u0026amp; art. \u003cbr\u003e\n      That summer of 2017 I married my lovely climbing partner, and with her 10 year old son we began a new chapter. After Lindsay and I got hit by that car in Paris I knew I really loved her; after Spain I knew we should live together. After New Zealand we got married and fell face first into a life I am so thankful for. After a little Honeymoon climbing in Cabo, our second season of glassblowing began. Our first day back in the shop was the busiest day we have ever had. I can\u2019t say whats next, but I know as I get older it will be harder to survive deportations and divorces. I welcome some parts of my life settling down. I was illuminated recently by a comment from an old friend of my family, he knew me as a little boy. He asked me what it was like to know I had achieved 35 times more than anyone thought i ever would? I thought of my Pawpaw, who tho incredibly brilliant wondered in his later years if he had lived up to his own potential? I don\u2019t want to have that thought, I would rather be remembered as a man who had the audacity to live and was a breathless student of beauty.\u003cbr\u003e\n      I promise that with your patronage I will finish writing my first book. \u201cThe Philosophy of Touch\u201d The chapters will be released and refined here before they are bound and sold. It has taken many lovers and many fails to learn the lessons I want to share. I cannot wait to become prefect or dead before I share these discoveries. I seek an awoke audience. We will discuss everything from quantum entanglement and cold thermogenesis to how to kiss your lover.  I have so many films to share, so many people you must meet. I have been given much, its time to give back. My Anthem is Breath.\u003cbr\u003e",
