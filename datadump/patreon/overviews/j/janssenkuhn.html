    "summary": "As a lifelong music maker, I\u0027ve wished for a way to find patronage for writing original tunes. Since people freely donate money to me for freely playing existing music, why not have some help creating new, original tunes?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReleasing my new album of traditional fiddle tunes, I am more inspired than ever to start channelling fresh melodies from wherever those transcendent butterflies exist. It\u0027s clear to me that as a fiddler, having some of my own great tunes to play will upgrade my career. And I can contribute to the endless well of traditional music throughout the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t already, you can download and steam my new record at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://await.be\"\u003eawait.be\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOffer as little or as much as you want per tune. A tune, in the context of traditional music that is typically 32 bars long, which is repeated and elaborated on at the players disgression. A tune is pretty much a short melody that is repeated and can stand on its own. The theme from \u0027The Last of the Mohicans\u0027 and Ashoken Fairwell from the Civil War miniseries are good popular examples.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach tune will be published with the music notation and an audio recording or video of me playing the tune. This not only lets me share my creations with you, my patrons, but also puts the tunes out there for anyone who might want to play them. That is, afterall, how traditional music becomes actual tradition.\u00a0.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will! be offering generous supporters to have a tune named for them or their favorite cat, as is tradition. The rate will start at $20, but will rise as demand dictates. I do need to save some tunes to name after influential friends and local landmarks, as also is tradition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to seeing how this goes, and really appreciate every bit of financial support I get!\u003cbr\u003e"
