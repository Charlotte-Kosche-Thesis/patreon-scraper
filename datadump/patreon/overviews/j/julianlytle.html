    "summary": "Hello, I\u2019m Julian Lytle and I make things. You might be thinking what in the world does that mean? Over the years I have many different creative exploits in art, comics, podcasting, and criticism. Some of you might know me from my 9-year-old Glyph award nominated webcomic,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ants.thejulianlytle.com/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnts\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0and some might know me from my podcast\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ignorant-bliss.com/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIgnorant Bliss.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e , In the 7 years, the show has been around I\u2019ve been able to have some amazing guests on my show from Ronald Wimberly, Shawn Pryor, Joseph Illidge, Ramon Villalobos, David Brothers, Ulises Farinas, Jamila Rowser, Karama Horne (The Blerd Gurl) and many more. Inbtween creating comics, drawing stuff, and recording and editing a long-running podcast I also review films, which at times I also make audio reviews for the podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the above is completely funded by me. So this Patreon is to help offset (cue offset ab libs here) some of the costs of production of all of this and hope to improve the quality of the podcast with better equipment along with ways to increase the reach of the show. This would also help to fund the production of physical versions of my comics like Ants and future projects for conventions and online sales. This will also give you, the Patrons access to creations from me that other wouldn\u2019t necessarily see plus early access to comics and my show before I put it on the standard show feed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*I want to thank everyone who is supporting me and has supported me through sharing my stuff or purchasing things I\u2019ve made."
