    "summary": "Thank you for supporting me on Patreon! Your support allows me to set aside more time to concentrate on quality uploads for YouTube, and will help fund purchases that will create more content as well. With YouTube demonetizing many of my vids, any small compensation that I had for my time is almost gone, and Patreon support allows me the freedom to stop working for a few hours and do something I really enjoy. If you enjoy my content, becoming a supporter will assure you that you\u0027ll see it more consistently. It\u0027s hard to stop working in the shop (every hour pays a bill for my family) to sit down and make videos. Between photography, video time, editing and uploading, I spend 2-4 hours PER video. This is time that I do not, and can not make any money. Supporting me as a Patron also allows me some extra cash to invest in more product to review, and possibly upgrades to my equipment and editing software too."
