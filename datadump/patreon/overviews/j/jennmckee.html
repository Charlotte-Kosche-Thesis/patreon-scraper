    "summary": "For twelve years (2004-2016), I worked passionately as a staff arts reporter/critic for The Ann Arbor News. Plus, during many of those years, I also filed occasional freelance theater reviews (with EncoreMichigan.com) of productions that spanned the greater Detroit area. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, though, my fate was that of nearly every professional arts critic in a print newsroom these days: I got laid off.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that hit me hard. But since that time, I\u0027ve continued to cover the local arts scene on a freelance basis, for all kinds of publications, and launched my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://a2artsaddict.com/\"\u003eA2 Arts Addict\u003c/a\u003e blog as a kind of clearing house for all my projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven so, there\u0027s been one consistent problem: theater criticism \u2013 the very work that I love and do best \u2013 is damn near impossible to place in this region. The publications that still make room for reviews, let alone pay for what \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e, I assure you, skilled labor, are few, leaving me and my fellow newsroom-banished critics fighting for scraps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegional theater criticism has thus been devalued to the point of irrelevance, but I refuse to shrug and abandon it. There\u0027s a reason I spend between three and four hours on every review I write, and then feel utterly spent, as though I\u0027ve\u00a0sacrificed yet another piece of my soul. It\u0027s because intellectually grappling with art is a rigorous, sometimes painful act; but it\u0027s also a sublimely rewarding one. Nothing else (short of therapy) forces us, in quite the same way, to confront and process our biases, beliefs, pain, and illusions. And ideally, when a review is well-executed, its reader instantly has a response \u2013 because criticism is about launching, not shutting down, further conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in this tumultuous time, we need more and better communication with each other, not less.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m here to humbly, gratefully ask you to support my mission to keep professional theater criticism alive in the Detroit/Ann Arbor area. After wrestling with the realities of the current media landscape, I\u0027ve concluded that the only way my dream can happen is by following the example of public radio (as well as subscription services like Netlfix and Hulu) and asking readers and friends to consider pledging a few dollars each month to this cause. The more funding I can secure, the more high quality local theater criticism I can offer to you all each month \u2013 something I\u0027m so, so excited to do. Thank you so much for reading and considering my request.\u003cbr\u003e"
