I also run a small record label and artist collective called Headphone Treats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started a Peel Sessions-style recording series out of my Headphone Treats studio. I\u0027m bringing in artists to record between 2 to 6 songs over the course of a day or two. The basis of the recording will be tracked live to tape with moderate overdubbing. The point is to capture the live interaction and true character of each artist performing their own original material in a high-fidelity setting, and we\u0027re hoping Patreon members are as excited about the possibility as we are.\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere\u0027s what the artists will get out of this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 21.75px;\"\u003eA free, high quality recording to which they own the full rights and masters.
