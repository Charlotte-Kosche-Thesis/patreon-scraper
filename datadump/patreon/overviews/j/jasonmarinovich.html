It started with digestive issues when I was still in primary school and then as a teenager I suffered from depression. In my 20s I experienced\u00a0migraines, back pain, and severe skin issues. I received temporary symptom relief from medical doctors and the drugs that western medicine had to offer, but nothing would work long-term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until I came across Functional Medicine and Holistic Health that I discovered the root cause to all my health conditions and was finally, once and for all able to reduce and eventually eliminate the symptoms I had been experiencing for over 20 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd thus began a change in my career. I moved on from working in the education and IT fields to becoming a certified functional and holistic health practitioner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now provide functional lab testing (e.g. saliva, stool) to get to the root cause of health conditions. I coach people with their sleep, nutrition, and mindset and help them uncover hidden obstacles that are preventing them from reaching their goals. I also provide body+mind connection training (physical and mental fitness) helping people get in tune with their physical and mental abilities through resistance and sprint movements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to create a world full of happy and healthy people by providing guidance toward a new way of being happy, healthy, whole, and complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am putting together a library of functional and holistic health information in the form of videos and podcasts. I will offer all of this information for free for as long as I am able. I am transforming my own personal holistic lifestyle website (\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://wholeguidance.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewholeguidance.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e) into an online health portal, creating a natural healing network filled with blogs, videos, podcasts, and other health resources contributed by people \u003cstrong\u003ewith experience in the health field all\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ewith different backgrounds and perspectives on what it means to be healthy.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to produce educational health content relating to physical, sexual, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. I hope to build a health reference that anyone can come to about a number of health complaints that they may have and find at least one practical piece of information that they can implement\u00a0into their lives as a first step toward healing long-term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want anyone else to suffer needlessly like I did for over 20 years. The answers to your problems exist if you\u0027re willing to keep moving forward and dig deep. The real hope for what I\u0027m creating is that you won\u0027t need to dig deep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou won\u0027t need to unearth old books and scientific studies and look what\u0027s underneath every single rock for your answer. I\u0027ve already read a lot of those books and the research, and I\u0027ve turned over many many many rocks in the past 20 years of studying my own psychophysiology and guiding others on their health journeys, and I will put what I\u0027ve found in one place, this library of online content that I\u0027m creating. That is my promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to travel the world seeking functional and holistic practitioners from different backgrounds and creating docu-style interviews to show the world how there is no one cure, there is no one way to heal and that there are in fact many ways to heal and support yourself back to full health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to sit with and pick the brains of the best healers in the world would be a dream of mine not only because I would learn so much and be able to create more quality health content, but also because you and everyone else searching for answers will get access to these global leaders in the healing arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for joining my exclusive community as we go on this creative journey and also a journey of health-discovery where together we can change the future state of human health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving you here as part of this tribe means more than you know\u00a0\ud83d\ude4f\u003cbr\u003e"
