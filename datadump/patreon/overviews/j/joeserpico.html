    "summary": "Thank you for being awesome enough to visit my page. For those of you who aren\u0027t familiar with me or my life mission, I hope to change that now! I\u2019m a unwavering animal rights activist, passionate defender, fearless animal rescuer and humanitarian. I relentlessly work to make the compassionate and sustainable changes I wish to see in this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI provide advice to simplify the transition to veganism. I rescue animals, coordinate activism events and participate in outreach and education throughout New York, Long Island, and New Jersey. I volunteer with local animal shelters and sanctuaries to provide care to animals and independently rescue injured and orphaned cats, dogs, farm animals, as well as wildlife. I also support the LGBTQ community, fight for equal rights for people of color, women, and vulnerable human and non-humans. I also collect blankets, warm clothes, vegan food, sanitary products and essential items to distribute to America\u0027s growing homeless population. In my spare time, you can find me snuggling my rabbit and dog or rolling in the dirt with pigs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile these things provide a wealth of personal fulfillment, they come at a price. Unfortunately, I am not independently wealthy. I have financial burdens which limit my potential to pursue activism full time and in order to rescue and care for more animals. However, my greatest goal is to pursue street activism, outreach and rescue efforts morning, noon and night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your assistance, I can invest more time and energy into pursuing these vital causes and amp up my efforts to create a compassionate world. Your pledges will allow me to invest in extremely powerful tools to spread the vegan message to thousands, perhaps millions of people around the world. With these funds, I will purchase virtual reality headsets, create unique signage, outreach materials, rescue more animals, and fund new animal rights campaigns throughout New York and beyond. I will utilize my efforts to educate the public about the exploitation of animals, adoption, and more through a variety of successful tactics. I find that my online platform and face-to-face interactions are extremely powerful in creating conscious, meaningful change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recognize that there is a wonderful community of generous donors who see the work I am doing and are willing to help. Whether you pledge 5 dollars or 100, I appreciate you from the bottom of my heart and look forward to sharing my journey to veganize the planet with you and to save many lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s a breakdown of my current activism/outreach and rescue efforts:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProviding urgent care to community cats and neonatal kittens\u003cbr\u003eRescuing, rehabbing and homing cats, dogs, rabbits and injured wildlife\u003cbr\u003eFoster cats, dogs, and rabbits\u003cbr\u003eVolunteering at a wildlife rescue, animal sanctuaries, dog and cat shelters\u003cbr\u003eWriting educational posts on social media and miscellaneous blogs\u003cbr\u003eOrganizing \u0026amp; attending protest and outreach events\u003cbr\u003eOrganizing \u0026amp; attending vigils\u003cbr\u003eAttending \u0026amp; organizing protests at aquariums, circuses, rodeos, and stores\u003cbr\u003eOrganize miscellaneous protests throughout New York\u003cbr\u003eAttend and organize disruptions at corporate facilities that exploit animals\u003cbr\u003eLeafleting at college campuses and events\u003cbr\u003eVolunteer and organize animal adoption events\u003cbr\u003eAttend Cube of Truth activism events\u003cbr\u003eCreate meal plans and provide vegan advice\u003cbr\u003eOrganize and attend meetings with local activists\u003cbr\u003eParticipate in races to raise money for non-profit animal groups\u003cbr\u003eProvide vegan meals, blankets, clothes and essentials to the homeless\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a breakdown of my future activism, outreach, rescue goals:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eTravel to vigils, protests and demonstrations around the country to capture conditions inside slaughterhouses and on animal agriculture operations.\u003cbr\u003eCollaborate with other activists across the world on campaigns.\u003cbr\u003eCreate a billboard/ signage campaign in New York addressing health, environmental and animal rights issues associated with the production and consumption of meat, dairy \u0026amp; eggs.\u003cbr\u003eEducate vegans on effective activism strategies.\u003cbr\u003eExpand my current animal rescue efforts to save more animals.\u003cbr\u003eOrganize and coordinate trips to sanctuaries for vegan and non-vegans.\u003cbr\u003eChange the world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
