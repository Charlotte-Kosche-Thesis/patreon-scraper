Zines are published every 6 months or so.\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0have a vlog called #braindump on YouTube that I am working towards producing once a week. With your support I can reach this goal. Come along for the ride as a Producer of my videos.\u003cbr\u003eOther creative endeavors of mine include writing poetry, prose, and other things.
