I\u0027m almost positive it was illegal, I was a made-up character, I followed a bunch of people around the stage for about one minute, and I had no lines. I was HOOKED! I have been a performer ever since. It doesn\u0027t matter if its acting on a stage, in film, voice over, singing, or even writing--I am thrilled if I entertain. And I know what I want to do with my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003ePatreon allows you to send a regular payment to creators, so they can support themselves and keep making new stuff.

Actors spend 20 hours a week on average in rehearsals, 30 hours if its a big musical. Rehearsals last 4-5 weeks. Then we spend about 15-20 hours a week performing. In return for all of this work, we receive\u00a0an average of $200-$500. That breaks down to around $0.80 per hour! My hope is to turn this, my blog, and--soon to come--YouTube series into my only jobs. But that\u0027s simply not possible without your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat I Am Doing Now\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWhen I\u0027m not working at my day job or at rehearsals/performances, I produce a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://josiahframpton.wixsite.com/actor/blog\"\u003eweekly blog\u003c/a\u003e that talks about what happens behind the scenes in my acting career.
