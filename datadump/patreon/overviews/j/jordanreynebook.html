    "summary": "Hi, and thanks for being here. I\u0027m a full time musician who also writes. I have a passion for folklore and contextual sound (when I write albums, I make sure I dig out the sounds that the characters would have been surrounded by at the time). I like tales that are dark, mysterious, or bravely real - and combinations of that are my favorite.\u00a0\u003cp\u003eA while back I was commissioned by the New Zealand Arts Council to research our pioneer history. I was sent to a place called Karamea, on the west coast of New Zealand\u0027s south island. A town so remote it is still left off many maps (though not google maps ;)).\u00a0 It was one\nof the earlier settlements, organized under the \"special\" settlement\nscheme by Eugene Oconnor in the 1870s. Families in the UK left their\nlives and relatives behind to journey for 80 days by ship in the hope\nof a better life. Whey they arrived in Nelson, there was no work for\nthem, and a group of some 30 men were sent to Karamea, later to be\njoined by their families on allotment land. The land had been mis-surveyed, and most of the land was swamp and podzol, and therefore unfarmable. Surprisingly, the settlement went ahead, but tales of hardship and courage were abundant. \u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jordanreyne.com/images/karamea/pioneer_cottage_karamea.jpg\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eimage: turn of the century settler hut in Karamea.

The dead, as we know, are\nforgotten so the\u00a0 undead, spurred on by their fear, seek out\nthe ears of the living - to give them hope that their lives were for\nsomething and that they will be remembered. \u003cbr\u003e\nLethe, a gravedigger in the employ of History, returns to her hometown\nof Karamea. Her task is to gather the tales of the undead, at least,\nthose that seem to be of historical import.
