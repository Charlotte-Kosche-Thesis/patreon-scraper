I believe we have only touched the ostensible surface of the constructs defined under art and music. Both as singularities or combined harmoniously can cure disease at statistically alarming rates, open minds to new ideas, bond lives together, give hope to those who feel otherwise resoundingly lost, and bring the most stoic of sentience crumbling to their knees explicitly foaming with crocodile tears of joy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I dream to seek the answers and keep questioning, to awaken others towards discovering their potential while relinquishing the restrictions and damage carried over from a failed barter system that outgrew its own construct, a commercially driven world collapsing in on itself, and generations of collectively conditioned fears once instinctual survival mechanisms rendered mostly detrimental in recent amalgamations.\u00a0Every living being has dreams. As long as those goals do not harm or torture another, it is terribly important that everyone have the freedom to pursue them regardless of religion, occupation, who they love or what a person fucking looks like. \u003cstrong\u003eEvery single individual is born with that right.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn turn through these artaclysmic efforts, they help me to grow and I think learn to be a better person. Also always open to collaboration, don\u0027t be shy. Just ask.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that pretty much covers it. Thanks for reading and taking an interest.
