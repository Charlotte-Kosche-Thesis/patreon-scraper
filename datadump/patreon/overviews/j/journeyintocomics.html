Nate Phillips (The Podfather as Network members lovingly call him) started the podcast (first featured on Josh Figures It Out) to talk about his comic book collection and have to an outlet for his opinions. Brando made his first appearance on episode 5 and stayed on as co-host giving the show its unique tangential tendencies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos-6.dropbox.com/t/2/AAB9F-wHCuZa5mZYyntj7dzIBZi4INzDdpaclXAMYMxZvQ/12/344430344/jpeg/32x32/1/_/1/2/Nate%20and%20Brando.jpg/EPmn6dgCGLssIAIoAg/28kADzZyTSh7h7o9UroYm0fUQo7go6oL5w6L4ZCB0QM?size=1600x1200\u0026amp;size_mode=3\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Road to 200\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA lot of podasts don\u0027t last.
