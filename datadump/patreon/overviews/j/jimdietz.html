    "summary": "Greetings.\u00a0 Believe it or not, there will be a video, but of all the skills I lack, working with video is in the top 10 (along with playing the harp and cricket).\u00a0 On the other hand, I\u0027m an author and if you\u00a0can\u0027t figure out what I do or what\u0027s around here--Houston, we have a problem.\u00a0 Actually, it\u0027s more complicated than what can be shown in a video or in a few sentences.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do is coach college volleyball, manage my own small game company, and I write--which is, of course, why you are reading this.\u00a0 It helps that I write in each of those first two jobs.\u00a0 Those are where the articles come from.\u00a0 I used to teach, so I always look at coaching from a different perspective and my articles relate to that (not necessarily volleyball).\u00a0 I have a published book out with Championship Productions that discusses just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith games, I like discussing how games are created, but often there are inspirations that come from elsewhere, so those will get me writing about controversial or unique topics--would you ever think you could make a boardgame about the US Constitutional Convention?\u00a0 You\u0027d never believe what those guys actually believed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write novels and books.\u00a0 I have published two novels with small publishers, but it is incredibly difficult to justify the time of writing or to know if I am \u0027on the right track\u0027 (because all writers have moments of self-doubt, regardless of what you may think) without some sort of feedback, and obviously, the easiest way to justify writing is financial.\u00a0 In the old days, writers and artists were lucky to have the filthy rich as sponsors, but now, because of companies like Patreon, that support can be from everyone and it doesn\u0027t have to mean millions of dollars (though I\u0027d be happy to\u00a0 accept that...just sayin\u0027....)\u00a0\u00a0 So here I am, willing to work for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe beauty of Patreon is you aren\u0027t paying me until the content is provided.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s face it--that\u0027s a big deal.\u00a0 Just as important, you don\u0027t like it--you can stop your support at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you know, Patreon\u0027s thought of everything.\u00a0 Since you are paying for each time I provide content, I could pimp the system, post 50 articles/day, and suck you dry like I\u0027m the IRS.\u00a0 \u003cem\u003eThat\u0027s uncool\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 So you are also able to limit the maximum amount you donate over the course of month, so that even if I get crazy-productive, you get that as a bonus.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport will motivate me to work primarily on two things:\u003cbr\u003e1 - Editing and making suitable for publication various ideas and starts I have made on projects, but that have been set aside for various reasons (don\u0027t worry--the two clunkers won\u0027t be foisted on you...but I keep them around to remind me that I can always do better....)\u003cbr\u003e2 - Creating new material, published ideally two chapters (or articles) per month, so that you get to read it like people did in the good old days with serialized publications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the ideas for stories and novels:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 *The last CIA agent in Saigon, 1975\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 *An \"Indiana Jones\" inspired World War Two race between Nazis, Americans, and Russians to find a magic relic.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 *Angels on Earth, using pre-Judaism and early Judaic history and myths as inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 *Best friends who come of age in the early 1960s, and then tracing their lives past Vietnam and how the era changes them.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 *Why are mummies always the bad guys?\u00a0 What if immortal mummies were the good guys?\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 *The war in Afghanistan--how can you succeed without becoming just like the bad guys?\u00a0 Would that drive you insane?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to be able to do these on the 1st and 15th of every month.\u00a0 But I won\u0027t lie--there are times that won\u0027t happen, especially when I\u0027m neck-deep in recruiting and \u0027in-season\u0027.\u00a0 I\u0027ll try though--that is a promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as good, I\u0027ll post (free) blogs and random thoughts along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
