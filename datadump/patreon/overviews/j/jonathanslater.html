    "summary": "Hello everyone!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jonathan Slater, and I\u0027m a singer/songwriter from Huntsville Alabama. \u00a0I play both as a solo artist and with my full band JSP: Neil Coffman, Evan Miller, and Josh Conine. \u00a0My music is a unique blend of folk, grunge, blues, swampy bluegrass, and hard hitting rock. \u00a0I\u0027ve always been fascinated by lyrics, style, and the process of songwriters. \u00a0Particularly word choice, imagery, song form, melody, and of course depth and realness. \u00a0I have an EP out, and am currently performing and working very hard in Huntsville so my full band can record a full length album and perform outside of our hometown. \u00a0Thank you so much to anyone who decides to support me on Patreon. \u00a0I plan to upload a minimum of 1 video per week, and one mp3 per month. \u00a0My 6 song EP will be available to ALL patrons. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy rewards are as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReward 1: People who pay $1 or more a month gain unlimited access to my EP, videos, weekly videos, and monthly mp3s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReward 2: People who pay $5 or more a month receive the same reward 1. \u00a0Also, I will write and record a video of a personalized song (you pick the subject matter). \u00a0You will also receive a free copy of the full length album I will be releasing by early next year. \u00a0I will also play one 2 hour private or public event for free for you (for locations within a 90 mile distance).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReward 3: \u00a0People who pay $10 or more a month receive all the rewards of 1 and 2, plus I will play 6 2 hour long shows a year (up to 2 per month) for any private or public event within a 90 mile distance.\u003cbr\u003e"
