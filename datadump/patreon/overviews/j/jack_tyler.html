    "summary": "I am the world\u2019s\nfirst, and probably the last, cat naturalist [suburbia]. Since 2006,\nI have been studying all aspects of lost cats. There are six broad\ncategories that cause a cat to become displaced. And, you can find\nout all about those and all the other lost cat projects at \u003ca href=\"http://donation.catflasher.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edonation.catflasher.com\u003c/a\u003e\n \n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a result of truly\nshocking discoveries that I have made about these guys who live with\nus, I can advise on what you should be doing to find your lost cat. See the cat locator videos on my site at \u003ca href=\"http://jacktyler.name/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejacktyler.name.\u003c/a\u003e And, my\ninvention, the Cat Flasher Robot Locator, catflasherca.com, will protect almost any\nindoor-only cat. Outdoor cats, or what I call ecosystem cats, have\navailable to them other prevention devices. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nCats should all be\nsafe, at this point. What to do to prevent a cat from getting lost\nand what to do afterwards if one did not take any preventive measures\nis covered on my site. This is why it\u2019s probable that I am, not\nonly the first, but, the last cat naturalist. Citizens like\nyourselves can fine tune what is now understood about how amazing\ncats are in their own element with no professionals needed. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of my research\nhas been self-supported up until this present time in 2018. Maybe you would\nlike to help out with history and the future by supporting me with $1\nor $2 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the moment, one\ncat who belongs to a human, or vice versa, is permanently lost every\nminute in America. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for your\nconsideration!"
