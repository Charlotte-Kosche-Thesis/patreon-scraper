The thing about that is... I am currently going to art college for it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing in school to learn and excel in what I love most is really invigorating -- In every way except in my wallet. So I thought I\u0027d make a Patreon to help with that. I figured this would be a cool way to share what I know and have learned (in school or in my daily trial and errors while working in art) to people who may be fans of my work, or just enjoy my vision!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support I would get from Patreon would help \u003cem\u003etremendously\u003c/em\u003e with affording supplies! I\u0027d like to experiment more with my art, and explore different mediums and techniques when it comes to telling different stories. Eventually, I\u0027d also like to sell some handmade things, like books I bind myself or embroidered totebags! The possibilities? Endless!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of tiers and their corresponding rewards, I\u0027ll be focusing on sharing things I know and learned in school. I\u0027ll also be sharing complete and finished artworks before they go up on social media. As usual, though, my sketches and progress screenshots will still go up on Twitter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I\u0027ll be making two big posts every month (exciting!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe first post will be sort of a reflective journal. I\u0027ll be talking about things I learned in the previous month, and also be talking about upcoming projects and other things I have in the works! I\u0027ll include project descriptions, screencaps or images if there are any, and whatever else that would be relevant to the (There will also be a small post prior to this where I take questions and requests and do a small sketch to accompany the big post!)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe second post will likely be a short process video or a link to a livestream where I will work on any project that\u0027s sitting on Photoshop! (If I do a livestream, which I really want to get into the habit of doing, I\u0027ll open the chat up for questions and talk about anything and everything you guys want me to talk about!)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
