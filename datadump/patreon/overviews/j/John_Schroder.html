Based upon that, you\ncan probably figure out my age and also gauge the years of\nexperience.  Over the years I have written a number of articles and\nhave also have produced a newsletter that we had been doing for\nabout 18 years now as well (and in fact the newsletter distribution\nlist had grown exponentially over time, up to over 30,000 at one point, which we always did for \u003cstrong\u003eFREE \u003c/strong\u003eto all who subscribed).  You can read some of our\narticles on this site and via the other links I have provided below\nfor you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003eBut\none thing many of our long terms clients and readers of our\nnewsletters can attest to is, we have never, ever accepted any kind\nof paid advertising on our sites nor in the newsletter.  No banner\nads or pop up ads selling vitamins, rechargeable flash lights or\nanything else for that matter.  And we do wish to keep it that way. \nWhat we do, what we have been doing has been indirectly or in part\nsupported by our own clients.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003eHowever,\nI do realize that not everyone either has the financial capacity to\nbecome a client, and or perhaps in terms of relocation have another\nplace in mind other than the Dominican Republic (which is fine). \nBut, with that said, based upon reader feedback, we have been glad to\nhear over the years that people have found our articles and the\nnewsletter to be helpful, informative and worthwhile.\u00a0 But writing articles and producing content is a time consuming exercise.\u00a0 In fact if you can do it well \u0026amp; often, it can be a full time job.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003eSo,\nfor those clients that have decided to utilize our firm for whatever\nservices (assistance with the residency and citizenship process in\nthe Dominican Republic for example) we do thank you.  But, if for\nwhatever reason you are not in a position to use our firm\u0027s services\nbut still would like to support what we are writing and sending out\nin terms of information, I would ask for a small amount of support. \nAnd this is where PATREON comes in.  Through Patreon, you can show\nyour support and patronage by simply donating US$5 per month (or more\nif you like, I won\u0027t complain if more).\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003eBy\ndoing so, you will allow us to continue writing and sending our\ninformation with the financial support we need to help defray our\nbasic operating costs (and let\u0027s face it, HBO isn\u0027t free, neither are\nother monthly utilities, although I am not quite sure HBO can be\nconsidered a utility or necessity but you get the idea).  In\naddition, I will certainly offer\npreference to those supporters that want to write in looking for\nanswers to some specific questions (such as what are the highest\npaying and safest investments right now in the Dominican Republic).\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003eSo,\nin advance, thank you for your patronage, support and readership.  We\nwill keep writing and keep the information coming if you think it to\nbe worthwhile.
