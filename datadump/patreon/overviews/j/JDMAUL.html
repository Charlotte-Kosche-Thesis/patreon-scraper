Just $1 per month will get you the main story up to its current release instantly, and each new chapter going forward. \u00a0To sample the tone and direction of the story please scroll down, and find the \u0027Things to Come\u0027 entry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://document-export.canva.com/DAB5wYZ0Cl4/13/preview/0001-12992742.png\"\u003e\n \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0The year is 2219, and the last century has been rough.  As foretold, the ocean has slowly, but surely, encroached further onto lands all around the world.  Islands, cities, and even entire nations have been brought to their knees, displaced, or have perished.  To add insult to injury, the shifting world has off-balanced countless habitats, and weather patterns.  Out at sea, the surface of the ocean which mankind freely traversed for so long, has become incredibly dangerous, and highly unpredictable.  Despite many concerted attempts to devise a cost-effective way of circumventing the dangers of modern inter-continental shipping, none have met with large-scale success.  The \u0027global economy\u0027 has, effectively, collapsed.  Each remaining community, big or small, has been forced to \u0027turn inward\u0027 and subsist on what resources can already be found within their own remaining lands.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0For the United States, the results have been nothing short of catastrophic.  There are volatile \u0027ripple\u0027 storms, which have continually rampaged up and down the coasts for 85 years.  Horrible epidemics, starvation, and dehydration have crashed in waves over millions of scrambling refugees for decades at a time, as they are forced further inland over the course of each tumultuous year.  Best sources estimate that there has been a 1/3rd reduction in the nation\u0027s overall population.   \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0While the economic and social implications for pockets of the Midwest \n\u003cem\u003ewere \u003c/em\u003ejust as dire as anywhere, the environmental impact has been comparatively mild.  Spring and summer have risen to an even more humid, and wet period.  Fall has turned into a time of dryness, sometimes interrupted with brief, but powerful thunderstorms.  These storms with dangerous,  hurricane level winds, form and subside within mere hours.  Winter has become a true wildcard.  The season is capable of dumping volumes of snow previously only associated with parts of Russia and Canada.  On the other hand, it can also involve nearly \u003cem\u003eno moisture\u003c/em\u003e, with long, bitter, \u0027freeze-dries\u0027 plummeting below -30 Fahrenheit for days at a time.  On the whole, the population has been able to adapt, and produce enough food to feed themselves due to their uninterrupted access to the aquifer under their feet.  That, combined with vast swaths of previously unused land, has caused a flourishing resurgence of a lifestyle lost outside the Midwest.  Thanks to a constant influx of motivated, displaced people, and a surviving infrastructure, Nebraska\u0027s Lincoln and Omaha have grown into one gigantic metro area.  This place has become a mecca of culture, prosperity, and stability in a country that has long since fallen into disarray.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://document-export.canva.com/DAB5wfKHoQQ/6/preview/0001-12995881.png\"\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0When I was a kid, my answer to the \u0027what\u0027ll you be as a grown-up\u0027 question was very consistent: a writer.

(See first post below for the opening of that story.) This plot is about 18-20 chapters long, based on where I choose to split them up. \u00a0These \u0027chapters\u0027 can be anywhere from 4,000 words in length to 9,000. \u00a0I want the story to dictate the chapters, not the other way around. \u00a0Suffice it to say, it\u0027s \u0027not short\u0027, but it\u0027s not \u0027super-long\u0027 either. (Think: Medium-length novel.)\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 For the most part, that story is ready to go. \u00a0It\u0027s been written from beginning to end, and awaits only to be typed up (I \n\u003cem\u003emeant \u003c/em\u003ethat \u0027scribbling in notebooks\u0027 thing), and edited for punctuation. \u00a0As such, you won\u0027t be waiting on me to compose the next chapter from scratch, merely for me to polish it up to presentation standards. \u00a0That is why I am confident I can deliver 3 chapters a month, spaced a week apart. (I will stick as consistently as I can to a specific day of the week.) \u00a0I\u0027ll use the \u0027off week\u0027 to create other material, which will deepen the characters and world of the series.\u003cbr\u003e"
