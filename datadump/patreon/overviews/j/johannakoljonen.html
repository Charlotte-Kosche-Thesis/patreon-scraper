    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eBelow is a brief description of what I\u0027m trying to do. \u003ca href=\"https://participationsafety.wordpress.com/faq/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out the FAQ\u003c/a\u003e on my blog for more details!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027ve spent about five years researching, thinking about and lecturing on safety in live action role-playing games or larps. \"Larp safety\", I\u0027ve learned, is actually an umbrella term not just for \u003cstrong\u003ekeeping participants alive and unharmed\u003c/strong\u003e (things like fire safety and weapons simulations) but also for enabling trust and co-creation (things like \u003cstrong\u003eplay style calibration mechanics\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ecommunity design\u003c/strong\u003e). All of these, however, always interact with each other \u003cstrong\u003ein a system\u003c/strong\u003e. That\u0027s why a simulation mechanic that worked great in one larp might flop in another one, and why different sets of players might end up playing the exact same design in a very safe or very risk-taking manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started work on a book, \u003cem\u003eSafety in Larp \u2013 Understanding Participation and Designing for Trust\u003c/em\u003e. My problem is that this subject is unendingly fascinating. I keep thinking about additional sub-areas and running across great sources that require reading, so it\u0027s best to publish stuff along the way!\u00a0So I decided to organize my thoughts \u003ca href=\"https://participationsafety.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ein a blog\u003c/a\u003e to begin with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://participationsafety.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe blog\u003c/a\u003e will do three things. It\u0027ll \u003cstrong\u003edocument\u003c/strong\u003e what I\u0027ve already learned from the community so far, \u003cstrong\u003eshare my research\u003c/strong\u003e as a read up and reflect on what everyone else is doing, and \u003cstrong\u003erespond\u003c/strong\u003e to questions or input from you. I am also asking for three things in return!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027d Love From You If You\u0027re Into This Stuff!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMoney\u003c/strong\u003e really helps. The finished book will be \nsomewhat of a niche product and I\u2019m not expecting to make a mint from \nactual sales. So, yea, Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEncouragement\u003c/strong\u003e is just as important! Writing is a \nlonely job (I know, since it\u2019s my living). Even if you can\u2019t pledge, \nbeing a reader or spreading the word would be super helpful for my \nlong-term motivation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, I\u2019m hoping to tickle your \u003cstrong\u003ecuriosity\u003c/strong\u003e and \ninspire you to design new exciting systems to enable every imaginable \nkind of larp, even content you thought could never be explored in a \nresponsible manner in the medium!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll charge on Patreon only when I\u2019ve posted \nsomething meaningful on the blog (which tends to mean looooooong posts, \nbecause that\u2019s just who I am, sorry). But I might also do shorter posts,\n like links to awesome stuff, and I won\u2019t charge for that stuff \u2013 and \nobviously you can cap how many dollars a month you\u2019re willing to spend. \nReally, do that. I \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e go crazy and post like ten times in July.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a professional writer, experience design consultant and media \nanalyst. I\u0027m very busy, and do very interesting things (like writing plays, books, and comics, \u003ca href=\"https://nordiclarptalks.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehosting the Nordic Larp Talks\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://alibisforinteraction.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAlibis for Interaction,\u003c/a\u003e working in television)\u2026 But larp is my \nlife-long passion.
