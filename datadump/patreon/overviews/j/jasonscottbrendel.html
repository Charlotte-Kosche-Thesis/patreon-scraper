    "summary": "I\u0027m Jason Scott Brendel, a poet, writer, and podcaster who is seeking to connect with people through truth, reason, and humor. I\u0027ve written an extensive collection of satire sonnets, hundreds of other ridiculous poems, several short stories, and will be debuting The Treason Show: A Podcast About Truth... and Reason, on June 11th. My ultimate goal is to engage deeply with, and further the conversation about fundamental issues that humanity must face such as: finding meaning in one\u0027s life, group and individual identity, race and gender, creativity, judgement, politics, and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo, what can you find on this site, and why Patreon? Patreon allows me to provide updates to my wonderful supporters, allow access to various content, and garner support directly from you, the people! The reason I write and the reason I speak is to honestly express what\u0027s on my mind, free of pressure and restrictions. For this reason, I don\u0027t want to run ads. But, in order to write, and in order to maintain a podcast, I do need support from somewhere. Your support will help me continue to provide fresh content and do what I love, as well as provide various rewards depending on your level of patronage. Thank you so much! :)"

     "about": "While studying creative writing in college, one of the first classes I took was an introduction to poetry writing. I immediately developed an admiration for artistic expression through poetic form, but found myself easily tired by the abundance of abstract and depressing poems. So, as a writer I set out to do something new and fresh and something that\u0027s well... more me. I decided to take the most formal kind of poem there is, the sonnet, and write satirically about the ridiculous nature of humanity through its form. A year later, I\u0027ve written about seventy-five of these satire sonnets that (with some help) I hope to soon publish as a collection.\u00a0",
