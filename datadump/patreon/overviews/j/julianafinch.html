Online communities are not less real than in person connections, they ARE communities -- YOU are my community. I am shifting my life and my work so that I can connect with you more and reward the people who have been there for me since the beginning.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music industry is in transition. Artists can no longer rely on album sales or tours to make a living and are seeking out other ways to continue their work while being able to live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you want to directly support the work I do and be a part of my process going forward, this is the absolute best way to do it. \u00a0Please take a moment to look at the pledge levels available (starting at as little as $1 a month) and consider adding your hands to the ones that hold me up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and much love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePutting My Money Where My Heart Is\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAside from your pledges helping me make a living as a musician, they also help support some of my fellow creators. For every 10 patrons, I will become a supporter of another Patreon page. You can view the creators we\u0027re supporting together in the \"Supported by\" column on this page. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
