    "summary": "About 7 years ago I started thinking about creating pieces of art using yarn, beads, baubles, everything except (or possibly including) fabric. Although the pieces would be based on clothing, they wouldn\u0027t necessarily be wearable, but would be displayed as murals or in semi-sculptural settings. Because life is life all my sketches, swatches, and notes were lost when I moved 5 years ago. Now I\u0027m ready to start over and I\u0027m asking all of you to join me on this new journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons of my work will have access to weekly posts and pictures that describe the scenery we are traveling through. Sometimes I might ask you for directions or your opinions on where to head to next. Always you will have my thanks and lots of tail wagging and kisses from my dogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook for my first post with lots of information about our first trip including a design board and a link to the music behind the idea. Because I want to get you as excited as I am, this first post is public. To continue the journey with me, please become a patron. Traveling together will be fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
