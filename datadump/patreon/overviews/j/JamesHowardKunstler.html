    "summary": "\u003cem\u003ePatreon allows artists, writers, and bloggers to get funded\nby their fans or patrons on a recurring basis. And here\u2019s why I\u2019m starting a Patreon account. I don\u2019t aim\nto charge for my weekly blog or monthly podcast. This is voluntary support.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Situation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWriting is my livelihood. It has always been a tough racket.\nI get a lot of letters from young, struggling writers asking for advice. My\nmain message to them has been that talent counts, but perseverance counts more.\nYou really have to hang in there against pretty tough odds. After all, you\u2019re\nproducing work that nobody asked for.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith the rise of the Internet, writing has gotten to be an\neven tougher racket for true professionals. It has almost fatally disrupted the\neconomics of what\u2019s called \u201ctrade publishing\u201d \u2014 the book industry. The chain\nstores and Amazon didn\u2019t help either. These outfits strong-arm publishers into\ngiving them very deep discounts. And guess what: it comes out of the authors\u2019\nroyalties. We get screwed on that deal sort of like musicians get screwed with\ntheir songs on Spotify downloads.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s also well-known that few websites pay writers for\ncontent, and even if they do, it\u2019s way less than the old newspapers and\nmagazines did. When I wrote for \u003cem\u003eThe New\nYork Times Sunday Magazine\u003c/em\u003e twenty-five years ago, they paid a dollar a\nword. Today, magazines and newspapers are struggling desperately just to stay\nalive. Meanwhile, writers are lucky to get a dime a word writing for websites \u2014\nand twenty-five years later that dime won\u2019t buy anything but a cinnamon\nfireball. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe diminishing returns of technology are killing writing as\na professional occupation. Readers are still \u201cconsuming\u201d professional writing\n(for free). Writers are generating more and more work for their followers (for free). So, those of us who\nreally work hard at it (and I do) have to make other arrangements to make a\nliving.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, I\u2019m Not Getting\nRich\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve hung in there over a long career and published about\ntwenty books. I\u2019ve seen better times, worse times, and really hard times. My\nearly novels are out-of-print. I pull in about $3,000 a year in total royalties\nfrom some of my more recent books. Here\u2019s my latest semi-annual royalty check\nfrom Grove Atlantic Books covering \u003cem\u003eThe\nLong Emergency\u003c/em\u003e and the first \u003cem\u003eWorld\nMade By Hand\u003c/em\u003e novel. (Other recent books didn\u2019t \u201cearn out\u201d the modest advances\nI received years ago.) They pay my \u201ccompany,\u201d Highbrow Productions, Inc. (I\u2019m\nthe sole employee.) Note, they issue payments six months after they report the\nearnings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://kunstler.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JHK-RoyaltyCheck.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI used to make more of my annual income off of college\nlectures. You may have noticed that the rising hysteria on campus against\nthreatening ideas, and the clamor for \u201csafe spaces,\u201d etc., has made it difficult\nfor controversialists such as myself to speak to college audiences. I have no\nbookings for 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is not my hobby. This is my vocation. Blogging does not\neven pay for itself. The basic cost of running \u003ca href=\"http://kunstler.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKunstler.com\u003c/a\u003e is $200 a\nmonth. I write a check out for\nthat every month along with the other bills. The few Google Ad-sense ads that\nrun there don\u2019t cover it. I have the usual load of regular monthly bills for staying\nalive, too, of course, just like you. You might think that recording a podcast\nis easy, but editing the darn thing takes a couple of days for each one. I\nspent an entire week writing the annual forecast last month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSupport Your Blogger\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI started blogging in the late 1990s because I write\ncultural, political, and economic commentary and I had a lot to say between\nbooks like \u003cem\u003eThe Geography of Nowhere\u003c/em\u003e\nand \u003cem\u003eThe City in Mind\u003c/em\u003e. This was a\nreally peculiar moment in history. Things were flying apart here in Western\nCiv. I titled my 2005 book \u003cem\u003eThe Long\nEmergency\u003c/em\u003e because it was obvious we were in for a hard ride. My \u003cem\u003eClusterfuck Nation\u003c/em\u003e blog is the\nunofficial weekly chronicle of that journey \u2014 which is picking up speed again\neven as I write this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve gotten a lot of personal satisfaction from the simple\ndiscipline of having to compose a weekly blog on deadline and I haven\u2019t missed\na week since I regularized it to Monday mornings more than ten years ago \u2014 I even\nput it out the week I had open heart surgery in 2013. That\u2019s how much it meant\nfor me to be there for my readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter all this time, the blogging scene has begun to sort\nitself out. It\u2019s pretty clear now who are the voices \u201cout there\u201d who you can\ndepend on to be worth reading and listening to. New voices come along\nregularly, too, and if they\u2019re any good, they\u2019ll find their audience. The\ntrouble is that hardly anyone\u2019s getting paid for the work that you value. So,\nPatreon is a way that you can decide to support the bloggers who give you\nvalue. Nobody\u2019s strong-arming you to subscribe. Back during the Watergate\nfrolic of 1973, I used to gladly pay 25 cents just to read \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e columnists James Reston and Anthony Lewis inveigh\nagainst Nixon. Back then you could buy 2 cans of Campbell\u2019s tomato soup for 25\ncents! With Patreon you can arrange to fund my blog and podcast on a recurring\nbasis. There may be enough of you out there so that five measily bucks a month each\nwill enable me to pay the propane bill and the dentist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOh, one final thing: if Hollywood manages to turn my \u003cem\u003eWorld Made By Hand\u003c/em\u003e novels into a TV\nseries or a movie franchise, I\u2019ll discontinue the Patreon program. Promise.\u003cbr\u003e"
