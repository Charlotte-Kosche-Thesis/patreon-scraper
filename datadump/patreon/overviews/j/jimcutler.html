    "summary": "I\u0027ve been a part of the the Seattle jazz community for over 30 years, leading my quartet since 2000 and the Jim Cutler Jazz Orchestra since 2004. I\u0027ve played music since I was ten years old, and love to share my passion for music, both with the audience and fellow musicians.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, in addition to the rewards that are offered you\u0027ll have early access to information on upcoming special performances as well as exclusive videos of select performances. And most of all, you\u0027ll have a say in keeping live music and the American art form called jazz alive and well. My patrons are truly what make my music possible, and words can\u0027t possibly express the gratitude I have for the years of support I\u0027ve had, and will continue to receive. Thank you for allowing me to express myself, and provide the same opportunity for the hundreds of other musicians I\u0027ve played along side.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Jim Cutler Quartet \u003c/strong\u003ewas formed to provide a creative outlet for my playing and writing. We formally came together in 2000, and released our first CD, \u003ca href=\"http://www.jcutler.com/jcq-the-jim-cutler-quartet\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJCQ\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in 2002, followed by \u003ca href=\"http://www.jcutler.com/for-real\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor Real\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in 2003. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Jim Cutler Jazz Orchestra\u003c/strong\u003e was inspired by my desire to bring a house big band to \u003ca href=\"http://www.tulas.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTula\u0027s Restaurant and Jazz Club\u003c/a\u003e. We\u0027ve been playing there on Sunday nights since 2004, have had two successful CD releases, with a third to be recorded in March 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few things that will be funded by your monthly subscription:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaying the musicians\u003c/strong\u003e - our Sunday night gigs are great, and at the end of the night the money is spread thin for a 16 piece ensemble all while funding our projects. Your patronage will put money directly into the pockets of the band members for our jazz orchestra performances, and enable our quartet to work and a wide variety of venues throughout the Pacific Northwest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecording studio costs\u003c/strong\u003e - The Jazz Orchestra is going in the studio in March of 2018, and we\u0027ve got money socked away to help pay for studio time, but a day in the studio costs about $2500. The more quality time we have in the studio the faster our new CD can be released and other projects can get underway. By becoming a patron you\u0027ll have priority access to session details, photographs, and recording samples.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther recording costs\u003c/strong\u003e - The studio is the first step, then there\u0027s mixing, editing, mastering, artwork, and finally manufacturing and feeding distribution channels (both for physical and digital). These costs add up, and your patronage will make a big difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive projects\u003c/strong\u003e - We\u0027ve hosted guest artists, done fundraisers, and participated with local schools, but all that takes time and money. You\u0027ll have advance notice on events and opportunities for interacting with the musicians with your subscription.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew music\u003c/strong\u003e - I write for both my jazz orchestra and quartet, along with several other Seattle area musicians/composers, and the original music is part of what makes these bands unique. Funding composers is critical to allow jazz to continue to grow and evolve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll the other things\u003c/strong\u003e - There\u0027s a long list of things of things that make a difference for me and my groups, I\u0027ll share some of these ideas as time goes on, and you may see these as goals or posts. You can be assured that your patronage contributes to something that forwards what I\u0027m out to create with my music, and will allow me go beyond the scope of what I can do on my own.\u003cbr\u003e"
