Then it became a way to show progress to my miniature painting clients. Along the way I realized that I enjoyed just sharing the projects with everybody and, when time permitted, helping others to improve their own craft. Sadly, the freelance projects have always been at odds with my desire to create more video content for the community. The more videos I create the less time i have for client work - which means less money to pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThis is where you (and Patreon) come in.\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027d like to be able to focus more on creating the videos that you want to see. Not just logging my progress on commission projects, but doing tutorials, reviews, and battle reports that you want to see. As more patrons sign on the less freelance work I will need to do and the more time I\u0027ll be able to devote to the videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
