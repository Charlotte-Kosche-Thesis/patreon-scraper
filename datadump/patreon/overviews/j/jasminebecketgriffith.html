I paint all the time, having started my career and website in 1997. \u00a0Lots of beautiful big eyed girls, faeries, mermaids, pop surrealism, new contemporary, fantasy art and such.

I hope you enjoy it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have joined Patreon to create a space for myself and for my fans, collectors and patrons to connect and interact in a way beyond that of existing social media.  Patreon is where you will find exclusive content unavailable anywhere else, advance notifications and sneak previews, receive surprises (if you are an official Patron I typical do multiple \"surprises\" throughout the month - you might find yourself a surprise recipient of rare Disney items like artist color proofs, original paintings, one of a kind production artwork, retired/exclusive pins, etc. ), see a lot of \"Behind the Scenes\" photos, and depending on what patronage tier you subscribe to - even get \"first dibs\" and \"reservations\" on original paintings and hard-to-get Limited and Masterpiece Editions. \u00a0We have a \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Pin Collector Tier\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0where you receive Patreon Exclusive pins, Patron Surprises on other exclusives, and a new Pin of the Month each month!\u00a0 Full members will be able view original paintings before they debut to the public.  Works-in-progress will be posted here FIRST.

I will not spend the money on fancy clothes and video games, this Patreon program is specifically to offset the costs of running my art career, keeping my website \"ad-free,\" paying for bandwidth, legal fees, art supplies, website administration, and (very importantly) travel expenses so I can come \u0026amp; do art shows, meet my fans, etc. \u00a0 To see my upcoming schedule of events,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/strangeling/events\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick HERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:  But don\u0027t all the big companies and galleries pay you to come out and have shows?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:  No.  Even if it\u0027s a free autograph event halfway around the world where all I do is meet fans for 45 minutes, all travel costs (and hotels, food, etc.) always comes from my own pocket.  I do it because I love it and I love to meet my fans, supporters and friends.  It is pretty much always at a tremendous financial loss.  Patreon can help me offset these costs, and help make it possible for me to come out and see you all more often!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:  So you really surprise your Patrons with things like original paintings?  Even if we\u0027re only at the $1 level?\u00a0 Does everybody get one?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Each month, I will do multiple surprises for my Patrons (not every Patron, lol, it\u0027s a surprise each time who will get a gift, I can\u0027t send them to everybody each month or I\u0027d go broke!\u00a0 I spread it around randomly) - so you may wake up one day with a \"Surprise\" from me and I will mail you an original painting.  Probably a very small one, at least at first, but if this thing grows into a larger fanbase I start sending larger pieces as well.\u00a0 No matter how many people join Patreon, I will still surprise at least one Patron with an original painting per month.  If only two people sign up, y\u0027all can take turns. \u00a0In addition I will surprise folks with other items out throughout the month, one of a kind \u0026amp; rare collectibles, Disney colour artist proofs, figurines, rare \u0026amp; exclusive pins, original production art and more - focusing on things that cannot be bought \u0026amp; sold elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:  So are you not going to post so much at Facebook, Instagram, etc.?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:  I sure am, just as I always do, don\u0027t worry!  Patreon however will include ADDITIONAL content that is not going to be available at other sites.  In addition, particularly at the higher tiers, I will preview paintings and works-in-progress here BEFORE I do so to the general public.  That\u0027s part of what you get in exchange for a little support! ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:  What is \"Behind the Scenes\" content?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:  This is fun stuff from me, that I don\u0027t bother sharing on other sites.  Photos from my vacations, pics from my studio, pictures of me \u0026amp; my cats, pictures of projects I\u0027m working on, pictures of us getting ready to set up our shows and events.  Personal insights that the general public wouldn\u0027t probably appreciate, but that you guys might find interesting!  I\u0027m hoping to get more into doing videos and stuff too, and Patreon\u0027s \"Behind the Scenes\" will be where I post that kind of thing.  \"Behind the Scenes\" content is available to those at the $5 tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:  What is \"Top Secret\" content, and is it really secret?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:  Top Secret really is top secret.  It is for the $50+ tier.  In fact, once you join the tier we will have a short \"NDA\" (Non-Disclosure Agreement) that you will need to agree to.  This is for serious collectors.  This will be the first showings of works-in-progress, and those in the Top Secret tier will thus be the first people to get \"first dibs\" on my infamous First Dibs list.  At that time as well, those in the Top Secret tier can also pre-order Limited Editions / Masterpiece Editions before the general public, which can be crucial.  The Top Secret content will also include full previews of finished original paintings before art shows open, which can be a wonderful bonus for those still not having decided on a piece based on the work-in-progress pics.  I will also use the Top Secret content feed to first announce new shows, private projects, pre-orders for new books, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:  How does the 10% OFF discount work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:  The 10% OFF discount (available for those in the $10+ tier) is for my website, Strangeling.com (not eBay, not Amazon, not StrangelingUK, not Disney World, only Strangeling.com).  Within a day or so after joining this tier, we will contact you with your discount code.  You can use this discount code over \u0026amp; over again, as long as your Patreon membership on my page is viable.  You will need to use the same email address when placing an order with the discount code at Strangeling.com as you do on Patreon (otherwise contact us first at \u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e\n/*  */ if you need to use an alternate email address).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:  What do I get 10% OFF of?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:  You can get 10% off of any glossy paper prints, Collectible Metal Enamel Pins, Limited Edition Canvas prints, Masterpiece Limited Edition Canvas prints, or Open Edition Remarqued Canvas Prints at Strangeling.com  - basically any print up there.  If you even occasionally buy prints, this is an excellent deal for only the $10 tier.  If you were to buy at $595 Masterpiece for example, you\u0027d save almost $60 alone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How does the Pin Collector Tier work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: \u00a0It\u0027s one of the best things about Patreon! \u00a0Only $25/month. \u00a0If you collect pins, sign up as soon as you can, it is well worth it. \u00a0Firstly - you\u0027ll get the current Patreon Exclusive Pin (as of July 2017 that is the \"Paisley\" pin), not available for sale anywhere else. \u00a0Throughout the year, we release additional Patreon Exclusive pins, and whenever we do you\u0027ll get those too. \u00a0You\u0027ll also get items like Strangeling custom pin lanyards. \u00a0Then of course each and every month you\u0027ll get the Pin of the Month (usually shipped on the 10th of that month) automatically! \u00a0Not only that, you get 10% off any pins you buy from Strangeling.com (and prints or canvases too!). \u00a0All shipping worldwide is included. \u00a0Also whenever I have spare pins that are rare or exclusives leftover from special events (I usually order extras in case of loss or damage, and as they never hardly ever get damaged I usually have a handful left!) we will surprise some folks ONLY the Pin Collector Tier at Patreon by sending them an extra surprise pin, which can be quite unique \u0026amp; valuable commodities!\u00a0 You also get everything that the $10 Patreon level gets, sneak previews, behind the scenes content, early works-in-progress, etc. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:  Who told you about Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:  The wonderful and very clever Amanda Palmer.

Also with the \"Top Secret\" feed of posts here at Patreon I will show other projects before I can show the general public, such as book projects, potential film or themepark events, merchandise in the test-market stages, sculptures at the basic clay level, the odd sketches and such.
