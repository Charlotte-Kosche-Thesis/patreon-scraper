    "summary": "I\u0027m Jayden Raske, a furry composer seeking to make music for viewers like you. I can make music of almost any style with a big focus on orchestral and jazz. I\u0027ve studied at McNally Smith College of Music while it was still open. I\u0027ve learned how to make music with the help of Sean McMahon, Jay Fuchs, and other various music enthusiasts that got me into what I make today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my volunteer work, I\u0027ve worked on various student film projects by making music for video to making song for animations. I\u0027ve also worked with a group that\u0027s producing a fanseries of a cancelled game called Dinosaur Planet. I\u0027ve made some test tracks along with the teaser music, and I\u0027ve also donated my voice to help voice characters in the cast. This group has taught me a lot with chemistry with many kinds of members, and it\u0027s something I wish to use when working with fellow music enthusiasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetting into a constant groove of music, I\u0027m producing SpeedComps. SpeedComps is basically a form of music where I just make music depending on the type of mood I\u0027m in. Let\u0027s say I\u0027m angry with work for some reason, I\u0027ll make a piano pounding song that makes you think I\u0027m just stepping on my piano. Or maybe I\u0027m having a nice chat with a good friend of mine, so I just make a relaxing music that feels like a mix of ambiance and chill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading through this, and have a great rest of your day\u003cbr\u003e"
