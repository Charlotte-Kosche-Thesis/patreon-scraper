    "summary": "Hi, we\u0027re Jenny \u0026amp; Tyler! We\u0027re a married duo from Nashville. Patreron exists to help artists like us make music in a sustainable way, through people like you. If you want to know more, read below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur Story\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been living in Nashville for about 9 years making music together.\u00a0We have three little girls. We\u0027ve been playing music together in some capacity since we met at the University of Delaware back in the fall of 2004. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking music and having people listen to it is a privilege and we try our best not to take it for granted. While music is our livelihood, we primarily consider it to be a ministry. We strive to communicate truth and hope through our songs and have been so encouraged by the stories we\u0027ve heard from people who have listened to the music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e A few years ago, a girl attending a show told us that when she first began listening to our music she didn\u0027t believe in Jesus. She had come to shows and not been a believer. At that show, however, she told us that she now believed and that our music helped lead her to that place. Others have told us incredible stories of healing and redemption and how the Lord has used the music to minister to and change them. We\u0027re humbled by these stories and grateful that God chooses to use these little songs that we write to change hearts and lives. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople at shows often encourage us to \"keep going.\" They tell us that what we\u0027re doing matters. We believe that we have more to say and we want to find a way to make that possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the advent of Spotify and Apple Music, we\u0027ve found that most people don\u0027t buy music anymore. Our merch sales at shows and online sales are a fraction of what they were. For the past year, we\u0027ve made more money from Spotify than iTunes, but Spotify doesn\u0027t come close to making up for the income we\u0027ve lost from iTunes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere are some numbers for you:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes about 1,000,000 streams on Spotify to equal the same profit as 700 albums sold at $9.99, about $5,000. So let\u0027s say we spend $20,000 on our next studio record (which isn\u0027t a whole lot). We\u0027d need 4 million streams on Spotify to breakeven. When we started our Patreon in April 2017, our #1 song on Spotify had 1.3 million streams and that song was released in 2010.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to keep making music, but it\u0027s becoming increasingly hard to do so. If you kept working harder and harder and getting paid less and less with each passing year, you might consider a career change. Earlier this year, we made a couple of changes; now we\u0027re operating a recording studio out of our home, where we\u0027re producing other artists. We really enjoy this, but we still feel that it is worthwhile to make music of our own. We still feel called to this. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that most good art happens in community. We write about relationships and are inspired by our other creative friends. We\u0027ve made some of our best friends on the road. We find that we process life through songwriting and our hope is that we\u0027re able to communicate feelings and stories that many people have, but aren\u0027t always able to put into words. The patron system seems like a natural fit for our music as it gives folks the opportunity to come alongside us and participate in the creative process. We don\u0027t make music just for ourselves, we make it for all of us. We\u0027re all in this together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the four years prior to partnering with Patreon, we had one patron. He\u0027s not a family member, though at this point he kind of feels like one. This individual approached us after a show. He told us that he\u0027d had it on his heart and mind to support us financially. At the beginning of the month, we see his donation come through; we\u0027re reminded that he believes in us; he wants us to keep going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis patronage has helped cover:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBoosted posts on social media\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe cost of keeping our songs on iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, Google Play, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaintaining our email list\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaying our business manager\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeb hosting fees\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecording costs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eManufacturing costs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo-production costs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMuch more\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have hundreds of untouched melodies and lyrics recorded as voice memos on our phones and written down in our journals. We\u0027d like to make songs out of those. It sounds simple enough, but taking time to write songs and create demo recordings means coming off the road and playing less shows. Most of our income comes from touring, so when we\u0027re off the road, we\u0027re pretty much living on whatever we made from the last tour.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s\u00a0also becoming more difficult to come off the road and take the time to actually create art and content when we have a family to support. We believe that the health of our family depends not just on quality time, but quantity time. When we tour, we bring our kids along for the ride; honestly, while touring with kids is good for the health of our family, it\u0027s also exhausting, both for us and our kids. We\u0027d like to be able to give our family more of a break from that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is different from Kickstarter and PledgeMusic campaigns because it\u0027s sustainable; it brings consistency to the inconsistent life of a touring artist. Instead of receiving a large sum of money all at once and creating one big project, we\u0027re able to create art all year round.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming our patron, you\u0027re helping us create art and contributing to the health of our family. You\u0027re giving us the ability to steward the gifts God has given us. You\u0027re helping us write and record songs that would otherwise be stuck in our journals and phones.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
