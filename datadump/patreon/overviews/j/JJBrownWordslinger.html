    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eA long time ago, in a small town, one screen theater, I discovered a galaxy that I very much wanted to be a part of. \u00a0So much so, that I created my own character and wrote myself into it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, okay, I was seven, the movie was \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e, and I had so much fun writing my own adventures with those characters, that I went on to add myself into other favorite movies, TV shows and books. It would be more than a decade before I discovered that I had been writing fan fiction. By that time, I had been writing my own stories independent of pre-established worlds and creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I never forgot what writing those stories had taught me - character, plot, story, world-building - and it was those tools that helped me take that leap of faith into creating my own worlds. \u00a0My very first novel was a result of those efforts. \u00a0It is terrible, but most first attempts at anything usually are. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many goals planned for this site, which includes sharing some\u00a0original, serialized novels. One of the serialized novels is designed to allow you, the reader, to choose from four (4) options to determine the story\u0027s next action. \u00a0The other serialized novels will be standard, straight-forward tales. \u00a0This will include My Truly Awful First Novel, for the amusement of all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere may be some excerpts from Current Novel-In-Progress, as well as snippets from a saucy novella set in the 1920s. and revised scenes from a two act play. There will also be some posts about art, featuring some of my own art. \u00a0I\u0027ve been re-acquainting myself with painting and drawing, something I did for a number of years. My profile picture and the cover photo are recent paintings I did.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to begin this process and hope you feel the same as you join in. I\u0027m eager to build on what I\u0027ve currently established on my tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, welcome to my Patreon page and thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
