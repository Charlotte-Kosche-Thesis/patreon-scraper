Can you imagine?!?!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe band is ready! The studio has been picked out. The dogs are not quite sure what\u0027s about to happen.... oooooooh yeah.... four dogs in a Corolla with 315k miles on it?! Hell yes, that\u0027s all about to happen. That\u0027s an adventure in itself, right?! Holy crud.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be spending a few months in Wisconsin, (gasp!!), working with the band, playing a few shows and cutting this new Cd, and I truly do need your help to do it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will have not just have studio/production costs, but Lord help me... I\u0027m maintaining two households to pull this off. My home in Arizona, and renting in Wisconsin as well. WHOA! Talk about dreaming big! I\u0027m going to make this happen. I am. I am. I am. We are. There is just no room for failure here. None.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe total costs needed is really unknown, but in order to record and release just one Cd before the end of 2018, we will need our monthly pledges to be a minimum of $3,000 a month. It\u0027s a hefty goal, but... together, we can totally do this. \u00a0I am so grateful for those of you who have been with me as long as you have and I am excited to get to share this next leg of the journey with each of you, and the newbies that we pick up along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time I RISE up, again, with you pushing me along. It has been a very hard few years... a lot of years actually... and 8 years worth of songs that haven\u0027t been shared, except in Patreon (many have been released already through Patreon which you have immediate access to when you join). I am excited for this new adventure. I am eager. I am... finally ready, and I need your help to Rise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a pledger, you will get full access to all of the online content, no matter what level you pledge at, I want everyone to get to experience this no matter what you can afford. Pledge what you feel confident about contributing to the production of these songs (you can adjust your pledges every month if you need to). By pledging, you will get access to an exclusive Facebook Group where you get A LOT of behind the scenes fun! Included will be live streaming from the rehearsals where we work with the songs and bring them to life. You\u0027ll get to see how it all goes down in the studio, also with live streaming and video blogs. You\u0027ll get to help me choose artwork for the final Cd(s), and you will get your name in the credits of the released Cd(s) as long as you are a current Patreon member when the record comes out. I will send you a digital release as long as you are a current Patreon member when the Cd(s) are released. **I will shut down the ability to join Patreon a couple months prior to release for the lower levels**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $20 per month or above, you will be getting even MORE access, discounts and physical rewards sent in the mail to you... from new tour merchandise, to original art pieces, fun little trinkets and whatever inspires me to send out... I will also randomly send invites to visit the studio when we are recording, how fun?! There will be live online shows (acoustic, or maybe full band depending how we can set it up so it sounds good). The more you pledge, the better it gets! You\u0027ll also get discounts on merchandise at shows and private house concerts. Whoohoooooo! \u00a0**I will limit the ability to join Patreon a couple months prior to the Cd release at the upper levels**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe longer you are a part of Patreon, the more we can accomplish together. I hope that the rewards will be a fun part of this adventure, and that you will enjoy being a part of this process as much as I love having you here with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can raise or lower your pledge as you need to. You can cancel, or rejoin at any time. And once you sign up, you immediately get access to over 100 entries that are already in Patreon, including many downloadable songs and art pieces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will come along with me. I cannot do this without you... literally. *Wink*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s to the RISE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJL\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
