    "summary": "I\u0027ve been documenting my life learning to live in the Alaskan wilderness, completely off the grid, without roads or motorized transportation. Our land is on the Tanana River in the Alaskan Interior, 20+ miles from the nearest road. My goal is to eventually hunt, fish, and forage 100% of my food, and to use semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers lifeways as a guideline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime I\u0027m taking tons of pictures of the process and the amazing landscapes I see here. I usually average about 4-5 photos published a week. Sometimes we have a lot going on or we are traveling around the landscape, and I am producing a ton of work. Less often things are slower or we\u2019ve traveled to a place there is no way to access the internet and I am not sharing any photos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMy Backstory\u003c/h2\u003eI\u0027ve been struggling to pursue my work as an embroidery artist since my first gallery exhibition in Austin, TX in 2007. Despite shows in Austin, Los Angeles, New York, and London, I never found a platform for the kind of ongoing support required to stay in the creative mode necessary to release constant material (and eat and sleep under a roof). I figured that having my work featured in books, made into movie posters, shown as public art campaigns, and licensed by mass-market retailers would provide an escape trajectory from perpetual life as part-time as a barista. Unfortunately, achieving those milestones didn\u0027t finance my rather modest urban lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I became involved with the Feralculture project, and it was able to procure its first piece of land, I was met with the opportunity to pursue a long-time dream of mine, subsistence living in Alaska. I sold pretty much everything I owned and liquidated my unsold art to fund the move and help get the project off the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a brief stop in eastern Oregon, where I helped build a canvas wall tent, as well as some other gear and organize everything with my partner, we then packed all of it into a tiny frankencar and headed up the Alaska-Canadian highway. I took on a freelance embroidery job a few days before we were setting off, because why wouldn\u0027t you want to do some massively time consuming work in a packed car on a tight deadline while moving cross-country on one of the most notoriously bumpy sections of highway in North America?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we set up our first camp, it quickly became apparent to me that embroidery work would no longer be a regular option for me. Being so far off the road system and with very limited technology, there would be no way to make it work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we\u0027ve set up multiple camps making our way down the Tanana Valley to the place I now call home, I\u0027ve been documenting the process through photography. It just started happening naturally and became a nice creative outlet for me, where fiber art couldn\u0027t serve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was posting the photos on instagram and the website whenever I was able to grab a little Internet access, and the responses were that people felt inspired by the project and wanted to learn more about the process we were going through.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTime \u0026amp; Money\u003c/h2\u003eLiving out in the wilderness and trying to survive off the land actually is an endeavor that has monetary expenses. The biggest hurdles I face are the interfaces between the woods and the rest of the world. I sometimes struggle with whether or not I should continue to maintain them. I would like the experiment to be something others can join \u2013 whether that means joining me where I am, starting a similar project, or being inspired to make smaller changes in their lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently use a hand-me-down mobile phone to take all of my photos, I would like to create higher quality photos and I have dreams of being able to share with you things like the beauty of seeing the river ice breakup and move out. These projects would require better equipment that is out of my reach. There are many other random expenses that I run into trying to continue this project and grow community, as we all know we can\u2019t just walk out of the money economy. I expect that you trust me to manage those funds accordingly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen living so far from civilization and trying to avoid the petroleum economy, there are no local jobs to be had. So far I\u0027ve been taking seasonal work elsewhere to finance the lifestyle. I\u0027ve worked in southern Alaska serving food to tourists in the northernmost rainforest in the world and scrubbing toilets in Antarctica. Those jobs sometimes allow interesting adventures, but they disrupt subsistence living, which requires direct participation in the flow of seasons. I find myself choosing between cash and missing moose hunting (a major source of food for the year), or being away all summer while I need to be working on building shelters and making other preparations for winter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarning: While the many of my photos are of the beauty I see in in the woods, there is a more gritty side of subsistence living. I often take pictures of things like our hunts, animals being broken down for meat, and hide tanning. I always try to approach this type of subject matter with the upmost respect for life (you won\u0027t see any typical smiling hunting shots here), but some people might find those images disturbing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOutposts\u003c/h2\u003eYou can see my Instagram at \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jenniferbot/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@jenniferbot\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can learn more about our land project on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.feralculture.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFeralculture website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps a monthly commitment isn\u0027t your thing, you can make a one time contribution via \u003ca href=\"https://paypal.me/feralculture\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePayPal.me\u003c/a\u003e"
