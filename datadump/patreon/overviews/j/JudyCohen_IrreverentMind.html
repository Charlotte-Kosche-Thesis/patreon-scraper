So I am\ngoing to do it for her.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSo what does Judy\nCohen do?  Simply, she guides people to\npeace.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe how, the naming of this\nprocess, is not so simple.  Not a\ntherapist.  Not a guru.  Not a teacher.  And yet all of those.  Judy has a unique (in my many years\u0027 experience, anyway) ability to pull the covers off the tricks of the mind \u2013\nthose worries, obsessions, fears, dark fantasies that the mind loves to produce\n\u2013 and reveal them for what they really are.  Just thoughts.  That\u2019s it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSounds simple,\ndoesn\u2019t it?  And it is in the simplicity\nof Judy\u2019s \u201cmind tickling\u201d that the secret lies. \nOur minds love to give themselves a job to do.  Something to think about, mull about, plan,\nscheme, empire build \u2013 or destroy.  And\nthe more we identify as a player in the movie, the more we validate something\nthat\u2019s not actually real.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen Judy works\nwith her clients, of which I am grateful to number myself, you get to step back\nfrom your \u201cspot\u201d and see the stage, the lights, the cameras and, of course, the\nDirector.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn decades of\nworking with therapists and healers I have never come close, not even vaguely\nclose, to the profound and enlightening understanding I have now of my own pain\nand suffering and how to relieve them, instantly.  As Alice probably says in Tim Burton\u2019s Alice\nin Wonderland, \u201cYou are nothing but a pack of cards.\u201d  Judy gives you back the deck.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nI hope so much\nthat Judy will find patrons here to support her supporting others!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHer weekly Mind-Tickler essays are\nenlightening in and of themselves and hold so much truth, freely given.  As a patron, you will receive extra Mind-Ticklers each month and, depending on the level of support you give, you even get your own sessions with Judy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you are truly\ninterested in awakening to your higher self and yet still being able to live in\nthis physical world \u2013 and helping others less fortunate to do the same, then\nJudy\u2019s your woman.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e--V, London, England\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e--------------------------------------------\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003e\"These writings are bloody brilliant.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem style=\"\"\u003e\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003ecreative and genius and FUN!
