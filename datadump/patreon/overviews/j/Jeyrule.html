My name is Jey :D\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love art in all forms, specifically drawing and ceramics, but as of late I have been highly unmotivated to do anything. A lot of this lack of motivation I believe has to do with my current living situation at the moment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why am I here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m struggling to make enough income to upkeep a household and also take care of my animals and myself. Any little bit of help I could get would be greatly appreciated, and would also help me become motivated to create art again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect from me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current goal is to get a piece of art whenever possible, but as of right now it\u0027s looking as though it can take up to 3 weeks or a month to finish a piece. I primarily create art having to do with video games - one of my favorite series being The Legend of Zelda series - but I\u0027m open and willing to create art having to do with other subjects as well!\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few of my digital works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ton.twitter.com/i/ton/data/dm/887774777733263364/887774767121616897/OfcxlXsx.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFEZL-iXYAAqxvw.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnNaSUiXYAQx6iJ.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as some works I\u0027ve done with charcoal, graphite, and chalk (some of which is still-life):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ChmY3HOWsAAxPW1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8IE8smUwAEBUUU.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CeMdNobWAAAZe3v.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd lastly, some of my ceramic stuff:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DATafDhW0AAMy6j.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is something I absolutely \u003cstrong\u003eLOVE\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and I want to do more of (and plan to do more of)!
