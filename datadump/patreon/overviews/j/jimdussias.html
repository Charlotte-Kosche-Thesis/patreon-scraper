Those two trips were life changing experiences, and I have enough material in sketchbooks and on video to last me many years. Having said that, I plan on returning to Greece at least every other year for the rest of my life.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m now ready to branch out to other parts of the United States, in particular the Appalachian region, where my maternal great grandparents were from - do you see a pattern here?\u003cbr\u003eI would like you to join me on my next journey to this ancient, historic, and fascinating part of America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will I be doing? \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be paddling and filming the world\u0027s second oldest river, stopping on a sandbar to do a quick watercolor sketch and maybe cast a fly to a rising trout ? Perhaps a hike into a remote area to fish for native brook trout and then later doing an oil painting of that beautiful fish.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be upgrading my video camera and editing software to ensure high quality results.\u003cbr\u003eI will also be outfitting a new art studio with a bigger easel for much bigger canvases(that will have some mixed media elements that I\u0027m really excited about)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you will have exclusive access to Patreon specific videos of my travels and outings, art tutorials, fly tying tutorials, and artworks in progress. These videos will be posted on a weekly basis.\u003cbr\u003eI will be doing a monthly raffle/giveaway of a half dozen custom tied flies and/or an original watercolor sketch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being a fan of my work. I hope you\u0027ll join me on this next adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
