I\u0027m Jeff Pina and I love to make comics and art!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been self-publishing over 10 years now, also working on projects for Valiant Comics, Big Dog Ink, Moonstone and a lot of my fellow indie folks! For the last 6 years, making comics and selling them on the comic con circuit has been my full-time job, and now I\u0027ve added stay-at-home-dad to that list!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still work part-time to help on bills (and also so I have other interactions than with the baby and cats!) but still need to stay ahead of my publishing schedule, as I\u0027ve created several series, both ongoing and minis. It\u0027s always my goal throughout the year to publish no less than 6 comics, graphic novels or artbooks. Which can get pretty ambitious when it\u0027s just me (and my wonderful wife on letters and digital setup!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon will help support pretty much everything from paying the bills, to keeping my comics going. The ultimate goal is to jsut be 100% on the comics (and the dad part =). I\u0027ve also included some other artwork I do, as I\u0027m also known for a \u0027Chibi\u0027 art style that I make by hand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for my comics, here\u0027s a list of what I make:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDR.
