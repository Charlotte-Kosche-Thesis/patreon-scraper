Here\u0027s more info!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, we are Nitrozac and Snaggy, and in case you don\u0027t know us already, we\nmake a comic called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Joy of Tech\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0We\u0027ve been creating comics and content at GeekCulture.com since 1998, with over 2500 episodes of The Joy of Tech under our belts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, we\u0027ve made our living via licensing, merchandise, and advertising. We\u00a0never liked having ads on our website, (I think we hate them more than anyone!), but they were a necessary evil that allowed us to continue our work. Not so much anymore in this age of ad blockers and native ads. Over the past year, there has been a collapse of display advertising as a revenue source for sites like ours, and many have shifted to clickbait models. We are not willing to subject our fans to native ads, sponsored posts, and all that other garbage that\u0027s sprouted up almost everywhere, so instead we are asking for your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are hoping that support from readers like you can help fill in the gap where advertising has fallen away.\u00a0We hope it will\nenable us to continue to create our work and deliver it for free on the web to\neveryone. We\u0027re hoping it will enable us to eliminate advertising, and to pay some bills and update some of our decade-old hardware. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s also a tendency for people to not visit regular websites anymore: they just stay on Facebook and image sites like Imgur and Instagram, places that don\u0027t generate us any income.\u00a0A Patreon-supported comic would free us up from\nthe constant need to get people to come to our website in order for us make a living. We could include the full comic in social media posts and in our RSS feed, and we wouldn\u0027t have to rely so much on actual website hits to put food on the table and juice in the computers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/patreon/happygeek.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support through Patreon will allow us to continue bringing much needed laughs to the tech industry. We\u2019ve been there from the\nbeginnings of the Internet, cheering on the Rise of the Geeks, as they\nhave flourished and gone on to do amazing things. And we\u0027ve also been there when there\u0027s been a need to call them to task on issues such as privacy, questions of morality, hypocrisy, or just plain stupidity. We\nfeel there is still a need for our type of work, an independent voice that holds a mirror up to the tech world, to celebrate it, but also to occasionally rip it a new one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Internet has been good to us, and\nhas allowed us to keep poking fun at the tech world and pop culture for\nover 15 years. We do hope you will support us now so that we can keep bringing everyone The Joy of Tech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNitrozac and Snaggy\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(What\u0027s Patreon? Patreon is ongoing crowdfunding for creators. You pledge a dollar amount per month to support our work, and that enables us to keep making Joy of Tech comics for everybody.\u00a0If you are new to how Patreon works, you can find a video about it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e) Note: Rewards of physical items and illustrations are delivered after your first contribution, which is the start of the next month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
