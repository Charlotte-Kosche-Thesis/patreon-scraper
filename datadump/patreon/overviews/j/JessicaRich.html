I\u0027m an established painter of 3D miniatures, but have recently been delving back into the 2D world. I\u0027ve never had \"formal\" education in illustration or painting, but I haven\u0027t let that hold me back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve fallen in love with watercolour painting, and the freedom of expression it allows. My imagination wants to pour itself onto the page, and I want to share it with the world, to make it more than my hobby. With your support, I will be able to spend more time developing my skills, and paint what I see in my mind every day."
