    "summary": "Well, this is a somewhat big moment of my life that is about to unfurl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;Notices the viewer\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreetings to you all and, to those who will be Patrons to my page, I thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst question, who am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Name is Brad Stephenson, or by my Pen-and-Game name Jago Dakari, and i am an aspiring writer based in Australia. As you may have noticed on my banner that i am a writer of both Fantasy and Science Fiction, two genres that are close to my heart since childhood, be it by book or game. The deeper the lore, the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s why I am here. Hopefully with your support, I can make this dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first major epic in works, Slayer\u0027s Vengeance, set in the Alien\u0027s Vs Predator universe, has been well received on Fanfiction.net, in terms of writing style and character development and of course rocking action sequences, and I hope that it could be published in the future. The lingering pang of Aliens: Colonial Marines (And it\u0027s \u0027CANON\u0027) \u00a0is still throbbing in my head :(. And the newer novels to the main storyline, inter-quals and what-not, are serving to muddle things up in my opinion. Don\u0027t get me started on the plot holes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, second question, why should you support my Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I hope to serve up something that would be clear and treat the universe with the adoration and respect it deserves, be it in an alternate timeline to the mainstream more based on the original comics. Slayer\u0027s Vengeance would have a clear theme of ancient history and mythology, coupled with extensive lore building to intertwine with the Universe\u0027s original setting but still retain a unique feel unto itself. there will also be epic clashes between ancient forces, be it those of good, evil and those who follow neither Light or Dark.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd before any of you ask, I intend to get a new chapter out every 2-3 months. I am particular when it comes to quality. As matter of fact, I intend to rewrite Slayers Vengeance earlier chapters to a better standard for my Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that is not all, for I have many original ideas floating around in my head just waiting to come out. Including a somewhat.... absurd tale involving a tree-crazed lumberjack and a crumpet-addicted dwarf. Yes, I had too much free time on my hands and I have plans for them if this Patreon should get off the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo without further due, I must retreat back to my cesspit to hammer out these tales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and happy reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;Trapdoor opens beneath and i fall down into darkness\u0026gt;"
