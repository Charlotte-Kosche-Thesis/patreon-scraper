I\u0027ve worked in politics and nonprofit advocacy for a decade, for organizations like NARAL Pro-Choice America, Wendy Davis for Governor, and other progressive causes. \u003cstrong\u003eI strive to bring an unabashedly heart-first, intersectional social justice frame to the art I make.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the home of my Patreon community.

The funds we raise here will go directly towards buying the gear we need for our creations (from cameras that capture beautiful shots to software we need for editing to money to pay the amazing experts we\u0027re lucky to work with).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also allows me to be supported directly by you, the community, and thus be more beholden to the work we want and need to create, rather than having to endlessly pursue the quickest buck. Often, the work of increasing representation, fighting racism, ending gender inequality, and more doesn\u0027t pay--but this way, I can stay focused squarely on our shared mission of making the world a better place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eThank You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI truly believe in the power of this community not only to help me financially, but for us to make art that we\u0027re proud of and to hold each other accountable.
