Brewer here, and today, I want to talk to you about\nputting books into classrooms. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOnce upon a time, I was a high school teacher, but I did not\nleave the classroom after seven years because I became disgruntled or angry at\nthe system. I loved working with students, and I found great joy in helping\nthem discover their voices within the world of literature. However, as much as\nI loved teaching, I left the classroom because there was something calling from\nmy core that I couldn\u2019t ignore any longer. Writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince launching my first novel, I have found my way back to\nteaching in the strangest of ways. As an author. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough Skype dates, classroom visits, and writing\nworkshops, I\u2019ve been able to talk to teenagers about the joys and pains of writing.\nWe\u2019ve discussed things like how to pick character names, how to edit, how to\ntighten dialogue, how to journal while experiencing nature, how to work with\ncriticism while ignoring negativity, and how to power through with or without\ninspiration. I\u2019ve even begun a YouTube channel, \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/jdbrewerbooks\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/jdbrewerbooks\u003c/a\u003e, to\ndiscuss some of these writing tips and struggles in more detail as a resource for\nteachers and young writers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThree novels into my writing career, I\u2019ve discovered that\nthere is a humbling sense of awe that happens when a young writer or reader\ngets to talk to an author. It is still unnerving to experience, but when\nstudents are able to have access to authors, they feel the possibility in their\nown writing. They get to ask those questions that otherwise would not be\nanswered, whether it\u2019s about the actual books or about the process of writing\nthem. After experiencing this, the forever teacher in me could not be quieted. I\nstill enjoy any opportunity to hang out with teenagers who are searching for\nways to make their voices heard. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYet, when I find myself in front of classrooms, I keep\nwishing I could give away free books. I think it\u2019s the inner teacher in me that\ncringes at the idea of teenagers paying for words, because as a teacher, I used\nto rack my brain trying to get them to read and write. Then, when I see teenagers\neager to read something I\u2019ve written, deep down in my heart, I want to tell\nthem to put their money away, take the book, and run. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, I thought I would try Patreon to cover the costs of\ngetting books into students\u2019 hands. I am hoping to give away three to six books\nper classroom a month. If I earn more than the cost of three to six books that\nmonth, then the excess will be put towards sending a donation to the next\nclassroom on the list. Plus, any classroom that receives the donation will be\ngiven the option for a free Skype Date during that year. The content of the\nSkype Date can be on a specific writing topic the teacher is trying to work\ninto their lesson plans or a simple Q\u0026amp;A session. If distance and scheduling\nallow, for the cost of travel, classrooms that receive donations can even opt\nin for a live author visit. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBooks will be given at a first to sign up, first to be served\nbasis as donations come in. If you are a secondary teacher (or you know one)\nwho would like to be put on the list, please let me know by contacting me on\nsocial media outlets. In terms of content, the audience I write towards is\nbetween the ages of fifteen and eighteen, and the genre I mostly work in\n(though I\u2019m not limited to) is science fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are a potential donor, please consider throwing two,\nfive, or twenty dollars a month towards this venture. It doesn\u2019t have to be\nmuch on your part to do something big for young readers and writers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat else is in it for patrons, besides the feeling of\ngetting books in students\u2019 hands? Once a month, I will choose one patron at\nrandom to send a free, signed copy of one of my novels to keep or give away. I\nwill also post first looks of upcoming projects that only patrons will\nsee.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI thank you for your support on this venture in advance! Your\ndonation will allow me to help aspiring writers find their voices. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith warm wishes, \u003cbr\u003e\n\nJ.D. Brewer\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nP.S. For more information on me, and my shenanigans, don\u2019t\nforget to follow me online! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlso, check out my website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.jdbrewerbooks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.jdbrewerbooks.com\u003c/a\u003e, to see which\nschools are receiving books! \u003cbr\u003e"

There are those who say she\u0027s fiercer than a baby pterodactyl, despite the fact that she was probably a stegosaurus in another life. Others have titles for her that are a bit more generic: friend, teacher, student, family, etc.The truth is, she spends her time gathering moments from the people (and puppies) she loves, and from those moments, she creates. She glues letters into words, words into thoughts, and thoughts into questions. When she\u0027s not out having a blast in the universe she shares with you, she\u0027s creating her own through pen, paper, and keyboard. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more updates on upcoming novels and her shenanigans as a writer, follow J.D. online!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.jdbrewerbooks.com\"\u003ewww.jdbrewerbooks.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jdbrewerbooks\"\u003ewww.twitter.com/jdbrewerbooks\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/jdbrewerbooks\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/jdbrewerbooks\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/jdbrewerbooks\"\u003ewww.goodreads.com/jdbrewerbooks\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/jdbrewerbooks\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/jdbrewerbooks\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

If you are a secondary teacher (or you know\na teacher) who would like to be put on the list, please let me know. In terms of\ncontent, the audience I write towards is between the ages of fifteen and eighteen,\nand the genre I mostly work in (though I\u2019m not limited to) is science fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are a donor, please consider throwing two, five, or\ntwenty dollars a month towards this venture.
