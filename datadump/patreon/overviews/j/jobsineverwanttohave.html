(Do we ever really \u003cem\u003eknow\u003c/em\u003e another person, though?) (Yeah, I\u0027ll stop.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e I\u0027m H. Claire Taylor, bestselling humorous fiction author, blogger, podcaster, and \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdel\u003efamily disappointment\u00a0\u003c/del\u003e\u003cstrong\u003elovable scamp. \u003c/strong\u003eMaybe you discovered me through the Jessica Christ series or the Something Nice to Say podcast, or, hell, even The Waffling (if you don\u0027t know, don\u0027t worry about it). Or maybe you met me on a transatlantic flight and we hit it off but I\u0027m married now so we don\u0027t speak anymore. Just a totally made-up example.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI write fiction full-time under three different pen names: H. Claire Taylor, Brock Bloodworth, and Nova Nelson.\u003c/strong\u003e Which is my real name? If we\u0027re getting super technical, none of them. But I\u0027m speaking with you today as H. Claire Taylor, fully aware that normal people do not introduce themselves with a firm handshake and, \"Nice to meet you. I\u0027m speaking with you today as Bruce,\" or whatever her name is. Now that we\u0027re on familiar terms, you can call me Claire, or H. Claire if that helps you differentiate me from the myriad Claires in your life. But please, do \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0call me Gwen, because that\u0027s simply not my name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.hclaireblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Patreon-Headers2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I launched this Patreon is that \u003cstrong\u003ethere weren\u0027t enough people in my life who decided it was easier to tell me to \"get a real job,\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0than to pursue their own creative passions\u003c/strong\u003e, so I thought I would take things a step further and \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e set off those stifled curmudgeons by asking people to support me in this way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile that\u0027s not entirely true, I should address why a full-time author would need a Patreon account.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make a modest amount off my fiction. It\u0027s enough to keep my husband happy, at least. Or maybe that\u0027s my cooking. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m not here to get rich. I\u0027m here because I have a non-fiction book of comedy essays that I want to write and that I know\u00a0people (that\u0027s you, you person!) will enjoy.\u003c/strong\u003e The problem is that I already work 60-70 hours a week to make the money I do from my fiction, and adding another book to my already packed production schedule means losing income from my established series to venture into a new genre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I\u0027ve said (and I \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e saying), \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m an established humorous fiction author. That\u0027s not the same as an established humorous non-fiction author.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m also not famous, so I can\u0027t just tweet \"Hey, I published a book about my thoughts and maybe I mention some famous people I\u0027ve slept with that you didn\u0027t know about. You animals will EAT IT UP!\" and then make a million dollars. That\u0027s on me, I accept that. I didn\u0027t do what it took to be a household name, and\u00a0I turned down all the invitations for sex from famous men. Let the record show that there were a bunch of them. Additionally, let the record show that I can\u0027t prove it, but you can\u0027t \u003cem\u003edisprove\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0it.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy lack of international recognizability means every time I bring up this essay collection, \u003cem\u003eJobs I Never Want to Have\u003c/em\u003e, my smarter author friends say, \"Don\u0027t even go there, stupid.\" They have a point. But also, maybe they\u0027re not great friends? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m clearly not listening to them anymore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.hclaireblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Patreon-Headers3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI worked a hodgepodge of jobs before I found myself here.\u003c/strong\u003e Most of them were not good. And along the way, I \u003cem\u003econsidered\u003c/em\u003e working a host of other jobs just to make ends meet. When I say \"make ends meet\" I\u0027m not talking affording a tanning salon subscription or a new outfit every month, I\u0027m talking affording a new v-neck tee at Walmart because the one I have I bought in eighth grade and it has a hole in it right in the nipple, which, I should say, has nothing to do with the sharpness of my nipples. Just thought I\u0027d clarify. But again, this is merely a fictional example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach chapter of this collection, \u003cem\u003eJobs I Never Want to Have\u003c/em\u003e, will be a mostly self-contained essay about a specific job\u003c/strong\u003e that I worked or almost worked or someone I know works or maybe none of these. For example, teacher (check!), waitress (check!), or\u00a0cop (husband is this one). They\u0027ll go off topic, of course, exploring the Big Questions as well as the Useless Questions. \u003cstrong\u003eEach is guaranteed to make you laugh\u003c/strong\u003e (especially if you\u0027ve worked that job) and maybe it\u0027ll even make you feel something again. That last bit is for sure not guaranteed since I don\u0027t know what sort of an emotional disaster you are/what medications you\u0027re taking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will write and release an essay a month to backers until the book is finished, hopefully within a year. \u003cstrong\u003eOnce all the essays are complete and the book has undergone extreme editing, it will be published for the world to see\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e this Patreon will be wrapped up with some sort of a celebration, and you\u0027ll be able to say you were there for the journey.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.hclaireblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Patreon-Headers4.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much. Essays. Audio recordings. Funny videos. Personal thank-yous. Signed copies. Maybe even an exclusive online party. What you get depends on the support level you choose, but each of them has something mega fun associated with it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s how it works.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach time I send out an essay, you\u0027ll be charged your pledge amount.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I straight-up don\u0027t have the time to publish an essay a day or anything that nuts, so don\u0027t worry about that. Generally, it will be once a month. Maybe once every three weeks if I decide to overachieve or once every five weeks if I\u0027m launching a bunch of fiction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLaunch point: \u003c/strong\u003eOnce I hit my goal of $500 per essay, I\u0027ll release the first one to qualified backers.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eHurrah! The sooner I hit that mark, the sooner you start receiving the essays. And until I reach that goal, you won\u0027t be charged because, duh, I haven\u0027t given you anything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinish line:\u003c/strong\u003e When I\u0027ve completed 12-15 essays, I\u0027ll consider the collection complete and that\u0027ll be a wrap on this Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne-time physical gifts, like signed copies and swag, will be delivered to backers once the project is complete. Higher backer levels will likely get little extra gifts from me along the way, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBig thanks for reading this far rather than clicking out of the window in disgust.\u003c/strong\u003e The idea of artists who spend their lives honing their craft getting paid a basic amount for their creations shouldn\u0027t be revolutionary, but it kind of is. Patreon backers are like the opposite of HuffPo editors who ask writers to submit solely for \"exposure\" (something I can easily get from walking buck-ass naked outside into the Texas sun), and that should make you feel good. \u003cstrong\u003eYou are morally superior to a HuffPo editor.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m grateful to you for being a part of this revolution.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart. Specifically, my left ventricle.\u003cbr\u003e-Claire\u003c/strong\u003e"
