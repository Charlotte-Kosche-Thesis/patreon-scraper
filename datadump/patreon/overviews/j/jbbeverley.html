    "summary": "Greetings folks, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for coming to my Patreon page! For any\nof you who know who I am and have been following my work, you know that I have\nmy hands in various pots of creativity and expression, and chances are you are\nhere because you want to support my endeavors. For those of you who aren\u0027t\nfamiliar with my work, please allow me to introduce myself to you:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is J.B. Beverley, and for the better\npart of my life I have been an independent musician, spanning multiple bands\nand multiple genres. I also engineer and produce other peoples\u0027 records and\nvideos. In recent years I have taken to some writing, acting, snake wrangling,\nand other adventures. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is at this point in my life where I find\nmyself at a significant crossroads. I have ruptured my rotator cuff, lost my insurance, and been told by my doctor that I cannot tour until it is addressed. But between not being able to perform much, and being physically limited, my income by has gone to hell, and I am stuck at home, and having to put many projects off to just sustain income. This is something\nthat is growing tiresome and difficult. So I am here on Patreon to offer a more intimate\nplatform to my fans and supporters in an effort to stabilize my income a bit,\nand free myself up to finish many of these long-awaited projects. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am currently trying to finish my new album\n\"Head South\", plot the next Wayward Drifters record, work on a\nhardcore punk side project, finish the Ghostdance album, finish two film\nscripts, my book, take part in an upcoming movie with Jessie Seitz and Jim Van\nBebber, and keep myself afloat despite my injuries.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have launched some new content here on Patreon too. I have a weekly video short called \"Let\u0027s Talk News\", where I go over and react to the latest headlines. I also have a weekly podcast called \"Where The Monsters Live\", which is centered around subversive and somewhat taboo elements of culture. From horror films and renegade underground artists, to snake men and other outliers, the show takes you on a bit of a journey, and it is available first here on Patreon (to members of the \"Snake Den\" tier)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goals here are to not only create\nsome supplemental income, but to upgrade some of my audio and video equipment\nto bring you all the best possible production quality that I can. I will\nalso be broadcasting behind the scenes footage from here at Rebel Roots Studio,\nas well as from film sets and documentary locations. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease take a moment and watch my introductory\nvideo to see what exactly I will be doing here. If you like what I do, and want\nto help an independent artist skirt the madness of the industry, your support\nand contributions are not only much needed, but also greatly appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to be seeing you all here on\nPatreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBest, \u003cbr\u003e\n- J.B. Beverley \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
