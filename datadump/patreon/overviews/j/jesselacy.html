This is how we succeed together. Ask my friends, my main two mottos are \u003cstrong\u003e\"Enjoy A Good Thing\"\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e\"We Are Stronger Together\"\u003c/strong\u003e, and I truly live that way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is hard to beat that moment when an artist tells me that she would not have organized her press kit without my specific submission guidelines or when a blog reader tells me that he has discovered some of his favorite new acoustic artists on my blog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I started the \u003ca href=\"http://jesselacy.com/fridayfeature/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e#FridayFeature\u003c/a\u003e and continue to support talented folk musicians, from all around the world, and do the hard work necessary to keep it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the reasons I work so hard to support other musicians navigating this crazy industry is because I am also a DIY musician. I know how hard it can be. In my 10 yrs performing live music, I have made many, many mistakes and bad, bad jokes. However, I have also seen and discovered some amazing things and met some influential people living their passions. Maybe I have also learned a little along the way. So instead of watching fellow artists reinvent the wheel, I have made it a point, a mission, to support fellow folk artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I also administer a Facebook group called \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/music.mst/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMusicians Stronger Together (#MST)\u003c/a\u003e -- a community of folk musicians working together to succeed in the music industry.
