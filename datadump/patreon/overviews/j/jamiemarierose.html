    "summary": "I am an artist with a passion for writing, drawing, glass art, and all things fantasy. I have several on-going works, but currently, I am posting two stories here : \u0027Treasure\u0027 and \u0027Only Power\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTreasure\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDragons have always been well known for coveting treasure - gold, jewels, the occasional, priceless artifact - but sometimes, if they were desirable enough...the beasts would steal a person. This is a story of a possessive monster, a confused captive, and the bleeding walls of a castle that make up their world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOnly Power\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThey were adored by the masses, they were famous, they were glorified... but gladiators were still slaves. He knew nothing good could come from falling in love with a killer, least of all one with a silver smile constrained by golden shackles. Shame that Hadrian never was very rational. Ancient Rome based (but fictional) society: violence, adult themes, political drama.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew chapters will be posted as blog posts. \u003cstrong\u003eI will update both stories every month, meaning one chapter of Treasure \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e one chapter of Only Power. To be clear - this means that if you pledge $1 or more, you will have access to both.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The first sections of both of these stories are posted publicly here:\u00a0(\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/treasure-1-14-7222583\"\u003eTreasure\u003c/a\u003e ;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/only-power-first-17954159\"\u003eOnly Power\u003c/a\u003e).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3292638/1/Treasure\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAfter that, you can find subsequent chapters posted individually. Here is the easiest way to do this: When you click on \u0027Posts\u0027, you will be taken to the page containing all of the posts I have made thus far on this site (crazy, I know). On the left side of the page, you will see two big blocks underneath the words \u0027Featured Tags\u0027. One of these is \u0027Treasure\u0027, and the other is \u0027Only Power\u0027. Click on the box of whichever story you want to read, and then only posts with chapters of that story will be on the page. They will all be labeled in the title as to what # chapter they are, and will be posted in order (so if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you should be able to read them all in order fairly easily).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all pledges you make are helping me to possibly, someday, achieve the same goal as every other struggling artist - to Make A Living Off Of Art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to check out my page!
