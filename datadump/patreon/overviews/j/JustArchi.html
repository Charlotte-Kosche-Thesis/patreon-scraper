I code a lot of stuff. In fact, I sometimes ask myself why am I coding stuff nobody needs, nobody will use and nobody really wants. I believe that I code it for myself, but people always prove me wrong.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nImagine a software, device or a service that you use, but doesn\u0027t fully satisfy you. Normally you\u0027d maybe write an e-mail, post a suggestion or said \"eh whatever\", but I\u0027m the man who says \"this is crap, I can do better than that\", and then through hard work and determination, actually achieve that, while learning a lot in the process.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOkay, we get it, so what did you make?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA lot of stuff. There are many people that know me from various different sources, some do recognize me even from a few. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nProbably the most of you know me from Steam, as I\u0027m the creator of\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArchiSteamFarm\u003c/a\u003e, which I like to call ASF. The reason for creating that software was very simple - Steam trading cards are basically a free source of virtual money you can buy games with, and I\u0027m true gamer by heart. This quickly caused my Steam library to grow in size rapidly, and all of those cards were waiting for me to be collected and spent on even more games... Problem is, there was no good idling software, as the only candidate at that time - Idle Master, was working only on Windows, required Steam to be running and was unreliable most of the time, requiring a restart or even whole reinstall. You should know me by now, I was not happy with that, so I created my own Idle Master.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9y1MARWkLWE?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m very proud of ASF, since GitHub statistics don\u0027t lie - every stable release is downloaded by approximately 50-100k users, and I\u0027m receiving a lot of positive feedback from my entire \"small\" community that I managed to create, which is truly a great feeling. This is mainly what I focus on today.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, ASF is not the only thing I managed to create across those years. Many people also recognize me from\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s3/development/rom-archidroid-v2-4-6-power-hands-t2354859\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eXDA\u003c/a\u003e, where I released my very own operating system based on Android, which I called ArchiDroid. The reason once again was simple; the original software from Samsung on my Galaxy S3 was so bloated and crappy that it was almost impossible to use. I got so annoyed with my new toy that I decided to create my own alternative OS, as the hardware was powerful enough to do much better than what Samsung sadly ruined with their TouchWiz. This was also my first really big project I decided to share.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWait what, that guy created his own OS just like that?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd I even wrote a whole engineering thesis about it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xbOURRqELTo?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSoon enough, I created my own \n\u003ca href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s3/development/kernel-archikernel-v1-0-power-hands-t2785337\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArchiKernel\u003c/a\u003e for battery life and speed, \u003ca href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2597220\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArchiKitchen\u003c/a\u003e for building, and my \u003ca href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2754997\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eoptimizations\u003c/a\u003e for maximum CPU efficiency. That was still not enough, so I even created my own ArchiToolchain based on \u003ca href=\"https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLinaro\u003c/a\u003e that I used in ArchiKitchen for compiling ArchiKernel and ArchiDroid, so I can generate even more superior code.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically, if you owned Samsung Galaxy S3 or Sony Xperia M and looked at custom firmwares available for those phones, then very likely you can recognize my software being around, if you didn\u0027t use it yourself that is. Despite of being outdated, some people I know still keep ArchiDroid on their phones, claiming it\u0027s the best Android OS that was ever created, even though there is still a lot more that could be done. As a \"thank you\", I even received a brand new device - OnePlus Two, absolutely for free, from one of my fans, that I still use today and I\u0027m very grateful for. It\u0027s not a common thing to see a happy user donating a $349 phone to a random Archi found on the internet, just because you like his work - this is when I knew that my work is truly something bigger than just \"me breaking things and sharing stuff with the rest of the world\".\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSadly, a while later I dropped my interest in Android development due to being too busy at the time, mainly with college. I was developing ArchiDroid for like 2 years if not more, with weekly releases, crapload of science going on, and code floating around in my GitHub repos 24/7. I needed a break, but of course not a break from development, but a break from Android, so I put my smartphone development on hold. Perhaps I\u0027ll return to Android someday, but that\u0027s unlikely considering my lack of interest in this matter -\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.lineageos.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLineageOS\u003c/a\u003e does the thing much better than my ArchiDroid did, even if some things could be done better... Still, this is what I use today and I\u0027m quite satisfied with it, which means that I\u0027m unlikely to spend my time on creating something better if it\u0027s good enough.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nApart from the above, I\u0027m working on many smaller side-projects, some which are widely known by public such as ArchiBoT, as well as other less known like\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://asf.justarchi.net/STM\"\u003eASF STM\u003c/a\u003e, which helps me during each Steam sale to match my cards and get some nice badges. I\u0027m also a founder of our small\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://touhou.justarchi.net/\"\u003eTouhou Giveaways\u003c/a\u003e SteamGifts group, where I can spend time on more relaxing things, such as making ArchiBoT capable of reminding me in 53 minutes to take lasagne out of oven.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what am I doing? I\u0027m doing science. In fact, I didn\u0027t even want to create a patreon at first - \"who the hell would like to support some random Archi fixing what is not broken on the Internet?\", but then one of the users \n\u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ascfarm/discussions/6/1353742967823953154/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003easked me for that\u003c/a\u003e, so I said why not, maybe people really want to support a mad scientist like me - after all my projects are no longer being used only by a few friends I know...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat we can expect from you in the future?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, assuming I\u0027m still alive, you can for sure expect that I\u0027m not moving anywhere as a person, and I\u0027m still going to work on things I consider useful, interesting and practical. I\u0027m software developer and it doesn\u0027t look like I\u0027m going through any rebranding anytime soon. I can\u0027t really foresee what I\u0027m going to do in following years, but I\u0027m definitely not going to stop playing video games, writing code or enjoying to share my knowledge. Who knows, maybe you\u0027ll be the one who suggests me the next big thing?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI created my Patreon because my users asked me to do so themselves. If you want to donate, you already know the reason and you don\u0027t need additional one. If you don\u0027t have a reason yet, then why you won\u0027t try out something I created and find a reason yourself? I created all of that myself, through hard work, dedication and determination, always trying the best I can do - give it a try, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll love it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a thank you, apart from the awesome feeling of supporting a hard-working developer, you can get access to some interesting things in terms of the software and IT in general, even if you\u0027re not currently using any of my work. Refer to rewards for more info. Although you should be aware that I don\u0027t really maintain that big activity on patreon itself, as I like to focus on what I\u0027m doing best - writing long walls of text like this one is not really my strongest trait.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m very grateful for all the support, since coding usually requires several ingredients - mainly food, water, electricity, working Internet and time. You can most definitely help me with the first 4 issues, while I\u0027m slowly teaching ArchiBoT to handle tasks that I need to do daily, so I can spend more time on doing science and less on boring repetitiveness.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can be sure that by supporting me you\u0027re supporting open-source developer that puts gigantic amount of work and dedication into his projects, making them as perfect as possible, while at the same time offering that hard work to everybody entirely for free, with a hope that it will come useful and practical to more people. I never ask for money for my projects, but I do appreciate a lot generous people that despite of that want to donate something nonetheless. Thank you!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
