    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out\u00a0my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Julian McDonnell and I\u0027ve been making videos for 10 years. You might have seen my award-winning travel log Take Me To Pitcairn or one of my many videos about London called \"Joolz Guides\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really delighted that this platform exists so that anyone who enjoys my films can help support me to make more. No one pays me to make these films and I do it because I believe you are worth it. \u00a0I think YouTube is the most honest form of film making because you don\u0027t have to pay if you don\u0027t like what you see. You can switch off whenever you like. If you do like what you see and you can\u0027t afford to pay then a simple thank you goes a long way! In the cinema you have to pay before you even know if the film is any good or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do enjoy my films and you can afford a dollar or two, please make a donation here on Patreon. $5 and I\u0027ll be delighted. $20 and I\u0027ll probably ask you to marry me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously, this is how I\u0027m trying to make a living so if you can afford it please make a donation, and if you can\u0027t then just say thanks in the comments section under one of my videos on youtube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing these videos isn\u0027t easy and isn\u0027t cheap. They take a long time to film and I also have to pay my cameraman. Getting around London and around the world is a costly process and the equipment is always changing and needs upgrading.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, if you\u0027re really strapped for cash keep your money! I will still make my films anyway and a simple thank you will mean a lot to me. I love it when people enjoy my films. But if you can afford to help then I\u0027ll be massively grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
