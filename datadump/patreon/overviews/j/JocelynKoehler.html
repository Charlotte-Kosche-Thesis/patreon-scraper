I write romances and mystery novels under different pen names, but I also love short fiction, especially speculative, which is what I\u0027ll be publishing here. Mostly. I\u0027m unpredictable.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe books I write under my pen names have (just!) a large enough audience to earn out and even give me a small allowance after production costs. In the case of other stories though, there\u2019s no way I can earn anything close to minimum wage for the time invested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where Patreon comes in. While I really, really enjoy writing romance and mystery, I want to keep pushing my craft in new ways. But it\u2019s been hard to step away from my pen names in order to focus on my \"Jocelyn writing\". Hopefully Patreon will allow me to do that.\u00a0So the short version is: you pay, I write. Think of it as subscribing to a very focused online magazine that only publishes me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll post stories at the rate of approximately one per month. (Longer stories might be broken up into multiple posts, but the fee is monthly, so it\u0027s not a Kill Bill situation.) \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Jocelyn Koehler. Made in Wisconsin, exported to Philadelphia, citizen of the \u2018verse. I am a writer person. Pretty much everything I\u2019ve done in my life is related to words and books. I\u2019ve been a student, librarian, bookseller, archivist, editor, and a few other things. I\u0027m now a writer. When I\u2019m not doing things with words, I like to lay around, think about cats, and figure out new ways to incorporate cheese into my diet. One MAY go to teamblood.org to learn more. If you want. No pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
