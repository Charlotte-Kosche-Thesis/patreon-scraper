I used to toil away for years at a time without sharing my music making journey. Patreon has allowed me a platform to share my work- as I make it, and to help build a sustainable income for my music, which really helps! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I share on average 3 songs a month and write a little bit about each song. Whenever I post a new song you get an email from me letting you know. Then you can listen and download the song if you like, you can also tell me what you think, in that way you are helping to shape my new records. I love this idea, It gives me a way to share something unique with just my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging a few dollars per song (whatever you can afford). You get to share in an intimate part of my writing process as well as to know you are enabling me to spend more time working on my music.\u003cstrong\u003e Thanks very much for believing in my dream.\u003c/strong\u003e Onward and upward, Jacob\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTo Become a Patron: \u003cbr\u003eCheck out the cool rewards for different pledge levels below!!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e \u003cli\u003eClick the big button that says Become a Patron.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eChoose your pledge amount for each song I share.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eDone! Now each time I share a new song on Patreon\u00a0you will get a message, you can then download the song, leave comments on the post and share in this community.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eThank you for your support. Know that your pledge really helps me to make a living as a musician!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eAs a patron of mine, you are welcome (and encouraged)\u00a0to comment on my posts.

You can cap your total amount per month to whatever you want so you don\u0027t have to worry about going over your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m in the UK can I still be a part of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an international site. You can pledge with your native currency Euros,Pounds etc...and Patreon will translate it to US dollars. It\u0027s like any recurring subscription payment on your card.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if you share more than three songs in a month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is for individual songs. But if I was just on fire and wrote and wanted to share more then 3 songs in a month, then you can always put a limit on the total amount you want to pledge per month. You can do this at anytime. no hassle. So you don\u0027t have to worry about going over your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan I change my pledge amount or cancel if I need to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, absolutely. you can change your pledge amount or cancel at any time.
