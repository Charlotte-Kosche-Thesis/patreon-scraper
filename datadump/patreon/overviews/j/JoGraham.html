    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe stories I tell\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter a world where gods speak through their mortal avatars, heroes battle impossible odds for justice and mercy, and love is eternal across many lives. \u00a0Wait -- that\u0027s our world, for those who have eyes to see it. \u00a0From the ruins of burning Troy to the depths of the Great Depression, through the palaces of Ancient Egypt and the battlefields of the Wars of Revolution, there is enchantment in every stone and magic behind each door. \u00a0This is the Numinous World, setting of my historical fantasy novels. \u00a0They include the Locus Award nominated Black Ships, Hand of Isis, Stealing Fire, The General\u0027s Mistress, The Emperor\u0027s Agent and The Ravens of Falkenau, as well as the Order of the Air series written with Melissa Scott, which brings the story into the 20th century. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many stories in the Numinous World that haven\u0027t been told yet. \u00a0Some are forthcoming as novels, but there are also many short stories and scenes that don\u0027t quite fit into one of the books. \u00a0Maybe they\u0027re a scene from the point of view of someone other than the main character -- for example, a scene from Michel\u0027s point of view rather than Elza\u0027s -- or maybe they didn\u0027t quite fit the narrative -- too much of a tangent about Dion. \u00a0Maybe they\u0027re a piece of backstory -- I know who Stasi really is and what happened to her first husband, but that\u0027s not something that\u0027s come to light in the Order of the Air. \u00a0Or a piece of \"forestory\" -- I\u0027ve written Elza on the Retreat from Moscow even though that\u0027s eight years after the events of The Emperor\u0027s Agent. \u00a0Or maybe it\u0027s a piece that fits between books rather than into one neatly -- who was the one of Lydias who had in the past been a priestess in the Black Land and knew how to activate the sphinxes that guarded the border? \u00a0What happened to Lydias after the events of Stealing Fire? \u00a0Those are the stories I\u0027d like to share with you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistorical fantasy is very time consuming to write. \u00a0Whether I\u0027m writing about the campaigns of Alexander the Great or air racing in the Great Depression, whether my setting is Paris in the 18th century or New Orleans in 1933, making it real demands meticulous research and attention to detail. \u00a0However, like most writers, I also have to do other work for money. \u00a0One thing I do is technical writing for education under a different name. \u00a0The more time I need to spend doing that, the less I have for research and writing fiction. \u00a0I am hoping that subscribers to my Patreon account will allow me to take on less technical writing work so that I can spend more time on the Numinous World. \u00a0A big historical novel like Black Ships really requires six months of concentrated time, and while only the highest of my goals would get me there, each goal met will result in more books in the Numinous World and the Order of the Air.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You\u0027ll Read\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the first goal met, each month I will post at least 1,000 words of unpublished fiction from The Numinous World -- Gull, Charmian, Lydias, Elza, Georg, or others of their lives, or tales of other characters in their stories. \u00a0With the second goal, I\u0027ll add another 1,000 words monthly from the Order of the Air. \u00a0The third goal met will add a third sketch, and the fourth will mean that I can also add a monthly chapter of the new novel I will then have time to work on! \u00a0Additionally, if there are patrons at a high enough level to request stories about specific characters, those stories will appear here as well. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmbark with me across a wide, dark ocean. \u00a0For as little as the price of renting a movie once a month, you can have new stories in a world more numinous, an enchanted world that may be waiting just outside your door. \u00a0Thank you for being part of my life, and for this gift of magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
