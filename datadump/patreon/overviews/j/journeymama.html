    "summary": "I\u0027m Rae, the Journey Mama, mother of five, author and wanderer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing at Journey Mama since 2005, telling stories of motherhood and travel, things that drive me crazy and things that make me want to sing. I write books and poems and fantastical things. I write hope, humor and beauty as well as deep sad things that need to be spoken. I write with diverse, under-served characters who speak truth in a world that sometimes seems to be losing its marbles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be publishing my eighth and ninth books this year and have traveled many places and had three more children (bringing the grand total to five) since I started writing. Thousands of people have read my honest writing and many have written to tell me that it has changed their lives. I\u0027ve met beautiful people who read the blog or my books and have even stayed with them in their homes (thank you!) during my travels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, writing has become one of the main ways we support our family. We are volunteers in our non-profit organization, and I feel that I\u0027m often scrambling for other sources of income and stealing from my writing time. I self publish my books and my income isn\u0027t stable or nearly sufficient. There are always dentist visits and trips to the hospital. As I\u0027ve been focusing on generating income, my blog has suffered from lack of time. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m asking for patrons, people who love my writing and art, to support my writing so I can continue putting stories and posts into the world for years to come.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some projects I want to work on in the near future:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe fourth book in the World Whisperer Series\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA sequel to my novel, A Traveler\u0027s Guide to Belonging\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA book of poems and essays\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA devotional\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe fourth book in the Journey Mama Writings Series\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt least 8 blog posts per month\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaking all of my books into audiobooks.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA children\u0027s book, co-written with Kenya, my illustrator daughter\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAs you can see, I never run out of ideas. I only run out of time. Will you help me carve out time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wouldn\u0027t be on this journey without my readers and fans, so thank you with all my heart for your support, time spent reading, and caring about these words I\u0027m tossing out into the world. They come back to me with love and understanding.\u003cbr\u003e"
