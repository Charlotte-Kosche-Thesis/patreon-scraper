    "summary": "Hello everyone! Welcome to my Patreon! My name is Jessica Searl and I am SO excited to start making music for you all! With the help of my parents and all my wonderful friends, I\u2019ve recently started making music videos of covers and original songs just for you. :) As you probably know, making music and videos takes a lot of time, and depending on who helps, money. By supporting me on Patreon, you can help me produce more videos and pay those who have been giving their free time to help me. This also gives me a chance to do what I love most; Sing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently, I\u2019ve started doing live gigs around town, which has made me realize that I want to spread my music even further. Releasing videos on YouTube will allow me to get my music out to the world, rather than just my shower. ;) The internet gives me a chance to share my passion and music with you, and even all of your friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re interested in joining me on this music journey, I would \u003cstrong\u003elove\u003c/strong\u003e to have you come along! I don\u2019t want you to feel obligated to donate if it doesn\u2019t seem like the right time for you. You should only become a Patreon if you truly feel like you want to invest in this adventure. I will do my best to check my Patreon daily and interact with you lovely Patreon friends. :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t become a patreon supporter if you are tight on money.\u00a0:) But if you have\u00a0resources and the heart to help others create things that touch your and other peoples hearts, believe me, every $1 or more pledge really helps. I\u0027m so thankful for your support, even\u00a0if you can afford to just be a fan!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in buying any of these tracks, you can find me on Loudr. It is also completely fine to just stroll by and give my music a listen for free! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by, and hope you have a lovely day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJessica \u0026lt;3"
