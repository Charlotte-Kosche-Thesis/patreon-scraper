I would spend days in the woods, escaping from my home life in to a magical world of colors and textures that exist only in the forest.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat foundation of using art, fantasy, and nature to escape has carried with me in to adulthood. After choosing to focus more seriously on my art career over the last 7 years, I looked to what I know and have always appreciated, nature, fantasy and light-hearted living. \u00a0I love to envision the mythical beings that may be sleeping tucked under a bed of moss, a small creature underneath that colorful mushroom cap, or a terrified face emerging from a bitten donut! For me, imagining whimsical little creatures from magical worlds not only keeps me smiling but also helps me appreciate\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003especimens in nature or inanimate objects I might find around the home!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo top it off, the more I run a business, the more I love being a creative entrepreneur and soaking up all things biz and entrepreneurship. Through Patreon, I share behind the scenes of both my art and creation process as well as resources and practices and things I\u0027m learning along the way to be a full-time, self-employed artist and entrepreneur!\u003cbr\u003e"
