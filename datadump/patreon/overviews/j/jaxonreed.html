The book will then head to final\nediting and go up for sale on Amazon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI invite you to read the book as I work on it, and participate in the creative process. If all goes well, I\u0027ll continue the serialization of the series with the next novel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBackers will receive digital drafts of at least one new\nchapter in the book every week.
