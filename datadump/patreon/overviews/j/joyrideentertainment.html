    "summary": "\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhy Support JoyRide?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowdy! My name is Ivan LeRoy and I\u0027m a writer who\u0027s been producing scripted content through the internet since 2012.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I create and release \u003cstrong\u003enon-profit parodies\u003c/strong\u003e through my newly founded\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/leroygendary\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube Channel\u003c/a\u003e which directs viewers to personality driven, for-profit content (podcasts, live streams, etc.). Although I have a long history and desire to write for original projects, the current Youtube landscape has made the production and sustainability of such content difficult; whereas parodies can essentially be made on zero budget (albeit, time consuming and of course, for\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003enon-profit\u003c/strong\u003e). Such parodies I\u0027ve produced have developed a reputation for their deep engaging characterizations and narrative that go above and beyond the expectations of the medium. They are brought to life by an incredible cast of voice actors who work free of charge and for the love of their craft. Here is an example of our work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jvZya63V_50\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of the JoyRide Entertainment channel, and this Patreon, is to \u003cstrong\u003ebuild an audience\u003c/strong\u003e for our distinct\u00a0brand of storytelling that can \u003cstrong\u003efinancially support an expansion into original content\u003c/strong\u003e. However, we aim to be especially patient and\u00a0pragmatic about this process. As such, we are entering a long transitional phase that will require us to keep our current goals small, realistic and most importantly, flexible to change and growth in the future. We deeply appreciate your support and patience as we learn throughout this process, but as our current body of work shows, you can trust that we will continue to perform at a level worthy of your support regardless if these goals are reached.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat\u00a0Are Your Goals?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) We want begin at a modest pace and \u003cstrong\u003estart compensating an editor\u003c/strong\u003e who can help alleviate the production burden and allow us to \u003cstrong\u003erelease more higher quality parodies\u003c/strong\u003e. Given the current landscape of appropriated content that rules Youtube, we believe this is the quickest, and most importantly, cost effective way to \u003cstrong\u003ebuild and entertain an audience that can sustain our future endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Once we get a comfortable rhythm going with our editor and an audience to support us, we\u0027ll move on to the \u003cstrong\u003edevelopment of an original project\u003c/strong\u003e. What exactly is this project? It\u0027s in a very early conceptual writing stage, meaning, there is nothing concrete to show you yet outside of concept art (but as a patron you would be the first to find out in our production blog). A lot can change over time, including the proposed format, but for now we\u0027ll say that the format is a \u003cstrong\u003elimited release comic book/manga\u003c/strong\u003e with a \u003cstrong\u003emotion dub component\u003c/strong\u003e, the latter of which would be \u003cstrong\u003efree to the public\u003c/strong\u003e. However, this is all still \u003cem\u003esubject to extensive changes.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhere is My Money Going?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me assure you one thing. \u003cstrong\u003eAll of your donations are going towards the growth and development of this channel\u003c/strong\u003e, not the growth of my wallet. I am blessed with a day job that adequately covers my bills, living expenses, education, etc. and still allots reasonable time for content creation. This situation \u003cem\u003emay\u003c/em\u003e change in the future, but for now, I will not touch a cent. And\u003cstrong\u003e I will give full transparency if/when this situation changes and how this would affect funding\u003c/strong\u003e. As for now, my current situation is in a very delicate time/cost balance. Working more means more money for projects, but subsequently less time to produce them. So, as it stands, my time is more important for production, whereas your money helps us meet our goals. And \u003cstrong\u003eif all our current subscribers donated to the $1/month tier, all of our current goals would be crushed that \u003cem\u003eeasily.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m currently not touching this money, \u003cstrong\u003et\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehe first person to receive it will be an editor\u003c/strong\u003e we choose to hire. Before we reach the first goal, all of the money will be locked away into a savings fund. After that, we will begin \u003cstrong\u003ebuilding a fund for the sole purpose of developing original content\u003c/strong\u003e, which will go towards: artists, musicians, publishing, and HOPEFULLY our wonderfully deserving voice actors. This all depends, however, on how much the channel grows and how much support we receive from the audience. That said, \u003cstrong\u003ewe have zero expectations of meeting any of our goals. We do this for the love of our craft and r\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eegardless of the success of this Patreon, parodies will continue to be produced at their current rate and quality (1 sexy video per/within 1.5 month[s]) until the foreseeable\u00a0future.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
