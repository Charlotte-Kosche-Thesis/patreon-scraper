    "summary": "We are known as the Magic and Piano Guys! \u00a0Jarrett is a magician who studied under the great Harry Blackstone Jr., and Raja is a piano graduate from The Juilliard School. We started performing together 15 years ago in NYC as a small cabaret act and have grown into what we are today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIncredibly,\u00a0Las Vegas has one of the highest rates of homeless and at-risk children in the nation. Since Las Vegas is our home, we feel the need to give back to our community - and what better way to do this than to share FINDING MAGIC with kids who need hope and inspiration in their lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will help us build and maintain a small theatre in our warehouse where once a month, we will produce free shows for charities that target homeless and at-risk kids in Las Vegas. Not only will the kids watch an amazing magic show with monthly guest performers from the Las Vegas strip, but they will also be taught magic tricks that they can perform on their own. FINDING MAGIC will help to build confidence and social skills within these kids.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter each show, we will be uploading video and images to share this journey with our patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping us share FINDING MAGIC with these great kids!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
