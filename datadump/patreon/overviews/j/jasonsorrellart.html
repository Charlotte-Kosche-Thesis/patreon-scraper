    "summary": "\u00a0My dad told me as a kid that art would never put food on the table for my family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Years later I paid for his dinner at a very nice restaurant with money earned from a painting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My life has frequently been a matter of proving people wrong, of taking every doubt thrown my way and seeing it as a personal challenge to overcome it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Patreon is a great way for me to connect with my fans, the people who continue to step up, cheer my efforts, support my work, and enjoy watching me pursue my dreams. I\u0027ve been doing what I proudly refer to as \"lowbrow art\" for over 20 years. I\u0027ve done everything from comic strips to sculpture. My work has been seen at festivals and in galleries. The best part of being an artist remains the moment when someone comes along and truly enjoys one of my pieces, No matter how much I do or how far I go, It is that personal connection that means the most to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I greatly appreciate that there are so many weirdos like myself out in the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am starting to make things happen. I\u0027ve reached a point where I can not only be an artist, but also a patron of the arts myself. I\u0027ve started writing books and creating video tutorials about art and the business of being an artist. My major goal, one that I am happy to report is coming to fruition, is to open my own print-studio and help other artists turn their works it to merchandise that can be shared with a wider audience. I want to open a studio that combines manufacturing with a gallery, storefront, and education center.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I want to establish a resource that helps more dreamers reach their goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Your patronage does more than help me continue to create. Your support will allow me to support others, to help bring more art from more artists into the world, and to help keep things a little weird. Subscribing to my Patreon Account gives you inside access to what I am doing; from sketches to completed works, as well as exclusive merchandise and discounts on some of my favorite items. If you dig what I do, there is no better way to keep me doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Follow my account, let me know what you think of my work, and thank you in advance for your continued support."
