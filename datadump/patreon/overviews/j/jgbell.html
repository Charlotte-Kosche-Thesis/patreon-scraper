In my personal life I talk a lot about political philosophy and political economy while also creating health and happiness for rescue cats.\u00a0By pledging support for this personal patronage campaign, you will be helping me create a firm foundation for the work and the fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBasic Income Guarantee Creator Pledge\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA firm foundation of $1000 a month will help me focus on my projects with technology, esotericism, and cats. Once I reach this firm foundation, all additional pledges will be distributed to other creatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond having a firm foundation, additional pledges provide increased security for me to focus on my projects. Additional pledges help ensure that dropped pledges, for whatever valid reason, or declines, do not create uncertainty. Further, I can begin to spread everything above $1000 to other creatives, to pay it forward and help others create their own firm foundations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis idea of creating a basic income and pledging every dollar above $1000 to other creators is very much inspired by the work of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/scottsantens\"\u003eBasic Income activist Scott Santens\u003c/a\u003e and I am making this Basic Income Guarantee (BIG) Creator Pledge to help others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Cats\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, my name is John, and I am a cat person.\u00a0I am not sure how it happened, but I\u0027ve rescued many, many kittens and cats; and they keep showing up. Will you help me make sure they are happy and healthy in a good home?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI once heard a statistic that in order to take care of all the cats, each human on the planet would have to take care of 40 cats in their lifetimes. I\u0027ve long since passed that number of cats that I\u0027ve helped! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have nine cats to whom I am providing homes. But, having so many cats, is quite a burden. There\u0027s basics like food and litter, but there\u0027s also burdensome health costs, especially for abandoned and stray cats coming inside after struggling to survive outside. Then there\u0027s also the time and energy converting the casual and active cruelty of their previous experience so far into the happy and healthy future I have been able to provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to meeting our basic ongoing needs, I\u0027d love to be able to create even better quality of life for these cats. With your help, I\u0027d like to do things like build some cat climbing trails along the walls, an awesome multiple cat window perch, an indoor garden of cat friendly greens, and, most of all, a safe outdoor enclosure where they can get lots of fresh air and sunshine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help supporting my ongoing effort will be very much appreciated and help me provide for these amazing little fuzzballs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther ways to offer support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is not the only way to offer your support for my work and the cats.
