I teach high school music to pay the bills. I love my job but it is demanding and finding time to create videos during the school year can be tough. Having more of a production budget would allow me to hire people to help me create content more regularly.\u00a0Upgrades to my camera, piano, computer, hard drives, and studio space will allow me to take my production to the next level. This includes a better variety of shots, higher image quality, faster turnaround time between videos, and better sound quality. In addition to improvements in quality and quantity, one of my main\u00a0goals is to provide access to awesome music education to people from around the whole world. Shifting to a patron system can allow me to remove ads and purchase requirements on content whenever possible. Your support also helps me to hire people to create closed captions and translations for my videos. This immediately improves access to my content; allowing me to teach to people who speak a variety of languages and who fall into a broader set of economic classes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
