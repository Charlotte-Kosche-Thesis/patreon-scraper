The basis of what I\u0027ll be sharing is a combination of cutting-edge neurocognitive science, developmental modeling and my own brand of mythological transformational storytelling. I\u0027ll be doing that in my posts and podcasts, and with live and recorded webcasts for patrons. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReality IS the Story ....\u003cbr\u003e\n\tthe Story IS Reality\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you know my work already you know that I think working with story is the most potent way to have what I call, \u003cstrong\u003e\"The Experience of YOUR Life\"\u003c/strong\u003e (as opposed to the one imposed upon you and sold to you as the one you should be having, i.e.: \"\u003cem\u003eBe good and fit in.\u003c/em\u003e\").\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllow me to share an ever growing arsenal of tools for perceiving, thinking and communicating with you, designed to allow you to shape the story of your life.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMuch of the early work I did with story came from the work of the renowned mythologist, Joseph Campbell, as well as a group of scholars centered around psychology, anthropology, philosophy and linguistics. Now, for the last decade and half I\u0027ve delved more deeply into the domain of neurocognitive science and evolutionary developmental modeling, generating a new level of awareness about how we engage with story and, how it shapes and affects us personally, and at the level of society-at-large. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy model of transformational performance, built on the structure of story and mythic form, the MythoSelf Process, is both pragmatically strategic and aimed at what\u0027s real.\u00a0Unlike many scholars of story my work is grounded somatically as well as semantically, not interpretation, projection and/or conjecture. The MythoSelf Process model spans the intellectual space between embodied and situational cognition, with a dose of evolutionary neurocognitive development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTogether we\u0027ll be opening up a pathway for you to make sense of and take action in the \"here and now.\"\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI promise you when you decide to join me on this journey all the stories you encounter every day of you life will begin making more and more sense, and you\u0027ll have a better understanding of them and what to do in response. I\u0027ll be laying out the basis of how we encounter story as the fundamental way you make sense of the world, and why that\u0027s so critical for you to get right up front. Then we\u0027ll unpack the structure of story as a universal idea, as well as beginning to look at specific stories to unravel be hidden meanings that reside below the surface. For what it\u0027s worth this is probably not as complicated as you might think ... in fact I suggest you\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/story-matrix-of-16978825\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStart Here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the beginning ...\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe come a long way from when Marshall McLuhan told us, \"The Medium Is The Message\" in 1964, informing us that the medium doesn\u0027t just contain the content, it becomes embedded in the content. In this way, the medium becomes entwined with what we perceive to be \"real\" ... i.e.: the story we experience and how it affects us in the telling.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince McLuhan\u0027s prophetic declaration about \"the medium\" we\u0027ve seen the enormous impact of how it shapes the story we are experiencing becoming what is \"real\" for us. For instance, how television shaped the 2016 U.S. Presidential election of Donald J. Trump, and before that, the 1960 Presidential election campaign between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. John F. Kennedy understood the medium and how it would shape his message, and\u00a0he was great on camera too. This combination allowed him to reach and connect with millions of viewers. Richard Nixon did not have the same success with television. Nixon\u0027s failure to grasp the significance of the medium proved to be a fatal mistake in telling his story, costing him the election. Every major political campaign from that point forward became about shaping and controlling how the message performs in the medium, and the effect on the candidate trying to tell their story to their constituents. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGet this bit wrong and you lose, it\u0027s really that simple.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2016, Donald Trump killed off his opponents one by one with catchy insults ... he crushed Marco Rubio with the simple moniker, \"Little Marco,\" then he went after the potential front-runner Jeb Bush by labeling him \"Low Energy\" among other things. You might imagine these things wouldn\u0027t matter at the level of a Presidential election, but these seemingly simple comments shape the story that\u0027s been told, and more significantly the one that\u0027s being heard. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Donald Trump insult while he was a presidential candidate on campaign that really stuck was \"Crooked Hillary.\" That simple\u00a0two-word phrase, that every medium covering the campaign trail took to like fish to water, summed up much of what her detractors and his constituency already believed to be true. Despite your political or personal opinion of Donald J. Trump, he mastered the art of shaping the story, and it won him the votes he needed to become President of the United States of America. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehe most potent thing you can do may be taking control of the story, because it means shaping and controlling the minds of those who are experiencing it, including your own.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWHY I AM HERE ON PATREON NOW:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy reason for being here on Patreon is simple; I want to create a shared space where I can present my thirty plus year journey of study and learning with you about how our stories shape our worldview. Peering below the surface to how our worldview shapes our lives and the world we live in is a necessary step if we plan on preventing a fall off the precipice into utter chaos, either\u00a0 personally or collectively. I think about this as a process of tapping into the operating systems that we use to run our experience, as individuals and together. This is an extension and outgrowth of my work as the\u00a0Architect \u0026amp; Designer of the MythoSelf Process and SomaSemantics after three decades of dedication to developing this unique model of human transformation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt seems with every generation, and every succeeding year, the complexity we\u0027re facing increases exponentially. What we need to shape our lives and the world around us in ways that reflect our desire for a viable future is an entirely new level of adaptability based on a cognitive shift in how we perceive ourselves and our place in the world. When you do this the gates of perception open, and new possibilities for being and doing emerge. Instead of being overwhelmed by the complexity we face, it becomes part of the framework we can use to leap beyond what limits us today. But, we need to build a \"new\" mind, because we can\u0027t do any of that with our \"old\" mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I\u0027m inviting you to join with me on this journey to our collective future, as well as on a journey within ... to the center of ourselves. Joseph Campbell called this \"The Hero\u0027s Journey\" and I agree with his fundamental premise that we are all called to discover ourselves. We do this in order to complete the path from dependence, through independence to inter-dependence becoming fully human, so that we can \"Return to the World,\" making the unique contribution only we are capable or making.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo once agin I\u0027m asking you to consider making a pledge at whatever level you feel makes sense for you today to support what I\u0027m doing here. While I try not to take myself too seriously, and what I\u0027ll be sharing with you here will sometimes be done with \"tongue in cheek\" humor, don\u0027t let that fool you for a second, I couldn\u0027t be more serious about the outcome I\u0027m aiming at with you here ... \"\n\u003cstrong\u003eCreating Futures That Work.\"\u003c/strong\u003e"
