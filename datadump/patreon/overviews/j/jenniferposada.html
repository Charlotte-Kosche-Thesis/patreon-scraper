     "about": "Jennifer Posada is an Oracle, Teacher, Author, Sound Healer, and the \nFounder of The Oracle School \u0026amp; Community, and The Orgasmic Woman \nProject...\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt has been her mission, since her earliest years, to share teachings\n of self-love, as she believes that \"The healing of the world will \nhappen with one person loving themselves at a time...\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is also Jennifer\u0027s deepest passion to share the ancient female \nlineages of ecstasy and revelation with the world, as she remembers \nthese traditions from her past lives as a Sibyl, Oracle, Priestess and \nNymph, and as they are now available to all genders. These sacred \ntraditions are unbelievably potent and otherwise nearly or totally lost \npractices and ways of life that include the arts of bliss, trance, full \nself-realization, body love and positivity, pleasure as a way of life, \nand profound prophetic wisdom.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJennifer believes and knows that these are gifts we all have, and all\n of her writings and teachings both lead and attest to that. Over the \npast eleven years in over 70 workshops and conferences, she has taught \nthousands of people all over the world these arts and helped them to \nremember their own ancient gifts and memories, and her writings have \nbeen read by millions worldwide. She has worked with people from over 50\n countries, and has presented live in many locations in the US, Canada, \nEurope and Egypt.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJennifer believes in the power of sexuality and that specifically at \nthis time women learning to love their sexuality is the single greatest \nthing that will change the earth and all of her inhabitants. When women \ncan embrace their deepest power, we will all be illuminated as a result.\n It is the healing balm for what ails us, for sexuality is not just \nsomething that happens in the bedroom, but the purest form of our life \nforce, creativity and passion as luminous beings of extraordinary beauty\n and love...\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRead the rest of Jennifer\u0027s bio at: \u003ca href=\"http://www.jenniferposada.com/about\"\u003ewww.jenniferposada.com/about\u003c/a\u003e",
