With your support we will continue to cover Japanese Football in English, in all its forms, from the national teams and J1 through to local leagues, women\u0027s, men\u0027s, kids\u0027, players in Japan, and players overseas. All aspects of Japanese Football considered and covered!\u003cbr\u003eALL Patrons will have access to ALL back issues of JSoccer Magazine on PDF - however small the pledge!\u003cbr\u003eVarious levels of Patronage will show various rewards and special offers and, again, we thank you for your Patronage, always! Without you - the fan - there is no football, and no JSoccer Magazine.\u003cbr\u003eSuffice to say, JSoccer Magazine is a labour of love... perhaps YOU can make it a little bit more!\u003cbr\u003e"
