    "summary": "Firstly I just want to say a huge thank you for coming over to my Patreon! My passion and dream is video and photo creation so the fact that you are even considering supporting me, is amazing and I am very thankful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon because currently my income is very unstable and I am not sure for how long I can do this for as I have no idea each month if I will have enough to keep going. I don\u0027t create videos for the money because trust me Facebook is not the place to make money from videos, I make them because I love to create videos exploring and travelling. However, money is a factor in life and as I put more into the Facebook the less time I have to make money from outside jobs. That is why I have created this Patreon to give you an option to support me and help me be able to focus 100% on creating daily content for you! I will be creating weekly tutorials here which can only be accessed by those who are a Patreon so you can get something out of supporting me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little bit about me:\u003cbr\u003eKnown to his friends as \"Mr Travel World Wide\" there is no surprise that Josh is obsessed with travel. Whether it be hiking the length of England, hanging off a tower in China, getting his shoes (Crocs) mugged in Malawi, climbing the highest peak of Borneo or surfing in Morocco. It\u0027s clear to see that Josh is an adventurous traveller with a hint of crazy. Living by the quote \"if it scares you it\u0027s something worth doing\" he jumps into any and all opportunities with great enthusiasm and overwhelming positivity. He never leaves home without his camera and has been shooting films ever since he was 8. However his passion for film making really came alive once he moved to England at age 14 (originally from Ireland). Spending 5 years  mastering the art of videography and video editing, Josh has an extensive knowledge of editing programs such as Premiere Pro, After Effects and Photoshop. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
