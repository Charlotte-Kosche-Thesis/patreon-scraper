    "summary": "For a blind person, defending oneself comes with very limited options.\u003cbr\u003e\tRunning is not an option, because a sighted aggressor can easily chase you down \u2014 or just wait for you to run into something. Calling for help is not a real option, since it is unlikely you will know where anyone is; likewise, you can\u0027t even do the sensible thing and run towards a crowded area for safety.\u003cbr\u003e\tExtracting yourself after an attack can be a challenge on its own. What happened to your guide dog during the altercation? Did you break your white cane? Which way are you facing now? More importantly, how do you know that the attacker is not going to get back up and follow you home? If you dropped your phone during the attack, how are you going to find it now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tEven after you have successfully escaped an assault, you probably won\u2019t be able to describe who attacked you or provide any useful identifying features to the authorities. Despite all these disadvantages, blind individuals have access to the best self-defence technique around: the element of surprise.\u003cbr\u003e\tI learned this valuable lesson at 8 years old.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eViolence and danger sparked my instinct for survival\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tWhen I was little, I didn\u0027t get to spend a lot of time with my parents. I probably got to see my mom five or six times a month, my dad once or twice a month. One day, I spent the morning waiting around my dad\u0027s office, then he and me and my mom were going to go for lunch.\u003cbr\u003e\tWhen my father finished his work, he and I walked to the car. It was a hot, muggy day. We got to the car and my dad realized he\u0027d forgotten his keys, so he put my hand on the side. It meant, \"don\u0027t go anywhere and wait by the car.\" And he left.\u003cbr\u003e\tI was standing there, learning against the car, when a strange man came walking up. He said, \"You dad told me to come get you. Your dad wants you.\"\u003cbr\u003e\tRight away, that tripped my radar \u2014 I knew my dad wouldn\u0027t have sent someone I didn\u0027t know. So I said, \"I don\u0027t know you.\" The man got agitated and grabbed my wrist and said \"Come on! You dad wants you right now.\"\u003cbr\u003e\tI wasn\u0027t really scared at that point. Growing up in the kind of family I grew up in, I no stranger to violence. I remember the first thing that went through my head, as strange as it sounds, was \"Oh cool. This is actually happening to me.\"\u003cbr\u003e\tWhen he pulled me by the wrist, I stepped forward. I brought up my back leg up in one of the Taekwondo front kicks I\u0027d been practicing for the past month and I nailed him right in the groin. \u003cbr\u003e\tRight away, he let go of my wrist and dropped down to the floor, cusing up a storm. That\u0027s when I got scared. I didn\u0027t know what to do with him after that. I didn\u0027t know what he would do to me if he recovered.\u003cbr\u003e\tLuckily, that was about the time that my dad came out of the building. The man saw my dad coming toward us and he started running away. My dad didn\u0027t pursue him, because my dad didn\u0027t know what was going on until he [asked,] \"What were you doing with that man?\"\u003cbr\u003e\tI told him. My dad just turned and looked. I don\u0027t think he ever treated this incident seriously, I don\u0027t think he thought there was a real danger. In my family, this kind of violence and danger happened often, so no one really took it to heart. As long as no one got hurt, people pretty much forgot about it and moved on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tWhen you are blind, self defense means being able to catch your aggressor off guard, control him or her, and neutralize him or her as quickly as possible. Beyond that, you must make a strong impression \u2014 so he or she is less likely to come back for a second try tomorrow, or next week, or two years later. It means you must conquer your own fear of the unknown, move when it\u0027s time to move and be certain in every move you make.\u003cbr\u003e\tIt means paying attention to what is underfoot and what may be around you, since you don\u0027t have the ability to see your surroundings prior to engagement.\u003cbr\u003e\tI have practiced martial arts in various forms for as long as I can remember and I have been teaching martial arts for most of my adult life. Recently, I realized that there are many blind people who are interested in self defence, but can\u2019t find a gym that will accept them as a student, or can\u2019t afford self-defence and martial arts training.\u003cbr\u003e\tThis is why I started the Night Strike movement. My goal with Night Strike is not to replace any existing martial arts system, but rather to establish a strong network for blind martial artists. I want to help more disabled people all over the world gain the knowledge and independence that I believe that can come from martial arts and self-defence training.\u003cbr\u003e\tThe benefits of learning martial arts were clear to me from a very young age. My parents first introduced me to martial arts so I could protect myself and as a way to \"toughen\" me up, but I soon realized that I was learning how to protect myself from my own family.\u003cbr\u003e\tLearning how to physically defend myself gave me the confidence to escape an increasingly violent and unstable family life \u2014 and to live independently and successfully as a blind person in a sighted world. Practicing martial arts has allowed me to see beyond the constraints of the prescribed role of a blind person. Through my work, I hope to help both blind and sighted people move beyond the ideas of how others see them so that they can truly live independent and fulfilling lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn conjuction with the Night Strike effort, I decided to create the Johnny Tiger Experience Podcast, where, through audio means, I can reach out to more people and touch them with my life- my voice. This is where I share more self defense tips, fitness tips, give Mandarin lessons, and can offer much much more. I also aim to bring the world interviews of unsung heroes- other blind or disabled martial artists from all over the world, so their stories can be heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its birth two months ago, I\u0027ve created over 25 1+ hour episodes of the Johnny Tiger Experience podcast, in addition to over 20 sub-episodes. This is when I realized that I need help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode takes roughly 6 hours to record, edit, design and upload. That time is doubled or tripled when interviews are involved. The Johnny Tiger Experience Podcast is quickly becoming almost like a full time job with its current production speed. In order to sustain its current flow and keep providing the world with new and interesting contents, I am forced to reach out to seek financial aid from everyone who feels that there is need for such a podcast.\u003cbr\u003e"
