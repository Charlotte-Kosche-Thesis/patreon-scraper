I do have one currently but I have my eyes on a Shure 58! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt may be a big skip and a jump but these are my goals and if you could help me out along the way , you would be one of my biggest heros!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.s Thank you for reading and don\u0027t forget to visit my socials xo\u003cbr\u003e",
