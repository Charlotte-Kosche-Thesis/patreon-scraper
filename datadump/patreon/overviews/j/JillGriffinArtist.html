Art is me...I am art. \u003cbr\u003eI was educated at senior school to advanced level in art, but my career path took me into medical imaging and painting was kept on the back boiler as a hobby until I carved out a couple of hours a week to attend an evening class where I could paint without the pressures of family life. I also began exhibiting with the local art group and selling my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027For me sharing my work is incredibly important- after all what is a painting with no-one to look at it?\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have come a long way since those evening class days and my work is now represented in a number of galleries and slowly but surely I am becoming established. I also exhibit with a wonderful group of artists at pop-up galleries, collaborating in making things happen together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the advent of social media and online gallery portals I have been in a really fortunate position to be amongst the pioneer fine artists making their careers in a very 21st century way and it is with a sense of new meets old.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why Patreon appeals to me greatly- I can share my work,\u00a0journey and development via a mini-blog with genuine and wonderful people who also have a passion for art- and patrons have been a part of artists lives, careers and success for centuries. I think that\u0027s very cool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I love to teach watercolour technique to my small group of private students and my Patreon supporters have helped me provide them with the same quality materials as I paint with. I still need help to be able to present my work to galleries finished professionally and properly framed. \u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t play with the big boys wearing my little girl socks- to coin a phrase!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027In the future I want to be able to say \u0027YES\u0027 I am a fulltime artist\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I want to make my living from art, from sharing my art.

I love it\u0027s unpredictable nature and often choose to work on rough handmade paper which makes it even more so. I love the translucent quality of this medium, but have also been known for pen and wash work and pastels. I have an eclectic style and am drawn to paint all sorts of things, from sea shells, to gardens, animals to abstracted town scapes. I find inspiration from lots of things, the countryside, amazing trees, the coast, natural objects and the sculptural works of Rodin.\u003cbr\u003eMy paintings have travelled all over the world to new homes, which is always humbling but is a lovely feeling. \u003cbr\u003eI exhibit my work here in Devon, in the Southwest \u00a0west of England, at various locations and I founded a group of exhibiting artists (@DevonArtPop # devonartpop) and am also a tutor to a number of lovely private watercolour students.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mantra is \u0027share and enjoy\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "One of the biggest expenses and an indispensable one, is presenting work properly for sale- framing. It\u0027s come to a point in my career where DIY is no longer an option. I\u0027m playing with the big boys now in exhibitions and galleries and to stand a chance of success I need to frame my work professionally. Sometimes this takes out as much as 1/3 of the retail price of a work, commission takes 40% and you can see that it\u0027s so hard to earn a living from selling work. If my pledges reach this goal it would be amazing, to not have to worry so much about framing my work and giving my paintings the tip top presentation they deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone\" height=\"173\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WPONzTlNSIE/VG9UqofqvLI/AAAAAAAAFY4/xpqBBOmbrQE/s500/Photo%25252020141121150510.jpg\" width=\"250\"\u003e",
