    "summary": "I was a prolific story writer in high school, but I started to take it more seriously when a creative writing professor in college told me I would be wasting my life if I became anything other than a writer. Since then writing has fallen by the wayside as my photography business and motherhood took priority, but lately I have received so much encouragement to write about my myriad misadventures in life and love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome stories will be written from a provident emotional distance, while others are poking at fresh wounds, but with your loyal support I can continue to explore everything from connection, to identity and sense of self, to creativity, to coping with grief, to my many crazy travel stories, with honesty, authenticity, and humor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am committed to a daily practice of writing and in gratitude of your support I offer you exclusive access to new work before sharing it publicly, among other things. Some pieces will be more traditional narrative written works, while others will combine my background in photography and design to experiment with different approaches to memoir. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour financial contribution will give me amazing freedom to explore the creative possibilities of story-telling with a goal of releasing one or two patron-only stories per month. Thank you so much for your support! I am so excited to share this journey with you."
