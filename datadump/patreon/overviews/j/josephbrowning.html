These books are ones that you could find in a sage\u0027s or wizard\u0027s library. Each of these books will be available free at my \u003ca href=\"http://josephbrowning.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSorcery \u0026amp; Super Science!\u003c/a\u003e blog, so if you can\u0027t support me, just drop by the website and enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a tabletop-rpg gamer for over 30 years now (damn, I\u0027m getting old), one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game was when I stumbled upon a lost library. The potential always seemed limitless! What kind of ancient knowledge lurked within the moldy old covers? Very little fires my imagination like stumbling across a library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut from a Game Master perspective, lost libraries are really just a pain in the neck. You\u0027ve got a group of excited players who\u0027ve just found a treasure trove, and you have no information on what exactly they\u0027ve found. So you just make up a few highlights and handwave the rest. Which is fine, but imagine if you could hand your players a list of titles found in their haul, and then back up that list with more detailed information, such as weight and dimensions (just how are you going to haul this stuff outta here?), and the most important, value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what the Tome of Tomes series is for. Helping keep players excited and helping you by doing all the heavy lifting. Check out the two samples from the 100+ previously released tomes below, and you\u0027ll see the information provided to you for each tome .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Demonomicon of Obering\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAuthor: Pennirth Obering\u003cbr\u003eRace: Elf\u003cbr\u003eDimensions: 14x12x1.5\u003cbr\u003eWeight: 25 lbs.\u003cbr\u003eMaterials: Leather-bound, brassboard, vellum, adamantine clasps and lock\u003cbr\u003eRarity: Very rare\u003cbr\u003eFields of Study: Supernatural \u0026amp; unusual\u003cbr\u003eSpecial Knowledge Categories: Planes (outer)\u003cbr\u003eValue: 2,500 gp\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\n first book penned by Obering, this massive tome contains an incredible \namount of scholarship regard the summoning and binding of demons.

Halda was an adventurer in her\n early life and achieved great success. She took her earnings and \nfocused the rest of her life on dwarfish agrarian purposes\u2014 a life that \nwas obviously magically extended, for she died at the age of 721. The \nknowledge contained within The Deeper Gardens is vast, thorough, \naccurate, and practical. When the Drachen Mountain dwarfs were defeated \nand destroyed, the book passed into legend, and the few copies that \nremain are fearfully guarded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
