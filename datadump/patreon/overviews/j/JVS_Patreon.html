    "summary": "ABOUT JVS:\u003cbr\u003eJVS is the name of our Youtube Channel! We are ALICIA, JOEJOHN030 \u0026amp; SEL0320, we make up the team main creators, other members include JOR_ELS \u0026amp; CINNA_GAMING. We are gamers and multi-console consumers! But we also are Movie, Game, TV, Music Reviewers and all things comic related! WE ARE ALL AROUND GEEKS, and we are also God Fearing people... We Love People, We Love God, and We Serious Love Technology/Entertainment. Enjoy Our Videos, and always remember \"Greater things are Yet to Come\u2026\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON\u003cbr\u003eJVS continues to grow, expand, and we get invited to a lot of various press events across the US. We are creating this as a means for our fans and followers to be able to push into our financial funding for everything we do moving forward. This Patreon will be specifically budgeted towards all travel expenses such as plane tickets and car rentals; also towards all technical needs such as interview recorders, lights, camera lenses green screens, and shooting rig equipments for all recordings done by JVS Productions. By partnering/supporting with JVS Patreon you will be helping to grow and develop the channel moving forward in all developments we do from now until forever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until this point JVS has been self funded, whether it be new cameras, microphones, plane tickets, or marketing equipment purchases. We now realize there is a huge push and love for what JVS stands for and the content we create, where next year events like D23, E3, PAX, Travel Advanced Screenings and various Comic-Cons have all been invited to already, but we know that a lot of these events are just not manageable financially or logistically. So knowing this, we wanted to be able to give the channel every opportunity for new endeavors and expansions, and if you would like to we would love for you support moving forward with are YouTube Support Page \u0026amp; JVS Patreon. Love you guys and we thank God for anything you decide to commit to, or if you just wanted to share with others that can. See you online!!! ;) - JVS\u003cbr\u003e"
