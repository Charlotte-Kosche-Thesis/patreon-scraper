    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for believing in me, friends! Together, we help more creators to live better lives and make more art!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent almost ten years calling myself a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/jenslennartsson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ephotographer\u003c/a\u003e. Then I added writer. But It never felt right. Photography, or writing, or making short documentaries were all just tools. Tools that made it possible for me to create art, and tell stories.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eNow, I call myself a storyteller!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve\u00a0created the platform\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cardboardcreators.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCardboard Creators\u003c/a\u003e , to help artists, creators and storytellers to make more and be happier!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext step is to try to figure out what ART is all about. What it can communicate, or do.\u00a0Basically, this Patreon page is a way for me to make arts - and calling myself an artists - less pretentious! Let\u0027s drop all labels, let\u0027s punch the fancy galleries in their well-groomed faces and just create for OURSELVES! I think - and I know a lot of other people do too - it is SO easy to get stuck in creating things we believe others will \"like\". And that is CRAP. It makes no-one happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you can help me explore this pretty d*mn fuzzy concept, without having to worry about doing art for anyone but ourselves. That is a pretty awesome idea, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease! Make let me hear from you! Make this a conversation, not a monologue from a Swedish, decadent artist. I don\u0027t think I can pull of what Hemingway did - drinking enormous amounts of alcohol while talking to myself, and still be super-cool. I kinda need you aboard for this one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform allowing creators and artists like myself to keep in touch with fans and followers. It also allows anyone who would like to make it easier for those artists to create more amazing art, to contribute by paying a small amount of money every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty neat, huh?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the money be used for?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the good fortune to be able to travel a lot. I love that. But will the money that you pitch in be used to pay for expensive drinks on the beach and for a business class upgrade on the plane?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. Here\u0027s the deal. I\u0027m getting paid to travel to places to photograph and write about it. Magazines and newspapers commission me to do travel articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I like to create travel essays a lot, I love being able to teach others how to improve their own writing and photography. But sometimes (all the time) it is hard to find the time to create all that material. Youtube videos, blog posts, articles etc etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions means that I don\u0027t have to as many articles and photo essays for magazines, and can get paid to create more stuff for you guys! So, I\u0027ll pay for my drinks all by myself, don\u0027t worry about it! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

I have been thinking about starting a podcast for a while, and I believe this would be a great topic! It will be available as audio - of course - but I really like to see the people I talk to, so I\u0027ll upload the video version someplace too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if I manage to get the tech sorted out, I\u0027ll probably be able to let some of you patreons in while recording it! So you can ask questions and stuff! Just need to install the right things first.....\u003cbr\u003e",
