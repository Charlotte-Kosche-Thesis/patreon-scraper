It feels like you\u0027re saying you\u0027re behind me, you believe in me, and you want to help me. It\u0027s actually really humbling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing music since I was 9 years old, and I have loved God at least that long, even longer I guess. I kinda think I\u0027m just made for that purpose: to love God through my music, and to lead people towards that very thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon lets you pick an amount you want to donate to me for every song I write. You likely already know I write about one song a week, and you can limit the total amount per month you want to give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy you supporting me financially, you\u0027re helping me dedicate more of my time to this passion, since I won\u0027t have to stress about coming up with money for the day-to-day expenses we all face. I can focus completely on glorifying God and sharing my love for him with you and with others who happen to discover my stuff."

This includes teaching, writing and publishing a song each week, and leading music in the village church.\u003cbr\u003eI love seeing the way music impacts and changes people - there\u0027s something about a melody, or the way instruments blend; how a chord played with just the right touch can resonate with the heart. I hope that my music has that impact on you. If it does, I invite you to \u003ca href=\"https://www.jasonsilver.com/static/contact\"\u003esend me a note\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jasonsilver\"\u003esubscribe to my newsletter\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://facebook.com/JasonSilverMusic\"\u003elike my Facebook page\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonSilver\"\u003efollow me on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/JasonSilver\"\u003esubscribe to my YouTube videos\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.com/JasonSilver\"\u003echeck out my Patreon place\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eMy main focus has always been on the piano, but I play other instruments, and am a one-man-band when I record. In the past I wrote a lot of pensive, romantic love songs, but have lately been preoccupied with Christian worship music.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to hear from you if you\u0027re so inclined, don\u0027t be shy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJason\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
