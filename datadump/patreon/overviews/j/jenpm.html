    "summary": "Hi! My name is Jen and If you\u0027re just meeting me, please allow me to introduce myself:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been blogging since 1995 (when I was just 20 years old!)... yes, I\u0027ve been blogging since before the term \"blog\" was even coined. :-p\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first blog/site was located at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jen-dave.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ejen-dave.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and I actually left my last \"real job\" back in 1996 to work on it full time. I had some amazing adventures! Finally, though, after 20+ years, I just felt it was time to move on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work part-time as a marketing consultant for a property management company. However, I still have my own side projects that I\u0027m working on, as well. I have a new personal blog/portfolio located at \u003ca href=\"http://necessarymagic.com/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNecessaryMagic.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e where you can find out more on what I\u0027m up to these days. :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of those things, though, is that I want to write a book about my exxperiences. While life has changed significantly, I still don\u0027t have a desire to erase the past. It was a unique journey to say the least, and I have so much I\u0027d like to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I can use all the support I can get while I attempt this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for rewards? I\u0027ll certainly give a discount on the book to current patrons whenever I actually finish this. In the meantime, though, I do have something to offer now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fact is, I have quite a bit of NSFW material. And I\u0027m still more than willing to share it all! The only catch is, while I was a bit free with it all in the past, it\u0027s just something that I\u0027ve decided (now that I\u0027m older and wiser ;-p) I should be a little more protective of and keep under lock and key, these days. To be perfectly honest, I simply don\u0027t want to post this stuff where just anyone can access it, anymore, even if I didn\u0027t need the money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, I\u0027ve decided that I\u0027ll keep the NSFW available, but just keep it as a reward for those who choose to be my patron!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHow much does that cost? Well, you decide! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have set the\u00a0pledge amount to the minimum allowable by Patreon ($1). It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t think I\u0027m worth more. ;-p  I just decided to do it this way because I prefer to leave it up to the individual, how much they\u0027d like to contribute. Honestly, it makes it feel less like I\u0027m selling something, and more like I\u0027m doing art for art\u0027s sake, and my fans just help me with whatever they\u0027re willing/able to!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\tNow, what exactly will you get access to by becoming a patron? Well, I\u0027m so glad you asked! :-D You will get access to my, ta dum dum dum dum... Google Drive! If that doesn\u0027t sound interesting, how about if I mention that it\u0027s where I\u0027m archiving, well, everything! At least eventually, you\u0027ll find all my work in there... past, present, and future! It is a bit of a work in progress, but there is already *a lot* there.\n\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll just end here by giving a big thank you to everyone who has supported me over the years, and all of you continuing to do so! I appreciate it more than I can say...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Jen\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nP.S. Again, all of this includes a lot of NSFW material, so please be aware of that (and, of course, please be at least 18 years old) before signing up!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nP.P.S.
