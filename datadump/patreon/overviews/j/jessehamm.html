    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Jesse Hamm, cartoonist, essayist, and illustrator. Over the past decade, I\u0027ve written many essays and tips about cartooning that have received a warm response from thousands of students of the artform -- professionals and amateurs alike. You may have seen my art advice on Tumblr:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://myplace.frontier.com/~jessehamm/sample1-templated.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eor my tips on Twitter:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://myplace.frontier.com/~jessehamm/sample2-templated.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eor analyses I\u0027ve written of artists such as Moebius, Frank Frazetta, and Alex Toth:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://myplace.frontier.com/~jessehamm/sample3-templated.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a huge fan of learning more about drawing and storytelling, and I enjoy helping other cartoonists learn more about the wonderful medium of comics. However, since I don\u0027t charge for the advice I post online, I rarely have time to delve into a subject as deeply as I (and my readers) would like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI would like to write more lengthy, illustrated, in-depth essays about drawing \ncomics. Not \"beginner\" tutorials, of which the market has plenty, nor \nregurgitations of lessons commonly seen, but NEW material, aimed at advanced \nstudents who seek to augment their skills with next-level knowledge.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0You can find a thousand books with titles like \"Advanced Algebra,\" or \"Advanced Engineering,\" but there isn\u0027t a single book with the title \"Advanced Cartooning,\" and I would like to change that -- one PDF at a time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI would also like more time to make personal art\u003c/strong\u003e, both for fun and to hone my skills. Though I spend the most productive hours of my week drawing for a living, \u00a0that time is currently\u00a0spent drawing properties that are not my own. I would like to buy back some of that time, to create art of my own and express my own ideas. I\u0027ve written a graphic novel which I wish to someday illustrate, but first I\u0027ll need to design the characters, creatures, costumes, and locales -- a task requiring many hours at the drawing board, hours I must currently devote to paid assignments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you patronize my efforts, you will help me create illustrated, in-depth essays through which I can share my knowledge of cartooning with you and other comics enthusiasts.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eYou will also enable me to carve time out of my work schedule to hone my skills and create original new art. \u003c/strong\u003eYour patronage will result in art and writings that represent the best of what I have to offer, material that would not otherwise exist outside my head. \u003cstrong\u003ePlease help me bring wonderful new things into the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://myplace.frontier.com/~jessehamm/samples4-web.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
