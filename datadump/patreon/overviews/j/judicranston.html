    "summary": "Hey!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Judi and I am into music in a big way (see below for more details on that!). I seem to breathe music and the urge to create is getting stronger and deeper the older I get.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI believe that music has the power to heal our lives firstly by changing our thoughts, then by changing our beliefs then by changing what we KNOW to be true. Once we KNOW something then no one can EVER take that away from us.\u003cbr\u003eAs I have dabbled in music affirmations and soul songs the response that I have gotten has been phenomenal not just in my own life but also with others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have been told over and over again to ask for help when you need it. So that is what this account is for. I would love to be able to record my music so more people can use it to change their lives.\u003cbr\u003eIt would be my honour to have you as part of my team healing the world one song at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Bit more about me::\u003cbr\u003eI have a T shirt that says \"my life is music\" it almost feels like that is not quite it anymore. More like \"I am music\" but I havent found that T-shirt yet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first musical memory was as a 3 year old listening to my mum\u0027s choir. Since then its been:\u003cbr\u003eLearning a ton of instruments including piano, guitar, violin, trumpet, flute, oboe, saxophone, uke, plus loads more...\u003cbr\u003eTeaching music privately and in schools\u003cbr\u003ePlaying in bands\u00a0and orchestras\u003cbr\u003eConducting choirs and directing community groups and events\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently I started a music education company called kindyRock (check it out here if you like \u003ca href=\"http://www.kindyrock.com).\"\u003ewww.kindyrock.com).\u003c/a\u003e  Since 2008 I have been heavily focused on music education and write songs and music resources for preschoolers, teachers and parents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen since about 2015 my spirituality has been more and more important to me. As I have focused on that part of my life the music I am writing seems to reflect that journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I can no longer ignore the signs that the music I am writing is having profound changes in myself and in others. \u003cbr\u003eA while back someone mentioned the term \"sound healer\" to me and I was a bit interested in the concept. I looked at what others were doing with sound bowls and chimes and chanting and I thought to myself \" oh that\u0027 what a sound healer is I can\u0027t do that\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the concept of sound healing keeps coming back an just yesterday someone (thanks Deb) said to me \"I wonder if you are aware of the healing you do through your music. I just listened again - and my eyes leaked again!\". So finally today I am acknowledging\u00a0that my music has healing properties for those who need it and I guess that makes me a sound healer. I think being a rock chick, I would much prefer calling myself a Soul Rocker.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday I would welcome you into my soul rocker family and hope my music can help you as much as you can help me with your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love and blessings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJudi C\u003cbr\u003eSoul Rocker\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
