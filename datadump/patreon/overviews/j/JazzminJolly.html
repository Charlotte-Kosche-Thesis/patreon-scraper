    "summary": "Hi Everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jazzmin Jolly. I\u0027m a silly humanoid who likes to play dress up, model, and believe that the whole world is filled with glitter, pegasi and rainbows!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously though, hi there, I\u0027m Jazzmin! For the past 5 years I have been modeling and doing cosplay and having an absolute blast at doing so! Both hobbies have led me all around the country and into a world of new adventures, where I have met many amazing people and gotten to experiences some amazing events. My life has been changed forever, and I wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work my regular job as a Behavioral Therapist during the week, and on the weekends, I\u0027m usually traveling! I try to make costumes and pack for upcoming trips in the meantime in between my pole classes and my trapeze class. As I\u0027m sure you can imagine, life can get super crazy super quick!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe slightly suckish part is that even with all the running crazy that I do, certain social media sites (that may or may not rhyme with \"Spacelook\" can withhold much of my work from many of my fans that may want to see it, with the bribe of \"Money for views.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027d like to try something else, another venue where I can release content and it will go straight to those that want to see it without a middle man blocking the view.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat leads me here to Patreon! Whoever would like to can donate as much or as little as you please, and you will get all the rewards for that tier! Also, if I don\u0027t produce anything for that month, you won\u0027t get charged! It\u0027s a way of being able to keep in better contact with you guys on a more personal level as well as supporting me in a way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bonus is that absolutely every donation helps me to make more costumes, and attend more events so that I can come meet more of you! Also, you can get Behind the Scenes videos of my shoots, Model Tips, Coupons from the stores that I model for, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Patreon is not for you, it\u0027s totally okay! I really just want to be able to get content out to those who really want to see it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for all of the support, everyone! I love you all!"
