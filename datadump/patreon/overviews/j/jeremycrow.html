    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMy Journey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jeremy Crow and \u003cstrong\u003eI have dedicated the past 22 years of my life towards uncovering the hidden mysteries of the occult\u003c/strong\u003e. Even earlier in my youth I learned how to read tea leaves and was practicing lucid dreaming but hadn\u0027t seriously dedicated myself to the esoteric arts and sciences until I turned 17. At that point I got seriously into ritual magick and the Tarot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was raised to the degree of Master Mason in the Ancient \u0026amp; Primitive Rite of Memphis-Misra\u00efm. I was mentored for five years by Tau Cerinthus, Gnostic Bishop of Canada, which resulted in my ordination as a Gnostic Priest, initiation into the Martinist Order to the degree of S::I:: and knighted in the Portugal lineage of the Knights Templar Order. I\u0027ve held officer\u2019s roles in several Esoteric Orders including the Golden Dawn \u0026amp; the O.T.O. I became a founding member of Electro-Industrial music project \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ptp\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePleasure The Priestess\u003c/a\u003e,\u201d delved deeply into Taoist Tantra and received mentoring in lab \u0026amp; internal alchemy from Rubaphilos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere I\u0027m At Now\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have become a profoundly different person from the earnest but naive young man who first embarked on this quest. Today I am a Master of the Tarot, a seasoned Walker-Between-Worlds and have proudly adopted the label Luciferian. I have risen to become the head of two international occult and philosophical organizations (\u003ca href=\"http://www.ordo-luciferi.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOrdo Luciferi\u003c/a\u003e and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.greaterchurchoflucifer.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAssembly of Light Bearers\u003c/a\u003e) and have personally crafted two Esoteric Orders (Ziggurat of Enki and the Titanic Order of Prometheus.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI founded and continue to run the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.luciferianresearch.org\"\u003eLuciferian Research Society\u003c/a\u003e, an independent social networking site for Left Hand Path Occultists. I produced the first International Left Hand Path Conference back in 2012 and have continued to play a role in similar events since then. Most recently co-hosting the upcoming\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.flambeaunoir.com/\"\u003eFlambeau Noir\u003c/a\u003e, an occult conference being held in Ottawa, Canada the weekend of April 28th to 30th, 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am passionately inspired to spearhead projects that will empower individuals and encourage a greater sense of community among those of us with esoteric interests. To this end, I have spent decades sharing the knowledge and experience I\u0027ve acquired by writing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jeremycrow.com/articles.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003earticles\u003c/a\u003e, giving regular lectures with group discussion, making\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ZigguratOfEnki\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideos\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/luciferian-research-society/id388269596?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epodcasts\u003c/a\u003e in addition to directly tutoring individuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve co-written a book with Michael W. Ford. I\u0027ve self-published one of my own and have solid plans for over 13 additional books which are in various stages of progress. My band is about to release a new album and I\u0027m developing a three-day Lucid Dreaming workshop. With the launch of this Patreon campaign\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI am making the commitment to release a new video every week\u003c/strong\u003e. As I gain more support, I will continue to devote more time and resources towards improving both the quality and quantity of material I produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Participate\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI would love for you to be part of all this! There are several ways you can get involved. The easiest thing you can do is simply enjoy the free content I\u0027m putting out. Without a community there isn\u0027t much point in producing content and hosting events. If you come across one of my videos (or podcast episodes,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://torchbearertarot.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e posts, albums, events, etc...) that you particularly resonate with, please share it with your friends directly or through social media. Sharing this stuff around has a huge impact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAttending events is one of the best ways you can participate in the movement. I want to see you in person!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I want to crack jokes with you over a cup of coffee or a pint of beer. I want you to interact with the other people attending the events and to collaborate on your own projects together. I\u0027m talking about the large conferences but also the regular local meetings of the Assembly of Light Bearers, for example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, another important way to participate is by contributing financial support to these projects. This Patreon campaign allows you to easily set up a recurring monthly subscription for as low as one dollar per month. This gets you access to the community of Patrons here. At higher levels of support you will unlock additional perks that I have set up to show my gratitude. You can change your subscription level every month if you want. This can be useful if you want to take advantage of higher level perks for just one month. Alternatively, if you need to tighten the budget for a few months you can lower your subscription level and then put it back up again when your budget allows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Will The Money Be Used?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be absolutely amazing to work on these projects full-time. The truth is that my occult pursuits have thus far been entirely a labour of love. I generally put more money into these projects than I ever get back. To give you some background, I typically work 60 hours each week at my mundane job in order to support my family and to progress towards our financial goals. Some of the money that you contribute will allow me to reduce those hours at my day job and dedicate more time to occult projects. This will mean more content being produced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I intend to use some of the money to upgrade my facilities and equipment as well as hiring people to assist me on projects. This will result in higher quality content. I would love to start producing high end podcasts again. The amount of effort and resources required (i.e. research, recording, editing and audio engineering) has been difficult to justify these past few years but with your support all of that can change. Let\u0027s see how far we can take this together!\u003cbr\u003e"
