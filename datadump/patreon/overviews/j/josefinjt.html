    "summary": "Hi! \u003cbr\u003eMy name is Josefin, I\u0027m 20 years old, from Sweden and\u00a0I am a actor/model that is just starting out in a completely new country. Acting have been my passion since I was around 13 years old when I played a small character in a play that the local youth facility group put up in my home town. I kept going and tried to be a part of as many plays and short films as possible and in the spring of 2016 I got accepted to a film school in a different country. And so I moved to Canada, a little more than a year ago now, to study Acting for Film \u0026amp; Television. It was a fantastic year filled with both ups and downs and personal growth. But that year of training is now over and my training wheels have been taken away. I\u0027m now trying to keep practicing my passion and work with what I love, but it\u0027s difficult sometimes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would make me so happy if you would want to support me in my passion. Every penny would go to even the smallest things in favour of my acting and modelling career. Like transportation to auditions and (hopefully) gigs and letting me stay and not starve in this wonderful country!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003eJosefin\u003cbr\u003e"
