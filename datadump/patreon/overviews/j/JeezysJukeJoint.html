Since debuting in 2011, this annual Chicago-based weekender has expanded with shows in St. Louis, Nashville, Indianapolis, Des Moines, Iowa City, and more soon to be announced!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis jumping, jiving, foot-stomping revue pays homage to Black burlesque and variety with a fabulous line-up of award-winning, entertainment. Ranging from classic burlesque to drag to comedy and everything in between, this acclaimed event is sure to leave you on the edge of your seat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHosted by Jeez Loueez and featuring established and up and coming performers from all over the country, each production of Jeezy\u2019s Juke Joint is finely curated into a diverse and rich line-up full of glamour, storytelling, and thought-provoking pieces. Past guest have included such luminaries as Perle Noire, Poison Ivory, The Luminous Pariah, Ray Gunn, The Lady Ms. Vagina Jenkins, Alotta Boutt\u00e9, and many more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Word From Jeez Loueez\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI became involved in burlesque in Chicago in 2009. I was immediately enthralled with the community, the idea of creating my own art, the glitz, the glamour, the stories, the artists. I did as much research as I possible could on everything burlesque. Shows, performers, schools, legends. What I couldn\u2019t find was a lot of information or coverage about performers of color. I knew they were out there, but why such a lack of representation? Inspirational neo-burlesque trailblazers such as \u003cstrong\u003eBrown Girls Burlesque\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eHarlem Shake Burlesque\u003c/strong\u003e, and\u003cstrong\u003e Foxy Tann and the Wham Bam Thank You Ma\u2019am\u2019s\u003c/strong\u003e caught my eye and I remember feeling a sense of \u201cYES! My people!\u201d I started a blog interviewing and highlighting Black burlesque performers in Chicago and around the world. After receiving a lot of positive feedback, in 2011, this blog became a live revue.\u00a0My first show featured performers from Minneapolis, St. Louis, and New Orleans as well as amazing local burlesque performers, dancers, and singers. Jeezy\u2019s Juke Joint aims to not only bring light to the amazingly diverse performers in the scene, but to bring the art of burlesque to the Black community by reflecting the beauty and power of our culture on stage. It\u2019s important for me, as a queer person of color, to seek out and create spaces for marginalized performers to share their art. I\u2019m proud to say that the Juke Joint is even better than ever- constantly growing and evolving. The cast that has graced the stages over the years are not only some of the best in the business, but their dedication, passion, and love for the show is really what makes this such an incredible experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Jeez Loueez\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeez Loueez is an award-winning burlesque performer, actor, emcee, and instructor in Chicago known as \u201cThe Honey Badger of Burlesque\u201d and \u201cThe Powerhouse of the Midwest\u201d!
