I\u0027ll still be here\u00a0waiting for you, promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that we\u0027re all on the same page, welcome to my Patreon! If you\u0027re already a Patron, thank you so much!! Your contribution is actively improving the vlog (and by extension, my life).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Favorite Part of Vlogging Has Been YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheesy, I know, but \u003cem\u003etrue!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0The best part of vlogging this year has been interacting with and meeting the people who watch my vlog. It\u0027s wonderful and strange and inspiring all at the same time. I love reading and responding to comments as well as the messages I get through a variety of other mediums. But I want more - I want to increase your ability to engage with the vlog - and I think I found a way to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Vote - I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoy the interplay of having an audience watching me live my life on the daily - the suggestions and questions and requests for more of this (e.g. eating healthier) or less of that (e.g. my old nasty hat) which do have a real impact on how things go. You guys care and I want to give you some fun ways to help me make even better videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon enables a few really cool ways of interacting, but I think using polls to influence my decisions would be a blast. I\u0027ll give you options for everything from what I should eat to what I should wear, and you can vote as you please. The winning option (mob rule around here) will wind up in my vlog or, even better, being live streamed on YouTube (and eventually, we can do exclusive events via Twitch or Patreon\u0027s own live streaming function).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat shorts do I buy? Which new pastry should I try? Where should I explore next?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to you guys, I went into Versailles when I would have otherwise avoided it - and had a blast filming and sharing the interior of the castle with you. I can use the extra push to get out and see a few things, but more importantly I want to share those experiences as I go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVlogging As a Passion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJumping into Patreon with me does two things at once - it provides some funds to improve the quality of the vlog through a variety of means (from experiences to equipment upgrades) and will eventually free up more of my time, which will feed back into each video as I dedicate more of that time and energy into planning and executing better videos. I don\u0027t make any money off my vlog as it stands - there is no ad revenue, nor do I have big sponsors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will keep me independent of all that and help push me towards making these videos for you full time. We can certainly dream together =D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is like an ongoing Kickstarter - it\u0027s crowd-funding to support the projects we love. In this instance, it\u0027s your chance to influence my life by making me eat strange things or visit exotic lands. And in exchange for obeying your every whim, I want to build an ongoing and ever-growing conversation with you here. Won\u0027t you join me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSelect a reward level in the sidebar - each level includes all the rewards of those below it.
