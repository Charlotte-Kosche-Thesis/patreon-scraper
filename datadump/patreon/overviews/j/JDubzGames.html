    "summary": "Hi potential Patrons, my name is Jeff and I\u2019m an up in coming Indie Video Game Developer. My life long dream and goal of this campaign is to start a Game Development studio and make Indie games for Nintendo New 3DS \u0026amp; Nintendo Switch (as well as other popular platforms eventually).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have 20+ years experience in computer programming and I\u2019ve been a Nintendo gamer my entire life. I\u2019m very passionate about 2D side scrolling platformers and for the past few years have been learning how to develop them using the Unity game engine. I\u2019m finally familiar enough with Unity to begin creating original games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already have a vision for the first original game I dream of developing for Nintendo Switch. I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of 2D sidescrolling action platformers and the \u201cMetroidvania\u201d genres. I\u2019m also a fan of anime \u0026amp; manga and find the \u201ccel-shaded\u201d graphic art style very aesthetically pleasing in video games. I envision a 2D \u201cMetroidvania\u201d action platformer with badass (yet adorable) graphics, compelling plot, lots of fun weapons and upgrades, epic boss battles, a huge map with secret areas to discover and a TON of freaky looking enemies to shoot up! In a nutshell, I\u2019d want this game to display the same balance of fun \u0026amp; challenging gameplay elements that held up from the classic NES \u0026amp; SNES titles of this genre with a modern / polished look (that Nintendo fans expect to see on the New 3DS \u0026amp; Switch eShops). I also ensure you guys that I will strive to feature a few secret touches to distinguish it from competing games so it stands out as memorable in the genre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we\u2019ll be able to raise enough money to cover a Plus plan subscription for Unity as well as a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud. In the near future, after the above goal is met I\u2019m also looking to raise the funds needed to purchase a Nintendo New 3DS \u0026amp; Nintendo Switch Developer Kit so I\u2019ll be able to live my dream of making games and then publish a bunch of fun games for you guys to play!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for checking out my campaign. Your support is very much appreciated!"
