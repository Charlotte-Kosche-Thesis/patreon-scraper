    "summary": "You could say that I am just a regular guy and I am a furry. I can\u0027t get most of my work done for the people of mine and most of my time are wasted and losing so much of my own time when I should be working in a part time job or going to college. I had made videos on my YouTube Channel and most of the videos that get attention and most liked are Omegling. I use a live animated talking cat as my camera to interact with people on Omegle.com to capture their reactions or capture some moments. I also use a laptop to edit my videos, play or capture game moments and go on Omegle to get some moments. This is the only computer I use to do most of my work in the internet. Not the fastest to get things done and is certainly not ment for high video editing or recording. The program I use to edit my videos is Adobe Premiere Pro. I paid monthly for that program and I don\u0027t think I can keep going on like that. I am going through some troubling times in real life and it is not good to spread depression. So I keep things positive. I really do like to video edit my videos. I still got videos to edit but my program just expired and cannot be opened again until I keep paying for it. That\u0027s most of the story that is going on. I do not know if Patreon will be effective, a friend of mine recommended it to me in a game. Someone by the name Tythesly, thank you for recommending me this. Thank you for reading this far. Hopes for the good.\u003cbr\u003e"
