    "summary": "BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT ANYTHING, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT STARTING IN 2018, I INTEND TO GIVE 5% OF EVERYTHING I RECEIVE FROM PATREON (AFTER THEY TAKE THEIR SMALL CUT) TO THE EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM FUNDS. YOU CAN CHECK THEM OUT HERE:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds\"\u003eEFFECTIVE ALTRUISM FUNDS\u003c/a\u003e. EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM, THE ORGANIZATION BEHIND THE FUNDS, IS DEDICATED TO USING RESEARCH AND STATISTICS TO DETERMINE THE BEST USE OF CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND HELP THOSE WHO WANT TO GIVE TO DO THE MOST POSSIBLE GOOD WITH THEIR MONEY. \u00a0I\u0027M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW WRINKLE IN MY PATREON WORLD. \u00a0HOPE YOU ARE, TOO. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND NOW THAT THAT\u0027S OUT OF THE WAY....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello patrons, potential patrons, curious others, and people who ended up here totally by happy (or not so happy) accident. \u00a0My name is Josh Kaufman, which is why it says \"Josh Kaufman\" at the top of the page, which is why saying \"My name is Josh Kaufman\" at the beginning of this sentence was mostly- perhaps completely- unnecessary. \u00a0But you know, rather than bother with the backspace button, I\u0027m just going to leave it and stop rambling about it. \u00a0Anyway, this is my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT PATREON:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"What is Patreon?\" you ask? \u00a0Well, Patreon is a magical internet land created by talented musician and entrepreneur, Jack Conte. In the land of Patreon, superfluous industry middlemen don\u0027t exist. \u00a0It\u0027s just you and the artists you love, connecting directly with one another. (Moving on without the \"magical land\" metaphor...) Patreon is a bit like crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but instead of a one time donation for a big project, you\u0027re committing to give an amount of your choice per release over an extended period of time. \u00a0You can set a monthly maximum, so you never pay more than you want. \u00a0And don\u0027t worry, you can back out whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor better or worse, most music is free or nearly free now, if you want it to be. \u00a0That\u0027s the reality. \u00a0And, as a musician, I can either choose to rail against that reality, or figure out how best to live with it. \u00a0There are, of course some advantages to the current system; for instance, it\u0027s much easier to reach a bigger audience without the help of a major label. \u00a0The obvious downside, however, is of course that it can be REALLY HARD to make a living making free music, and eventually it can become absolutely unsustainable. \u00a0Enter Patreon. \u00a0Patreon offers a place where an artist (me) can ask a listener (you) to contribute voluntarily to my ongoing creative output. Yes, you\u0027ll still be able to find and listen to my music for free, if you want to. \u00a0And yes, I\u0027ll be happy that you\u0027re listening to it, regardless. \u00a0But my hope is that some of you will choose to be a part of this community here on Patreon and support me, not because you have to, but because you want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT JOSH, DIDN\u0027T YOU SAY YOU WERE SHUTTING DOWN YOUR PATREON PAGE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUh... well... yes. \u00a0But after giving it a good deal of thought and doing some talking, and reading, and learning over the last few months, I realized a couple of things. \u00a0First, I really had no idea how to run this page and make it work, and I didn\u0027t use it even remotely to its fullest potential. Sorry for that. \u00a0I\u0027ll be better. \u00a0Second, I really believe in this way of doing things. \u00a0I think that, given the current reality of the music business, this is what makes the most sense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO, WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM YOU ON PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, you can expect engagement and community. \u00a0I will be posting A LOT here, and I hope lots of you will too. \u00a0I want to know what you think. \u00a0I want to let you know what I\u0027m thinking. \u00a0I expect this to be the place where I connect the most with people, because if you\u0027re on this Patreon feed, then you\u0027re directly supporting me and making what I do possible, and just all in all giving more of a damn about me than the vast majority of other people are. And I appreciate that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what content you can expect, the paid posts will be videos and I intend to release those every other Saturday, so if you commit to giving an amount per video, you can plan on that amount being charged every other week - no more, no less. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT WILL THAT MONEY GO TOWARDS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell... everything. \u00a0It will make it possible to continue making videos. \u00a0It will help me produce more music. \u00a0It will make collaborations possible. \u00a0It will allow me to pay people to help with aspects of production. \u00a0By becoming a patron, you will be making the whole thing happen. And as I mentioned at the top, 5% of what I get from Patreon (after they take a minimal cut) will go to the Effective Altruism Funds. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you. \u00a0A lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
