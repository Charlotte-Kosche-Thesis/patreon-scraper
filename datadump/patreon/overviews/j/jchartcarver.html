    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m creating a brand new fantasy world through art and writing, and I\u0027m dying to share it with you.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to introduce you to Dorhen. An elf living outside his society. A stranger. A vagabond. A watcher who\u0027s sick of being on the outside. What does he do? He walks. He walks circles around the Lightlands, hardly stopping. He\u0027s not allowed to speak to anyone, especially humans, humans are wicked, they want to harm him. So he can\u0027t be seen, he has to keep walking, use the tools the faeries gave him to stay invisible, and eat only the food they provide. At the age of six Dorhen was led away from his home by Arius Medallus, a dutiful faerie with a plan for him. Dorhen does not know why he must walk, or why he must hide, and he doesn\u0027t ask. Until he meets Kalea.\u003cbr\u003eKalea lives in a small manorial town on the edge of a large forest, a bit of an outcast herself. They say she\u0027s crazy, and her mother tries to hide it. Nonetheless, Kalea manages to earn people\u0027s scoffs herself. No sensible woman should have such a keen interest in the foreign elven enemy. Kalea does. She loves their mysterious ways. She doesn\u0027t have much prospect for marriage, she\u0027ll be a lonely washerwoman for the rest of her days. Especially after that incident in which she helped an elven thief, named Dorhen, escape his arrest one day at the market. She had \"elf lover\" stamped to her forehead that day. She didn\u0027t care.\u003cbr\u003eAt Kalea\u0027s request, Dorhen easily agreed to stop walking. She wanted his friendship and he gave it to her. They spent thier evenings in the forest together. Kalea wanted to go with him, but Dorhen knew his life was no good for such a lovely girl. What he doesn\u0027t know is that Kalea\u0027s life has turned down a dire path. You can\u0027t do what she did and not expect repercussions. When she finally tells him, he agrees. But on the night they are supposed to meet, Dorhen is absent.\u00a0Kalea decides to follow the advice of one of her insanity dreams and leaves without him, in search of him. She joins up with an entourage for protection and they go all the way to the Darklands in the north. Does she find Dorhen? Sure. But his life has taken the worst turn imaginable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/gp/trollblooddolls/Yr5d1m\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"320\" src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5597/31103219830_bfff4741a5_n.jpg\" width=\"270\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/465/31980031042_e892d979ec.jpg\" width=\"407\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe kinda stuff I write:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been thinking hard on this and will conclude that my writing style straddles the high, dark, and romantic fantasy genres. I don\u0027t like anything more high tech than a watermill or a magnifying glass. I love the romance of the rustic world. I believe in preserving spirituality--this means magic instead of machines. It also means morals and integrity to me, and a belief in the existence of other realms and beings the naked eye can\u0027t perceive. Spirituality is important to the human existence. I love the mysterious--the unknown. I like turning attention to the darker side of things rather than ignore it and pretend that everything is ok. I live on extreme conflict and high tension. Very important in fiction! I like to make my characters suffer. I think the mighty should fall and the lovers be ripped apart. And I like sexual tension. I like sexy. I like dark heroes. I consider my novels to be written for adults (though I have no idea what the teens are reading these days), and you can expect \"sexy,\" \"edgy,\" and \"gritty\" but I do not write explicit sex scenes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I paint?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI paint according to what I write. My painting and writing goes hand-in-hand. I have trouble painting otherwise. I\u0027m trying not to take anymore of people\u0027s general commissions because I need to focus on my fantasy art and I\u0027m here on Patreon so I can hopefully bypass doing more of that kind of thing. I simply don\u0027t have enough fantasy art accumulated for marketing my book. I NEED you to be my cheerleader for this!\u003cbr\u003eI use oil paint and try to emulate the old classic ways. I want my paintings to feel real and communicate scenes from the books. I intend to share a lot of my art journeys with my patrons. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eYou can expect to see some nude art, by the way\u003c/span\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I said, my fantasy art reflects my writing: \"sexy\" \"edgy\" \"gritty.\" It may not be the fanciful imagery you\u0027d expect, with the colorful, glamorous goddesses and fairies that I\u0027ve seen a lot of--my art is dark and \"heavy.\" I use tones of black all over the place. I like to show scenes of sadness and misery. Discomfort. I use a wide range of colors, but when the painting is finished it usually still looks \"subdued\" somehow. Also, I like the male human figure--I will not be stingy with those!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"385\" src=\"https://c5.staticflickr.com/1/664/31480782332_dfbdc72720.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my biggest goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need to publish my first novel! I really want to bypass using the big publishing houses because they are a drag. Nothing feels more RIGHT to me than publishing my own work and I\u0027ve created a company in 2017 to do just that. Publishing is kind of expensive depending on how you do it and I demand nothing short of excellence for my books, so this is the main purpose for this Patreon page. Your contribution will help me to hire freelance services, cover necessary fees (like buying ISBN numbers and whatnot), and I want you to ride along and see my progress as well as reap the rewards of free ebooks and fun physical gifts! \u003cbr\u003eIdeally, after a few years in gaining\u00a0experience in publishing books, I might see fit to publish other people\u0027s books too.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on a series of 5 books, called the Sufferborn Series and book 1 is about to be edited--the publication will happen at the end of 2018. I also have first drafts waiting to be improved all the way up through half of book 4. So this series is about to spill out into the market one by one!\u003cbr\u003eThe other big goal is painting book covers. I\u0027m still working on book 1\u0027s cover and I\u0027ve had the worst time deciding! I\u0027m still at square one with that so I will very much value your help in getting some ideas together, and deciding what to paint. A little later if I can come up with multiple cover painting candidates then I want my patrons to vote on which cover to use for each book, so please stick around for that, it will be so much fun!\u003cbr\u003eI use only the best tools and materials for painting, like nice and heavy 15 or 12 oz canvas on heavy duty stretcher bars or solid panels, Windsor\u0026amp;Newton paints, and Robert Simmons brushes. Your monthly donations will support my ongoing quest for a book cover and fantastic concept art by keeping me and some supplies in the studio!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou will be rewarded!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not publish my art freely around the net. Please know that as my patron you will have the privilege of seeing work not very many other people see, not to mention the duds, the processes, and a behind-the-scenes look into a tightly closed studio! \u003cbr\u003eI need your support in my journey to publication! And I want you to share in the fun of the process (because I do enjoy this process most of all in life). For $5+ a month, I want to print YOUR name in the acknowledgements of my books, everyone donating from $1+ will have the ability to vote on a cover design, and the $5+ donators will get a physical item in their mailbox. So at least once a year I\u0027d like to send you my paintings printed on post cards, bookmarks, magnets--who knows?!\u003cstrong\u003e (Prints may contain artistic nudity)\u003c/strong\u003e. The $1+ tier will get an ecard for Dorhen\u0027s birthday (yes he\u0027s very special to me so I observe it each year), I like to make his birthday cards funny and they also\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003emay contain dirty jokes\u003c/strong\u003e. You will get some good info on the world, races, and characters to get you up to speed with how the story works. The $20+ tier will get an autographed copy of\u003cem\u003e Sufferborn\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0after it is published. Want something else? I will name a character after you if you donate $800. I promise it will be a likable character! So go ahead and press that \"Become a Patron\" button. Step in a little further to see what you can do to help a dreamer achieve her vision, get an awesome fantasy novel in your library, and a little something in your mailbox too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I have published so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve published 2 books for the ball-jointed doll hobby community called \"How to Rock at BJD Face-Up: A Beginner\u0027s Guide to Painting Resin Doll Faces,\" and \"Make Your Own Wigs for BJD and Any Other Doll.\" They\u0027re available in ebook and paperback format and can be found at all the major retailers: Amazon, iBooks, Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, Smashwords, Kobo, Createspace, and more! Check and see if your favorite retailer has them! Other than that I had an essay printed in my college\u0027s \"best essays\" magazine several years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt and writing: these two things have always been in my life. My childhood was kinda rough and I always used these two mediums to sort of... get myself through the tough times in a constructive way. When I was thirteen I was pulled out of school and put into homeschool, as public school was one of the roughest parts of my existence. I had a lot of healing to do from there, so what did I do? Near the end of 1998 I started drawing characters and dreaming up their adventures in order to soothe myself. I think it worked, or maybe turned into an unhealthy obsession--who knows?! Regardless, those characters I drew and thought about never went away, they kept developing and changing and growing with me and when I hit the age of seventeen I realized that I was dealing with a whole book that was banging on my skull trying to get out! So I sat down at the pc and never quite got up.\u003cbr\u003eI spent my twenties in college honing my writing and painting skills. Now I\u0027m 33 (as of 2018) and it\u0027s time to publish my life\u0027s work.\u003cbr\u003eBut there\u0027s one problem--life. I pay bills just like everyone else, and am juggling my student loans payments--I\u0027m literally paying for the very skills I learned to work on this book series.\u003cbr\u003eThis is where YOU come in. I want to share with you what I am writing, painting, and drawing. As far as novels go, I\u0027ve read a lot of good ones and a lot of bad ones. I am using my own experience as a fan of books and fantasy to create a great one. One that suits me as a reader and fantasy fan, and is designed to work not only as an exciting, enjoyable story, but also one that is deep and meaningful. So please come join me on my journey, I need to hear your opinions and your moral support!
