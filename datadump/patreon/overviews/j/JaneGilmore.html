Because all too often the focus\nis the victim - her choices, her actions, her life. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy do rape victims make headlines but rapists don\u2019t? Same reason. It\u2019s the\nvictim who goes through trial by media, not the rapist. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy are children described in the media as \"having sex\" or worse,\nbeing in \"a sexual relationship\" with an adult? Children, by\ndefinition, cannot have sex with adults. It\u0027s not sex, it\u0027s rape, it\u0027s sexual\nabuse, it\u0027s any other term that accurately describes a crime.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo one who has been raped or murdered has ever said anything, worn anything, done\nanything to cause the crime someone chose to commit against them. There is only\none thing that causes rape or murder and that is the decision to commit rape or\nmurder. Nothing else.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJournalists and editors have a responsibility to the truth. Headlines that\nblame victims for the violence enacted against them is not journalism, it\u2019s\ndeception.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve spent years\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://janegilmore.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efixing these headlines\u003c/a\u003e. And I still see them come up, every\nsingle day. It has to stop. It\u2019s a constant, insidious reinforcement of the\nmyths that blame women and children for the violence men commit against\nthem. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe FixedIt project has taken on a life of its own and I believe it is\nimportant. I started it because victim blaming headlines are unbearably\ndisgusting and dangerous. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut it takes time. And that means money. I see too many of them go by and I\ndon\u2019t have time to fix them because landlords don\u2019t accept outrage in lieu of\nrent.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can help me have more time to give to this project, I will do more with\nit. Daily updates. International publications. More public speaking. Finish the\nFixedIt book. More focus, more energy, more time on holding the media to\naccount for the things they do. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for supporting this. Thank you for knowing how important it is to\nchange the way men\u2019s violence against women, children and other men is reported\nand understood. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for helping me make some contribution to\nchanging it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see the all the FixedIt posts on my website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://janegilmore.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejanegilmore.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
