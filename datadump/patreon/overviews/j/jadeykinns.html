Second, the financial situation at home wasn\u2019t the best, only my dads wage was what we was living on, I want to help more by finishing uni and get a job ASAP. I was lucky enough to get work as a Christmas temp with more than enough hours to help out at home, then they offered me permanent work, even better. In the same year I fell pregnant with my first born son with my partner of 8 years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEli, my son is one of my main reasons for wanting to do better with my life, I don\u2019t want to waste away in a job that can\u2019t provide for him no more. Before I found I was having him, I was contemplating suicide. He is the reason I\u2019m still hear today. Giving him the best life is all I want to do for him."
