Military Science Fiction.\u00a0 I also write High Fantasy, Steampunk, and other similar genres and sub-genres and crossed-genres in the general realms of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and occasionally Romance mixed with one of the other two.\u00a0 (Be advised, my Romances tend to be NSFW; the warning\u0027s just there in case you buy and read those novels.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories can be found in mass market (normal-sized) paperbacks, trade (slightly larger) paperbacks, and even ebook formats, through retailers such as Barnes \u0026amp;

I\u0027ve dreamed of being an author since I was a little girl.\u00a0 Unfortunately, writing as a career\u00a0doesn\u0027t pay as much as people think it does, but I\u0027ll make you, my Patreon patrons (readers)\u00a0a deal: You give me a little support each month through Patreon here, to help me get my various bills covered,\u00a0and I\u0027ll give you access to exclusive content: character bios, map sketches, sneak peeks at upcoming chapters, \u0026amp;
