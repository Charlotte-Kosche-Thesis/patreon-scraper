It explains what Patreon is and how it works, as well as what I\u0027m using it for. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlus there\u0027s some sneak peaks of my new music videos and some of the super freakin\u0027 awesome exclusive rewards in there!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m Making\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy passion is to create explosively quirky rap music to tickle your funny bone, feed your soul and touch your heart. And you might just feel like dancing while you\u0027re at it. On top of that, I absolute LOVE bringing my songs to life through music videos. I like to keep them infused with\u00a0cheeky comedy delivered through surreal visuals bursting with beautiful and eccentric characters. I\u0027ve met some of the coolest people ever and made some of my best friends during the production of these videos and have had some wild adventures on the way. Like this one!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/szMUN8T3B9Q\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy music is also about spreading a message. I believe that all the tools necessary to create the existence of your dreams are available and attainable, and through my art,\u00a0I want to share with you what I think those are.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlus I want you to grow a beard, lose your pants and be as weird as you want to be. Basically I want you to express your individuality, and I hope that by doing that through my music, I can inspire you to do it too. The world would be a better place with more of us weirdos and beardos frolicking about :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Here\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nFor the reasons mentioned in my Patreon video and also because I believe this is the best way for independent artists to be supported in their work. I want to make more art and I believe the best way to do that is to find people who believe in me and want to be a part of what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OSZETKNizoM\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nThere\u0027s all kinds of sweet rewards!

     "description": "I will fly anywhere that costs less than 500 dollars for a return flight and perform a private concert in your house for you and your friends! I will pay for the flight out of the donation, so it\u0027s effectively a 500 dollar donation. I will ask that you find me a bed to sleep in for 2 or 3 nights while i\u0027m there as well :) Comfy couches work for me too. I am living in Australia at the moment so this probably only applies to Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia at the moment.",

     "description": "To make a proper album requires serious production, not to mention oodles of extra time and effort compared with a mixtape or an EP. At least that\u0027s what I imagine as I\u0027ve never made one! But I have created two mixtapes \u0026amp; two EPs (soon to be released) and I know that they are already a ton of work. What I really feel would allow me to step up to the next level to create a full, cohesive album is a talented producer to work with, and they ain\u0027t cheap. Once I reach $1,000 per release I will be able to afford to hire one.",
