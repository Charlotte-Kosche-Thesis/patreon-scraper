First. A few words about me: I am a writer. As Delany states so well, I find that my best ideas come \"largely through writing.\" Or outlining. Or reading. The text, in all its facets, is the terroir from which the finest, fermented spirits are produced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the outset, I could share with you some words about what I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, writing for me is a vocation, like contemplative practice \u2014 these days, it is difficult to separate these two. \u003cem\u003eWrite, breathe, be\u003c/em\u003e. Blank page, open sky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I write, and have written, for many publications, such \u003cem\u003eEvolve Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eKosmos Journal\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eEvolve and Ascend\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eConscious Lifestyle\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eDisinformation\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, I helped co-found \u003cem\u003eMETAPSY\u003c/em\u003e journal, and since 2013 I\u0027ve written for \u003cem\u003eReality Sandwich\u003c/em\u003e magazine, serving as a contributing editor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year, in 2017, I joined\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.revelore.press\"\u003eRevelore Press\u003c/a\u003e as an editor \u2014 \"\u003ca href=\"http://revelore.press/philosophies/\"\u003eCurator of Philosophies\u003c/a\u003e\" \u2014 which you\u0027ll learn more about this year as my first projects with the press come to fruition (these projects include anthologies exploring \"consciousness culture\" or \"transformational culture\", science fiction and metaphysics, and educational zines).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my background in online learning and my passion for studies, I\u0027ve founded an online school dedicated to exploring consciousness, self-transformation, \"integral pedagogy,\" and empowering artists to deepen their practices and \"make good art\" that could help move culture:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nuralearning.com\"\u003eNura Learning\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo more things at the outset. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the \"exiting\" president of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gebser.org\"\u003eJean Gebser Society\u003c/a\u003e \u2014 an academic society exploring the work of the integral philosopher \u2014 and have served as their conference convener for the past few years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly: I\u0027m writing my first book. It\u0027s called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rubedo.press/passages-from-tomorrow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePassages From Tomorrow\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e You might have guessed what it\u0027s about. If there\u0027s one, singular, intellectual passion of mine, it is the spiritual, philosophical, metaphysical and sociological interest in a transformation of consciousness. In understanding what is happening to us, through us, in the present. \u003cem\u003eWhat we are becoming\u003c/em\u003e. This very much involves the imagination, as the late Le Guin so beautifully triumphed, and a sensitivity to acclimating our mind and body to the latent events of our present culture to tell us what might be in store. The future whispers to us in the dreams of yesterday, in the reveries of now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy own writing, in this respect, is to study the \"reveries of now,\" to attune our cultural instruments to those better tomorrows. In the spirit of the 20th century luminaries, from which I count my greatest inspiration, like Jean Gebser, Teilhard de Chardin, Sri Aurobindo, Mirra Alfassa, and many others I could list here, but won\u0027t for brevity\u0027s sake, I wish to encounter our world with an inquiry into what is possible. With the fundamental sense that what we are is a \u003cem\u003edoing\u003c/em\u003e \u2014 \"I seem to be a verb\" \u2014 and that doing is always transformation. \"The exercise of imagination is dangerous to those who profit from the way things are\" writes Le Guin, \"because it has the power to show that the way things are is not permanent, not universal, not necessary.\" Here, at the edge of the world, where capitalism buckles, the Anthropocene crawls up with the rising tide, and we gaze upon our collective reflection, mirrored in the oceanic scrying glass of the Earth from space, what do we see? \u003cem\u003eWho\u003c/em\u003e do we see? What we \u003cem\u003ewere\u003c/em\u003e, can no longer be. What we \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e seems to escape definition. What we \u003cem\u003ebecome\u003c/em\u003e is like an answer on the tip of our tongues \u2014 not quite here, but our whole being wells up with a hidden word that announces it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eSO WHAT IS THIS PATREON PROJECT ALL ABOUT?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll try to be short, and offer you some points...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003eWriting -\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027d like to share my writing process with you. \u003cem\u003ePassages\u003c/em\u003e, and my work at Revelore as an editor, are both seeking to explore this question of the human species in an age of great transformation. As I\u0027ve likely overstated, imagination and aesthetic are potent, inextricable dimensions of this question. It is perhaps the greatest of all questions\u2014\"Who am I?\"\u2014so I hope to produce literature that readers can participate in, and with, in coming to understand ourselves in the great long \u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cstrong\u003eProducing Literature -\u003c/strong\u003e In the vein of \"consciousness culture,\" which is always very interested in this question, I hope to assemble and curate some of today\u0027s artists, philosophers and writers.This is not merely a material question, or a scientific one, but an occult inquiry. It extends itself to the visible and invisible. The inquiry is spiritual, poetic, scientific, philosophical. It is narratological, mythopoetic, and sociological.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the 1970s, the human potential movement asked what was possible in the future human; today, the Anthropocene answers us with Rilke\u0027s mandate: \"You must change your life.\" I am interested in new metaphysical movements and modalities, new philosophies of tomorrow that, in a sense, already live in the future, that spring forth from tomorrow\u0027s latent answers and reveal to us what we always were. These are the \"evolutionary mysticisms\" of the aforementioned scholars like Teilhard, these are modes of thinking that must come to wrestle with the struggles and complexities of the present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to create and curate literature and build a consciousness culture that is not satisfied to remain a niche market but to speak to our present spiritual crisis\u2014much like some of the most pressing 20th century scholars of the occulture, integral philosophy, and spirituality did in the human potential movement. To say, \"we must \u003cem\u003eleap\u003c/em\u003e into new ways of thinking and being, new shapes of thought.\" New mutations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here to help build towards that culture with the firm knowing that any new turnings, any new aesthetic movements, must be permeable and transparent. Not lost in the echo chamber but, like Thomas Merton reminds us of through contemplative life, \u003cem\u003eis at the heart of the world\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003cstrong\u003eBuilding a community \u003c/strong\u003e- My patreon project is intended to help support book writing, book editing, and culture building.

These especially pertain to the writers I will be working with for Revelore, and also interviewing for my book.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour feedback, involvement, and participation are helping to build this iteration of \"consciousness culture\" and support the publication of new literature, research, anthologies, and ultimately community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my hope that the community we\u0027re building will offer you tools for self-exploration, aesthetic renewal and inspiration, and more rigorous and critical unions (yogas) of scholarship and esoteric praxis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are right in sensing that there is a utopian ring to all this; I am trying to imagine a consciousness culture (or \"Visionary Culture\" or \"Transformational Culture\") that has a revived sense of intensity -- in the Teilhardian sense -- of truly being present in the world and building modes of thinking and relating that can help bring a better reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eWHAT YOUR FUNDING DOES\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt gives me more time, energy, and focus on the anthology projects at hand, on speaking with teachers, organizing conversations for the public discussion (\"Mutations\"), my own book writing (\u003cem\u003ePassages\u003c/em\u003e) and book research (funds for purchasing research books, etc.).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, here is the fun part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDonations of $1 (\u003cstrong\u003eMutant\u003c/strong\u003e) get you access to Patron-only content, like sneak peaks at unpublished writing, early announcements for upcoming Nura courses, and (eventually) the early draft of \u003cem\u003ePassages From Tomorrow\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$5 and up (\u003cstrong\u003eSuper Mutant\u003c/strong\u003e) get you a special Thank You note in my book, plus access to a monthly, private live Zoom meeting with me.
