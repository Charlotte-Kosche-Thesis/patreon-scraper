Until that day comes, however, I know the best course to get there is to keep practicing. Fortunately, I have found a great place for that while also, hopefully, building up an audience as I stumble along the road to establishing myself as an author.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to show your appreciation for the work put into crafting these stories then please feel free to pledge. Your money will be put to good use in entertaining my kids and plying them with junk food and video games so that I can prove that, yes, daddy really is working when he sits at the computer all evening typing away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
