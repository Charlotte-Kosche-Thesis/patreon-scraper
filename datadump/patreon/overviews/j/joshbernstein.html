I am a TRUTH seeker and a TRUTH teller and for that I am a HUGE target. I cover stories that the main stream media would not dare cover. I have exposed organizations like: The American Red Cross, The Southern Poverty Law Center, The Susan G. Komen Foundation, The FISA Courts, Antifa, BAMN, Child Trafficking, Big Pharma, Nursing Homes, Foster Care, Radical Islam, The Deep State, Globalism, New World Order, Members of Congress, The Communist Party USA, Paid Protesters,and many many more. As a result of these actions, Youtube now flags the majority of my videos in an attempt to silence me. As a result they have made it extremely difficult for me to monetize my efforts.That is why I started this Patreon Account. PLEASE HELP ME BEAT BACK CENSORSHIP BY BECOMING A PATRON OF MY SHOW. Together we will grow the show and continue to expose the lies, deception, and corruption in our Government. Thank you for your support!"

     "about": "JOSH ON WIKIPEDIA:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Bernstein_(talk_show_host)\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Bernstein_(talk...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTV Talk Show Host, Political Analyst, Commentator and National Spokesman Josh Bernstein is one of the most sought after TV and Radio guests in Conservative Media today. He has been called a \u201cpolitical savant\u201d and always gives you a different angle the rest of the media hasn\u2019t thought of. Never one to shy away from controversy he says and does what others in the media wouldn\u2019t dare say. His TV Show is watched by thousands of people each week and features a different top level guest each week.\u003cbr\u003eBefore Josh ascended the ranks of Television broadcasting he made a name for himself as a prolific writer and unapologetic radio talk show host. A published writer at a very young age, initially his passion was for poetry. (see the \u201cBeyond Politics\u201d for some of his published work.) However, his focus and passion all changed with the events of September 11, 2001. This single event inspired him to pursue his passion for Patriotism, Conservatism, and American pride. Josh article\u2019s were found on such powerhouses of Conservative thought such as Breitbart News, Right Wing News, and The Tea Party Tribune.\u003cbr\u003eHis articles lead him to numerous guest appearances on some of today\u2019s best conservative talk shows and to the formation of his own show \u201cThe Josh Bernstein Show\u201d\u003cbr\u003ePolitistick recently did an EXCLUSIVE interview with Josh in which they covered the legendary Radio Talk Show Host Barry Farber\u2019s prediction that Josh could be the next Rush Limbaugh. Josh feels just to be mentioned in the same sentence as Rush is an honor and a very humbling experience. Barry Farber has been on the air for over 50 years and is currently ranked #8 on the list of all time greatest radio personalities in the history of broadcasting. He also was very instrumental in the development of Sean Hannity\u2019s career and Sean counts Barry as one of his biggest mentors.\u003cbr\u003eHere is that article: \u003ca href=\"http://politistick.com/exclusive-radio-legend-predicts-this-man-could-be-the-next-rush-limbaugh/\"\u003ehttp://politistick.com/exclusive-radio-legend-predicts-this-man-could-be-the-next-rush-limbaugh/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDOWNLOAD THE JOSH BERNSTEIN SHOW APP: http://appshopper.com/entertainment/the-josh-bernstein-show\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Josh Bernstein Show has been named to \u003ca href=\"http://www.toptalkradio.com\"\u003ewww.toptalkradio.com\u003c/a\u003e \u201cTop 100 Conservative All Stars List\u201d (this is a list with great names in Conservative talk such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, and Mark Levin.)\u003cbr\u003eYou can read his Rolling Stone style Interview with Top Talk HERE: \u003ca href=\"http://www.toptalkradio.com/id138.html\"\u003ewww.toptalkradio.com/id138.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJosh\u2019s show is hard hitting, edgy, and carries with it the subtleness of a sledgehammer. The fire breathing Conservative Talk Show Host never uses any bad language because he understands that every show he does is part of his resume. Josh does his show in a very deliberate fashion. When his loyal fans ask him if he is as passionate off the air as he is on it, he says with no hesitation, \u003cem\u003e\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d \u201cI want people who watch the show to either absolutely love me or absolutely loathe me. I don\u2019t want to be \u201cmoderately liked\u201d by everyone. My favorite compliment is when a liberal says to me, \u201cI disagree with almost everything you say but I love the way you say it.\u201d To me, that is priceless.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE ALSO SUBSCRIBE TO MY YOU TUBE CHANNEL HERE: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7K0wNhrt6fQdTj9zQQwLtw\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7K0wNhrt6fQdTj9zQQwLtw\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso the audio portions of the TV Show can be heard on many different platforms around the Country frankly too many to list.\u003cbr\u003e*** Josh does weekly segments on many different shows such as \u201cThe Jiggy Jaguar Show\u201d which broadcasts on 50 stations and is ranked #49 on Talkers Magazine\u2019s \u201cFrontier Fifty\u201d BELLOWS UNPLUGGED, and THE ALLAN NATHAN SHOW just to name a few.\u003cbr\u003eLook for \u201cTHE JOSH BERNSTEIN NEWS MINUTES\u201d powered by AMAC EVERY DAY ON as many as 47 stations across the country and in 25 states. The Josh Bernstein TV Show is now featured on the Huffington Post website in the video section as well.\u003cbr\u003eJosh has been a guest on 1,000\u0027s of radio and over 50 TV programs across the country where he gives political insight and commentary on the pressing and breaking news stories of the day. Josh also can be seen frequently on Newsmax TV, RT America and The Dove TV and heard regularly on \u201cThe Barry Farber Show\u201d, \u201cThe Clint Bellows Show\u201d, \u201cThe Charles Butler Show\u201d, \u201cBobby Gunther Walsh\u201d, \u201cThe Allan Nathan Show\u201d, and many many others.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to hosting a weekly TV Show Josh is also proud to be a National Spokesman for the amazing group The Association of Mature American Citizens. (aka AMAC)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amac.us/\"\u003eWWW.AMAC.US \u003c/a\u003eis the \u201cConservative Alternative\u201d to groups like AARP. \u003cstrong\u003eI am proud and honored to represent this fine group.\u003c/strong\u003e AMAC helps guide Seniors to make fiscally sound healthcare decisions while stressing their independence and maintaining their liberty. AMAC puts Seniors first, their members first, and America first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJosh is the Director of Campaign Communications for Candidate Vetting for The Tea Party Community.\u003c/strong\u003e This allows him access to some of the biggest names running for Congress. Josh has interviewed just about everyone running for Congress as well as some other big name notables in Conservative Politics. Josh has interviewed Television stars, radio stars, Former White House Officials, Former Military Commanders and Generals, even a few folks on the right from Hollywood.\u003cbr\u003eAmerica is in great peril. Leftists and Globalists in BOTH parties are destroying America. The agenda 21 and New World Order are in full effect. Liberalism, Collectivism, and Socialism are destroying our country like a 21st Century plague. From Western Europe to Canada to the United States the axis of evil must be defeated.\u003cbr\u003eThe Josh Bernstein Show \u003cstrong\u003eexposes\u003c/strong\u003e liberal hypocrisy, \u003cstrong\u003edissects\u003c/strong\u003e leftist ideology, and \u003cstrong\u003edismantles\u003c/strong\u003e liberal policy with \u003cstrong\u003eintellect\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003efacts\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eThe Josh Bernstein show starts where the rest of the media ends\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
