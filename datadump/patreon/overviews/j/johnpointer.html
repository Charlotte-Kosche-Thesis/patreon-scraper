    "summary": "Hi there! If you\u0027re looking at this, first I want to thank you. You\u0027ve taken the first step toward making a huge impact on the work I do, and hopefully toward\u00a0making more of it together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a full-time musician for almost 30 years with tons of awards, experiences, and accolades under my belt. But none of that puts gas in the tank or food on the table. Why? Over the past 20 years we\u0027ve all watched the old music industry evolve into an even less-sustainable model than before, which has left us all with a major problem: Music is now free to listen to, but it\u0027s still expensive to produce. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid you know that Youtube is the number one place to discover music online today? That means in addition to buying all the music gear and spending years honing the related skills, unsigned artists like me have to buy and run our own video production studios, too. So that means even while the value of recorded music continues to plummet, the cost to produce and post it has risen.\u00a0Luckily, there\u0027s a solution: Patronage. It\u0027s as old as humanity but today it\u0027s as accessible as your phone or computer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working with patrons just like you for over a decade to\u00a0make new music, produce concerts, record professional-quality videos, and more. Even though we used to think the music \"industry\" was a normal business, at the end of the day musicians really just make music for people to hear and people listen to music that moves them. It\u0027s simple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage makes all the difference. It is the most natural extension of the relationship between the people who make music and the people who love music. In a nutshell, musicians make music and your patronage makes that music *happen*. You get all sorts of exclusive stuff, but more importantly, your funding actually buys the space to create *more* of it. That\u0027s how it should work, and that\u0027s why I\u0027m so glad we have sites like Patreon to make it easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all that said, it boils down to this: I love doing this for you and I would love your support to keep doing it. I look forward to what comes next and hope you join me on the journey!\u003cbr\u003e"
