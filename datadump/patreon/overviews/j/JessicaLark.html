In exchange they filled their homes and lives with their creations. At this level, each month you will receive a Fine Art Limited Edition Print, including ones available nowhere except Patreon; along with a beautiful Collectors Box.  Each print is signed and numbered by the Artist.  If one remains a Patreon for the duration of the project, at it\u2019s end they would have a full collection of the series.",
