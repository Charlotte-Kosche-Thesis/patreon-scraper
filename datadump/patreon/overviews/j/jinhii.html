Welcome to my Patreon~\u2740\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an aspiring artist, song coverist, and trying to work on becoming a game developer and music composer too! (I have lots of dreams haha)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have a job atm so any support would be highly appreciated! I\u0027m gonna try to start studying again in hopes of being able to get a better job to support myself and earn enough to continue to help support my parents also. I will do my best to earn money through commissions and adopts and possibly merch, but anything from patreon would be very helpful since it is a bit difficult for me to earn enough through just adopts and commissions considering I would have to be drawing and selling constantly and consistently to make enough without an actual job. Regardless of whether you support me on Patreon or not, I will continue to do my best to produce and improve on my art/adopts/covers/music/games/etc! I\u0027ll still love all of my watchers/followers/fans/friends that love and support what I do~ This will also serve as extra motivation to get things done and be more productive and connected to my supporters\u00a0\u2606\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven a $1 pledge is more than enough if you\u0027d like to support me!!! A tiny big of support can go a long way when it builds up so even that much would make me so so happy \u0026lt;3 Please don\u0027t feel bad if you can\u0027t pledge more than that! I\u0027d rather have more people pledge less than expect a few people to pledge a whole lot TTwTT\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support me with a one-time donation, you can also just buy me a coffee!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/A202O7L\"\u003ehttps://ko-fi.com/A202O7L\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support I get from Patreon will go towards funding my studies, helping my parents with bills, personal needs irl or online such as purchasing any tools/programs/plugins/materials I might end up needing for whatever I do, supporting others through Patreon or commissions/etc, and even food/travel expenses and the like~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel pressured to support me here and thank you so much for reading and even checking it out!
