    "summary": "Ever since I launched my peace blog and started sharing the story of how God used a little Muslim boy to turn my heart from hatred of Muslims to love them as friends; people have wanted to hear more. I have told the story of my encounter with Omar in homes, mosques, churches, a synagogue, and before heads of state and dignitaries from around the world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you told me personally or have written me that my peace efforts and stories challenged you, encouraged you, and above all gave you hope that we might be able to create a better world if we take the path of love and peace seriously instead of choosing rivalry, hostility, violence, and scapegoating which seems to be the default mechanism for most of the humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write about holistic peacemaking, reconciliation, and restorative justice. \u00a0The core of my writing flows out the Golden Rule:\u003cem\u003e love\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eyour neighbor as yourself and treat other people the way you want to be treated. \u00a0And if you find an enemy try to make them your friend. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAlso, I speak honestly in my books and blogs about the good, the bad and the ugly of peacemaking that I have experienced over the past ten years. \u00a0It seems that many of you resonate with what I am saying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging a monthly gift through Patreon, you will be able to tangibly partner with me as we continue important conversations and invite others to walk the path of peace with us. \u00a0You will be investing in created work that you enjoy and believe in. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot promise you fancy gifts or special bonus packages (though you never know), but I can promise you that you will be a true partner with me. You will join me in sharing this work of peace with the world and help support me as I work on upcoming books, ongoing blogs, and peace building for Muslims, Christians and other people of good will everywhere. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease know that any amount is most welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading my blogs and encouraging me to follow the Path of peace and for considering being a financial partner in this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and blessings,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeff\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "This level of support would enable me to go full-time as a writer, blogger, and peacemaker. \u00a0If I am able to reach this goal, I would be able to do the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. \u00a0Write a series of books on my personal journey as a peacemaker between Muslims and Christians. In these books, I will discuss the good, the bad, and the ugly of peacemaking in the United States. \u00a0These books will be loaded with stories of hope and encouragement, but they will also reveal the dark underbelly of resistance to peace in this country, not only politically but among people of faith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. \u00a0Create an online e-course called P.E.A.C.E. P.A.T.H., which is based on the successful model of peacemaking I developed over the last ten years. \u00a0This model is time and field tested and it works! \u00a0This e-course will give step-by-step instructions on how anyone can begin the journey of peace building in their own local communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Create an e-book entitled \u003cem\u003eRedeemed: How My Momma, My Wife, and A Little Muslim Boy Saved Me From Racism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e4. \u00a0Write a memoir on my time as a Southern fundamentalist pastor who had to confront deep racism in several congregations that I led. \u00a0The book will be called \u003cem\u003eHidden Racists: The Dirty Secrets of Southern Fundamentalist Christianity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e5 \u00a0Create an online community called The Path. \u00a0The Path will be a full fledged online community with a website, teaching content, discussion areas, and more. The purpose of The Path is to bring Muslims, Christians and other people of good will together in order to catalyze a peace movement online and also lead to local physical Path gatherings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
