    "summary": "Welcome\nto \u003cem\u003eJust\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDo It Afraid, a\u003c/em\u003e mentorship program for young adults (YA) and thank you for being a\npatron. \u003cstrong\u003eWe launched this mentorship program on January 15, 2018 to coincide with the beginning of a new year and the the message of Dr. Martin Luther King, a message of hope and dreams for many who still needs to successfully prepare to enter and thrive in their adulthood.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e After mentoring YA on an ad hoc\nbasis for some time I, Dr. Linda Barthelus, decided to start a\nmentorship program to help YA on a broader scale.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eI want you to ask us questions on anything you do not understand as you face challenges in starting life on your own. You are not alone.\u00a0 No question is too stupid or unimportant.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\ndo I believe this program is important?\u003c/strong\u003e It is because many YA I currently\nmentor feel uncertain, fearful and/or anxious about their future. They do not\nknow what to study in college, have difficulty finding a job and if they do\nhave a job, how to successfully hold on to it. Others have difficulty getting\nahead financially because they do not know how to budget their money, deal with\ntheir student loans, avoid excessive credit card debt, make the right financial\ndecisions and/or save for emergencies. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI have also heard from parents, grandparents and guardians who have asked me to\nmentor their children and grandchildren to give them some direction for their\nlives. \u003cstrong\u003eI found that the YA who needs mentorship include  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThose who are fearful and/or unsure of what to do with their lives\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThose\nwho lack parental guidance\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eIndividuals\naged out of the foster care system often left to raise themselves and figure\nout the adult world on their own\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eAt risk\nyouths\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eThose\nneeding some motivation and inspiration to positively jumpstart their adulthood\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eThose\nneeding some targeted training of key life skills to fill gaps in their formal\neducation\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nThus, in\nlaunching Just Do It Afraid, the primary purpose is to empower YA to proactively\n\u0026amp; successfully transition into adulthood\u003c/strong\u003e. I do this by first providing video\ntutorials, interactive discussions and monthly wrap ups to ensure learning is\neffective. The \u003cstrong\u003ebiggest plus\u003c/strong\u003e is that you get to ask \u003cstrong\u003eALL THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT\u003c/strong\u003e about different life challenges you face as you start life on your own.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes this mentorship program unique is that the focus is on you, the young adult,\nlearning the fundamental skills to live outside the nest, living on your own\nout of your parents/ guardian\u2019s home. \nThe video lessons will not be flashy but to the point with the content\nyou need to\u2026get an education, avoid defaulting on your student loans, start\nyour career job, get your own place to live, pay your own bills, create an\nemergency fund, use your credit cards wisely and more\u2026 This is what Just Do It Afraid is all about.  I deal\nwith the meat \u0026amp; potatoes.  I let\nothers deal with the dessert.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust Do It Afraid is structured in the order YA commonly experience their\npath to adult life.\u003c/strong\u003e This means the lessons and learning discussions will cover\nlife skills in the following order\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e1. Preparing\nfor and starting college\u003cbr\u003e2.\u00a0Managing your paycheck\u003cbr\u003e3. Finding\nand starting first real job\u003cbr\u003e4.\u00a0Revisit student loan debt\u003cbr\u003e5. Understanding\n\u0026amp; managing credit and debt\u003cbr\u003e6. Renting\nfirst apartment\u003cbr\u003e7. Tips\non living with roommates, neighbors and landlord\u003cbr\u003e8. Buying\nfirst vehicle\u003cbr\u003e9. Being\na responsible citizen (paying taxes, maintaining vehicle, laws, etc.)\u003c/div\u003e\n\nPlease note\nthat Just Do It Afraid DOES NOT cover topics on fashion\ntrends, celebrity gossip, latest movies and music, politics, social dating\nand the like.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI priced the\nmentorship program at $5 per month to ensure all YA can affordably gain the\nskills needed.  By becoming a monthly\npatron, you are not only benefiting yourself but also helping me ultimately reach millions of YA on a consistent basis. \nAs we reach each milestone together, I will be able to dedicate more\ntime and resources to this program.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, invite your\nYA relatives, friends, neighbors, co-workers and whoever else you know who can\nbenefit from this mentorship program.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank\nyou for becoming a patron! I look forward to walking the path to adulthood\nwith you!\u003cbr\u003e"
