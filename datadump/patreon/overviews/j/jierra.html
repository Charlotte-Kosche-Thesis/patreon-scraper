What if you could even say that you HELPED to make it happen.... Well.... Now you can.....\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eI am a singer, songwriter, music producer, actress, and beginning screenwriter and director. I have worked my whole life striving toward my great goals and I\u0027m getting close to breaking through to the next level \u00a0: ) \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eSo far, I\u0027ve been around the world performing (almost 4,000 live shows for over 3 Million people), I\u0027ve worked or performed with some of the top people in my industry and have been in many hallowed offices and recording studios \u00a0(I\u0027m not really a name dropper...perhaps I\u0027ll tell the whole story some day LOL). But for one reason or another, things didn\u0027t pop off in the past... Until now...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the 1st time in my life that I have the reigns... I\u0027m fully in control... and it\u0027s working \u00a0: ) In music land, I currently have interests from 4 MAJOR film companies for the possibility of using one of my recordings in any one of their films as a major theme song (fingers crossed, and may the best man win LOL). I am also in discussions with multiple companies looking to place my music in Films and TV shows. In addition to all that, I am a guest singer on 3 songs of an album that should be released in the Fall...(details soon to follow)... all this while making great strides towards my own solo recording and producing career \u00a0: )\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn acting land. I just wrote, directed and produced my first short film and right out of the gate, I already have great interest form a major film producer to possibly turn it into something more... To Be Continued\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is where you come in Patrons!!! \u00a0I\u0027ve been close to my goals before... but the developmental phases of these projects do not generate income...and even when they do, there is often a large gap of time before you have the $$$ in your hands. There is MUCH being asked of me right now to continue producing more products .... so... a bit of financial assistance is needed so that I can stay on course and provide what is being asked of me that will in the near future, provide income... but we are not quite there yet and I don\u0027t want to have to veer off and stop producing to go handle \"life\"... doing that in the past has only led to a vicious circle of get close and fall off, get close and fall off...but not this time.... I\u0027m pushing thorough to the other side this time....\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would like to provide videos for you and you can tip any amount for them \u00a0: ) \u00a0I will sing for you, provide you with songs you request, talk to you about the journey I am on and even share things with you that I won\u0027t be sharing with the broad public (private links to things in the works and chats about projects I have in the oven, etc.) In this way you will be connected to and SUPPORTING an Artist on the climb towards abundant success and happiness... And I will get there... and YOU will have helped a great deal .... You can actually set a limit on how much you want to donate per video and even set a limit for the month so that even if I\u0027m providing a lot of content, you won\u0027t ever go past $30 or $50 for example (or whatever you choose)... but you will actually only be donating for videos I provide to you \u00a0: ) \u00a0So, it\u0027s super cool... you\u0027ll be on this journey with me \u00a0: )\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet me begin by saying I appreciate you from the bottom of my heart... you allow me to continue doing what I love\u00a0xoxoxo \u00a0We will make it to the top together.... And kindly spread the word... these projects are costly and I need to survive in the meantime \u00a0: )\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany many thanks,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJierra\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n"
