In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF\u2014and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eNightmare\u003c/em\u003e is a digital horror and dark fantasy magazine. In \u003cem\u003eNightmare\u2019s\u003c/em\u003e pages, you will find all kinds of horror fiction, from zombie stories and haunted house tales, to visceral psychological horror. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach monthly issue of \n\u003cem\u003eLightspeed \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e Nightmare \u003c/em\u003econtains an assortment of fiction (9 stories in each issue of \u003cem\u003eLightspeed\u003c/em\u003e; 4 stories in each issue of \u003cem\u003eNightmare\u003c/em\u003e) and nonfiction; every issue is released first in ebook format, and then is serialized on the magazine\u0027s website throughout the month. Both magazines also offer a free story podcast the features selected stories from each issue. The ebook editions are available for sale (and subscription); the online version is free to all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eLightspeed\u003c/em\u003e is a two-time winner of the Hugo Award, and stories published by \u003cem\u003eLightspeed\u003c/em\u003e have won the Hugo Award, and been finalists for the Nebula (16 times!), World Fantasy, Stoker, Sturgeon, and Shirley Jackson Awards.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eNightmare\u003c/em\u003e stories have won the Nebula, World Fantasy, and Shirley Jackson awards and have been a finalist for the Stoker Award.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBoth have been edited by me since their inception (along with my dedicated team, of course). I\u0027m also the sole publisher of both magazines as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eAbout My Indie-Publishing Projects\u003c/h4\u003e\nIn addition to editing and publishing \n\u003cem\u003eLightspeed\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eNightmare\u003c/em\u003e, I also edit anthologies for various publishers, and edit my own science fiction and fantasy imprint for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (John Joseph Adams Books). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut sometimes I also use indie (a/k/a self-publishing) tools to publish anthologies myself, such as \u003cem\u003eHELP FUND MY ROBOT ARMY!!! and\nOther Improbable Crowdfunding Projects\u003c/em\u003e or the three books of The Apocalypse Triptych. Sometimes a project is just something I want to pursue independently, or in a couple of cases a traditional publisher published one of my books and then let it go out of print and the rights reverted to me, so I issued a new edition (as is the case with \u003cem\u003eFederations, Seeds of Change, \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e The\nWay of the Wizard\u003c/em\u003e). \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nThe magazines don\u0027t have the backing of any big companies to support them, so they really rely on reader support. Though we offer the magazines online for free, we\u0027re able to fund them by selling ebook subscriptions or website advertising. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile we have a dedicated ebook subscriber base, the vast majority of our readers consume the magazine online for free. If just 10% of our website readers became Patrons pledging just $1 a month, the magazines would be doing \n\u003cem\u003efantastically\u003c/em\u003e well. So we thought it might be useful to have an option like Patreon for readers who maybe haven\u0027t considered supporting the magazine, or who maybe don\u0027t want the ebook editions\u2014or would be glad to pay $1 a month, but not $3 (the cost of a monthly subscriber issue of \u003cem\u003eLightspeed\u003c/em\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThough \n\u003cem\u003eLightspeed\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eNightmare\u003c/em\u003e are separate entities, we decided to create a single Patreon, because it seemed like it would be more efficient to manage just one Patreon page. Plus, since I sometimes independently publish works using indie-publishing tools (as described above), we thought it would be good to have a single place where folks could come to show their support for such projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut basically, we wanted to create a Patreon where, if you enjoy my work as an editor, and you want to contribute a little something to help make it easier for me to produce more cool projects, then this is the place to do that. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve read this far and are still not sure about pledging any money to the Patreon or subscribing or the like, but still want to offer some kind of support... please post a reader review on something you loved (especially on Amazon, where they\u0027re most useful). Posting a review of any project of mine would be appreciated, but if you want to support one or both of the magazines, it would be most useful to add a review to the Kindle subscription page. (If you\u0027d like to do that, here\u0027s \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lightspeed-Magazine/dp/B004HO5TCO\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLightspeed\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s and here\u0027s \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MOMMWOE\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNightmare\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat Do I Get Out of Being a Patron?\u003c/h4\u003e\nWell, you get the satisfaction of helping to usher the creation of cool new short fiction projects into the world! Plus, the more support we get, the better we can make the magazines and compensate our authors and staff. By becoming a supporter via Patreon, you help fund our growth and continued publication of two award-winning magazines. Of course, if you\u0027re already one of our ebook subscribers (thank you!), you are already supporting us. This is for those who prefer to read the issues each month on our free websites, or wish to support our efforts more generally.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want something in return for your backing (which is totally reasonable!), please instead choose one of our (non-Patreon) ebook \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/subscribe/\"\u003esubscription\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.nightmare-magazine.com/subscribe/\"\u003eoptions\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThank You!\u003c/h4\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve read this far, thanks so much. We hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a Patron. Thanks in advance for your time. We look forward to hopefully being able to make the magazines\u2014and my other publishing endeavors\u2014even better with the support of people like you.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
