Many of my patrons will tell you that we\u0027re on a first name basis, and they know the in\u0027s and out\u0027s of whats going on with my career and life before anyone else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve truly become a community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I was cast in what is hands down my biggest career project to date: \"The Outpost,\" a fantasy television series that will air worldwide. With this comes a lot less time to focus on other facets and outlets, so I\u0027ve recently redesigned my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you\u0027re pledging toward now is an all-inclusive channel of behind the scenes communication. Patrons will continue to know updates and news before anyone else, and will have a fairly constant feed of candid photos, videos, and even live streams from my projects and happenings. This was the only change I could think of making/maintaining without being forced to close down Patreon all together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome, and thank you SO much...I can\u0027t begin to express my gratitude. I hope you enjoy the projects I am a part of, and if you decide to join our Patreon community, I hope you enjoy your time here as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my best,\u003cbr\u003eJake Stormoen"
