    "summary": "Hello! Thank you for visiting my Patreon page, I am Jonny Atma and I make video game music remixes under the project name \u0027GaMetal\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jonnyatma.com/Pictures/songicons/gamedleysip.png\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you do? What\u0027s a GaMetal? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a multi-instrumental musician of over 15 years with a passion for video game and rock/metal music.\u00a0GaMetal is my VGM project that I\u0027ve been working on for the past 7 years, and for the past 3 years has been what I\u0027ve worked on exclusively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jonnyatma.com/Pictures/songicons/smrpgsip.png\"\u003e\u00a0What is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a way for you to support the artists and creators you love by donating a set amount (as low as $1) for each video/song/creation produced. You can also set a maximum amount you\u0027d like to donate each month, for those glorious months where I can release a much larger amount of songs than usual (such as GaMetal\u0027s May Madness event, where 6-7 songs are released in a month!) and not have you end up overspending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your patronage, you will receive rewards based on your donation amount! We\u0027ll get to those in just a moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jonnyatma.com/Pictures/songicons/mdddsip.png\"\u003e\u00a0How will my donation(s) be used?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs of December 2016, I\u0027ve been able to leave my day job and devote my time to working on music, which is a dream come true. The majority of the reason I\u0027ve been able to do this is because of the support I\u0027ve received from you all here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will continue to help my projects like GaMetal further grow and develop. It gives me the time I need to work not only on more songs, but the time I need to make sure those songs sound fantastic, as well as being able to work on different types of content, such as guitar tutorial videos or acoustic songs which will come in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, to helping me pay my bills so I can continue pursuing music full time. xD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jonnyatma.com/Pictures/songicons/dscsip.png\"\u003e How will this help improve your music?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of the equipment I have is old or just plain broken, and is in need of upgrading. Pledging here will help me acquire the funds I need to replace and upgrade my equipment, which will directly result in better sounding songs, or better looking videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, as mentioned above, being able to make enough to work on music as a full time job gives me the opportunity to work on and release different types of content that people have been wanting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually it can also help me make enough to hire people to help me do certain things that I\u0027m not so good at, such as improving my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jonnyatma.com/Pictures/songicons/pokeysip.png\"\u003e\u00a0How often do you release songs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I average about 3-4 GaMetal songs a month. There will occasionally be months with more than 4 songs, but I always let everyone here on Patreon know ahead of time so they make sure their monthly limits are set properly beforehand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jonnyatma.com/Pictures/songicons/fiercesip.png\"\u003eLet\u0027s hear some GaMetal history.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always loved video game music, I remember when I was a child, I would record game music from the TV onto a cassette tape using a boombox, so I could listen to it later on my walkman. Fast forward several years later to around 2005, I recorded my first video game covers of music from the NES game Contra and the Hyrule Temple theme from Zelda II.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2009, I started a whole project dedicated to VGM called Nintendo Experienced Shred as a personal challenge to create a kickass version of the Tetris A theme. After I had about 10 songs, I posted them on Youtube to share with the world. To my surprise, people actually liked them! (I cringe listening to my older material now, as the production quality was terrible, haha.) I changed the name of the project to GaMetal, recorded and released some more of my favorite game songs along with a few requests, and people continued to like them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my major points of emphasis that I still follow to this day, was to not just do the obvious songs, for example the Mario Main Theme or Zelda Overworld Theme (we have enough remixes of those kind of songs!), but to also do a lot of songs that people don\u0027t normally remix. Some examples of these uncommon songs that I\u0027ve covered would be\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br4v2U5dKdQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDark Meta Knight\u003c/a\u003e, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGf32gMnOxQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFinal Boss theme from McDonald\u0027s Treasure Land Adventure\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSWUOQFDSa8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInterstice of the Dimension\u003c/a\u003e from La Mulana,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLjgd1lcNwA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Ultimate Show\u003c/a\u003e from Super Paper Mario, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOUq4oeVXf4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCount Canolli\u003c/a\u003e from Wario: Master of Disguise, just to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd when I do get to one of those obvious songs, I try to put some sort of unique spin on it, such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThZAn7dKrU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Legend of Mario\u003c/a\u003e, a combination of Mario and Zelda themes, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kWuW1yQ2u4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBig Mute Blue City\u003c/a\u003e, a mashup of F-Zero\u0027s two most popular tracks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the next 3 years I continued releasing GaMetal songs for fun and to improve on my recording and arranging skills. However, at the beginning of 2012 everything was brought to a halt when someone found out we were sharing the same stage name (not GaMetal, but the name I was using for myself at the time), they got a bit upset about it and trademarked the name, and had my account deleted for trademark infringement. An account with three years of thousands of earned subscribers went poof in an instant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis rattled me a good bit, and as a result I stopped doing GaMetal for a while, about a year to be exact. In 2013, I decided I had to come back with a vengeance. I practiced harder than I ever had, and completely retooled my recording process and, well, everything really. I came back under the new name Jonny Atma in April of 2013. I started releasing new material, and in a few months time I had regained the subscribers I had lost. Three years later, I now have almost 15 times the fan base I had before, and popularity is accelerating at an awesome pace.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are few things I love more in life than making music and releasing it for people to enjoy. I would love to do more. I have ideas for all sorts of other projects both GaMetal and non-GaMetal related, and now thanks to all of your generous support that I\u0027ve continued to receive from you all here on Patreon, I\u0027m able to dedicate my time to these things. That\u0027s why I ask you to become a Patron today: I want to be sure that I can continue making music and other things for you, and only you can help me make this happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e for your time and your support, \u003cstrong\u003eyou all are the best!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS. My Patreon is an ongoing campaign and I\u0027m always thinking about ways to improve it, so some additional reward tiers may be added over time!\u003cbr\u003e"
