    "summary": "Thank you so much for any contributions made to this strange adventure. Myself, my cat Tessa (who came with me to Mexico all the way from Pittsburgh), and anyone else even marginally associated with this project, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts not every day one burns down their life, packs their car full of the essentials, and moves to another country because the call of adventure and mental illness demand a change, but here we are. In Mexico. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to update about every two days, but cell service and wifi are sometimes... spotty in Mexico, so there may be the occasional lag. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are currently no videos of our travels available. Once you read a bit of \"the story so far\" you will understand why. I have managed to get into some unusual situations with people that would rather not have the strange Mestizo Americano who is already asking questions pull out a video camera. There will be video eventually, when situations allow for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also additional extra, and free, content on my Instagram account. Enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink: \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dispatches_from_the_field/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/dispatches_from_the_fie...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Its nice to be noticed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich means more updates, photos, and the occasional video from some truly strange and interesting places. Ancient ruins, haunted islands, ancient-haunted strip clubs, black market... markets, and everywhere else you or I can think might make for a good story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also won\u0027t be limited to Mexico, so there will be all sorts of weird posts from Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and all sorts of interesting places I can take my cat in Central America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will also allow me more time to pursue actual journalism down here. Not all of us are day-tripping-trust-fund-kids working as stringers and freelancers for the thrill of it. Some of us have to worry about where we live or how we survive.\u003cbr\u003e",
