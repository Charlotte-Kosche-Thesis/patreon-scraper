    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is this J1mmy guy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s me. I\u0027m that J1mmy guy. If you don\u0027t know who I am at all, well, thanks for coming to my Patreon page man. But I mean, basically... I make videos on a game called \u003cem\u003eRunescape\u003c/em\u003e. You\u0027ve probably heard of it, or played it at some point, but you\u0027re probably a normal, functioning person who realized there were other things to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut anyway, I make videos on this \u003cem\u003eRunescape\u003c/em\u003e game. And I\u0027m not talking videos like, \"Hey everyone, it\u0027s me J1mmy again, and today you\u0027re all gonna watch me play the game normally, just how you can, except you\u0027re watching me do it.\" No, absolutely not. So, let me explain what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Last Machinima Producer of Runescape\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI make Machinimas, or \"\u003cem\u003eMachine Cinema\u003c/em\u003e\" videos, which are basically mini-movies created inside the game. The \u003cem\u003eMachinima\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0wave came along in the early 2000\u0027s (if you\u0027re not familiar with it, I\u0027d google some shit like \u003cem\u003eRed vs. Blue\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eArby\u0027N\u0027Chief \u003c/em\u003ebecause you\u0027ll laugh your ass off.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMachinima videos found their way into the world of Runescape. Around 2006-2010, almost every video of Runescape was Machinima-style, with creators such as Tehnoobshow, Maxboison, Skythekid, Excl, BumBum007, and DRMMERGUY59 providing content that will go down as the most appreciated and memorable era of Runescape media. However, the videos evolved, and the Machinima-era was over. It slowly turned into what we have now: gameplay and update videos; also known as the \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003emost boring content on the face of the planet.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, I was bored, procrastinating homework, and made my own Runescape Machinima video called \"Just Some Fishing.\" It gained some attention through Reddit, and got featured on a big YouTube channel, ultimately establishing a fanbase for my channel. Over the next few years, I began providing comedy skits for my small community, and I became J1mmy, the nooby, ridiculous, unpredictable guy I am today. Machinima skits have a dear place in my heart, and it\u0027s what I love to do. It takes me out of the world for awhile, and I hope it does the same for you if you watch them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, Why Donate To Ol\u0027 J1m?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, to give you an idea, a 2-week paycheck from a part-time minimum wage job would be a much larger payout than I\u0027ve ever accumulated from YouTube since 2014. For the style of videos I produce, editing takes anywhere from 8 hours to 20 hours to edit, so I spend anywhere from \u003cstrong\u003e20--50 hours\u003c/strong\u003e a week filming, editing, voice, acting, directing, and advertising. The only reason I do this is because there\u0027s nothing else in the world that can make me as happy as producing these videos, so I\u0027ll continue to do so. However, with some extra financial support from fans, I can invest in more professional gear, expand my creative opportunities, as well as support myself as a living person who needs food to survive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this. If you decide you don\u0027t want to donate, then a \"Like\" on one of my videos is just as good. But if you \u003cstrong\u003edo\u003c/strong\u003e decide to support, then uhh... meet me at the Northeast corner of the Grand Exchange tonight behind the Spirit Tree with blue shorts and an open mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
