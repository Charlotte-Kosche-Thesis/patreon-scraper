Through my poems - both written and visual- I hope to create the space for you to pause and appreciate the artistry of the seemingly innocuous moments that come together to create your life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past 10 years I have developed my voice as a poet, publishing my work in various anthologies, compiling and illustrating self-published collections, performing on stages around Victoria and Vancouver, and facilitating poetry workshops in schools and community centers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I have grown restless of late- tired of my art taking a backseat while I focus on surviving, I want my art to take center stage and be where the majority of my time and resources are invested.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe transition between working full time and having art be a hobby, to dedicating my time to creating, and (hopefully) being able to depend on my art for income is terrifying and challenging. This is where YOU - you beautiful, kind, generous, art loving creature- can help! \u00a0Through your support here, you are enabling me to shift my focus from doing work that allows me to survive, to investing in projects that allow me, and hopefully those around me, to thrive!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a lover of evocative art, of poems that offer healing and the opportunity for growth, of the softness of springs first unfolding leaves or the low hum of summer\u0027s gracious honey bees, please consider supporting me in my work and allowing me to spread these things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003efind samples of my work at\u00a0www.hellopoetry.com/juniper-mae-gittens/ and www.facebook.com/artbyjuniper/\u003cbr\u003e"
