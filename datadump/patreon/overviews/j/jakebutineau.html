    "summary": "I\u0027m a game music composer who started making video game music discussion videos on YouTube in June 2017. I enjoyed it so much that I kept making them bi-weekly as a passion project.\u00a0Now, the videos are feeding a growing community of gamers who want to share and discuss game music - this Patreon is the next step in that growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent creation is tough. The amount of time that I pour into my videos is substantial, taking up my free time. I \u003cstrong\u003elove\u003c/strong\u003e making videos, doing live streams and The Game Music Podcast, but it\u0027s difficult to financially justify the amount of time I spend working on my content. As well, I have a huge list of games I want to feature on the channel but I find myself hoping for Steam sales so I can work within my budget.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon would allow me to focus more of my time on my YouTube channel and The Game Music Podcast without worrying about paying the bills. It would also allow me to purchase and play new games and games recommended by fans \u003cem\u003emuch quicker\u003c/em\u003e, instead of me waiting for sales. And, finally, it will allow me to dedicate more time to growing this wonderful community of game music enthusiasts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, you will be a key part in developing this community. You\u0027ll get access to monthly\u00a0live streams (similar to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/VWVPXVAz8lc?t=2h1m38s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e) and early access to my videos so you can start the discussion! At the higher tier, I\u0027ll thank you in my each of my discussion videos and you\u0027ll have access to a special\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/jEKZYkA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscord channel\u003c/a\u003e to chat and share your projects in a safe space. My goal with my content is to promote the discussion and sharing of games and music, so let\u0027s continue doing that together.\u003cbr\u003e"
