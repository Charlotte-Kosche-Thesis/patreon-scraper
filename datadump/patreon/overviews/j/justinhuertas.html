    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHI, FRIENDS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a Seattle-based actor, musician, playwright, and songwriter. My first musical LIZARD BOY world premiered at Seattle Repertory Theatre in 2015 and had its second production at San Diego\u0027s Diversionary Theatre in 2016. My second musical HOWL\u0027S MOVING CASTLE (book by Myra Platt, music and lyrics by me, adapted from the novel by Diana Wynne Jones) premiered at Seattle\u0027s Book-It Repertory Theatre in 2017. I\u0027m currently working on two other new works: LYDIA AND THE TROLL (commissioned by Seattle Repertory Theatre) and MY MOTHER IS A LAMPLIGHTER with Sara Porkalob and Kirsten deLohr Helland.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY MISSION...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eis to create space and opportunity on and off stage for people of color, womxn of color, and LGBTQIA+ friends by generating stories through theatre and music and collaboration with folks who don\u0027t often get a spot at the table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art is intersectional, and it also leans toward sci-fi/fantasy. Think LIN-MANUEL meets NEIL GAIMAN meets TINA FEY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWITH YOUR SUPPORT,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d be able to focus more of my time on creating new art and giving life to new voices. In doing so, I\u0027ll be able to generate more material (songs, plays, musicals) and reach wider audiences, Seattle, WA, and beyond. I have a lot of art to give and not a lot of time and space, so your patronage would ensure my ability to create that time and space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon, I would love to be able to fund an album of songs. More importantly, I have a lot of amazing collaborators who generously donate their time and talents, and I would love to compensate them for their incredible work. Your patronage will help me do that too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANKS FOR THE LOVE!\u003c/strong\u003e"
