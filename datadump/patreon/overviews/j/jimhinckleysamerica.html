    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eAnd so Jim Hinckley\u0027s America was launched with one simple goal - inspire adventure. Inspire adventure with a new book. Inspire adventure with photographs of the Mojave Desert at sunset. Inspire an adventure in business ownership with a Facebook live program. Inspire adventure by sharing the story of a community organizer. Inspire adventures in community revitalization with a presentation. Inspire adventure with stories of lost treasure. Inspire adventure with stories about great pie, barbecue, and cold beer.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe idea was conceived during research for a new book; \u003cem\u003eRoute 66: America\u0027s Longest Small Town. \u003c/em\u003eThis project included interviews with adventurers, visionaries,\u00a0 and countless small business owners such as Nick Adam, owner of the Ariston Cafe, a restaurant his father had started in 1924, and Connie Echols that, working with her sister, had renovated the 1936 Wagon Wheel Motel in Cuba, Missouri along Route 66\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eWith each and every discussion the vision to develop a multifaceted network that incorporated books, video, Facebook live programs, podcasts, blog posts, and other venues to inspire adventure gained clarity. Won\u0027t you join us on this grand adventure?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eShakespeare wrote the plays and sonnets that have entertained the world for centuries with the support of patrons. Henry Lovin was Jose Jerez\u0027s patron, and with a grubstake of just $16.00 he made a discovery that launched the last great gold rush in Arizona.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eI can\u0027t promise timeless literature or a gold rush in your community. However, with your patronage, with your grubstake (as little as $1.00 per month) I can write books about the inspirational people in small town America, and we can develop a community promotional video series, create specialized programs that market a community and its small businesses, assist travel journalists to ensure that a favorable and memorable impression is made when they stop in small town USA, and to help people plan unique and memorable adventures on the two lane highways.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo, who is Jim Hinckley?\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eI am the author of eighteen books and numerous feature articles on subjects as diverse as the history of highway striping and ghost towns of Route 66, heritage tourism and the back roads of Arizona. Presentations on Route 66 history, tourism as a component in economic development and community revitalization, automotive history, and the American southwest have been made internationally. I am also a member of the historic preservation committee in Kingman, Arizona, and the economic development committee for the Route 66: The Road Ahead Partnership.\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIf you would like to know more, a biographic summary is available upon request. Now, a few references.\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eMeghan Saar,\u00a0Editor at True West Magazine, \"Jim Hinckley is our go-to guy when it comes to ghost towns in the American West. His professionalism is obvious from the published books he has written on the topic, and we enjoy working with him at True West magazine.\"\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eTina Luster, Communications Manager at Sonoma County Tourism Bureau, \"Jim provided stories to me when I was editor of \"the weekender,\" a weekly arts and entertainment publication that covered the tri-state area of Nevada, Arizona, and California. \u003cbr\u003eHis love of history and automobiles made his feature stories come alive. I also had the pleasure of working with Jim on several stories. Our collaborations became adventures that still make me laugh. \u003cbr\u003eEven with all the fun, Jim\u0027s work ethic and integrity meant I was able to publish quality pieces in a timely manner. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m proud to be one of the first editors who worked with Jim. If I was in a position to work with Jim again, I would do it in an heart beat.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"462\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
