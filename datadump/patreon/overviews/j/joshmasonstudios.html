    "summary": "Hey everyone! I\u0027m a YouTuber and filmmaker from a small town in Tennessee and I love creating fun content! The film studio I run is Mason Studios and we produce everything from commercials and music videos to fan films. Lately I\u0027ve gained recognition for my cosplay highlight videos on YouTube. As most of you probably already know, creating films and videos is extremely expensive and I\u0027m often producing this content out of my own pocket. This often includes paying for things like camera equipment, lighting, crew, location fees, and all the other expenses that come with producing films. In the case of the cosplay videos, I\u0027m often attending these conventions on my own dime and they also can get very expensive when you consider travel expenses and hotel costs. For years I\u0027ve delivered content at my own expense but the films and cosplay videos have grown far too expensive for me to continue to make them without support. That\u0027s where YOU come in! With your monthly donations, we\u0027ll be able to continue making content for years to come AND you\u0027ll get to be a part of the action! Check out all the reward tiers listed below and find which tier is the one for you! If you can\u0027t donate, we understand. Even just subscribing to my YouTube channel helps! Thanks!! Love you all!"

However, we love supporting the awesome cosplayers and fans who attend the many local comic conventions and expos and this goal will allow us to continue creating videos that show off epic cosplays as well as other awesome content!",
