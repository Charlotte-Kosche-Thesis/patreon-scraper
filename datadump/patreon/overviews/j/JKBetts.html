Then fright when he flips to one of the last pages, eyes falling to the words \"I am now convinced he is responsible for the bombing\u00a0in Edinburgh\u00a0yesterday, I must find evidence and TELL SOMEONE!\" The young man\u0027s mind races and stumbles\u00a0over the edge of his mobile phone as he reaches for it in his pocket to dial 999.

As the years, and Julia\u0027s story unfold, her writing reflects a person attempting to process life in all it\u0027s facets.
