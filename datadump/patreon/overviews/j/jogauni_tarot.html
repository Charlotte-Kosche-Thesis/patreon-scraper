Patreon works by allowing you to pledge a small amount of money that will be charged recurringly every time the person you\u0027re supporting completes a work. So, in my case, if you pledge $1, you will be charged $1 every time I finish a new tarot card. You can set a monthly cap, so you don\u0027t have to worry about spending too much, and all patrons at the $0.50 level or above will have access to the patrons-only portion of my activity feed, which will contain early-release sketches and progress scans of each card as I work on it. Patrons will also be able to post to my activity feed, I think? SOMEONE TRY IT OUT AND GET BACK TO ME.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this \u0027Jogauni Tarot Deck\u0027 all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Jogauni are an invented fantasy species (of my own creation) of elemental creatures that resemble anthropomorphic canines. They are characterized by a pre-industrial aesthetic, playful color designs, and detailed established worldbuilding. I am attempting to use them to illustrate a Tarot deck\u2014one that anyone familiar with the traditional RWS symbolism should be able to pick up and use, but with its own unique take on the specific symbols and themes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, if you\u0027ve ever worked with Tarot you know that there are a lot of cards, and that some decks are more illustrated than others when it comes to the Minor Arcana. I intend to fall on the more illustrated end of this, and if you\u0027ve ever tried drawing 78 pictures in a row (79 if I decide to do a Happy Squirrel)\u00a0and having them come out with consistent quality, you know that it\u0027s no small feat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep this project in the realm of physical possibility, I\u0027m working small and with controllable media (bristol, ink, prismacolor). Each drawing is about 3x4\"; the final cards (printed through Game Crafters, most likely) will be available in both poker size (2.5x3.5\") and conventional tarot size (2.75x4.75\"). The prints offered will be ACEOs, which are the 2.5x3.5\" size.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, each card still takes several days of planning, composing, sketching, inking and coloring, and that\u0027s more time than I can afford to spend on it at the moment\u2014which is why the project originally stalled after the first eight cards. I will be using the pledges contributed by Patrons to pay for the expenses of the project and for the expenses of life. In addition to the cards themselves, I will be attaching commentary to each card and sometimes concept sketches. I will also occasionally publish broader concept work or things that relate to the project, but these will always be marked as free and you will not be charged for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin up, make a pledge, and help me keep the project alive!"
