Before they\u0027re mass distributed, you will get to read and comment on them before anyone else does. In a way, you get to help me in the editing process with your feedback. I look forward to hearing from all of you, whether it be good or bad, I can take criticism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is James K. Penn and I\u0027m a light-novel author. I\u0027ve been writing stories ever since I was 13, and before that, I played make believe a lot on the playground. I was the kid that everyone looked at funny because I never left my imagination behind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love anime. I also love manga and light-novels, and I read them as much as I can when I\u0027m not writing or doing something else, which tends to happen often. I\u0027m also a musician, music runs in my father\u0027s side of the family (writing comes from my mom\u0027s), and while I don\u0027t pursue music as a profession, it contributes to my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy camping, fishing, I love traveling, partying, dancing, and I enjoy exploring different cultures, my culture of choice in this instance being Japan and Anime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do with all my heart, and I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see my original/commercial works, check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/J.-K.-Penn/e/B0167NIPU0/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: If someone ever wants to send me a gift, make it a bottle of Glenmorangie or some Guinness.
