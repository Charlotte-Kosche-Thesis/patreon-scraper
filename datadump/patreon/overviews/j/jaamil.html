Through abstract, oblique, and alternative readings of society, I believe we can challenge these learned behaviors that prohibit us from fully seeing ourselves in each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat We Need\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eMy team and I are looking to receive ongoing support to maintain our artistic practice. Creating live and installation based performance is expensive because of material and personnel fees related to producing live events. All proceeds go to paying my awesome team of designers and performers. It will help us travel to present our ongoing European tour of #negrophobia with upcoming dates in Munich and Brussels, as well as conduct creative residencies to finish the new piece S\u00e9ancers. We are thankful for the institutional support we have received and need this push to meet our goal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
