I want to be clear here: I will make no attempt to\u00a0\u003cem\u003eanswer\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to these questions and along those lines let me make something abundantly, definitively clear: I will not claim to\u00a0\u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e any answers, nor would I be so bold as to claim I did. I am on the same journey as you. If we dig into these questions \u003cem\u003etogether\u003c/em\u003e, on a relatively level playing field, we\u0027ll find there is \u003cem\u003emuch\u003c/em\u003e to discover far beyond any so-called answers we might be striving to find. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this appeals to you, read the first public post below and then if from there you\u0027re hooked, I invite you to sign up. $2 a month as a starting level is less than you spend on practically anything these days. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I\u0027m a firm believer that you shouldn\u0027t have to pay for your truth. So lemme just throw out another definitive statement: I\u0027m not offering any truth here. What I\u0027m offering is a safe space for inquiry, for questions that lead to more questions. Conclusions are a closed door. They are essentially merely fast tracks to intellectual and spiritual suicide. I\u0027m offering everyone here what I\u0027ve been working to provide for myself: an\u00a0escape from the known. \u003cbr\u003e"
