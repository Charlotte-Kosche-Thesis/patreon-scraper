Now that YouTube\u0027s out of the way, let\u0027s talk about writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, so I write stuff and I am currently working on two series of books\u00a0at the moment called \"The Veil\u0027s Magic\" Series and \"Jules Galloway\" Series, both are surrounded by the fantasy sort of theme except I\u0027m planning on The Veil\u0027s Magic to be a Teen sort of genre that works up to be a Young Adult sort of genre, while Jules Galloway is purely for Young Adults and has some dark themes. Also from time to time I write short stories that you can find on my Wattpad or Writing Tumblr blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s mainly it for as far as what I do, and I won\u0027t lie, I don\u0027t do anything revolutionary with my life, I just sit down, write, read, and record videos for the internet and it\u0027s as simple as that. However, if you want even more of my content, then you can by giving at least one dollar a month, and as far as larger amounts, just remember this, any amount counts, you could give me one dollar, you could give me a hundred, I\u0027ll still be grateful and most likely thank you three million times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re all awesome and wonderful people, whether you chose to become a Patron or not, wanna know how I know? You took time to read this, you took time out of your day that you\u0027ll never get back, and you choose to spend that time on reading my Patreon page, and that alone is something to me, and you can\u0027t convince me other wise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you all have a great day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eJessie Wilhelm\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLINKS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube:\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuY2eEoGnBfS5562aWcj3ug\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuY2eEoGnBfS5562aWcj3ug\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Personal Tumblr: \u003ca href=\"http://jmw98.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://jmw98.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Writing Tumblr Blog: \u003ca href=\"http://jessiemw14.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://jessiemw14.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Writing References Tumblr: \u003ca href=\"http://wordsnamesnstuff.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://wordsnamesnstuff.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Facebook: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/jmw.wilhelm\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/jmw.wilhelm\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Twitch: \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/jessiemw14/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitch.tv/jessiemw14/profile\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Twitter: \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/JessieMW14\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://twitter.com/JessieMW14\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmail (Business Only): \u003ca href=\"mailto:jessiemw14@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ejessiemw14@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeviantArt: \u003ca href=\"http://jmw14.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://jmw14.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWattpad: \u003ca href=\"http://www.wattpad.com/user/JessieMW14\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.wattpad.com/user/JessieMW14\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
