    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to my Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019m Jewelia (or Iulia, on my \u2018real\u2019 name).\u00a0I\u0027m an independent singer-songwriter who makes Youtube videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMY STORY\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eFour years ago, I moved to the UK to pursue my music and study audio production, so I could become better at recording and producing my own music. I was lucky enough to have access to great facilities and to be able to use the university studios, microphones, cameras, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFast forward to four years later. I\u2019ve just graduated, which means the access to all these facilities IS NOW GONE. No more studio time, no more nice cameras, no more free recordings of grand pianos or orchestral instruments and all that, which you might have seen in my older videos. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you can probably imagine, all those things are normally really expensive and I was very lucky to be able to do them with little or no budget at all!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I reached a time when, if I want to be able to keep making music like I did in the past, I have to ask YOU guys for help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause, let\u2019s face it: if you\u2019ve been following my music and or even if you\u2019re new to it but you enjoy it, \n\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u2019re the only ones who care about it\u003c/strong\u003e! You\u2019re the ones who who have the power to make it last and to turn music into something sustainable for me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd here\u2019s where Patreon comes in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe way Patreon works is like a subscription service; where, you can choose the amount that you want to sponsor me with on monthly basis, or per thing I make. Anything, from $1/month to higher, is hugely helpful.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDepending on how much you pledge, there are different rewards you can get, from hanging out with me on Skype, to free downloads, getting your name in the credits of my videos or even have a song written especially for you. You can find them all below.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can cancel at any time!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY GIVE ME YOUR MONEY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support, not only I can keep doing what I\u2019m doing, but I can do it better and more often! \n\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting, practicing, recording, arranging, editing, mixing, shooting videos, editing them, promoting them in social media (which is an important part of this music business thing, for which I don\u2019t always have time) - all these, when done by one person, take hours and hours of work.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically, the more help I get from you, the more time I will have to spend on making music!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your help:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can get my own equipment. For example, right now I need a better camera and some lights. A better microphone at some point would be in order, but that can wait.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can shoot videos in nicer locations and actually spend some budget on props, travelling, and all that, to give you better and more and more professionally sounding and looking content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can tour, play more gigs and get a full band to support me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can be bolder and more ambitious about my creative projects; for example, I would like to release my debut album as a part of bigger package, involving a\u00a0\u00a0book and a set of twelve paintings, all connected to the story told in the book and the album. More details on this later.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLast, but not least, I\u2019ll be able to survive and make music without worrying (that much) about tomorrow.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you\u0027re able to offer any support, it would be greatly appreciated! \n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery little help will make a difference!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for any support you can offer if you decide to, and of course, for being my audience. I\u2019m looking forward to knowing you better and hopefully we can all have fun on this music-making adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKC5OYK2wHs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds9yrx0H4rA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXJNq4dlhrU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oag9PSONkpw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
