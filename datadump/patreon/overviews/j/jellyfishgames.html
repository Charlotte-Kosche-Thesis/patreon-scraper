We recently released our first title to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jellyfishgames.itch.io/astrobase-command\"\u003eitch.io\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s currently in Closed Alpha, which means \u003cstrong\u003eyou can buy and play it right now\u003c/strong\u003e but you can\u0027t publish or otherwise distribute screenshots or footage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWe love games!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe really do! We love games so much so that it\u0027s what what we do all day! We see the potential for a future where game developers get to focus on making the most innovative and imaginative games they can.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe reality is however that we are humans, and it turns out that humans need to eat AND pay rent-- every month! As you might imagine this incentivizes\u00a0developers to make games that make money over making something new and interesting (and untested in the market). In our opinion, this needs to change! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere is your chance to help us make this the ultimate timeline using the next generation of crowd funding, Patreon!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re a team of four with decades of industry experience between us. By keeping the team small and working from home (in 4 different cities, no less!), we keep our costs as low as they can go. Unfortunately, the peaks-and-valleys nature of game sales or occasional contracts when times are tight make it difficult to make the kinds of long-term plans needed for true innovation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy spreading out the money we receive from our supporters into small recurring pledges, we can plan further into the future at the cost of a coffee or slice of pizza, while remaining accountable to our promises to you in the long-term.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis allows us greater creative freedom and works as an example to help drive the change we want to see in game development.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the moment, your pledges will support the continued development of Astrobase Command. Our first reward is access to the Astrobase Command novel, a parallel creative endeavour Max has undertaken in his spare time to help explore Astrobase\u0027s storytelling possibilities.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/branching-out-in-15907490\"\u003eRead all about it here\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have more rewards in the works, too, so our thanks for your support will continue to evolve and improve as time goes on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf the Patreon goes as well as we think it will, we want to use it as a springboard for a whole host of other creative ideas by us and in collaboration with other creators.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you believe what we\u0027re doing to be the right thing, consider becoming a patron!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eCan I just buy your game?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSure!
