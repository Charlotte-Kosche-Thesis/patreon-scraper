My focus is to inform and entertain, creating a combination of nerf news videos every week, gameplay videos, and gear reviews. Unfortunately a lack of income can be limiting at times, as I currently can\u0027t work a regular job due to my health issues. I want to continue to grow and provide better and better videos for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://blastertagassociation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9737-768x512.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those that want to support the growth of the channel through patreon, thank you. For those that may not be able to or aren\u0027t interested, thank you for just being a part of the channel and community we\u0027re building, I never want people to feel obligated to support the channel monetarily. I have also tried to focus the patron tiers to give the best value I can for a low amount. I would rather more people be involved for less, instead of making this feel exclusionary by pricing rewards high.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout you the channel is nothing, your support will help me invest in the channel, whether it\u0027s equipment, blasters to review, travel expenses, or other related expenses, we\u0027ll be able to do more because of you. Thank you for your time, and your continued support in the growth of not only our channel, but the community as a whole, whether you choose to become a patron or not.\u003cbr\u003e"
