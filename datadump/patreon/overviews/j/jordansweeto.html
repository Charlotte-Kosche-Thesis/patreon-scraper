If you\u0027re reading this you most likely already watch some of my videos on Youtube but here\u0027s a quick overview!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making Youtube videos in 2009... I can\u0027t believe that was 7 years ago! It\u0027s always been hard for me to make time for every passion I want to pursue seeing as I have so many! \u003cbr\u003eThough music has always been at the core of what I do on Youtube I also have other interests that I\u0027m very passionate about, to the point of making two new channels dedicated to those passions, those being Animation and Gaming. It is important to me to try my best to maintain all 3 of my channels and I really feel like that has paid off and I\u0027m extremely grateful to everyone who watches anyof my content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seriously love Youtube because it has given me the freedom to pursue any creative direction I have been able to set my eyes on. Being able to do this and be apart of such an incredible community I like to call \u003cstrong\u003eSweetos \u003c/strong\u003emakes me happier than I can even say. I\u0027ve been able to make Youtube my job which I can\u0027t thank you all enough for. A career is such a huge chunk of one\u0027s life and for me to be loving it as much as I do.. I can\u0027t express how grateful I am for that as I am a person who needs to be creative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhy Patreon though?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Youtube \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e my job and I\u0027ve been able to get to the point where I can support myself relatively well due to it!\u003cbr\u003eWith that being said, in the past I\u0027ve had to hold back on the amount of music I had been able to record/release due to the cost of recording time, music videos, etc. I hate that stuff like that is determined by something like money but that\u0027s just how the world works. This year I want to start getting out \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e music at a much faster rate. In the past new releases from me have been every half a year or so.. which just isn\u0027t what I want! I want you guys to enjoy MORE of the music I have been writing but have been unable to release realistically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also noticed that its getting harder for Youtuber\u0027s to make a living off of ad revenue alone. Not just for me but also for other creators that I\u0027m friends with. A lot of them have turned to Patreon and on top of it really helping them stay secured financially they\u0027ve told me that it\u0027s a \u003cstrong\u003ereally\u003c/strong\u003e good way of being \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e involved with their supporters via the special rewards/perks they\u0027re able to offer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhy would I want to support Jordan Sweeto on here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to release more quality content, especially music related (which by far is the most expensive for me).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose not to support me on here that is 100% fine and it doesn\u0027t make you any less important to me, I know how annoying money can be! I will \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e be restricting any public content, the amount of videos I release on my 3 Youtube Channels won\u0027t change one bit because of this Patreon, so there\u0027s no need to worry! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who \u003cstrong\u003eDO\u003c/strong\u003e really want to support me and can part with a dollar or two a month, it would seriously help me ensure I could keep my new music coming at a much steadier rate!\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention it would help me overall with keeping Youtube as my 100% main focus, this means I can keep dedicating most of my time to making videos, music, animations, and much more content for you every single day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven as little as $1 a month will help me a lot towards becoming a Youtuber with BETTER and more consistent content for everyone. Whether you choose to support me on here as well or just on my Youtube Channels please know I appreciate \u003cstrong\u003eeveryone\u0027s\u003c/strong\u003e support from the bottom of my heart. Thanks Sweetos!\u003cbr\u003e"
