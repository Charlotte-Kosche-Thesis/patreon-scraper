    "summary": "Shalom my friends,\u003cbr\u003e\nWelcome to my Patreon page. Here on the JM Truth Homestead we are trying to get back to a healthier way of living. I am a disabled military veteran. After 12 years in the US Army serving as a combat medic in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, I was Honorably discharged. I went back into the work force and after beating my head against that wall for a while decided to go back to school. \u00a0I create instructional and educational videos. I was blessed with some outstanding video equipment during my time pursuing a higher education in Film Production and Instructional Design. This page is not about upgrading my equipment. This is about sharing knowledge in the form of instructional videos.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy family and I have recently moved to the Bitterroot Valley, Montana, where we homeschool our children and are transforming the property we live on into a homestead. We are interested in sharing that experience with you as well as many of the other dreams and goals we want to share with the community. One of those is the ability to grow and give away free food. Yes you heard me correctly, but I will explain more of that a little later.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA few of our goals are a shed, a chicken coop and greenhouse. I am a firm believer in the Back to Eden method of organic growing as established by Paul Gouchi.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAfter obtaining my Masters Degree it became a challenge to find work. I decided to take a chance and share my knowledge and education with the world. This is a way for Jackie (my wife) and I to continue to homeschool our children and share what our Creator has done for us. Please consider joining and supporting us, till next time my friends, SHALOM.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
