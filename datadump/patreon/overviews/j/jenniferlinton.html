    "summary": "One of the earliest and most basic stop-motion techniques is the \"paper cutout\" which, as the name suggests, involves drawings or prints on paper that are cut out and manipulated to simulate movement. The high degree of artifice and theatricality associated with the paper cutout makes this technique particularly well suited to animations which are fantastic, dreamlike and surreal. I love to make paper cutout animation, as well as to watch them. Maybe you do, too. With your financial support, me \u0026amp; my team can create independent films using this beautiful, elegant, and -- in the age of CGI, increasingly rare -- stop-motion technique. With your help, we can keep this artform alive and relevant.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
