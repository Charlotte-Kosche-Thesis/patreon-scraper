    "summary": "I\u0027ve been writing stories about busty sluts busting nuts for years, with the majority of my 30+ stories published in their entirety free of charge at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ballbustingstories.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eballbustingstories.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0It\u00a0is important to me that I be able to continue to make this content available for free as I know there are those without the money to spend on my work, but what I\u0027m hoping is that there are a few of you out there who are quite willing to pay for the privilege of receiving updates more regularly and that\u0027s where my\u00a0Patreon page comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.\u003c/strong\u003e I write lots, but I write slow, which means for the stories I charge money for I usually have to hold back all of the content until I\u0027m entirely finished. Through Patreon I can publish regular chapters (upwards of 3000 words) for those who would like to pay for the privilege of this early access.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. \u003c/strong\u003eI spend a bit of money each month supporting the ball-busting community and other content creators I love. This content fuels my imagination and helps me write the stories you love so it would be nice to be able to subsidise this and put more money back into the community we all love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.\u003c/strong\u003e You get to not only read, but participate in the writing of my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimer:\u003c/strong\u003e The money will not make me write more regularly... okay, it might, but if you know me you know that I like to take my time crafting my stories and hopefully you appreciate that in the final work. Because of this I am not asking for a monthly donation - \u003cstrong\u003eI will only charge when I release a chapter\u003c/strong\u003e of writing and as you also know - my chapters are usually pretty huge so you can be sure you\u0027ll get your money\u0027s worth!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I just want to say this is not a plea for money - I make a good living - so only support me if you have the cash. I will still be selling the finished stories - you\u0027ll just have to wait until they\u0027re done."
