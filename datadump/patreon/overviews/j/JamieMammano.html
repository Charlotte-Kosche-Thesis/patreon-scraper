    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Jamie. As an Equine Photographer, Graphic Designer, Illustrator, Painter, Sculptor... I\u0027m a Jane of all mad-art-horsey-love and trying to further my craft... I am here on Patreon because I believe that there are great possibilities to be had when an artist and their fans, followers and community are brought together. My hope is that I can offer some new and exciting things for those who wish to become part of this journey. I will be adding Original Paintings, Drawings and Sculpts to this page as I am able.\u003cbr\u003eMy intention is to create art that makes people fall in love with life, horses... I want them to taste the incredible thrill I feel, in the moment the image is captured, or my vision comes to life... I want to create imagery and designs that speaks to people, allowing them a brief moment to gasp and smile in awe. I am incredibly blessed in this life with the talents I have been given and I am excited to share them with you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowdfunding site, a lot like Kickstarter... But, instead of pledging large sums of money to fund a project with an \"End Date\", you make small, monthly contributions to a particular Artist/Creator, whose work you LOVE, so they can continue to produce and thrive in their creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating, you are giving the gift of financial security, while gaining membership \u0026amp; discounts on my work, this is both for supporters AND Investors. Whether you are donating to support and enjoy my work, or investing to access discounts and sales for your collection, you will be allowing me the peace of mind, of stability, which for an Artist, is difficult at best to attain. And I am ever grateful for your patronage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
