We wanted our podcast to kick ass. So we put a lot of care into our sound quality, music, segment intros, web design, and podcast art. And ever since, we routinely spend a lot of time doing things like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnalyzing the episodes and movies we cover\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGiving insightful, opinionated analysis\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eResearching behind-the-scenes info\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCollecting and answering your feedback\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCurating interesting news\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThrowing fun contests with great prizes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThinking up creative segments and bits\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArming ourselves for the impending zombie apocalypse (rarrr!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersuading celebrity guests to come on and coming up with interesting, in-depth questions to ask them\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMeticulously editing each podcast to keep it tight\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBringing in other talented, fun cohosts and segment hosts like Melissa Hutchison, Duncan, Grace, and Mr. Blahg to keep things fresh and varied.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, I know you guys have noticed that Karen and I value genuineness, in how we present ourselves and even in our advertising. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even more, we value community! We love interacting with you guys and bringing you into the show through your calls and emails, and getting to meet a lot of you at events.

Now we do. If you like what we do and would feel good supporting us, here you go. Thank you! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut\u00a0why start a Patreon now? Well, I\u0027m at a crossroads. I love podcasting, but with the increasing demands of my day job and a baby on the way, I\u0027m probably going to have to do less of it. But what I\u0027d \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e like\u00a0to do is quit my day job and do MORE podcasting!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough advertising and Walker Stalker Con I\u0027m making almost half of what I need to make this a full time job.

I\u0027ll keep podcasting about some of the best shows on TV, of which I still hold The Walking Dead to be one, and maybe I\u0027ll even throw you a curveball and start an additional podcast about something completely different.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what it will take, along with advertising $$ and WSC $$, for me to be able to continue podcasting as a career. If we don\u0027t reach this amount, I\u0027ll need to scale back my podcasting and find a new day job to pay the billz. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yes, that means the very time-intensive Walking Dead \u0027Cast may come to an end.",
