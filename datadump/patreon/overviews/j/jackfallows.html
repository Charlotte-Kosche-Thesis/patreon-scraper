Back in March 2017, however, I started hands-down the most ambitious self-publishing project of my 16+ years making small press comics, zines, music and games; this project is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cryptogrampuzzlepost.tumblr.com\"\u003eCryptogram Puzzle Post\u003c/a\u003e, and it\u0027s a monthly puzzle story inspired by witchcraft and alchemy. The issues follow a young witch called Anna as she navigates the mysteries of a world not unlike our own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month I write, design and illustrate a new envelope filled with pages of codes, riddles, ciphers, maps, spells, illusions and brain-teasers. It takes a massive amount of time and work to put together but I come from the DIY-or-die school of thought and retaining creative control of every meticulous aspect of this quickly expanding project is also one of the most rewarding aspects of putting everything together. In that way, platforms like these are so valuable to creative communities everywhere who want to be making and enjoying art at its most honest and least compromised.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been completely humbled by the support I\u0027ve received for the project so far and I\u0027m very excited to have its second year underway. The hope is that I can build even more momentum and expand the parameters to include new and exciting things as the months go on - a task made so much easier by your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this page is a chance to give (and get) a little extra outside of the main series. I\u0027ll be posting process pictures/videos, links to resources I\u0027ve used for reference and inspiration, news on future plans, extra tid-bits and exclusive giveaways with you all. This is your chance to peek behind the curtain and see what it\u0027s like to spend your days as the sole creator of this many-armed beast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe page will be updated at least once monthly and there are a number of different rewards available depending on what you\u0027d like to pledge; and however much that may be, thank you so much in advance. I really couldn\u0027t do this without you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Jack Fallows"

And I\u0027m doing it while also raising a baby!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of this, as the overseas readership grows, so too do the number of deliveries that go missing or arrive much later than their UK counterparts. This means some of the people wanting to group-solve the puzzles online are only joining the conversation once it\u0027s over and sometimes aren\u0027t getting a month\u0027s issue until the start of the following month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main reasons for this is that, in an effort to keep the project as accessible as possible, I have only been charging for a Standard Airmail service thus far. This means packages aren\u0027t tracked and can take anywhere up to 2-3 weeks to arrive. A tracked option has now been added to the website but this means bowing to the hefty pricing of Royal Mail for the time being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Solution\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can reach this goal, I will be able to pay someone to help me out each month with the very time-consuming administrative side of the project so I can focus on the creative work and get the issues completed and delivered in a much more timely fashion. If this is successful, there is even scope to stagger deliveries so that everyone should receive their subscriptions at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money will also allow me to approach overseas distributors about handling shipping so that loss and delay are both less common and more easily rectified should they occur. Above and beyond this, a regular source of income is truly invaluable for anyone doing freelance work and will create a foundation that will tangibly strengthen the overall project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, thank you so much for your ongoing support.
