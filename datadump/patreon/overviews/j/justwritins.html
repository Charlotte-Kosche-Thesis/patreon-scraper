Except while writing is what I love to do probably more than anything else in the world, it often has to take a backseat to Real Life and Real Life Work, especially my big projects. I write a lot of stuff for free and put it out in the world simply because I want to share it. I\u0027ve written thousands of words in fanworks, which you can view absolutely for free\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://justwritins.tumblr.com/tagged/justwritins+writes+thing\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/sinspiration/works\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0I also do have a few things\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://aidanwayne.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eactually published\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo what?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell!

I have spent hours and hours writing loads and loads for fandom, and I have put it all up for free. And I\u0027ll keep doing that; every fanwork that goes up here will eventually be posted publically too. This patreon has never been about someone paying me for fan creations (although I do have to ask, what\u0027s the difference between an artist selling fanwork and a writer doing the same thing?). It\u0027s about me providing something for free, happily, and giving my audience a way to maybe say thank you for that, if they like what I\u0027ve done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay fine. And the original stuff?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eMy original stuff! I\u0027m published with a few different indie presses (\u003ca href=\"https://aidanwayne.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eagain, all my original, published work can be found here\u003c/a\u003e) and I\u0027m always looking to get more of my original ideas out there into the world. Being a patron helps to support me in this endeavor! The more you read and share and support what I do, the more I am able to produce it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
