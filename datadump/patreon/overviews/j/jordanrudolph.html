With your support, I\u0027ll be able to upgrade my sound and recording equipment and focus more solely on my craft, as well as record a professional demo reel. Currently I\u0027m working a full-time job as a nanny to pay the bills, and obviously I want to get out of that and into my true dream career! While I don\u0027t expect my Patreon to support me entirely, I believe it will help me tremendously in reaching my goals and help in paving the way to become a professional voice actor. And with your help, in the future I\u0027ll also have the opportunity to take classes with seasoned actors and producers to further my education in the field.
