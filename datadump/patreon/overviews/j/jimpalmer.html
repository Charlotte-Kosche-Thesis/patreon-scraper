(The Short Version)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am writing this book to make the case that building an ever-advancing, flourishing and just civilization is possible on the merits of being human. If that sounds too simplistic, it\u0027s because we have not done our due diligence to discover and exploit all that being human means. My own excuse for not having done this until now is that I was heavily invested in the path of religion, which taught me that being human is a curse.\u00a0I\u00a0have published five books about my journey out of religion, which was not a cakewalk for a person with a\u00a0postgraduate Theology degree, successful career as a professional minister and public religious figure. In addition to my books, I speak and lead workshops about leaving and life after religion, and cultivating non-religious spirituality. I\u00a0have created other resources and programs, and have a counseling practice that supports and guides people in recovering from the damage of religion and toxic religious indoctrination. I have come to the place in my own journey where I believe that our world is not in need of more religion or even better religion, but a new human renaissance. I have explored current secular and non-religious efforts and often found them lacking, incoherent and ineffective. I made a personal investment of myself in becoming a Humanist Chaplain, certified and endorsed by the American Humanist Association, and I\u0027m the Co-Founder of the Nashville Humanist Association. My desire and goal with this book is to appeal to the better angels of our nature, evoke the vigor of the human spirit, and call forth the unique characteristics of our human species to the root causes of human and planetary suffering and aids the flourishing of all living things.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I writing this book?

But then \n\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ea\ncrisis of faith\n\u003c/strong\u003e compelled me to leave my religious life behind. That\u2019s when I\nstarted writing and have published\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jim-Palmer/e/B001JSBR04\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efive books\u003c/a\u003e to date.

In addition to writing,\nspeaking and my spiritual direction practice, I teach as an adjunct professor\nin the areas of Ethics and Comparative Religion. I am a \n\u003cstrong\u003ehuman rights activist\u003c/strong\u003e\nwho traveled abroad with an international human rights organization, witnessing\nfirsthand the exploitation and abuse of children through forced child\nprostitution and child slave labor.

Regardless of one\u0027s religious, spiritual or\nphilosophical background, I believe all people can find common ground and\ngoodwill in their shared humanity, to work together in creating a more peaceful\nand just world. I hope my books encourage,\ninspire, educate and challenge people to reflect more deeply about what it\nmeans to be human and being one human family together.

In\nmany cases this \u201ctypical religious thinking\u201d isn\u2019t even an accurate reflection\nof the deepest truths contained in these religious traditions themselves. Today\nthere are many people who are \n\t\u003cstrong\u003espiritual but not religious\u003c/strong\u003e, value a free and responsible\nsearch for truth and meaning, want to build a peaceful and just world for all, and respects the interdependent web of all existence. The\nbook I am currently writing is meant to fan the flames of these sentiments in\nthe hearts of many people today. It is my conviction that our common humanity is the way out of whatever divides us as human beings, and the path forward for building a world that works for everyone.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\nThe most debilitating notion in\nmost religious narratives is that human beings are inherently bad.  Synonyms for the word bad are quite bleak \u2013\nunsatisfactory, defective, inadequate, unacceptable, defective, inferior,\nsubstandard, deficient. This is how many people consciously or unconsciously think\nabout themselves, and what drives what they do. People rarely hear and\ninternalize the message that being human is inherently good and how the path\nfor wholeness and well-being stems from a blossoming of one\u2019s humanity, not a\ndenial of it. \n\u003cstrong\u003eOur\u00a0humanity is not a problem\u003c/strong\u003e to manage, a condition in need of forgiveness,\nor an obstacle to overcome. Our challenge is not escaping our\nhumanity but fully embracing it. And that\u2019s what this new book is about. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14203306_10153845538265592_8506384035212541714_n.jpg?oh=ca5cc29a03ce05b1b044fc54310e6690\u0026amp;oe=5B42A982\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not easy. Becoming and being fully human is not for the faint of heart. Most people have learned to deny, judge, mistrust, vilify, hide, and repress their humanity. I hope this book inspires, uncovers, revives, challenges, awakens, confronts, evokes, heals, liberates, deepens, expands, and calls forth our humanness.\u00a0It includes: unlearning certain things we\npicked up through religion; seeing ourselves and others with different eyes; walking\nthrough this world with more love, compassion and courageous solidarity; new\nways of approaching life\u2019s biggest questions; and taking on new ways of being\nthat inspire and fulfill us.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter publishing my first books with a\nmajor publishing house, \n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ve decided to\u00a0independently\npublish\n\u003c/strong\u003e with the support of my reading audience and social media friends.\nThis feels much more organic to me, and I find the process much more enjoyable,\ncreative, dynamic and worthwhile.
