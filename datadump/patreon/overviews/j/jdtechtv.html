As you know, I make high quality technology and gadget reviews on YouTube with that extra bit of humor you want. My channel started as a part-time hobby but has grown into a passionate job. The channel is growing more and more every day and nothing makes me happier than to expand my audience and be able to give back to the JDTechTV fam. In order to do this full-time comfortably with all my attention, I am going to need a little extra support from some of the best fans. In return for your generous donation, you will be rewarded special perks that every day viewers of my channel will not receive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ePatreon is the best way to directly support me and the channel. YouTube has \"Fan Funding,\" but it is rarely utilized and YouTube takes a certain percentage out. How dare they, right?!. These donations on Patreon go directly to the source of all of this JDTechTV goodness you so love! Through your kindness and generosity I am able to commit more time to the people that matter the most. You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of the amount of donations I receive, I will always give 110% into making the best content for you all. This is more than a hobby, it\u0027s a passion, and you\u0027ll get the best I can do. Any amount is appreciated, and because of you, my channel has the opportunity to expand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you :)\u003c/div\u003e"

This will not only be a space for me, but also a space for other creators in the Central Florida area to come and film and collaborate as well. This would start a larger community and network for YouTubers to grow and prosper across the platform. This would be the ultimate collab station. It would be for creators and fans alike to come and work at as well as visit. Hosting events and live podcasts at the JDTechTV studio would most certainly be a normal thing.\u00a0",
