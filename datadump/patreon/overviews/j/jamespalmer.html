    "summary": "Hi there. My name is James Palmer. I\u0027m an award-nominated writer of science fiction and pulp adventure. My work has been published by \u003cstrong\u003eFalstaff Books\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eAirship 27\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ePro Se Productions\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and \u003cstrong\u003eWhite Rocket Books\u003c/strong\u003e. My articles, columns and book reviews have appeared in \u003cstrong\u003eStrange Horizons\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Internet Review of Science Fiction\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eTangent Online\u003c/strong\u003e, among others. But what I enjoy most in this world is creating worlds and telling stories. Stories about characters stuck in strange circumstances, and how they come out the other end a hero.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I am a proud hybrid/indie author, which means that I work with publishers (mostly small press right now) and publish stuff myself through my own imprint, \u003cstrong\u003eMechanoid Press\u003c/strong\u003e. But I\u0027m not writing full time and I\u0027d like to be. I have so many ideas for stories, novellas and novels that I don\u0027t have time to get to because I\u0027m busy doing things that will earn money right now versus some time in the future. I\u0027m a fast writer, but things like book covers and editing cost money. Not to mention stuff like web hosting and advertising.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not asking for you to finance my lifestyle. Everything I earn from your support \u003cstrong\u003ewill go 100% into my writing business\u003c/strong\u003e, and help me create even more stories and novels you will love. I want to write more. More stories, move novellas, more novels, more everything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Will Do With Your Contributions\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore Books! \u003c/strong\u003eI will write more and create more e-books just for my Patreon supporters. I\u0027d love to write monthly short stories just for my patrons. You\u0027ll get exclusive access to stuff months before anyone else, and I\u0027ll have even more content to turn into books later on. It\u0027s a win-win.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese books will have really nice covers, and will be available in more formats, like hardcover. And you\u0027ll get em before anyone else. How cool is that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAttend More Conventions\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0going to cons, but they are expensive. I\u0027m only able to attend 2-4 shows per year, and they\u0027re all local. I\u0027d like to expand my reach, and maybe make it to one of your favorites. But that takes gas and hotel money. With your patronage I could make it to some out of state shows to offer my humble wares.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in this for the long haul, and I\u0027d love to do many more things later on down the road--host a space opera podcast, write screenplays--but this more than covers the basics for now. Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon page. I hope you will become one of my patrons. I promise you won\u0027t regret it. If there\u0027s any reward or something else you\u0027d \u003cem\u003elike\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to see from me, shoot me an e-mail at jamespalmerbooks AT gmail.com.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting."
