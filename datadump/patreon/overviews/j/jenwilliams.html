I\u2019m a writer from London,\nresponsible for chunky fantasy books such as \u003cem\u003eThe Copper Promise\u003c/em\u003e, the first book\nin the Copper Cat trilogy, and \u003cem\u003eThe Ninth Rain\u003c/em\u003e, the opening volume in The\nWinnowing Flame series. If you\u2019re here, you probably know me through those\nbooks \u2013 or, you might know me from twitter, where I chatter a lot about video\ngames, cartoons, the horror of my commute, stuff like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 224, 236);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sennydreadful.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CopperPromise_visual.jpg-198x300.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sennydreadful.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheCopperPromise-144dpi-198x300.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI\u2019m hoping this Patreon could go some way to supporting my\nfiction writing, while also giving readers access to both extra story content\nand an insight into the whole writing process. When writing epic fantasy, you\ntend to end up with assorted bits and bobs that are useful for the writer to\nknow, but can\u2019t really go in the book due to timing and pacing issues. But\nthey\u2019re still kind of fun \u2013 like DVD extras I suppose. And they can give\ninsights into the books that could be pretty revealing. When did Wydrin first\npick up a sword, for example? What exactly did Sebastian do while he was a\nknight? What was Frith\u2019s relationship actually like with his brothers? \u003cem\u003eThe\nCopper Cat Correspondence\u003c/em\u003e is my way of filling in back-story, deepening the\nreader\u2019s experience of the books, and basically giving you the juicy gossip on\nthe characters. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut I\u2019ve already\nbought all your books! Why should I give you more money?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, THANK\nYOU SO MUCH! Secondly, of course there\u2019s no obligation to support me this way,\nand if you want to enjoy the books as they are with no extras, that\u2019s totally\ncool. The Patreon offers extra bits and bobs if you would like them, and a\ncloser look at the life of a fantasy writer in London.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you would like to go ahead and support me, remember you\ncan always drop out or change your level at any time \u2013 I know very well\nhow circumstances change and things can get a little tighter. I am hugely\nthankful for every bit of support, you wonderful people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eJoin me at the tavern\nof your choice, and SINK A PINT OF MEAD (or something more sensible)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere is a quick rundown of the two main things I\u2019m offering,\nwith some little notes on the higher level options.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e$1 level \u2013 The Hands\nof Fate tavern\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatrons at this tavern \u2013 the sort of tavern where deals are\ndone and quests are planned \u2013 have access to a fortnightly newsletter post. As\nwell as all possible news on my books and general stuff on writing (release\ndates, events, covers, writing tips, convention diaries and so on) this will\nalso include more idiosyncratic items, such as my adventures on the bus,\nreports on the best pubs in London, what I\u2019m reading at the moment and entirely\nrandom Top Fives \u2013 Top Five things that annoyed me this Thursday, Top Five\nLeotard Wearers in 80s Cartoons, and so on. Also photos of my cat. Think of it\nas a wild expansion of my twitter feed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e$5 level \u2013 The Scurvy\nLemon tavern\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSubscribers propping up the bar in The Scurvy Lemon have\naccess to \u003cem\u003eThe Copper Cat Correspondence\u003c/em\u003e post (and the fortnightly newsletter). Once\na month I will post a letter, or even a series of letters, from the characters\nof the Copper Cat novels, as well as journal entries from Lady Vincenza\n\u2018Vintage\u2019 de Grazon from \u003cem\u003eThe Ninth Rain\u003c/em\u003e. Want to read Frith\u2019s complaint\nletters? Wydrin\u2019s bar bill? Sebastian\u2019s poetry? Over time, you may see broader\nstories evolving between the lines\u2026 If you would like extra glimpses into the\nlives of these characters, this is the tavern for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe fancy taverns\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are a handful of higher levels for those people who a)\nare impossibly generous souls, b) probably saints of some sort and c) would\nlike to receive physical things through the post. There are signed books\navailable (signed meaning personalized and covered in dragons, probably),\nspecial handwritten versions of \u003cem\u003eCopper Cat Correspondence\u003c/em\u003e with authentically\naged-looking paper and doodles from the Copper Cat herself, as well as special\noriginal artworks. These will be a one off pieces made specially for patrons \u2013\nI did study illustration at art college and I am reasonably good at drawing\nstuff, so it might not be enormously terrible. Whatever it is, it will\ndefinitely be unique, and signed by me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://sennydreadful.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fairy1-300x289.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sennydreadful.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wolfnew-300x290.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eIf\nyou\u2019re still here reading this \u2013 thank you.
