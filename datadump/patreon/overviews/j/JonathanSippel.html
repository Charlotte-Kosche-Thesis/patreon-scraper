I\u2019ve decided to jump into the world Patreon with two feet, after spending the past while pre-releasing content for you to unlock.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is a service that connects creators (like me) with their biggest fans and enables those fans to become paying members, or \u2018Patrons\u2019 who receive special perks in return for their generous pledges.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see this as the perfect tool to help me connect with people like you, and others who have come across my work one place or another.  \u003cstrong\u003eThrough this page I will share previously unreleased projects that I\u2019ve created dating back to 2008, in return for anyone who\u2019s willing to send a couple bucks my way.\u003c/strong\u003e  Just think of this as a virtual tip jar.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo update the public on what\u2019s happening behind the closed doors of Patreon I\u2019ll be releasing a bi-weekly preview called the \u003cstrong\u003e\u2018JS Free Press\u2019\u003c/strong\u003e which features low resolution thumbnails from each of the posts I\u2019ve made since the past edition.  \u003cstrong\u003eIf you donate just $1 per month you\u2019ll receive a high resolution version of each of the thumbnails from the JSFP.  If you\u2019re really interested in the content, just pledge $10 per month to see the full posts including the extra unreleased images from each shoot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, \u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m giving an incredible offer to Patron\u2019s who pledge $20 per month.  They will be invited to a special monthly photo shoot where I\u2019ll be taking solo portraits!  Every month will be different than the previous and each Patron\u2019s photo will receive a quick photoshop retouch.\u003c/strong\u003e  That makes for 12 unique portraits annually for less than the cost of what one personalized shoot starts at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m hoping to raise more money for personal projects, as well to help pay for studio costs, and new gear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your interest and support for my work!\u00a0 Nothing beats watching my ideas turn into something and sharing them with all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*If you have any questions about Patreon, feel free to ask! I\u0027ll be creating an FAQ section soon, after I receive some questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*There may be some tasteful, though technically \u2018Not Safe For Work\u2019 content present, it should be pretty obvious what not to click if you don\u2019t want to see it."
