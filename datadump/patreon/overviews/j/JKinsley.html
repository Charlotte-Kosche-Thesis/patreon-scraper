I\u0027ve been writing stories for a few years now, and I want to keep going. Writing\u0027s been a passion of mine since I first learned to tell a story back in grade school. I\u0027ve gotten better (I think) and I hope that comes across in my work. Separately, I\u0027d like to break out into some other content, like gameplay videos. You can check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLtdZzajBl9hb0E9jdUDDbQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e to see what I\u0027ve done so far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause it takes time to make the content I do to the level of quality I want. Writing takes time, sometimes lots of time, and Fimfiction doesn\u0027t have a way of helping me pay the bills. Anything helps, but as we reach milestones, I can dedicate more and more of my time to making content instead of working a traditional job. And if we reach certain levels, I\u0027d like to share the love and support other artists and creators I enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy per chapter?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll be producing enough content on a monthly basis to really justify going that route. But this per chapter model is going to be about new material I release for stories; any prompts I write or help publish under the Lightning Round won\u0027t count as \"chapters\" when you fund me*. The good news is that Patreon will let you set up a maximum amount you want to fund me each month, so if I do publish more than one chapter, you won\u0027t be contributing more than the maximum \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0set up! I may come back and revisit this idea later, if and when I can dedicate the time to push out more content beyond stories, like the JK Reviews series or more gameplay videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* If those prompts later become chapters for a proper story, like Fantasy and Fulfillment, that story will count as a chapter\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will this mean for projects going forward?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs best as I\u0027m able, I\u0027ll get stories written and edited to the same standards as before. I\u0027ll publish as often as I can regardless of how you choose to support me. And my work will always be free! Patreon is here to let me create new things while you support me in doing so, without me needing to put content behind a pay wall or cover it in ads (the ads on Fimfiction excepted).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
