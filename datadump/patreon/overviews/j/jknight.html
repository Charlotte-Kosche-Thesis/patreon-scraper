My songs come in a variety of delicious flavors\nincluding Pop, Pop Rock, Pop Punk, Rock, Metal, Punk, and even a\nlittle R\u0026amp;B. I\u0027ve created one short zombie film so far and I am\ncurrently working on a full length sequel.

Streaming music is more popular than buying\nsingles or albums and monetization on sites like Spotify and Youtube\nare extremely unreliable. As you can probably also imagine, making\nfilms is hard work and can be costly both in time and money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nmake music and films because it\u0027s my life, my passion and my drug.\nIt\u0027s a form of therapy that cleanses my soul. I also do it because I\nwant to share the enjoyment that the creative process gives me with\nyou.

My songs can take up to 100 hours to\nfully write and get to a final produced version and that doesn\u0027t\ninclude promotion. My movies take months to write, film, edit and\nproduce.

I may even do\nlive streams if requested by enough of you. I just\nwant to deliver high quality songs, videos and films to entertain all\nof you and that is what you will be supporting.

This version is created once a year during my final mix and mastering session right before the album\u0027s release to the public. You will recieve this version before the general public does. The two versions of the songs may not be drastically different from each other, but the final mastered version of each will be of slightly higher quality and clarity. But, once in a while the songs do end up being different and sometimes drastically, so you just might get a surprise once in a while :) Songs will be downloaded in MP3 or Wav file format.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e",
