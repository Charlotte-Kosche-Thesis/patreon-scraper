In order to achieve that, it places you as \u003cstrong\u003efugitive agent\u003c/strong\u003e, who uses his skills to do morally questionable actions on regular basis and establishes his own illegal enterprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo even if the theme is espionage, you are not special agent assigned to do so and so, you are mastermind behind the scene that is usually the opponent of such agent.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThink Raymond Reddington, not James Bond.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.ghoststruggle.com/assets/img/patreon/Ingame_picture4.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGAMEPLAY\u003cbr\u003e\nIn its heart, GS is the \u003cstrong\u003estory generator\u003c/strong\u003e which entails\u003cstrong\u003e dice and cards\u003c/strong\u003e mechanism of mission resolving, \u003cstrong\u003eRPG elements\u003c/strong\u003e for your agents and global \u003cstrong\u003estrategical concerns\u003c/strong\u003e with possibly an open world experience, after multiplayer feature gets implemented.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.ghoststruggle.com/assets/img/patreon/Ingame_picture1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHEME\u003cbr\u003eI believe that espionage is probably the most \u003cstrong\u003eoverlooked theme\u003c/strong\u003e in gaming today, which is surprising because it can comprise all three reliable attraction triggers - violence, sex, mystery.\u003cbr\u003e\nProducers of \u003cstrong\u003eTV series like Blacklist, Person of Interest and other\u003c/strong\u003e are well aware of that and therefore are build on the premise of secret organizations and criminals having significant influence on our world. They are but one-dimensional experience, so the GhostStruggle game is and will be \u003cstrong\u003emaking this idea more justice.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.ghoststruggle.com/assets/img/patreon/Ingame_picture0.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLATFORM\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeb\u003c/strong\u003e is here to stay for a long time.
