    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote many stories when I was a kid.  Some were fanfiction, some original creations, but the thing that tied them together were fantastical worlds filled to the brim with new possibilities. I loved reflecting the world around me, and within me, on paper. Yet what I found most frustrating was the feeling that I had to write all my stories from the perspective of a straight, white man in order for anyone to take my work seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I worked as a performer, playwright, and musician for many years, I wanted to make my way back to my first love: writing.  I\u2019ve found myself hurled back into the world of fantasy, science fiction, and dystopian post-apocalyptic literature, and I love it.  I love building worlds and filling them with fascinating and complex characters.  There\u2019s nothing better to me than creating and entering a world filled with dangerously diverse characters; characters with different orientations, races, genders, and everything else that make us all unique. As a child I was inspired by the Rebel Alliance and the X-men (or really, any scrappy young team of heroes), but I never saw myself reflected in them.  Now, in my 30\u2019s, I\u2019ve acquired the tools and arsenal to be an inspiration for my younger self and create the stories he needed to see. My dream now is to fill the arenas of science fiction and fantasy with characters that reflect my reality and to highlight the wild spectrum of people in my life, especially those who rarely see themselves in the spotlight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListed below are the projects I wish to bring to publication. I\u2019m currently penning two trilogies, one high fantasy, and one urban fantasy, which I hope to publish. There are two erotica series I\u2019m working on as well, which I hope to self-publish for kindle. My patrons would have free access to any of these should they come to fruition, as well as monthly updates and presented chapters for feedback, critique, and enjoyment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m still developing my voice as a prosaic writer, and the ability to focus on writing while not worrying too much about finances would be a great boon. I plan on spending this year giving myself solid deadlines, and instilling the discipline I\u2019ve learned from theatre and music into the craft of writing. Your support in this endeavour would allow me to focus, grow, and turn creative writing into a viable career. For now, I just want to improve at this craft; which is why I seek your patronage and collaboration in this journey. While I\u2019m not aiming for stardom, or the #1 on anyone\u2019s lists right away, I want to add my work to the zeitgeist, and in doing so, bring people of colour, trans and non-binary, and people of all sexualities to the forefront to challenge the white, cisheteronormative stranglehold on science fiction and fantasy. The goals, for me, are both personal and systemic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRepresentation in our communally consumed media is incredibly important to me.  Thank you for supporting me.  Your contributions will help me turn this childhood dream of mine into a tangible reality. (I could barely even write that last sentence without tearing up, so really, thank you.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m trying to make it as a writer and artist full time. My goal here is $600 a month, which is just shy of my current monthly rent. Should that goal be met, I\u0027ll up to try and meet full rent + bills. And if for some reason, we go crazy, I\u0027ll be aiming to meet rent, bills, AND groceries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy current writing Projects:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCinderwick Chronicles\u003c/em\u003e - a story following a sheltered Halfling, a draconic Salamander, a Druid from the Stars, and a bewildered human warrior.
