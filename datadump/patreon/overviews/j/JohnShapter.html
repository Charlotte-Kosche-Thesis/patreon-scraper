    "summary": "Hi Everyone\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m John Shapter, and I`m a passionate creator of Ambient Sounds and Sound Art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think sound is a magical thing. It has comforted and healed and inspired me throughout my life, both in music and the natural sounds around me and that is what I hope to do for others through sharing the soundscapes I create. I want to connect with people through these sounds, to take people on magical journeys, to communicate with them and to inspire them through my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are all equally important to me when it comes to my music and my art.\u00a0 My work has purpose because you listen.\u00a0 I strive to get to connect with real live humans out there in the world through this work and through the concept of `patronage` it becomes accessible to as many of you as possible.\u00a0 That`s a big `WOW` for me, the more people listening the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post new work once a month, as well as bonus sounds and files, and by pledging $5 +VAT per month (total for UK Patrons is just about \u00a31 per week) you\u0027ll help me to keep creating new and better things.\u00a0 \u00a0I love the thought that you`ll be contributing and interacting with the creative development of what I create in a really personal way.\u00a0 It may be a small investment for you, but the support will be massive for me.\u00a0 In return I\u0027ll send you all `patron only` versions of the soundscapes I release for however long you remain a patron - usually around 12 tracks a year! There are also other rewards I`ll announce each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, you also get access to all the non-limited editions of my work going back before you joined my community. As soon as you become a patron you\u0027ll be taken to a page with links for Patreon-exclusive sound downloads, including samples of my work in the form of shorter tracks.\u00a0 That means \u00a360 worth of sound tracks for your first \u00a31 pledge!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatronage also means you will build a portfolio of at least 12 downloadable creations, each worth \u00a310, for only \u00a31 a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat sounds like a great deal to me, hope that sounds like a good deal to you, and thanks so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you look at the posts, you`ll already see some examples of work underway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn\u003cbr\u003e"
