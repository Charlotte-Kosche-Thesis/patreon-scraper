I\u0027m Josh Closs. I teach college-level math at the local community college, and make comics and other stories! Neither of those is sufficiently paying the bills right now, so I\u0027m here on Patreon to help me live as a human in the 21st century. Wow, isn\u0027t American Capitalism great??\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to be a light in the middle of darkness, because we have a lot of darkness right now and not much light. As such, I try to promote hope and joy to everyone in the world! If you want to help do that, I invite you to join in the fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How do the character portrait/comic page rewards work?\u003cbr\u003eA: Short answer: A Google Form, that you\u0027ll get when you pledge at those levels!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong answer: Character portraits are one full-body character or two busts with optional speech bubbles. If the characters are mine, that\u0027s super-easy; you\u0027ll give a description of how you want them drawn and I\u0027ll get to work. If they\u0027re established characters or a person, you\u0027ll\u00a0send me some reference images in case, describe how you want them drawn, and I\u0027ll get to work. If they\u0027re a new character (D\u0026amp;D character portrait, maybe?), you\u0027ll give me as thorough a description as you can, I\u0027ll send you a sketch to approve/disapprove. Once we\u0027re on the same page, I\u0027ll draw that good good character for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor comic pages, you can either give me a general topic (Liz and Ambra), a more specific\u00a0plot\u00a0(Liz and Ambra meet for coffee), or a script (PANEL 1: LIZ: Hi! I like your ears!). I\u0027ll pencil a layout for your approval; once we\u0027re on the same page, I\u0027ll get to work on making it magical, and then email it to you when it\u0027s done!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll aim to get all commissions returned the same month. I\u0027m as impatient for you to get\u00a0your super-rad art\u00a0as you are!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eQ: I can\u0027t afford a monthly patronage at the level it would take to get a portrait/comic page, but I\u0027d love to commission one! What should I do?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/xZ8GmV6RRQyim5hE3\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThrough this form!\u003c/a\u003e Rates will be comparable to a month of patronage, though a bit lower since you\u0027re not getting the other rewards.\u00a0Patrons get first dibs on commissions, but if I have the time, I\u0027d love to take on yours!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Are there restrictions on what I can commission?\u003cbr\u003eA: As a matter of fact, yes!\u003cbr\u003e-No hate speech\u003cbr\u003e-No nudity (Nothing inherently wrong with it! Just not my jam to draw it)\u003cbr\u003e-No excessive violence\u003cbr\u003e-No Ginny wearing a Cubs hat (You cannot pay me enough money to draw this. Try me, if you dare. I will not bend)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: I\u0027d rather not get the physical rewards. What should I do?\u003cbr\u003eA: Putting your name as \"NO THANK YOU\" (or something along those lines) as your shipping address should do the trick! If Patreon doesn\u0027t let you do that, shoot me an email and I\u0027ll figure out something else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What will the Special Thanks look like?\u003cbr\u003eA: Every 24 pages, \u003cem\u003eDon\u0027t Worry About Their Classes\u003c/em\u003e starts a new chapter; the Special Thanks will go in the chapter title box (after a bit of reconfiguring). For \u003cem\u003eThe Guildmistress\u003c/em\u003e, chapter breaks will come at less regular intervals, but will serve\u00a0include \"The Story So Far\" recaps between chapters for those that don\u0027t want to go back and re-read the previous chapters when they forget where Character X came from or when Event Y happened. The Special Thanks will be included on those pages!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd trust me, the thanks won\u0027t be subtle. I love thanking people for helping me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Where does my money go?\u003cbr\u003eA: Helping me live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m living with my parents, working as an adjunct math professor at the local community college. Without an additional source of income (READ: y\u0027all), I\u0027m not earning enough cash to get my own place and still eat, so I need your support in as big a quantity as you can provide to help me make the best art possible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon, unlike a Kickstarter or a Kickstarterlike, is about supporting an artist/group of artists rather than a project. Art takes time; between scripting, layouts, inks, colors, and uploading, a page of \u003cem\u003eThe Guildmistress\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0takes about five hours, and a page of \u003cem\u003eDWATC\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0takes six to eight hours, depending on the complexity. That means I\u0027m putting in about 20 hours a week just on the regularly-scheduled comics, not to mention my writing schedule, monthly comics, postcards, and other drawing projects I\u0027m working on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, time is money, and thus art takes money. If you think mine is worth it, you should know that your patronage funds at least 12 pages of public comics per month, along with a patron-only comic and a nontrivial amount of prose! That\u0027s pretty rad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I have a list as long as my arm of cool projects that involve me paying other cool\u00a0people to bring them to fruition. As\u00a0this community grows, so will my ability to do said projects. It\u0027s up to y\u0027all to make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Will you name a character in one of your comics after me/give me a cameo/do another favor for me in \u003cem\u003eDWATC/The Guildmistress\u003c/em\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eA: Probably not, friend! For various reasons, I like to keep as much control over my comics as possible; introducing real people to those universes make me\u00a0super-nervous that I\u0027ll accidentally make you\u00a0out to be a jerk/misspell your name/draw your nose all wrong.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you really want your name in the comics, there\u0027s room for you in the Special Thanks! Or you can commission your own comic pages with you in the comics! So many options!\u003cbr\u003e"
