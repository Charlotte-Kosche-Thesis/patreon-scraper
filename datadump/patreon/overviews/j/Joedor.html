    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Joedor, and thank you for checking out my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing Pok\u00e9mon as a content creator and streamer for two years now, and have established my role within the community as the catalyst. I want to make battling, teambuilding, and learning to battle easier, more organized, and faster. Currently I run a league of 24 draft format coaches, host tournaments on my twitch stream, teach people how to gen and reach homebrew, and when they can\u0027t get there (or don\u0027t have a pc) provide them with the tools they need to get a competitive team through breeding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I made the decision to make the plunge and try out full time content creation, at least for the summer. If income for that period was $0, I\u0027d probably have enough saved up to comfortably go until August without picking up another job. But if the upswing happened just right, this could make the full time dream come 2-3 years earlier than originally planned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Four Pillars of the Joedor Nation are as follows:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be the catalyst for the Pokemon battling community\u003cbr\u003eTo provide a fun and safe environment for people to battle\u003cbr\u003eTo push the boundaries on Pokemon related content\u003cbr\u003eTo bring the Pokemon community closer together through battle\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is a logical argument for why you should support the channel: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u2019s say in any given month you have your income and your expenses. You put hundreds, if not thousands of dollars aside for various things that you either need or want. Let\u2019s say you like eating out, or you like to going to movies, or you buy music or DVDs. Whatever form of entertainment you enjoy, you spend money on it. Let\u0027s use that movie goer\u2019s idea as an example. If a movie ticket costs on average $8, you pay ~$8 and you get 2+ hours of entertainment. Add in popcorn and soda and you\u0027re in for another $20. Once per month you get entertained for 2 hours and it costs you somewhere between $8 if you went alone with no snacks, and up to $8+$8+$20=$36 if you went on your average date night movie. All for a meager 2 hours of entertainment. On the other hand, I put out 10-30 minute videos every day and stream on twitch for 3-5 hours every day. That\u0027s 130 hours of content per month. Now naturally, not everyone will watch every single video/stream that goes up on my channels. But \u003cstrong\u003eif you even watch a *tenth* of the videos/streams I make, you are getting over 13 hours of entertainment per month\u003c/strong\u003e. Is it as good as a movie? Maybe. Probably not. But is it worth *some* nominal value that is greater than $0? Definitely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill a movie ever reward you with VIP meet and greets for the actors just for buying a ticket?\u003c/strong\u003e No. \u003cstrong\u003eWill you ever get free apparel for buying a ticket and popcorn?\u003c/strong\u003e No. \u003cstrong\u003eWill you ever be taught by the actor of a movie how to act?\u003c/strong\u003e No* (Unless they have an academy or something). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe decision is yours.\u003c/strong\u003e If you enjoy my content and come to the channel frequently and you have the means to support, please consider doing so. Thank you for your continued support on the channel whether financial or not, I\u0027m very glad to have you as part of the Joedor Nation. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
