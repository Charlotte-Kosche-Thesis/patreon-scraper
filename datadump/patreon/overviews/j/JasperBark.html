    "summary": "Thank you for checking me out on Patreon. I\u2019m sure you have one or two questions about my page such as ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eJUST WHO THE HELL ARE YOU???\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s a very good question. Unless you\u2019ve come here from my website, or a link \u00a0on social media. In which case, I suggest you change\u00a0your meds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m a writer of hideous and horrible things. The type of fiction your parents warned you about, terrible tales that scandalise sermon writers and bring hot sweats to Sunday school teachers. I\u2019m talking about the type of books that make you feel good in all the worst ways and bad in all the best. Work that\u0027s highly imaginative and often thought provoking.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI write novels, graphic novels and comics. As you\u2019ve probably guessed, I\u2019m best known for horror fiction, but I\u2019ve also published science fiction, fantasy, many children\u2019s books and a WWII spy thriller. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve even won a few awards including a \u2018This Is Horror Award\u2019 for my short story collection \u003cem\u003eDead Air\u003c/em\u003e, an ERA award for my series of educational graphic novels \u003cem\u003eBattle Cries\u003c/em\u003e and a Fringe First at the Edingburgh Festival.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlus I blog, run a YouTube channel and host a monthly webcomic on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"320\" src=\"https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5585/30512311453_c305414537_n.jpg\" width=\"231\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eSO WHY ARE YOU ON PATREON THEN?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother good question, you do like to put me on the spot don\u2019t you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are two reasons really. The first is that I\u2019m tired of whoring myself out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to make any kind of income as a writer, I have to do a lot of hack work. While I\u2019m proud of the commissions, and the work for hire writing I do, it\u2019s not the reason I quit my day job. It\u2019s not the kind of legacy I want to leave behind, and it\u2019s not the work I always dreamed of writing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I also have a wife, two daughters and a very hungry overdraft to feed. That\u2019s why I need your input.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eFAIR ENOUGH, AND THE SECOND REASON IS ...?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, okay, I\u2019m just getting to that. The second reason is that I want to make a deeper connection with everyone who reads my work. Social media allows us to interact, but there\u2019s no central hub where we can build a really solid relationship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s what I want to do on Patreon. I want to build a personal relationship with you. The sort of relationship that will provide us both with encouragement, support and fine reading material, for years to come. All the rewards I\u2019m offering are designed to do just that. Please take a moment to check them out and tell me what you think. I\u2019d love to hear from everyone who stops by this page. Why not drop me a line to let me know what you think of this page, my unspeakable fiction or my startling resemblance to Frodo Baggins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far and please do get in touch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"320\" src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5323/30512279483_6bd7110081_n.jpg\" width=\"232\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
