While I\u0027m thrilled to be working on my own and creating my own path, I\u0027ve also seen that with that comes the danger of copyright strikes, demonetization issues, and other traps of the solo YouTube game. This of course is compounded by the fact that I\u0027m fairly stubborn in my ways and would rather create a complete entertainment experience, than worry about if a video will be flagged. The result, \u00a0is numerous series with minimal or zero ad revenue, which is how I earn the vast majority of my monthly income. Don\u0027t fret though, I never set out to get rich and it\u0027s certainly not a channel ending problem, but it has caused some professional downsizing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis patreon is NOT a Jesse needs money to live patreon\u003c/strong\u003e. This IS however, about expanding what I can bring to you the audience. There are two major goals of this patreon, that I believe with your help, will get things back on track and take the channel to places it has never been.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2267d088c7fe6b13fda9c1b66709b83/tumblr_odu2ec1bIy1rvp277o2_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Many of you love the Cox n\u0027 Crendor animation series, but they were few and far between. Our animator Dan, while amazing, was still in school and unable to work on them unless he was on break. Now, we finally have the chance to snatch him from out under his crushing homework load to work for Crendor and I full time. With Dan working for us daily, this means we can actually have a real animated video schedule!!! After talking logistics and the reality of doing it every day, we\u0027ve agreed that Dan would work on a 45 day production schedule, which means \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027ll have a new Cox n\u0027 Crendor every 50 days\u003c/strong\u003e! This is huge and I\u0027m very excited to do more of these than ever before.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/de2c775c65f6514fc9f1b6fee2256641/tumblr_omkhostq9M1qzmmw6o1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.\u003c/strong\u003e The next donation goal is for a \u003cstrong\u003efull time in house editor\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve noticed it: 1 video a day instead of two, series going on breaks, weekly shows running late. Since leaving a network all the day to day business operations have fallen on me. Not only am I making contacts and doing the business hustle end of YouTube and streaming, but I\u0027m also recording, editing, writing, and working on several other major projects. Editing and rendering takes a long time, and when I\u0027m doing that, I\u0027m not recording videos. This creates the insane backlog situation we have now on the channel that I\u0027m trying to remedy. \u003cstrong\u003eI know that with an extra person on staff to edit videos, we can get back to how my channel is supposed to run.\u003c/strong\u003e More Multiplayer Mayhem, Greenlight, Scary Game Squad, Co-Op series, Q\u0026amp;A, and getting Fan Friday back where it\u0027s supposed to be.... on Saturday morning. This will also trickle over into freeing up time for more Cox n\u0027 Crendor podcasts AND creating new crazy show ideas. It\u0027s something I\u0027m sure you all agree is needed very badly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth be told, that\u0027s it. I would feel horrible asking for any more than what I need in order to be the best entertainer I can be, for you the viewer. I\u0027m not trying to just take your money, I hope this will be seen more as an investment in more awesome content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT, this wouldn\u0027t be a patreon if I didn\u0027t include a \"if we for some reason get way above what I think people are willing to tolerate\" goal. SO:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAny additional funds would go to creating the dream channel I\u0027ve always imagined.\u003c/strong\u003e We\u0027re talking flying in friends to do Co-op (no more waiting for Crendor to visit to record Outlast 2 for instance), hosting more 24 hour event streams at the office, creating live events both here in LA and in cities near you, and my dream series \"Cox n\u0027 Crendor show where I take Crendor around to famous old stuff and film it.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/0766df6e2fde98a1995bd28bf046ddc6/tumblr_omkhostq9M1qzmmw6o7_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I know we can make some really entertaining and wild Cox content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have my supreme thanks and gratitude for any support you can offer. - Jesse"

So that\u0027s more Multiplayer Mayhem, more Fan Friday, more Q\u0026amp;A, more Greenlight, and more Scary Game Squad - in addition to other series I\u0027ve always wanted to start but never had time to do.\u00a0",
