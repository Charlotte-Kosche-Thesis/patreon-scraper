    "summary": "My name is Jesse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal in life is to be an artist. More specifically a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on a novel that\u0027s been living inside me for about five years: the characters go to bed with me, they take showers with me, they are on my mind at all times every day. I\u0027ve written enough extra material to be it\u0027s own book, but now it\u0027s time for me to really start down and write this novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what kind of novel is it? Put simply, it\u0027s a fantasy story with an emphasis on the role religion plays in people\u0027s lives. To give you some key words to give you an idea: there\u0027s a mage who can control fire, a witch who\u0027s entire culture was decimated by religious persecution, a demi-human whose people were massacred in a war, a kick ass transgender warrior, a wisecracking noble who joins a merry band of upstarts, and a dreamy boy-next-door who my main character is in love with. It\u0027s a difficult story to pitch in one sentence, but my hope is that it will tackle things that I want to talk about: religion, emotional and physical abuse, abandonment, parents and the lack thereof, family structures and whether or not they really exist, and a character who\u0027s struggling against the weight of anxiety and fear to live in the real world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy other big dream is to be a musician. I started playing piano when I was about sixteen, learning some introductory music theory from my chorus teacher when there was off time. After that I fell in love with Tori Amos, Imogen Heap, and many other musicians who inspired me to make my own music. Now I\u0027m trying to learn to speak, and to sing, with my own voice. Currently I\u0027m in the process of getting together a good setup to record something nearing studio-quality, and I\u0027m hoping that the money from this will help me to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of other ideas as far as writing goes. I want to write an erotica novel, I\u0027ve been bouncing around ideas for other fantasy stories for years, and every now and then I write short stories. I want to keep growing, and most of all, I want other people to SEE what I create. I want people to read my work, to hear my music. If everything were to go perfectly, this Patreon would be a platform for me to not only create my novel and my music, but to publish it in some way as well. I want the experience of creation, which is typically a solitary venture, to be experienced as a group. I NEED feedback, I need to be heard and seen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing my patron gives me a gift that I cannot express my gratitude for: the ability to be heard by someone. I don\u0027t care how much money you pledge, I just want to know that I can really be a writer, a musician, an artist, and that someone out there will care enough to support me. I\u0027m trusting you. I\u0027m asking you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027m excited to hear from you."
