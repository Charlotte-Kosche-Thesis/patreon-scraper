For those people which consume content more readily in audio form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s got religion AND politics, not to mention predictions of doom and obscure historical references. Also all of the entries are long. Okay the blogs are long, the podcasts are short (when compared to other podcasts).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI assume that despite all of these negatives that you have decided to read/listen to it. And that further, if you\u0027re on this page that you\u0027re considering supporting it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I can say is, \"Thank You!\" I think there truly is a hole in the current discourse which needs filling. It\u0027s a small hole, I may be the only one that can see it, but it\u0027s there and I appreciate your support in helping me speak to this narrow, but very important niche."
