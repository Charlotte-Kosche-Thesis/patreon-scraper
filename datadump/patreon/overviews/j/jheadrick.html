Sometimes 2. I also have videos posting to the YouTube channel (\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GameReviewHaven\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/GameReviewHaven\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e ) every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgbox.com/riOhGvCN.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWell, that all depends on how much is made, truthfully. For the most part, anything raised here (Or through any of the shops I have, or the ad revenue of the ReviewHaven channel) generally goes right back into the channels/sites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor instance - $5 here and there will often go to purchasing things like audio cables (I just recently purchased 3 new Optical cables, actually) and other minor purchases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also the costs of licensing software and the like. Anything made here or elsewhere can help to offset the cost of paying for new software/paying for subscriptions to things like \u003cem\u003eGameshow\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eAdobe\u0027s Creative Cloud\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then there are the obvious \u003cstrong\u003ebig\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0purchases. Things like \u003cstrong\u003erent\u003c/strong\u003e. Things like\u00a0new or replacement hardware - PC parts and the like. These things cost quite a lot of money quite often - and it\u0027s money I just don\u0027t really have to throw around as much as I love the stuff I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgbox.com/ahYgFo8g.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m being honest - I consider this more of a tip jar than anything else. That\u0027s why the very few Patron-only posts I \u003cstrong\u003edo\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0make are simply $1 only. I, truthfully, would rather make my money through my shops where someone could get a physical \u003cstrong\u003ething\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for their money. A t-shirt, a print of one of my fractals to hang on their wall, a case for their phone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I can\u0027t really do that without being able to promote and advertise said works. There\u0027s only so much a person can do for free. Being physically unable to work also tends to make things a bit more difficult than they should be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, by supporting this Patreon, you\u0027d be helping to make it much easier, and much more viable for me to continue doing the things that I enjoy and want to do.\u003c/span\u003e"
