    "summary": "My name is Jason Spaceson.... I\u0027ve been creating content on YouTube for nearly 8 years. I\u0027ve been through 3 YouTube channels at this point, until I finally found my niche and love for creating content in a live fashion. For the last 3 years I\u0027ve had my main focus of Content creation based around Live Streaming video games... However as time\u0027s gone on, more and more I find myself thinking about what it would be like to go back to making more Video content again with all of the new skill sets I\u0027ve acquired over the last 3 years as a live streamer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve done an extensive amount of studying and hard work to pursue a career as an avid Film Maker.... primarily Cinematography and Post Video Editing are my strong suits!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this series progresses, not only do I hope to continue creating Innovating and Engaging content... however I also hope that this project, along with MANY others in the works.... will help lead me on the right path and take me somewhere in the world of Film \u0026amp; Entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy you choosing to support my brand, you\u0027re helping out immensely with the cost of living, cost of assets needed for videos (Graphic Design, Paying Crew Members, Travel Costs, etc) All of these types of things can be very expensive and are essentially being paid for out of Pocket each time. Also since I\u0027m paid on a monthly basis through my MCN on YouTube, if I need to make bit of a bigger investment, that requires me to dip into my personal funds in order to make ends meet, then ultimatley end up replacing those funds with the following months paycheck (Sometimes this might not even be enough to cover the expenses with 1 month\u0027s pay)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, by making a contribution of ANY size... you\u0027re helping the production quality of my content increase more and MORE with every bit of support I receive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s never necessary to support someone monetarily, however I do hope that if you decide to contribute.... that you enjoy everything that\u0027s yet to come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI WILL NOT let you legends down!"
