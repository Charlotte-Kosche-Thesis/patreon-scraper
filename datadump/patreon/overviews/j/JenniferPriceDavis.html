    "summary": "Hi! I am Jennifer Price Davis. I\u0027m an artist living and creating in Cleveland, OH.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work primarily in mixed media. Acrylic and charcoal are my super favorites, with paper, oil sticks, and gold leaf holding very special spaces in my heart and soul. I also write children\u0027s books and have one book for adults with another on the way...a memoir and collection of essays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love art. I focus largely on the black girl and black woman experience out of love, joy, healing, and\u00a0 rage (not necessarily in that order.) I also play with landscapes, bugs appear in my work, and I\u0027m currently interested in creating pieces that honor the ordinary in black life....from being on the play ground to going to work home in the kitchen. Somewhere connected, if only through color...landscapes are emerging from me out of la place of love, curiosity, and the reclamation of nature as a safe space for black bodies. Intertwined in it all on purpose and unintentionally, is political commentary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here on Patreon to create community and geek out on the process and the product. I am looking forward to sharing thoughts on color, showing techniques, and sharing some lessons in case you want to paint your own creations. Between the painting, you can expect bits of my memoir and essays. Right now I\u0027m focusing on my early years...family dance contests and healing rituals in the playground. I cannot wait to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for rolling with me. Thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
