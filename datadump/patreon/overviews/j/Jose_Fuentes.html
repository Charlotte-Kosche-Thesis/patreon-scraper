    "summary": "My name is Jose Fuentes.  I\u2019m a student of Joe Kubert School for Cartoon Graphic Arts.  I have worked as a freelance comic book inker for about 12 years now.  My main focus was on small press books ( small press companies are significantly lower budgeted than companies like Marvel or DC comics).  I did a few logo designs for different companies and worked in a factory for almost 10 years, while my wife was going to school to be a midwife. \u00a0It was shortly after she finished that I realized that I enjoy working on comics a lot more than working in a factory and have decided to pursue my dream of being a comic book or children\u0027s book artist. \u00a0So I followed the Lord\u0027s lead and have uprooted my family from Florida and moved us to Pennsylvania so I can attend The Kubert School in Dover, NJ. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an active participant in my church.  I have been married for almost 13 years with 5 children. At the moment my wife is working on establishing a home birth midwifery practice which currently has no clients. \u00a0It has been rough to try and assimilate into a different state, despite her efforts we have little to no income at the moment and expecting God to provide!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to look at my art and my blogs, we hope you consider becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJose Fuentes\u003cbr\u003e"
