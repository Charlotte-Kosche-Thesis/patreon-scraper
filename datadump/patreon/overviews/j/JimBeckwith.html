    "summary": "Hi friends, I have a confession. I am an artist. I have tried other ways, but I cannot avoid the muse. I am asking my fans to commit to an amount per month to help keep me continue creating. Any amount. Please read on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e page. This is a form of \u003cstrong\u003econtinuous crowd-funding\u003c/strong\u003e that helps artists and others to \u003cstrong\u003econtinue\u003c/strong\u003e to do what they do best. I \u003cstrong\u003emust\u003c/strong\u003e continue to make music, and in the current environment of the music business, it is really \u003cstrong\u003edifficult\u003c/strong\u003e for musicians to get paid for their work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(221, 217, 195);\"\u003e{Even \u003cstrong\u003eApple\u003c/strong\u003e has created Apple Music, which is a \u003cstrong\u003estreaming service\u003c/strong\u003e, and they are \u003cstrong\u003eattempting\u003c/strong\u003e to funnel everyone away from iTunes and the \u0027pay for downloads\u0027 system. That way, they sell subscriptions and keep \u003cstrong\u003eall but .007-.2\u003c/strong\u003e of a penny that goes to the \u003cstrong\u003eartists\u003c/strong\u003e for music plays.

It\u0027s like a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly subscription\u003c/strong\u003e, and the more support I get the more I can produce \u003cstrong\u003enew creations\u003c/strong\u003e to share.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI invite you to take a look at my \u003cstrong\u003eofferings\u003c/strong\u003e in exchange\n for your support - most of which can be fulfilled by online means to \nallow me to continue traveling and making music wherever I am.\u00a0 It\u0027s not required that you get perks in exchange, but I will offer some extras. Please let me know what you would like to see also.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate your \u003cstrong\u003eengagement\u003c/strong\u003e in what I do and so grateful to continue to \u003cstrong\u003eembrace\u003c/strong\u003e my art and craft as these precious days continue to pass. May my art continue to inspire you.\u003cbr\u003e_______________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMORE ABOUT ME:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout \u003cstrong\u003e10 years\u003c/strong\u003e ago, I decided that I it was time to \u003cstrong\u003esurrender\u003c/strong\u003e to the \u003cstrong\u003eartist\u003c/strong\u003e within.\u00a0 It wasn\u0027t so much of a \u003cstrong\u003echoice\u003c/strong\u003e as it was just the \u003cstrong\u003etime\u003c/strong\u003e that it had to happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I\u0027ve \u003cstrong\u003etraveled\u003c/strong\u003e a whole lot in the USA and out, and connected with so many wonderful people. I had an idea that it would be cool to make \u003cstrong\u003emusic for yoga\u003c/strong\u003e the way I used to make music for \u003cstrong\u003emodern dance\u003c/strong\u003e, for commercials and film, for \u003cstrong\u003espoken word\u003c/strong\u003e artists - by showing up with a wide \u003cstrong\u003erange\u003c/strong\u003e of sound possibilities and feeling the moment and improvising with whatever comes through. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took some consistency in showing up but has paid off in a fair amount of \u003cstrong\u003eawareness\u003c/strong\u003e of some part of what I do. In some ways I feel I\u0027ve only scratched the surface, but I\u0027ve seen enough \u003cstrong\u003emiracles\u003c/strong\u003e in doors opening to know I\u0027m doing the right thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also \u003cstrong\u003esinging\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ekirtan\u003c/strong\u003e (devotional chanting), scheduling some \u003cstrong\u003ehouse concerts\u003c/strong\u003e, shootiing a lot of \u003cstrong\u003ephotography\u003c/strong\u003e as I travel, and I\u0027ve begun \u003cstrong\u003eproducing\u003c/strong\u003e music for others again. \u003cbr\u003eStill, it seems to take a lot of \u003cstrong\u003eperseverance\u003c/strong\u003e and diversification to garner enough support to keep the \u003cstrong\u003ecreativity\u003c/strong\u003e flowing. For the past two and a half years I\u0027ve given up having a home rather than being kept from making music and getting it to my audience. It is truly my priority to create and present in performance and I no longer feel like I have a choice. Somehow great things keep flowing to me, and hopefully through me as I continue to explore more opening as a \u003cstrong\u003echannel of creativity\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
