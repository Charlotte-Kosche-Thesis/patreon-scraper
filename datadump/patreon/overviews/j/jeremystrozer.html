    "summary": "I write historical flash-fiction of The 20th Century\u0027s War to enable people to enjoyably learn about history. Each story is told from the first person perspective, taking the reader into the mind of an individual coming face to face with some facet of human induced violence. My goal is both to teach history, as well as encourage the understanding that all war is experienced at the personal level. This is a fact few who advocate war keep in mind. Maybe one future leader will be less likely to engage in a war because of my stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy sponsoring my writing here you\u0027ll receive all of my stories before they are released in e-book, print, and audio format to the public. You\u0027ll also be supporting an effort to train future leaders to think through the human cost of war so they may be less inclined toward starting new ones. Whether you support because you want to save the world, or just enjoy short stories, I won\u0027t ask."

     "about": "I write first-person emotional history in order to teach people to avoid the wanton waste of war. Fascinated by ideas and personal stories, I am able to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena. By enjoying thinking and learning about the past I understand the present through creating its context. I have faith in the links between all things; believing there are few coincidences and that almost every event has a reason. I am also inspired by the future and what could be; thereby inspiring others with my visions of what occurred and what is possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy inspiration comes from years of improvisational acting education; the actions and writing of Gene Sharp, Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, Woody Guthrie, Studs Terkel, and Henry David Thoreau; as well as an affinity for history. I believe all stories are best told from the perspective of the individual experiencing the event and that learning about history should be an emotionally driven experience. Therefore, I push the conviction that all history is simply a personal story, compounded and woven with the personal story of everyone else, throughout time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRaised in California, I moved to the D. C. area at the age of 18 to attend university. Through education and luck, I\u0027ve been able to travel across vast swaths of the world, seeing and feeling things I never would have realized otherwise. I helped remove unexploded ordnance from war ravaged countries, stem the flow of the world\u0027s most dangerous weapons, and potentially reduce the likelihood of war between some of the world\u0027s most powerful countries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I simply seek to warn the world of the human cost of violence.",
