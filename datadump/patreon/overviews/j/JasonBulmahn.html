Edge of Eventide is a \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDramatic Campaign\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, a new type of campaign\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ethat includes player characters with rich backstories, complex emotions, and personal motivations. Each character is fully integrated into the campaign world and the story of the adventure, giving players and GMs a chance to fully immerse themselves in the world and its adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.minotaurgames.com/edge-of-eventide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eEdge of Eventide\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is\na dramatic campaign for 5 to 7 participants, built using the Pathfinder RPG\nrules. In this campaign, 4 to 6 of the participants will take on the role of\nplayers, using one of the characters provided by the campaign. The remaining\nparticipant will take on the role of storyteller and GM, using the provided\nadventures and characters to weave a rich and engaging story of adventure,\nloss, regret, and salvation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis campaign is divided up into three acts, with each\nact consisting of three adventures. Each of the nine adventures that make up\nthe campaign is designed to be played in one long play session or two shorter\nsessions. The campaign assumes breaks between each adventure in any case, to\nallow time for special events, new character revelations, and other downtime\nactivities. In total, the campaign should take anywhere between 60 and 80 hours\nto complete.\u00a0I am planning on delivering one adventure every four to six weeks. The best part is that you don\u0027t pay unless I deliver!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnlike in a traditional campaign, players in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.minotaurgames.com/edge-of-eventide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEdge of Eventide\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e campaign must select\nfrom one of six premade characters that come with a deep back-story, personal\ngoals, motivations, and attitudes. Taken as a whole, this makes the group one\nthat has an intricate relationship, with friendships and rivalries, secrets and\nhistory. While much of each character is set, the players are given a wide\u00a0variety of choices to make with their character during selection and throughout play. Some of these\u00a0will have a deep\nand lasting impact on the campaign, while others will simply serve to round out\nthe character and make it a unique expression.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the PDF files, all supporters of this Patreon will have an opportunity to contribute to the process, giving feedback on the adventure and the characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.minotaurgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/E0E_Logo_mix_Small.png\" style=\"width: 247px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport Levels\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eTo help me fund this campaign, I have created a number of different support levels to give you the flexibility to help in a way that suits your group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdventurer ($1/Adv)\u003c/strong\u003e: This is for players of the campaign.

While I am designing the adventure to be both fun and challenging, much of the richness comes from the connection that the characters have to the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre the characters customizable?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eYes, in fact each of the characters offers a broad number of choices both in terms of rules and personality. While two players taking on the role of Leylinia will have a lot in common, each will have a different experience with the possibility of a wildly different fate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhere is the campaign set?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThe details of the campaign world are left intentionally a little vague so that the GM can set the events of Edge of Eventide into any game world. That said, the adventure also provides all of the material needed to run the game, including maps of the region, towns, and adventure locales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is the appropriate age for participants of the campaign?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEdge of Eventide is designed for players ages 13 and up, but there are some themes that explore the darker parts of the adventurer\u0027s experience. While sexuality is not a central issue of the campaign, there are issues that deal with depression, alcoholism, and infidelity. These are not the guiding themes of the campaign, but they do play a part in some of the characters. Options will be provided to minimize or even eliminate these aspects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWill there be a print edition of this campaign?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThere could be, but that is not part of the plan for this Patreon campaign. If there does end up being a print edition, backers of this campaign will receive as big of a discount as I can manage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch4\u003ePartners\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://syrinscape.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.minotaurgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Syrinscape-logoart-and-logo-Which-Bigger-Syrinscape-copy.png\" style=\"width: 215px; float: right;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIn the coming months, I am hoping to bring the \u003cem\u003eEdge of Eventide \u003c/em\u003eto a variety of digital platforms and PDF stores.
