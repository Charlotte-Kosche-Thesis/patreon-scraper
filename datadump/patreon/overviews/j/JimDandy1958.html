    "summary": "If you were to do a Google search for \"Mql4 lessons\" \u00a0you will most likely see that I am on the first page of results several times. This is because there are not a lot of people in the world who want to spend the time, effort \u00a0and money doing research and buying recording software to teach a few people(relatively speaking) a \u00a0relatively obscure and sometimes frustrating language that is constantly being modified by the software developer.(metaquotes)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 It\u0027s not exactly as well known as .... Html5, Css3, Php, Java, Perl, Ruby, Python and so on.... I did not start down this road with the idea of making \u00a0a profit, but to simply help others sort out this puzzle. I didn\u0027t realize though, how much it would cost me to do this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Now, due to requests, I\u0027ve started a site for downloading free files (\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jimdandyforex.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.jimdandyforex.com\u003c/a\u003e ) and more recently a subscriber only site containing video tutorial courses (\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.learnmql4.com.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.learnmql4.com\u003c/a\u003e ). I have produced many videos on this subject on Youtube and in my \u00a0subscriber site. Some of them an hour long (a bit too much).\u00a0Making videos and maintaining websites really adds up to many, many, hours spent away from my real life!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I enjoy teaching this but can only continue to make videos with your nod of approval. By becoming my Patron you are telling me that you want to see more videos on this subject. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I make many videos for youtube that are not mql4 lessons. Those are free to all. It is only when I produce a lesson that teaches how to do something in programming that you will be asked to contribute.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 So....\u00a0If you are able to pledge a couple of bucks (less than the price of a starbucks coffee) for a video as a way of saying thanks that would be great!\u00a0You set how much you will give per video and your monthly limit. Keep in mind that this is only if I produce a video about mql4 programming. Otherwise no body spends anything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Hopefully, with your help I can devote more of my time to making new 15-20 minute videos with the new revised information in it. This is short enough that people can watch them on their lunch breaks or while commuting and not be tied to the computer for an hour. Keeping someone\u0027s attention for an hour in this day in age is asking a lot. So what is an Mql4 lesson worth to you? A cup of coffee? A newspaper?\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Please consider skipping that cup of Starbuck\u0027s \u00a0and become a patron. It\u0027s easy! Just fill in the info!\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for reading all of this.\u003cbr\u003ePipPip....Jimdandy\u003cbr\u003e"
