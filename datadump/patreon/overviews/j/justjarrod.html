    "summary": "Hello everybody! My name is JustJarrod and here on the channel we have continued coverage of both No Man\u0027s Sky and Dreams! Two very unique and special indie titles that have a special place in my heart! I\u0027ve covered No Man\u0027s Sky by way of news updates, montages, community videos, and gameplay, for almost 2 years now, and we\u0027ve grown a community of 3,000 plus strong from that! Now we cover Media Molecule\u0027s next game, Dreams, as well! A game where you can actually make your dreams come true and create whatever you want! Dreams and No Man\u0027s Sky coverage will continue for a long time to come in the form of news update videos, montages, gameplay, community videos, challenge videos, livestreams, community livestreams, and other fun projects along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe community is most important to me, so far after 2 years of making videos on YouTube, I couldn\u0027t have asked for better a better community, so thank you all very much for making this ride all the better! Here\u0027s to the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what am I doing here on Patreon? Well, I debated making a Patreon account because I wasn\u0027t sure it fit with what I was doing, but I realized that some people wanted to help me and the channel out by way of donation, which, in all honesty, is amazing. Everything that comes through Patreon goes straight to bettering the content I make on YouTube. Whether it\u0027s upgrading my microphone, or getting acoustic foam for my walls (current goal) all the support goes 100% towards equipment. Patron rewards will eventually be a thing once I get a few ideas that are actually cool, those rewards will probably be focused around No Man\u0027s Sky and Dreams apparel/items. Until then, thank you so much to everyone who has supported me! I can\u0027t wait to see where the channel, and the community goes from here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
