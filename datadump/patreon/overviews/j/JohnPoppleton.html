I\u0027m a twenty year veteran of wedding and portrait photography who, in recent years, unexpectedly found his niche and passion in Black Light Photography and UV Body Painting. I love art! I love the beauty of the world around me and I love the beauty of the human, especially female, form. I\u0027ve always been fascinated by black lights and fluorescent colors as well. I\u0027ve combined these passions in what I call Black Light Bodyscapes. Through the use of fluorescent body paint I paint scenes from nature and outer space on the body and photograph them under black light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t31.0-8/12363236_10206561868583576_1176530310179185569_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon you ask? \u003c/strong\u003e- Patreon is a site where fans can support their favorite artists on an ongoing basis. If you\u0027re a fan of my work and would like to help make it possible for me to continue doing what I do best or help take what I\u0027m currently doing to the next level, then this is your chance. For as little as $1 per month you can make a huge difference in what the future holds for me and my art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your support\u003c/strong\u003e -\u00a0\u00a0I\u0027ve come a long way in the last five years but with your support I could go so much further, faster. I\u0027ve been blessed with UV body paint sponsors but there are still so many materials yet to try. With better lighting and camera equipment I will be able to produce higher quality images and videos. During the winter, just being able to heat the studio would go a long ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who are true fans of my work, you eagerly await the posting of my latest image. Freed from the distractions of how I\u0027m going to keep the electricity on, through your support I will be able to dedicate my time and energy to releasing new images on a regular consistent basis. I\u0027ll be able to try new materials, start incorporating props, build small sets, and actually pay my models! As the patron collective grows so will my ability to create on a larger scale and the more time I will be able to devote to Patreon and my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUYp8G60dvE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you can expect\u003c/strong\u003e - Patreon is a new adventure for me, as well as for most of you. I therefore need to take \"baby steps\" while I get it figured out. I plan to do this by under promising and hopefully over delivering. My goal is to release every month, 2-4 new body painting images, at least one of which will be exclusive to Patreon, and one \"behind the scenes\" video. Patrons will have the advantage of seeing my latest work one week in advance of it being released to other sites and the exclusive images will only be found on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot everything I do is a scene painted on the body but most of it does involve the use of Black Lights and the female figure. I\u0027ll post a variety of side projects each month and refer to the \"suggestions box\" to get a feel for what patrons want to see most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/t31.0-8/12375116_10206562317794806_7802086445878592863_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor patrons that want to be more than just a supporter I\u0027ve created some upper level \"Collector\" tiers. These levels will include physical limited edition greeting cards, prints and books only found on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs milestone goals are reached, every patron at any level will receive a bonus photo greeting card thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future I will also start to include Black Light Photography and UV Body Painting \"How To\" videos. This will most likely start as soon as I can afford to hire an official cameraman to follow me around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line\u003c/strong\u003e - It\u0027s not easy asking for help. I love what I\u0027m doing and will do as much as I can afford to do. If you\u0027re a fan of my work and are in a position to help a little or a lot it will be greatly appreciated. Even if it\u0027s as little as $1 per month, with strength in numbers it can make a huge difference! Thank you so much! I look forward to sharing my latest creations with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

After graduating in 1989 I relocated to the mountains of Northern Utah where I started a career as a portrait and wedding photographer. After more than twenty years of weddings I retired from the portrait business enabling me to devote all of my time to more artistic aspects of photography. I love anything that makes my work different including Infrared but I\u0027m mostly known for my UV body paintings and black light photography.",

     "description": "When working with black light you\u0027re working in very low levels of light that make it challenging to get great results. Slower shutter speeds have to be used requiring the camera to be mounted on a tripod and the subject to hold perfectly still but many times not still enough. Had I got into black light photography sooner my earlier equipment never would have cut it. The camera equipment I\u0027ve been using lately has been amazing but still has it\u0027s limits, especially in video which requires faster shutter speeds. Recent developments in technology have taken cameras to a whole new level of low light sensitivity to the point that I could use the camera hand held and even capture subjects in motion. I would also be able to create much better \"behind the scenes\" and \"how to\" videos while working in the dark.",

It\u0027s a separate building next door to the main building that doubles as a home and a home office. It\u0027s over 100 years old and has no plumbing or insulation to keep the heat in. During the winter it takes hours to heat and if the model needs to use the bathroom they have to put on a robe and go next door only to find out one of the kids is taking a bath in the only bathroom we have. One model at this point asked for some toilet paper and a flashlight and went out back. Not very professional on my part. At this total monthly pledge I\u0027ll be able to expand the studio, add a bathroom and insulate the walls making it much easier to heat and keep warm.",
