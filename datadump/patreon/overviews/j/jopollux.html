    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Jo, and I love creating mysterious and edgy black and white photography and erotic films. It\u2019s amazing that you\u2019re here to explore my page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy brain is filled with the visuals of film noir, smokey interiors, ivy-draped forests and long brick alleyways. Although most of the artists that inspire me, such as Brassai, Helmut Newton, and Mapplethorpe work with intense atmosphere and smouldering sexuality, they are also dead white men, and with the exception of Mapplethorpe tend to shoot with an \u2018outsider\u2019 view. I am a white, queer identified European femme photographer who works with other artists and models from my own underground community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI first discovered photography as a teenager through my father, who shared my fascination with cameras. My  visual expression started to take shape when I lived in Paris in my early 20\u2019s, where I met a group of artists who inspired me. I studied  Arts and Communication at The Academy of Fine arts in Vienna before moving to Berlin, where I currently reside and take inspiration from the stories between the walls of the city.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLocation is very important to me, and some of my favourite places to shoot are cellars, graveyards, abandoned buildings and ruins. Beyond BDSM  images, I\u2019m working on queer re-telling of classical stories and concepts  (such as Romeo and Juliet and the Seven Deadly Sins) and themes around witchery,the occult and ritual practices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy fascination with photography is based in the construction and translation of the image. I feel compelled to build the worlds that I see from an internal eye and share them with others, or to translate waking dreams into pictures. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy themes come mostly from investigations of desire, kink and fantasy. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy goal through patreon is to raise a budget to be able to fairly pay the people I work with and therefore support the artistic community around me. That, and rent.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027d love to share my experience and knowledge with  you, through behind the scenes images and anecdotes, and \u0027making of\u0027 series\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI enjoy hearing and visualising the fantasies of others. Do you have a desire I can make come true through photographic creation?\u003cbr\u003e"
