     "about": "James Payne was three years old when he first started painting with pastels. His fascination for visual art only grew as he began experimenting with as many facets as possible, such as designing clothes, making charcoal drawings, and drawing sports pictures. But painting was at the heart of everything, and by 18 the fascination had turned into an obsession.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayne\u0027s first collaboration with music was with Chapel Paralys, an 8-piece psychedelic metal band from St. Louis. Although the project was short-lived, Payne realized-most noticeably throu\u0026lt;wbr\u0026gt;gh live performances-that his work as a painter was somehow entwined with music. After the birth of Payne\u0027s daughter in 2009 he left Chapel Paralys and was invited to work with Soundscape, an instrumental band. It was there he truly began to develop his process of painting alongside music. \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAlthough he does not always paint while listening to bands play instruments, Payne claims that he is always painting to music. Whether it\u0027s the hum of an air conditioner, the laugh-track from a sitcom, or even the sound check on a stage, James Payne is never sure what colors he is going to paint with nor what patterns will emerge until the sound vibrations have inspired him. Similar to a bass player melding to a drum beat, Payne\u0027s art responds and compliments whatever melody arises.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhat Payne attempts to do through his paintings is to document, subjectively, the ways in which elements shift and patterns emerge in nature. From cloud formations, to crackling fire, to flowing rivers, to eroded land formations, every piece of organic material has a story, a cycle, and a pattern that can be documented from an original perspective.  That originality of perspective comes from one specific place for James Payne: sound. \u003cbr\u003eJames Payne has painted at over 40 music festivals, mainly in St. Louis and the Midwest area, and has sold upwards of a thousand pieces. He was born in 1984 in St. Louis, Mo. and credits most of his creative influence to his mother.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
