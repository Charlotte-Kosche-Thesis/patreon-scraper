    "summary": "I\u0027ve been playing the piano since the age of ten. As of 2009 I started putting my music online on YouTube. I noticed a huge interest from the start and figured that this was something that I would love to pursue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in a tight spot financially, and to have your support through these rough times helps out more than you could ever imagine. The year of 2017 have been really rough for me, but knowing that I could always find comfort from having your support helps out a lot in my well-being. If you would consider becoming a Patreon to help me pursue music even more I would be forever grateful, no matter how big or small of a donation. Even a single dollar helps out so much. Without you I would never be able to have this opportunity from the first place, so thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to be able to focus more on my music, but my everyday life and stress takes up so much time. With your support, I would be able to focus more energy on my music.\u00a0I truly appreciate all the support and love from you. I wish you all the best. Thank you."
