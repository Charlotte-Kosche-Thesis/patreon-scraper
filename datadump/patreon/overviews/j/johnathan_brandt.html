I have carried stories in my head for the last 30 years and I never put them to paper permanently for fear that they were terrible - hopefully you will read a page or 2 and let me know that they are not too terrible (nervous chuckle).\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a little sample (page 4 of the comic):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://kreeategame.biz/videos/sample.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*No seriously, they might be terrible. I am an awful judge of these things - I LIKED Attack of the Clones.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first story has very little to do with Robots or tech.\u00a0 \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is about perception, greed, anger love and a bunch of other stuff. I am influenced daily while listening to the news, sitting in traffic, standing in a queue trying to buy a sandwich or watching my gorgeous wife while she gardens (don\u0027t ask me how I managed to marry her, I was as shocked as everyone else that she agreed to go on a date, let alone marry me! 3\u0027s can land a 10 fellas, it just takes a lot of effort)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThings that make me happy or angry or sad directly influence the work. I hope it shows and I hope that my patrons share with me their philosofys...phylosophis(flip how do you spell that?)...ideas on the world. Talk to me about tragedy, talk to me about hope, tell me what music you love inspire me!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
