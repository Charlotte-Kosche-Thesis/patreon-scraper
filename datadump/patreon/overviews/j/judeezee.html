    "summary": "Hello everyone! I\u0027m Judee, (aka Astrayeah on other places) a 20-something freelance illustrator who\u00a0likes to cover songs from various anime and videogames on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWanna hear my story? Read on.\u003cbr\u003eHate tl;dr material? Scroll further down XD\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome years ago, I came across\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/adrisaurus\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea talented YouTuber\u003c/a\u003e who does all these amazing vocal renditions from the OST of a certain DS game that I really really like--and you know what? That\u0027s actually the first time I became aware of cover artists on Youtube. Songwriting had been one of my secret hobbies, so one day, I wrote my English take on a certain Final Fantasy song.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI figured it would sound better if said YouTuber sang this instead of myself, (and probably because I still didn\u0027t have the confidence to sing \"in public,\" lol) so I sent my lyrics to her and eventually, she made a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzYpXgZw-5o\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecover\u003c/a\u003e out of it! It felt great to hear the lyrics that I wrote in an actual song, so eventually I managed to muster up the courage to work on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast track another couple of years until I had like, almost 1k subs on YouTube. \"Oh wow, almost 4 digits, yay! I guess I should try to sound better on my next cover--no wait, I SHOULD BUY A NICE MICROPHONE!\" I only used a Skype mic at first, and then the usual mic that everyone uses for sing-alongs. :\u0027D At that time I didn\u0027t have a stable job so it took quite a while until I saved enough money to buy a kinda-okay condenser microphone that cost around a hundred dollars.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI kept on making covers (and parodies eventually) until the subscriber count ballooned into 10k in just a year and a half, much to my surprise. This is the point of no return, I guess. I\u0027ve no other choice but to keep improving with each song.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way I purchased some additional equipment using my hard-earned money. Sadly, all the stuff that I spent and still have to spend are kinda in the way of my living expenses which includes my share on the rent plus the extra money that I pitch in to send my three younger step-siblings to school. ALSO, WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY THAT I STILL HAFTA SPEND ON TOYS AND VIDEO GAMES!?!??!

In my case, I only charge once a month.\u00a0Patrons are also free to opt out at any time.

In order to produce some awesome content a lot more quicker than usual, I\u0027m really going to need other people to help me out.\u00a0Hiring a good musician, hiring a skilled mixer or recording in a studio, getting better equipment, an animator...they\u0027re all going to cost a lot! HALP!\u003c/strong\u003e (Ughhh I\u0027m so sorry for being poor!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube has been strict lately when it comes to copyrights that\u0027s why I don\u0027t plan on using copyrighted material for my covers anymore.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s either I hire a musician or work on a backing track by myself. Hiring is the best option for me because it saves time and the music would sound better. (i\u0027m just a noob so my arrangements aren\u0027t that great lololol) \u003cstrong\u003eRight now I\u0027m using my own money for covers\u003c/strong\u003e and it\u0027s such a struggle to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll proceeds will go to the people that I work with and the stuff that I need to have a better recording area.\u003c/strong\u003e I live in a VERY noisy house, so as much as possible I need to do something about lessening the noise or I have to move out so I can record in peace. To be able to sing all these songs in a soundproofed place would make me really happy!\u00a0I also plan on working on stuff that doesn\u0027t have to do with music someday--prolly let\u0027s plays, interviews or skits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt is my goal to produce at least one content every two weeks, and should you decide to help me out, that tiny dream would become a reality. \u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s completely okay if you don\u0027t btw, it ain\u0027t mandatory! The stuff that I make won\u0027t change, and I will still work harder in order to make stuff that would make y\u0027all happy!
