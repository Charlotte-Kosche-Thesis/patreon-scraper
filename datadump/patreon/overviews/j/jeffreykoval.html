    "summary": "I\u0027ve always enjoyed learning about various financial services online and what drives people to spend and dedicate their time \u0026amp; attention to. I have also created numerous things, to varying degrees of notoriety and scope, that exist out there in void, but never really sought to or conceived of a tangible product out of the lot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite banner ads can be tacky and tend to take away from the overall aesthetic of pretty design, and I can also only ask my lovely readers to buy a book so many times before I sound insane (a justifiable concern). So, I am now turning my attention to this interesting platform, Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI must make it clear and insist that these proceeds do not go directly to the creation of one of the largest projects I am involved in, EverymanHYBRID. I love my brothers in production and if there was a monetization program in the works for the Monolith, it would be a joint endeavor, and as such, I do not want to give false pretenses or misdirection in hoping you become a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will be a focus on the realm of creativity between my main site, my personal YouTube (just now growing), original content tumblr, and future published works (digital and paperback).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you found this: firstly, a warm thank you, and welcome to my world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeffrey Koval, 2016\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I have been using the Patreon platform for just over a year now, I believe, and have enjoyed the format and ease of it all. Obviously, beyond the site, I am ever grateful and appreciative of those of you who have supported and continue to support me and my creative endeavors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not think I want to change any short-term goals (that is, I do anticipate a printed collection to be compiled eventually) and think that maybe a revision can be made once larger projects come to a happy conclusion and allow for a more focused operation to be incorporated with Patreon and its model. While current output may not be overwhelming, I do keep a live complete library of my written work for supporters, or as I once put it, a horribly depressing, written Netflix subscription. :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe optimism and cautious giddiness for the future I\u2019ve shared in the original text still applies. In the spare time that a rewarding professional career in my State\u2019s government has afforded me, I like to think that I\u2019m either taking care of myself with light exercise, finding needed rest or spending the time with wonderful people, or creating. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for that, and many other achievements and gifts I\u2019ve been granted (and as a small piece of blue string tied to my backpack is always there to remind me): I am gracious. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeffrey Koval, 2018"
