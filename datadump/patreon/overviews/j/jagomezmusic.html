I am here because I love\nto write music, and I love to work with talented musicians to bring my music to\nlife. Here you will be able to find video recorded performances of my work, and\nif you too love what I do, please consider supporting my projects by becoming a\npatron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor as little as\u003cstrong\u003e $1 per creation\u003c/strong\u003e, you will have access to my feed as\nwell as high quality MP3 downloads of the music you find here. Your\ncontribution helps me to continue hiring great musicians to perform my music\nand skilled audio engineers to record it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now my music will consist\nof short sketches for various chamber ensembles, but in the future, I hope to\ntake on larger projects consisting of larger groups as well. This all relies on\nthe continued support of patrons to make this a reality. If you are not ready\nto become a patron just yet, that\u2019s ok too! You will still have access to my\nmusic for free either on here or on my Youtube page. You can find that link\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCH1Vuhq0E20hagLSDCEaQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy my music.
