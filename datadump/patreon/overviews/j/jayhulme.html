    "summary": "I\u0027m a young transgender performance poet, speaker, and educator. I spend most of my time trying to make the world a better place through acceptance and art (and the rest of the time on trains getting to the venues I do those things in).\u00a0My poetry on trans rights has been the focus of a TEDx talk and featured in an Amnesty International teaching resource, and the rest of my work has been published in numerous books, including a children\u2019s anthology that is studied in some schools. This means I\u2019m often contacted by teachers and other educators asking me to come and do some work with their young people but the cost of living prohibits me from doing anywhere near as many cheap or free jobs as I\u2019d like to. You can help with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think poetry should be free, and for everyone, sadly, my rent bill does not agree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePoetry can, and does, change lives, particularly when it tackles social issues, and is used to address those who need it most. I believe very strongly that everyone should have access to poetry, and the changes that can make in a persons life, changes I have seen firsthand, and this patreon account is there for you to help me continue to do that. Thank you."
