    "summary": "Hello friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are reading this you likely know who I am. If you don\u0027t, I do a podcast called JuRY. It started as an experiment, a chance for me to do a one-mic show where I would talk for an hour about whatever I wanted to. Sometimes it was about current events, other times it was an outlet for personal stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut a funny thing happened: people started to talk back. Over the last year a remarkable community has sprung up around the show. Folks shared their own stories about virginity, loss, death, betrayal and more. It\u0027s been an amazing transformation. It created an awesome dialogue about issues ranging from the deadly serious to jizz jokes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings went SO well that I just started doing a Politics podcast named Politics Politics Politics. That way I can indulge my love all things ballot-related with this amazing community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so now we\u0027re here. I think the show is ready to take a leap forward and currently has the momentum to do so. The Patreon will give people a chance to support the content they like and possibly get a lot more of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me won\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJustin"
