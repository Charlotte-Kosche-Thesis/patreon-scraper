I have dedicated the last 22 years to researching and writing the history of crime in Portland. While my history is often focused on murder and other crime, it is not solely about that. I work in a variety of media writing books and blogposts, as well as songs and musical drama, films and podcasts. Currently I am writing fiction in various genres and I will be spotlighting my project Werewolf of Portland.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI believe this is the best way for an artist to find an audience. My blogs and podcast have received excellent support and now it is time to introduce my fiction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Werewolf of Portland is a new project I have been working on that creates an exciting horror story within the context of Portland history. Set between the 1870s and 1915 this serial will adapt European legends of the Werewolf to a historically accurate American setting. It is a kickass story and each episode will include an original illustration created by artist Caitlin McMorris.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Much Will it Cost?\u003cbr\u003eMinimum pledge is $1 per post. That will give you access to everything on my page. I intend to post a new episode of Werewolf of Portland about every three weeks. In addition I will continue to post to my blog and podcast on an irregular basis. My pledge is that I will never charge for more than four posts per month (at this point I plan about 2 posts per month.) You are free to put a cap on your posts (minimum $1 per month).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting my work.
