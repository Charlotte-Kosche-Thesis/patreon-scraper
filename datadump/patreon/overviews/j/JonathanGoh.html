It was inspired by Tolkien\u0027s Lay of Leithian and set in a medieval backdrop where characters are anthropomorphic talking animals. It also functions as a tongue-in-cheek commentary/parody of common cliches found in similar romantic works such as Meyer\u0027s Twilight series.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like poems, animals and fantasy please consider supporting this project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you Get:\u003cbr\u003eSupporters of my projects get to see panels and updates early, with higher tiers meriting bonus content.\u00a0"
