    "summary": "Hey everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Jaron Davis. Very simply, I love to create unique music covers and original tunes. And I spend an immense amount of time composing, arranging, recording, editing, mixing and filming my musical endeavors within a limited time frame. I post videos to YouTube on a weekly to bi-monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy posting a capella pop song covers. So far this has included covering such groups as The Beatles, Beach Boys, Keane and Radiohead, but I have many more covers from these groups and groups such as Muse, David Bowie, Pink Floyd, Queen and many more planned. I try to be as faithful as possible to the original tune, figuring out and emulating each instrument to the best of my ability and range. I\u0027m open to requests, and I\u0027m really looking to expand my repertoire in this area in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy posting a capella video game covers. This forms the majority of my YouTube videos, and I\u0027m hoping to keep adding to these moving forward. I\u0027ve covered well known franchises such as Zelda, Metroid, Pokemon and Castlevania as well as lesser known games like Faxanadu and Terranigma, both tunes that were a part of my childhood and tunes that my fans have requested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy making original material. Taking from influences such as The Beatles, Beach Boys, David Bowie and Radiohead, I like to make creative and experimental pop tunes that are both fresh and interesting, with unique chord progressions and arrangements. My first album, Dark Forest, was released in early 2012 and I\u0027m hoping to follow this up with another album that\u0027s currently in the works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started posting weekly a capella covers on YouTube sometime last year, and that has fallen to about one video every 2-3 weeks this year as the arrangements have become more complex and challenging. Your contribution will ultimately enable me to spend more time creating these videos, allowing me to put them out faster and/or improve the recording and video quality. It will also help me to upgrade my equipment, which will also enhance the quality of the videos and sound. And it will enable me to find more time to create some original tunes and videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your help! I hope to hear from you, and I\u0027m immensely thankful for anything you can offer. Anything from a penny on upwards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJaron Davis\u003cbr\u003e"
