I\u0027ve been in both the furry and vore communities for over ten years!\nI\u0027ve written well over 100+ pieces that have either been shared or kept private\nfor certain commissioners. I\u0027m happy to have written the things I have and hope\nthat those that have read my works over the years have gotten some sort of joy\nout of them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor years I\u0027ve wanted to do interactive stories involving fetish related\nmaterials (mostly centered around vore/transformation and relatable stuff) basically\nI wanted to take the concept of my stories and put it on a grander scale. As a\nkid I always enjoyed choose your own adventure books because it let you be part\nof the stories. It let you insert yourself and explore the world. Every\ndecision you made prompted you to move to another page where the story would\neither continue or end. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the past year or so I\u0027ve noticed an up rise in creators using something\ncalled Quest. This is the program I\u0027ve wanted for years. I\u0027m a little late to\nthe party in doing interactive vore stuff with this program, but I hope to use\nQuest to do many things over the next couple of years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eTHE LOW DOWN\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver the past few years I\u0027ve\nbeen doing a lot more commissions. Getting paid to write about things is\nsomething that makes me happy. I get extra cash dollars and someone gets a\nproduct that they can fully enjoy WINK WINK!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis puts that concept to a\ngrander scale! I write a massive amount of stuff and share it with others! They\nget the chance to help support me so that I write as much as possible when I\nget home from work and during my days off! Plus I figured some people would\nenjoy having their own characters make surprise appearances in the pieces that\nI write about! That is always fun stuff to do! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI understand that supporting\na writer via Patreon is difficult. Words and scenes are difficult to write and\nkeep fresh but I believe if done write a few paragraphs can paint something\neven more beautiful than a single piece of art. That isn\u0027t to say that art\nisn\u0027t great, because it is! Damn sexy art!! I just think writing gets a bad rap\nand is looked at like the weird step child when it comes to comparing it to\nother things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis Patreon is designed to give those supporting me the chance to see my\nprojects before they are shared with the world. You will get constant updates\nwhenever I\u0027ve added new pieces to the current adventure I\u0027m working on. You\nwill be able to vote on any polls that I make up (which can include future game\ntypes, game locations, predator creatures and what they do to other\ncharacters).
