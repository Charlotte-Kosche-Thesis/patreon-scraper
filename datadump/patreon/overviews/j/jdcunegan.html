    "summary": "I\u0027m a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s really what it all boils down to. As far back as I can recall, I\u0027ve had this visceral need to put words on a page. That need has manifested itself in the form of novel writing, and as I write this, I have three-self-published novels to my name, with several more in the works. I published \u003cem\u003eBounty\u003c/em\u003e, a murder mystery/science fiction genre mashup that calls back to my love for comic books, in June 2015, introducing the world to Baltimore homicide cop Jill Andersen, who also doubles as the costumed vigilante Bounty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2016, I published the sequel, \u003cem\u003eBlood Ties\u003c/em\u003e. Then the third book, \u003cem\u003eBehind the Badge\u003c/em\u003e, hit Amazon in June 2016. Along the way, I\u0027ve also written my share of short stories -- including the Kindle-exclusive \u003cem\u003eBoundless\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0-- and I\u0027ve started branching out into other genres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first fantasy novel, \u003cem\u003eNotna\u003c/em\u003e, released on Oct. 10. \u003cem\u003eBehind the Mask\u003c/em\u003e, the fourth book in the Jill Andersen series, followed on Dec. 4. I\u0027ve also got novels in the works, spanning everything from spy thriller to political conspiracy to paranormal mystery. Twelve books in all (so far). Suffice it to say, I have a lot of fires going -- and that\u0027s not even counting my freelance editing or my love for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, this is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s something no one tells you about being self-published: it can be expensive. Between hiring editors and designing book covers and worrying about promotion, a lot of times, you\u0027ll find yourself spending money you might not necessarily have (especially if you\u0027re not one of the better-selling authors). The purpose behind this Patreon is to help me with the expenses of being a self-publishing author. Indie publishing is a tight-knit community; we\u0027re all fans of each other and we try to help whenever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider this me asking for help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel obligated to pledge if you can\u0027t. Money\u0027s not nearly as tight for me as it used to be, but I still remember what it\u0027s like to wonder where your next meal\u0027s gonna come from or how you\u0027re gonna pursue your dream without sinking your bank account into the negative. Even sharing this page with others is a big help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo one gets where they want to be all by themselves. If I\u0027m to achieve my dream of being able to write novels for a living -- of being a bestselling author -- I need to occasionally reach out for help. This doesn\u0027t happen in a vacuum, and it doesn\u0027t happen overnight. This is a long journey, and I would be honored if you\u0027d take that journey with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to those of you who have taken this journey with me, and thank you to those who are just now jumping on board. Let\u0027s make this as much as can, hm?"
