    "summary": "Welcome! I\u2019m so excited you found me here and are interested in becoming part of this community of fiction and essay-loving patrons. As a patron, you get access to my mostly-daily Patreon feed, a sweet, short, and sometimes sassy outpouring of thoughts, tips, quotes, photos, poems, and even WTFs. You also have the opportunity to be the first to see much of what I\u2019m writing and creating, including first drafts of a mystery novel and essay collection, which will become published books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am idea-prone, getting ideas like most people get cravings for pizza, or ice cream, or...fruit? If I can produce one-QUARTER of these ideas by my The End, I\u2019ll have fulfilled my purpose. And what is that Purpose? It is to Notice, Wonder, Correlate, Communicate, and Catalyze! Most of my ideas are for things written, filmed, sung, photographed, published, lived, or incorporated. Some are crazy as hell. But most of them are written. And I\u2019m here because I have enough in my head for a couple of lifetimes in fulltime writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first book is done, ready for you to read. The Oat Project: How I Came of Age and Faced My Fear in One Wild Summer is a memoir about the summer in which I did 25 things I\u0027d never done--sowed my wild oats--at 37, amidst everyday life of mothering three kids and tending a then-husband, in conservative mecca Colorado Springs. All true. Levels beyond normal TMI (\"Too Much Information\"). So your Patron access in this world will usually be up close and personal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is Patreon? This special place is a membership platform that makes it easy for creators to get paid. Patronage has been an essential part of human history for millennia, and now, thanks to this marvelous mashup of the ancient art of patronage and the modern brilliance of collective action via the internet, you become like the kings of old\u2026only nicer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are my goals? Besides becoming self-sustaining (like rent and health insurance), I plan to:\u003cbr\u003eEven before simply becoming self-sustaining in an income, I will finish paying off production costs for The Oat Project.\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I\u2019ll update my tech. Though I\u2019ve managed by writing everything on a tablet, then formatting and publishing with the more powerful computers and software at a local library a few miles north (and uphill), the Colorado winter is coming, and being able to work from my home office (er, garage) without having to drive on ice or snow would be much more efficient\u2026I\u2019ll be much more productive with up-to-date tech.\u003cbr\u003eThird, other project books I\u2019d like to get going require classes and travel, including one about dancing and a sequel to The Oat Project! The BIG goal for these is to also film them, creating a documentary movie or series.\u003cbr\u003eAnd fourth (though probably not last), both current and future books would benefit from consistent marketing dollars. From tools to make media integration and communication more efficient to more video production to ads, it takes capital to get the word out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, I\u0027m excited to connect with you all here! It\u0027s a terrific community, and I can\u0027t wait to begin to pass along support to other artists and creators. And I can\u0027t wait to get started on the two new book projects and excited for you to read them! \u003cbr\u003e"
