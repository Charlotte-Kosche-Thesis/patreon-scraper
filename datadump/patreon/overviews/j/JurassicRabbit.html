For those that don\u0027t know me, my name is Mitchell Saltzman, and for the last 4 years or so I\u0027ve been working as a video walkthrough producer for GameFront.com\u0027s YouTube channel. But I\u0027ve done much more than just video walkthroughs and let\u0027s plays. I\u0027ve done reviews, previews, in-depth strategy guides, easter egg videos, co-hosted E3 content\u00a0and much much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at some of our most viewed videos and maybe you\u0027ll see something that you recognize me from:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GameFrontDotCom/videos?flow=grid\u0026amp;view=0\u0026amp;sort=p\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/GameFrontDotCom/video...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January of 2015, I was laid off from GameFront, and turned to Patreon to continue my dream of making video game content for an audience that I truly love and want to continue to have part of my life. Your support was amazing, and in my best month, I had more than $800 worth of support! Your help kept me afloat long enough to get a PR job that provided me with much needed stability and gave me a way to deal with the taxes that I owed for the previous year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my Youtube Channel now sitting at 11,000ish subscribers, I decided that I wanted to give my dreams one more shot. With that, I left my PR job and I\u0027m relaunching this Patreon with renewed focus, new ideas, and a determination to make it work with your help and generosity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
