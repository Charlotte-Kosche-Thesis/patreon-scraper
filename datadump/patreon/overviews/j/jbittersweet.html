I would not be able to make those YouTube\u00a0videos without you, so you are doing me, and all the people benefiting\u00a0from my videos, a huge favor... so thank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is JBittersweet and I am a YouTuber making videos on meditation and alternative health helping you reach a state of inner calmness and peace, reducing stress and anxiety, while boosting your self-esteem and self-love, as you learn to calm your mind and body and get in touch with your inner self. I make both guided meditation videos and more informative videos on anything health, spiritual and meditation related.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been\npracticing meditation for many years now, and I am simply sharing what I have\nlearned over the years to help you guys recreate balance in your life free of\nstress, worries and anxiety. In this busy world we live in, it is very easy to\nget overwhelmed by deadlines, responsibilities and expectations, making us\nanxious, stressed out and depressed\u2026 unable to fully enjoy life and feel in\ncontrol. Meditation has had a huge impact on my life, and all the things that\nused to make me upset, no longer have the same effect on me, as meditation helps\nyou center yourself and simply become a much calmer and balanced person\u2026 fully\nin control of your emotions. The list of the benefits there are with meditation\nis endless, and I truly believe that it can transform your life\u2026 taking you\nfrom a place of sadness and frustration to a place of total calmness and\nserenity. That is why I make these videos. I make them to help you guys\nexperience the wonderful life-changing results of daily meditation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo this was\na little introduction on who I am and the vision I have with my YouTube\nchannel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Does\nPatreon Work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe concept\nof Patreon is to allow people to financially support content creators and\nartists so that they are able to provide you with helpful content. Since I am a\nYouTube, my content will be regular video uploads on YouTube helping you\nachieve inner calmness, peace of mind and spiritual awareness. So if you wish\nto support me, then what you will have to do, is to select how much you want to\ndonate on a monthly basis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are 4\nlevels of which you can support me. You choose the level you like, and then each\nmonth you will automatically donate the chosen amount. It works like a monthly\nsubscription, which you of course can cancel at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Will\nthe Money Go To?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\ndecide to support me, then that money will go to the creation process. Your\ndonation will make it possible for me to continue creating free YouTube content\nand improve the quality of the videos, making them even better so that they can\nhelp \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e achieve your spiritual and\nhealth related goals for a balanced and peaceful life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support and generosity...
