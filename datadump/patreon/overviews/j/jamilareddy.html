I am a writer, speaker, and personal development coach passionate about helping people live joyful, liberated, \u003cem\u003eextraordinary\u003c/em\u003e lives.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a 28-year-old black queer Buddhist writer + wellness advocate making the most out of this life and striving to help others do the same. My vision is to create a global community of people dedicated to overcoming things that stand in the way of their absolute happiness.You can get to know me better \u003ca href=\"http://jamilareddy.me/blog-1/allow-me-to-reintroduce-myself\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(5, 45, 73);\"\u003eHow I Make It Happen\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI enact this vision through writing, public speaking, workshops, and one-on-one coaching/advice calls.\u00a0My work, in short, is to help people (like you!) figure out simple but profound ways to get closer to their best life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay Jamila. Sounds cool...but. What Do You Actually Do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+\u003cem\u003e I challenge people to reflect on themselves and their lives \u003c/em\u003e\u2014 to do the difficult (but necessary) work required of them to achieve their dreams and claim their desires. By speaking truthfully about my experience \u2014 and sharing the ways that I am getting ever closer to a more liberated life \u2014 I open the doors for other people to do the same. I connect people to their potential and activate a curiosity within them about how to use their power. I encourage people to let go of things that no longer serve their higher purpose and to courageously pursue that which does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ \u003cem\u003eI inspire people to be authentic.\u003c/em\u003e I live in my truth as a black queer Buddhist, doing my best to get free in this body, in this lifetime. I resist shame by claiming the parts of me I have been taught not to love. I tell my stories and put my own images into the world as an act of resistance against distorted representations and the myth of \"normalcy.\" I allow myself to be vulnerable in my personal life, and then I share what I\u0027ve learned from doing so. I show people that there is value in letting oneself be seen. I remind people that they don\u0027t have to perform or pretend to be someone they aren\u0027t. I express myself fully and freely, in hopes that it encourages others to do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ \u003cem\u003eI encourage people to take care of themselves. \u003c/em\u003eI model what it looks like to practice self-care consistently. I live by example, and share my process of loving myself in action so that other people can see what it looks like. I affirm my humanity by acknowledging when I\u0027ve failed to take care of myself, and I name (without shame or guilt) the areas of my life in which I can grow and improve. I contextualize self-care as more than just a social media buzzword. I affirm that it is okay to rest, it\u0027s okay to prioritize yourself, it\u0027s okay to say no. I remind people that the GOAL of life is living well. I help people awaken to their unlimited potential. I help them understand the value of their lives. I remind them that they are capable of greatness and that they are in control of getting there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You Should Support Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo I can turn my side hustle into my day job. \u003c/em\u003eIn order for me to serve\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003emy community, I \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to be able to support myself!
