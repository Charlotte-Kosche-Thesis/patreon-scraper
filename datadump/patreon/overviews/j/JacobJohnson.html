If you\u0027ve managed to land here you probably already know who I am and what I\u0027m doing, but just in case...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Jacob. I\u0027m a musician based in the Dallas, TX area. I began studying music at 4 years old, and I have been captivated ever since.\u00a0I have 26 years of public performance experience in a wide variety of disciplines and on a variety of instruments, though I mostly focus on the renaissance lute and classical guitar these days.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, artists relied on the generosity of wealthy patrons in order to have the freedom to practice their art. With a patron\u0027s favor an artist could focus time and energy creating art rather than doing whatever needs must not to starve. That\u0027s part of why I came to Patreon, in fact. Patreon supporters today are able to do for the arts what the Medici family did in the renaissance, and I was excited at the opportunity to participate in that tradition. The best thing about Patreon is that this unique patron/artist relationship is no longer the realm of the ultra-wealthy alone, nor is it limited by geographical location. Each Patreon supporter can choose a level that is comfortable for them, and can participate in the art that excites them most from their own home.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, ok, ok. But what does your money actually do? Really, it will all come down to how much is pledged per month. As the pledges grow, I will be able to take on more and more adventurous projects and offer greater rewards for my patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Jacob Johnson is a musician based in the Dallas area. Mr. Johnson specializes in guitar and lute performance, and offers personalized private instruction. His repertoire spans the 15th century to the current day, and includes many popular tunes arranged for solo guitar. Mr. Johnson is a published arranger and composer of music for guitars and other instruments, and has been published as a music essayist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMr. Johnson has always been drawn to music; from the daily pestering of his parents to get him piano lessons at just 4 years old, he knew his calling in life. He later pursued the trumpet, eventually performing as soloist with the renowned Wind Symphony of the Greater Dallas Youth Orchestra after winning their annual concerto competition. He began his collegiate career as a trumpet performance major, but having taught himself to play folk, blues, rock, pop, and heavy metal guitar in his teens, he was captivated by his discovery of the \u003cem\u003eclassical\u003c/em\u003e guitar at college. He quit the trumpet department and devoted himself to the classical guitar. Since 2006, Mr. Johnson has studied classical guitar with some of the world\u0027s finest performers in private lessons as well as in masterclass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, Mr. Johnson placed as a semifinalist in two of the three international classical guitar competitions on his circuit. Mr. Johnson acquired his first lute and began studying in the fall of 2014, and in less than 2 months, he was performing in masterclass for one of the greatest lutenists alive, Hopkinson Smith. Mr. Johnson was a semifinalist in the 2015 Texas Guitar Festival and International Concert Artist Competition at UTD, and took the 2nd Place Prize in the 2015 Mountain View College Professional Division Guitar Competition. In November of 2015, Mr. Johnson won the Advanced Division of the 9th Annual Collin College Guitar Competition. Mr. Johnson is currently working on his first cd\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003eand release information will be forthcoming.",
