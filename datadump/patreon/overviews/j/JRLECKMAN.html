Leckman\u003c/a\u003e. Welcome to my sparkly new Patreon page! Thank you so much for dropping by and checking things out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a horror/fantasy writer exploring new avenues to find homes for the stories I have written. I am the author of three novels in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jrleckman.com/the-legend-of-kimberly.html\"\u003eLegend of Kimberly series\u003c/a\u003e (with book four to come!) as well as a collection of some horror shorts that are floating around the web. I am looking to expand my reader base, and that is why I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the real world, I am a science teacher. As noble as the profession is, it eats away at the one thing I don\u0027t have enough of: Time. \u00a0Anybody who has followed me for a long period of time knows that I would rather write my heart out than do about anything else, and I think this page could be the first step to such a dream. I typically spend my summers generating most of my content and then nickel-and-diming it throughout the work year, which means my free time is almost exclusively dedicated to writing new things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI not only enjoy writing novels, but love writing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/they-dont-exist/id412105272?mt=11\"\u003escary short stories\u003c/a\u003e. This page could become a landing page for the library of stories that just sits on my computer with nowhere to go. I have debated trying to publish them through anthologies (etc), but the payoff is extremely small and the rights to said stories can get dicey depending on the publisher. However, this Patreon gives me a unique opportunity to maximize my own efforts while delivering the content that you deserve, and will become a landing page for my short stories, both rough and final.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of tales, this Patreon does have a giant end goal. On top of unlocking a larger reader pool, the money I make from this will be applied directly to my novels. I am a firm believer in giving my readers the best experience possible, which is why I pay good money to have my stories professionally edited, formatted, etc. I already have two complete novels that are past revision and await professional editing services, but as a teacher (and new dad) it has been tough to generate a large enough revenue stream to simply purchase these services outright. Once goals are met for novels, I will be using the money generated to publish them on multiple platforms. If the ultimate goal of \"Make Enough Money to Make This My Full Time Job\" ever happens, then this page will become my office!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
