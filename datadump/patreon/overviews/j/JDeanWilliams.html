    "summary": "Josiah Williams can be defined as a lyrically expressive, adult-kid who leaves it all on the stage, and allows his faith to be the center of his artistry! As a performing and creative artist, Josiah utilizes his God-given gifts as an actor, an emcee, a percussionist, a photographer \u0026amp; videographer, public speaker, digital editor, and he leads with his work as a musician.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWilliams\u2019 music is reflective, fresh, and engages in truthful storytelling; his recording style is backed by a high-energy, dynamic, crowd-engaging mode of performance! \u201cIt\u2019s not just about speaking into a microphone, or just performing my material,\u201d Williams says. \u201cMy background is in Theatre Performance, so my goal is always to give the attending audience an unforgettable, inspiring experience through lyrical storytelling.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen listening to a Josiah Williams track, you\u2019ll get a blended earful of Hip-Hop, Rhythmic Soul and Christian Rap. In crafting his work, he always aims to make universal music\u2014songs that are appropriate for all ages, songs for all walks of life, and songs that take the listener on a journey. \u201cI make music for my homies, and everybody is a homie.\u201d\u003cbr\u003eJosiah Williams has been blessed to share performance opportunities with some of his favorite homies: FLAME \u0026amp; Mike Real, Chance the Rapper, Josh Wilson, The Cool Kids, Vic Mensa, Kids These Days, Saba, Klassik, Kat Deluna, AGAPE and many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWilliams gives credit to other multi-talented artists \u0026amp; performers for proving that a versatile skill set can expand one\u2019s career: \u201cI admire Jamie Foxx for all that he does in the entertainment industry. I look up to Trip Lee for preaching the Gospel in every possible way. People like Bruno Mars, Don Cheadle, Janelle Monae, Donald Glover, [Justin] Timberlake, Chance [the Rapper], Andy Mineo, HBK [Shawn Michaels], The Rock, Y2J [Chris Jericho], Jordan Fisher, the list goes on!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe typical road to success is not the path that Josiah Williams has chosen. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m looking to grow, to get better as an artist and communicator, but I\u2019m not seeking fame,\u201d Williams says. \u201cMy goal is to glorify my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ with my work. My goal is to inspire others, to serve others, and ultimately, to be an unforgettable entertainer.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#GloryToGod | #LivingForHim | #PerfectlyImperfect | #ReroutingAlbum\u003cbr\u003e"
