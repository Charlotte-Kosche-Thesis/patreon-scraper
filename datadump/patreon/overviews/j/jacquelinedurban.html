Over the last seventeen years,\nI have led workshops and spoken internationally on death and dying\nand on connection and communion with She~Who~Is; the Sacred Feminine\nand the hallowed land, through all religions and none. I believe that there is a thread to follow through all of these; the river~beneath~the~river, and that there is much empowerment and healing for us all to be found in bringing it into consciousness. This is the work that I love to do. I am particularly interested in those places\nand aspects of life that are pushed to the edges and brushed under\nthe carpet; the wasteground, the weeds, our death and dying, our sacred wounds, and on the \u0027small beauties\u0027 of life that we so often miss. I stand for kindness, the power of vulnerability, everyday acts \nof small subversion, wild acts of fierce courage, and the quiet magic of\n a whistling kettle and a nice cup of tea. In another life I would\nlike to be a mycologist/librarian/lock keeper and I am sure that such\npeople must exist but, for now, I have dedicated myself to\nconnection, community, creativity, and cultivating wonder. I am good\nat wonder! I have been described as a \u201cword witch\u201d, a\n\"lovely black feathered thing\", and \"a magically\ndelicious cup of toadstool tea\". I hope to live up to all of\nthose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2009 I left my job in public service to\ndedicate my life to my work as a hedgepriestess; through writing, through prayer, and through community. Since that time I have trained as a\npsychospiritual counsellor and worked with the dying and the\nbereaved, with gypsy travellers, and with young children. In 2014,\nalong with my husband Simon, I founded Hedgetemple, a gathering place\nfor those who long for Spirit, the wild, and community, allowing\nthose who follow diverse spiritual paths, or none, to gather in good\ncompany and mutual respect in deep communion with the wild earth. So far our presence has been mostly online but there is so much more that I, and we, want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreate..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ea pack of \u0027Small Beauties\u0027 cards for inspiration and sharing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emy yearly \u0027Small Beauties\u0027 calendar.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea book of poetry \u0027rewilding\u0027 the female saints of the British Isles, in collaboration with wonderful artist friend of mine (but that is a secret). \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea short book about creating \u0027home-made\u0027 funerals and reclaiming death from the funeral industry.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea longer book about the healing that would come from returning the Sacred Feminine to the centre of our lives and how Her loss impacts the way that we think about ourselves and society.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe encouragement of hedgeconsciousness\u0027; one idea I have is to put up beautiful signs on \u0027wasteground\u0027 explaining to people why the wild things growing there matter to bees and other pollinators, to people, and to the healing of heart, spirit, and body.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eat least two posts per week for my Radical Honey blog.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eoffer articles on hedgeconsciousness and death and dying to national newspapers and magazines.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eonline courses and a writing retreat.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eincreasing my online \u0027priestessing\u0027 through videos and live happenings.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebegin to offer workshops and gatherings on connecting with nature and the sacred.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eoffer funeral services as a celebrant along with Simon.
