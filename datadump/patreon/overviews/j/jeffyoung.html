I have some really big plans for the future and our team is asking you to be a part of it all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is blood, sweet, and tears. Artists can work on their craft their whole lives and never see much money from it. Even some of the greats like Mozart were too poor to afford a proper burial. Likewise, artists like Bach, Beethoven, \u0026amp; Haydn relied on patrons to support them while they created their timeless work we still know to this day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy only intention since the day I began playing music was to create art that makes people feel good and possibly even think outside the box. To create songs and videos that entertain people and challenge us as artists. We are\u00a0fortunate to have fans like you! People who are willing to help fortify and be a part of this musical mission of positivity. Your open eyes, ears and support means the world! I have so many ideas for new music \u0026amp; vidoes that will entertain you in so many ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always want to continue to grow and expand, whether it be recording new music for you to enjoy, filming music \u0026amp; instructional videos, upgrading\u00a0equipment, etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute any more to my projects than simply listening and sharing the postive vibes. I appeciate that more than I can express but if you feel like contributing and being directly involved in the co-creation process, it will all go back into creating more music \u0026amp; art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003ePlease join me in the co-creation of these new album projects: A) 6-song Vocal EP B) 6-song Instrumental EP. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBASIC TRACKS have already been recorded on several songs for both new EPs!!\u00a0The plan is to release the albums on high-quality Vinyl \u0026amp; USB formats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the featured performers joining in thus far include: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~\u00a0Ric Fierabracci who has played bass for such iconic artists as, Stevie Wonder, Chic Corea, Blood, Sweat \u0026amp; Tears, Billy Cobham, Tom Jones.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Shane Gaalaas is a phenomenal drummer who has recorded with Michael Schenker, Yngwie Malmsteen, Vinnie Moore \u0026amp; the B\u0027z (Japan), to name a few. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~\u00a0James LoMenzo, well know for his work with, White Lion, Zakk Wylde, Megadeth \u0026amp; John Fogerty also adds some beautiful bass stylings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~\u00a0Jeff Bowders (Paul Gilbert, Shakira, Stu Hamm) also hit the skins on a tune or two. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Andrea Whitt (Shania Twain, \u003cstrong\u003eZucchero\u003c/strong\u003e)\u00a0Andrea is an international touring and recording artist.
