    "summary": "Hi! My name is Jessica Singerman and I\u0027m a painter living in North Carolina with my husband and our five-year old son. I make paintings that I hope will inspire people to enjoy nature and to live life to the fullest.\u00a0In previous lives, I taught yoga and worked as a guide leading epic bicycle tours all over Europe, Central America, and Australia. I am obsessed with riding bikes, and I\u0027ll occasionally jump into a race.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I was a kid, I lived all over the world and always felt like an outsider. In each new place, I felt a need to hide parts of myself in order to assimilate with others and try to feel like I belonged. I discovered that it is through intense outdoor activity and making artwork that I feel most like myself, whole and engaged with my environment, no matter where I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am inspired by the poetry of nature: color and light in the landscape, seasons, and the passing of time. My work is a kind of meditation and a love letter to life and painting. It is through painting and outdoor activity that I can quiet my mind, make sense of life, and explore spirituality.\u003ca href=\"http://www.jessicasingerman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIn 2016, I started a daily project. Each day I made either an abstract watercolor painting or an ink drawing of a little snippet of my life with my husband and our son.\u00a0I made a book featuring 100 of these watercolors and it is available from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.jessicasingerman.com/product/little-watercolor-squares/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e. Here\u0027s a little video documenting the process of making one of these watercolors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfeOtvqKJ5s\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017 I have continued making drawings and am working on larger oil and acrylic paintings as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means a lot to me, and I am deeply touched to know that you believe in my work, and that it brings you happiness. I\u0027d also like to take this opportunity to thank my parents, who have been incredibly supportive of me since, well, forever. Thank you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m open to requests for patron rewards. If you have suggestions, feel free to drop me a line! I\u0027d love to hear from you."
