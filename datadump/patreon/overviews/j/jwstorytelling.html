     "about": "Hello,\n My name is Jesse Wolfe and I am a recent college graduate that has a \npassion for telling stories. I have always had a wild imagination and it\n was this imagination that helped get me through the hard times as a \nkid. I grew up poor in a housing project on the edge of Long Island City\n determined to make a name for myself. School wasn\u0027t a cake walk either,\n being bullied all the time made it hard for me to make friends and made\n life tough in general but that never stopped me from dreaming. I stayed\n away from all the bad elements that such a life brings hoping to one \nday move to a better area, which I have. I can only hope the works I \nwill be bringing you will be entertaining enough to help you escape the \nstresses of life, if only for a little bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\n have always been interested in the art of story telling and so I \nstarted to write my own. My biggest influences would have to be TV shows\n and movies because I tend to watch a lot of crime dramas, superhero \nshows, and I love Supernatural. In the end though I\u2019m just a young \ndaydreamer with hopes of making it big one day doing what I love to do.",
