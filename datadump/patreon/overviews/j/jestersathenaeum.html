    "summary": "My name\u2019s Marie Bellamont and I created Jester\u2019s Athenaeum. It\u2019s an ongoing collection of short stories that can be read either individually or as a series. Some are black comedy, some are just silly parody-like humor, all are surreal fantasy. Updates are (to the extent that I\u2019m able to deliver) posted every Sunday. The general rule is that if a title is some kind of carnival terminology, it means it\u2019s black comedy. Most characters are recurring, though their stories don\u2019t appear in chronological order.\u003cbr\u003eI post these online so that they can be accessed for free, but accept donations from those who are willing and able to pay what they feel the stories are worth. I know that very few people are able to donate and that\u2019s fine, but since donations make up a significant portion of the income I use to provide for myself and my soon-to-be infant son, they are very much appreciated from those who do have the means to contribute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJester\u2019s Athenaeum has only been up since late April so it isn\u2019t very well-known yet, but so far the vast majority of readers have had really good things to say about it. My hope is to get the word out so that more people will discover and hopefully enjoy the content, so if you know anyone who might enjoy this website please don\u2019t hesitate to share the link to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://jestersathenaeum.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJester\u0027s Athenaeum\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e or to either of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/jestersathenaeum\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFACEBOOK\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://jestersathenaeum.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTUMBLR\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations\u0026amp;business=MUEE5CP45JUZU\u0026amp;lc=US\u0026amp;item_name=Jester%27s%20Athenaeum\u0026amp;currency_code=USD\u0026amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease feel free to contact me about anything\u00a0\u2013 I\u2019d really love to hear from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Marie\u003cbr\u003e"
