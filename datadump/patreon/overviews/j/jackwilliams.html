I don\u0027t have a team of people to help me - no booking agent, manager, or publicist - it\u0027s just me and my wife Judy doing it all to keep this show on the road. I love it, and I intend to keep doing it, but I could sure use some help!\u00a0For the last several years, my creative time has been taken up with the \"business\" of music - booking, publicizing, driving, and working out the logistics of touring - and I\u0027d like to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me by becoming a patron on Patreon. Patrons are people who have realized that music and art add value to their lives, and are willing to support it. People who want to take the next step beyond attending concerts and buying CDs. Historically, patrons have been wealthy fans who gave a lot of money, sometimes enough to have the symphony hall named after them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers a way for my fans to become patrons for \u003cem\u003eas little as $1 to $5 a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, the extra support would go a long way towards freeing up time to create more of the music that made you a fan in the first place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a thank-you gift, I\u0027ll periodically be posting full-length videos of a performance, a new song in progress, or an old song with the story of how and when it was created. And occasionally shorter videos in my \"Postcards\" series, of conversations with fans and colleagues, and interesting places and things we find along the road in our travels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
