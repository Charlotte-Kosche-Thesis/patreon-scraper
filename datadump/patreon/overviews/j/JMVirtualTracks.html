I\u0027m an artist, it is what I have done all my life; even in my early childhood I was drawing pictures of cars before I could spell my own name. My art skills at this time has evolved quite a lot, I very much enjoy digital painting though it hasn\u0027t served me professionally much at this point.  I have also always been a motorsport fan and became highly interested in video games at whatever age it was I started playing them, hard to remember now. How all this fits together is by my teens I started to have an interest in making games not programming per say but the art side of it and what better games to work on than those based around motorsports.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the early 2000\u0027s I finally got my chance at that, first with modding games then finally by 2005 doing so professionally though only in a limited freelance position it was still living the dream for me. I\u0027ve now spent 10 years doing so but it has been an up and down struggle, working freelance can often run like a roller coaster with big ups and big downs. One day you are making steady money and working on projects and the next you are told you aren\u0027t needed anymore and its up to you to figure something else out before your savings run out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to Patreon, I am here because I believe there are people who want the things I enjoy and feel like I am good at creating. With enough support I can hopefully be able to do what I love to do by working directly for the people who ultimately are the ones passionate about Sim Racing, are motorsport enthusiast and eliminate the middle man.  I can bring to life what they desire and I get to share the creation experience with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you one of them? All Donations are appreciated, the goal is to start project by project and be able to sustain myself while I work. Down the road maybe one day I will get a chance to full realize a large project I\u0027ve always wanted to make happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eThe Projects\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am offering virtual racing circuits for modern racing simulations.\u00a0 Currently the primary target is Rfactor 2 and possibly Assetto Corsa as well.
