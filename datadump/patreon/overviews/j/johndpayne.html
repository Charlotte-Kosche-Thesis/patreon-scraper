    "summary": "I quit my job. \u00a0I was an assistant professor on the tenure track, teaching and learning about terrorism and other really interesting stuff. \u00a0I was making good money and working with great people. \u00a0I loved it! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love writing. \u00a0And I\u0027ve had some small success. \u00a0Before jumping on the tenure treadmill, I got my first novel published, which was an amazing experience. \u00a0Since then, though, I\u0027ve only been able to manage short stories. \u00a0Turns out a tenure-track job in security studies is not super compatible with making up stories about dragons and spaceships and whatnot. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. \u00a0In previous centuries, writers, artists, and other creators sought out wealthy patrons to support their work. \u00a0Today, we can reach out and connect to a multitude of individual patrons. \u00a0And even if each of them only pledges a small amount, these little streams of support can flow together into mighty rivers. In other words,\u00a0Patreon helps writers like me build careers and cultivate our audiences-- on our own terms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe flexibility this affords is extra important because quitting my academic job means taking on another demanding job: full-time dad to a preschooler, a toddler, and a newborn. \u00a0Happily, raising a bunch of awesome little humans is compatible with making up stories. \u00a0So that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, I\u0027ll be releasing one story a month via Patreon. \u00a0(Plus some other fun stuff-- see the Monthly Schedule, below.) \u00a0But I have big plans for what we\u0027ll be doing here as more patrons sign up. \u00a0(See Goals, on the left-hand menu.) \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo check out the rewards on the right-hand side of the page. \u00a0If one of them looks like a good deal to you, click where it says Get Reward. \u00a0If you\u0027re not sure, try hitting the button on the top left of the page that says Follow. \u00a0It doesn\u0027t cost you a thing, and it gets you a free copy of my newsletter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support (whether a pledge or a follow) helps me produce more stories about snarky superhero sidekicks, and extra-dimensional hipster unicorns, and lots of other fun, nerdy things. \u00a0So, thank you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e^_^\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJDP\u003cbr\u003e__________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMONTHLY SCHEDULE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e1st Monday : Story of the month, for Readers and up\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2nd Monday : Bonus content, for Amigos and up\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3rd Monday : Poll, for Deciders and up\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePLUS Brain Trust video chat \u00a0(date \u0026amp; time set w/ BT+)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e4th Monday : \u00a0Newsletter \u0026amp; pix, for general public\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e5th Monday : PATRONPALOOZA (special features, usually for a limited time)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
