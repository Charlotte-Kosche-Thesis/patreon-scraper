In general, that means you\u2019ll be supporting\n12-13 posts per month. The minimum pledge at Patreon is $1 per month, so if you backed at that level you would normally be spending $12 or $13 per month to support the Alexandrian.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I do a per post contribution instead of a monthly\ncontribution is because the Alexandrian doesn\u2019t always update reliably. I don\u2019t\nwant to feel guilty if there\u2019s a month where I can\u2019t produce as much material\nand I don\u2019t want you to feel ripped off.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019d prefer to do a monthly contribution, however,\nPatreon offers the best of both worlds: Set your contribution level to the\namount you want to contribute and then set your maximum monthly contribution to\nthe same amount.
