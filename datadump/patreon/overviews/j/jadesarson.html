In 2015 I finally got some steady work, and a book\ndeal! Wow! That meant my income mainly came from: a one-time arts\ncouncil commission, a series of workshops, attending conventions, a book\ncommission and my own graphic novel for Myriad Editions called \u201c\n\u003cem\u003eFor the Love of\nGod, Marie!\n\u003c/em\u003e\u201d. It was all very exciting, but I definitely spread myself thin.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo thin, in fact, that I had to\nput my free-to-read webcomic \n\u003cem\u003eCafe Suada\u003c/em\u003e (a comic about tea, coffee and romance,\nwhich I had been updating every week for 5 years since I left university) on\nhiatus for 9 months. And that SUCKED. I\u2019ve been trying to find time for it ever\nsince Cup 5 (the fifth chapter) ended, but there\u2019s just no time when I\u2019m looking\nfor freelance work to support myself - I have basically no downtime.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eSo here\u2019s the gist:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019ve finished\nall of my ongoing commissioned work and my graphic novel is out now. I want to get back to work on \n\u003cem\u003eCafe Suada\u003c/em\u003e\nand deliver you all the rest of the story in a weekly fashion once again.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eThat\u2019s where YOU come in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve started a Patreon to fund\nthese things:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\n\t1. Getting\nCafe Suada back to weekly cupdates, with the possibility of progressing to 3 pages\na week\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t2.

So Cafe Suada is back, and Feels like Noodles is available to download. If we can hit some\nof the other milestone goals, I\u2019ll be able to really devote more time to \n\u003cem\u003eCafe\nSuada\n\u003c/em\u003e. The more you pledge, the less time I\u2019ll have to spend doing freelance\nwork, and the more \n\u003cem\u003eCafe Suada\u003c/em\u003e pages I can make per week.\u00a0I\u2019ll be able to start streaming as I draw my comics for\nyou to watch, too! Once we hit some of the higher goals, you might even cover my\nrent and bills, so I could devote ALL my time to \n\u003cem\u003eCafe Suada\u003c/em\u003e, possibly even\u2026\nANOTHER SUPER SECRET SPECIAL COMIC PROJECT?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat you and I get out of this\nPatreon is entirely in your hands.

If we meet this goal, I\u0027d like to start teaching them online to YOU via streams! All patrons will be able to watch me teach workshops on subjects such as: basic comics techniques, storytelling, character design, lettering, digital skills, anatomy, expressions, colour, etc etc. I\u0027d also record these streams so that any patrons can watch at a later date (if you want to participate or ask questions, you\u0027ll have to watch live though). These workshops would also include me sending you all resources such as worksheets and notes, for use during and after the streams.",
