Over the past two years this shifted to a Snapchat\ninterface, bringing recorded content to my followers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMoving\nto Snapchat opened doors I never would have imagine for the #FoodEmpowered\nProject. Suddenly, folks were more engaged with the content and asking tons of\nquestions. It is quite amazing and I couldn\u2019t be happier about it. However,\nSnapchat isn\u2019t always the most ideal interface for long foodversations (food\nconversations), nor is the information retrievable after 24 hours. This is\nterrible for newcomers to the foodversation and seeking #FoodEmpowerment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am\nnow moving to a YouTube channel, so the content can be more accessible. My goal\nis to empower people through their stomachs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFood shouldn\u2019t be exclusive, neither should the information concerning it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI believe so deeply in\nthis I went to graduate school specifically to learn how I could make food\nknowledge more accessible, so folks in my hometown could become empowered\nthrough it. Little did I know, my Capstone Project concerning this research\nwould become a full-blown thesis that resulted in the creation of a local\nfarmers\u2019 market, FoodiO.org, and the JaemiO YouTube Channel. Thanks to these\nefforts, food is now empowering people both within my community and others\nthroughout the world! However, these things take up a great amount of my time\nand personal budget.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s where you come\nin.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s\neasy to make food interesting, because, well, it\u0027s food. However, it is super\nhard to really tackle the extremely specific food topics that chefs,\nnutritionists, and food scientists dedicate their entire lives to without\nspending a ton of time and resources to research, understand, and present them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the past seven years, 90% of my budget\nhas been paid for by me. Needless to say, I do everything I can to keep my\ncosts low, but there are \u003cem\u003eso \u003c/em\u003emany things I want to share with\nmy followers. Thus, I need your help.
