    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019ve decided to make a Patreon page for my channel\nsince I receive very little money (so far I\u2019ve received literally zero) from\nYouTube ad revenue, because of age restricted content and false copyright\nclaims. Believe it or not, it is actually very difficult to create YTPs, and it\ntakes me at least one month to finish a decent one that\u2019s 3 or 4 minutes long.\nFor this reason, even if I were able to make the full amount of YouTube ad\nrevenue I should be getting, it still wouldn\u2019t be much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy aim is to make a new YTP every month to two months.\nThere may be some variance based on how ambitious of a project it is, and how rough\nmy retail job is going, but generally speaking it shouldn\u2019t take more than 2\nmonths to make these going forward. I SHOULD ALSO MENTION YOU CAN SEE PREVIEWS\nOF WHAT I\u2019M WORKING ON at my twitter, @jallerbo_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe way this will work is that if you donate any amount\nof money, whether it\u2019s 1 dollar or 100 dollars monthly, you will get your name\nin the credits for every video I make with |YTP| in the title. People who\ndonate more will get their names higher on the list, and people who wish not to\nbe listed can just message me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour donation will go largely towards basic living\nexpenses at first. I live in an apartment with my roommate and have basically\nno financial support other than working 30 hours a week at a grocery store. My\nplan is to eventually get enough monthly donations that I can work less hours\nat the store and more time editing videos. After that my goal is to receive enough\ndonations that I can make a living solely from making YTPs. Any donations past\nthe $2000 a month goal will go toward purchasing things to make my job easier,\nsuch as an extra monitor, additional software, and possibly even outsourcing\nsome work to other creators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe reason I\u2019m only doing one tier is because I don\u2019t\nlike the idea of early access and exclusive content. I want everything I make\nto be available to everyone at the same time, whether they donate or not. The\nday I finish a video is the day I upload it. If you are a patron and would like\nto contact me to ask me questions or make requests, feel free to message me\nover Twitter or Discord. I won\u2019t guarantee that I will act on any request, but\nI will gladly answer any questions you may have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, that\u2019s it. Making videos is the only\nthing in the world I\u2019m passionate about, and I would love the opportunity to be\nable get my videos out faster and to make them better overall. Even if you don\u2019t\ndonate, thanks for watching my videos and supporting me with wet kisses and\nspooning."
