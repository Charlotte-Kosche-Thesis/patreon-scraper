I hesitated. The voice in my brain for the millionth time doubted: \u201cYou\u2019re not a real writer, you can\u2019t even write this book.\u201d I responded:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u201cAt the moment I am figuring out what\u2019s next. Every day I write, and I often share, but I don\u2019t think I qualify as a writer, you know I have not written a book.\u201d\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlarm\u003c/strong\u003e seemed to have picked up on my hesitation and then turned to me \u201calarmed\u201d and said:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cFuck yes, you\u2019re a writer.

What I realized that the doubt is the voice of fear. That\u2019s it. Nothing else and no one else. \u003cbr\u003eI am afraid of failing. Of writing a book that no one publishes. Of the opinion of those who question who can call themselves a writer, humorist singer. Staying  humble, has been my excuse to staying afraid. To hiding. To shrinking.\u003cbr\u003eI am going to be a full-time writer. With your help.

She is the child of the moon, because when no one gave her love, she went on the balcony and felt held by the moon. This book will take you on a raw emotional journey, back to finding self-love, falling into the lap of despair and finding an unusual path. The book will hopefully bring words to some of your pain and suffering. If you have survived abuse, or any form of trauma, you too are a child of the moon. You are not alone in the pain. Together we find the pearl in the darkness.\u003cbr\u003eThe book will be illustrated by a designer, incorporating the themes of the moon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSelection of published writing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/personal-growth/write-739b8b822a70#.egya3x18t\"\u003eWrite\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/fuck-changing-yourself-235dfd4d353a\"\u003eFuck changing yourself \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/a-letter-to-my-not-so-happy-single-self-43a338350007\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/personal-growth/pwhen-you-don-t-know-where-home-is-7f5b95cdf536\"\u003eWhen you don\u0027t know where home is \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/a-letter-to-my-not-so-happy-single-self-43a338350007\"\u003eA letter to my not so happy single self\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thecoffeelicious.com/i-cry-6ec2de527d27\"\u003eI cry \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with money: $3000 / month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot get a full-time job that will suck the life out of me. \u003cbr\u003ePay rent\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHire an editor for the book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with money: $5000 / month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot get a full-time job that will suck the life out of me. \u003cbr\u003ePay rent.\u003cbr\u003eHire an editor for the book.\u003cbr\u003eHire a designer for the book\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with money: $6000 / month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot get a full-time job that will suck the life out of me. \u003cbr\u003ePay rent.\u003cbr\u003eHire an editor for the book.\u003cbr\u003eHire a designer for the book\u003cbr\u003ePromote the book on social media\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe process from writing to finishing the book will take 12 months.
