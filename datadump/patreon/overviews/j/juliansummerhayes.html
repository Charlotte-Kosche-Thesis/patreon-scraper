That alone should make us love each other but it doesn\u0027t. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.\u201d \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2015\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://bukowski.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCharles Bukowski\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here?\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s my purpose?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey\u0027re all part of the same space, namely the unexamined life. Trouble is, for most people -- including me, for most of my adult life -- we\u0027re told to look out \u0027there\u0027 for answers to the happiness paradigm. And where does that get us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a heap of self-induced trouble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, when you\u0027re on the hamster wheel (of life) -- i.e. running faster and faster just to stand still -- you never stop to ask anything more profound than, \"What\u0027s next?\". But you already know the answer: more pain, suffering and empty thoughts about how life shouldn\u0027t be this hard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd just in case you\u0027re curious, I\u0027m not offering another faux solution. If you want that then you\u0027re better off reading the next \"Life\u0027s just perfect\" pile of BS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m inviting you to do anything, it\u0027s to look in a different direction and come to terms with what it means to live in a thought-induced world (i.e. inside-out, not outside-in). The reason: if you master this ticket, they\u0027ll be no need to invest your time and emotional labour in any more get rich schemes, let alone the quackery that pervades the personal development world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, the aim of this Patreon page is simple: support my writing, speaking and podcasting in support of my message \u003cstrong\u003eawaken, to true self\u003c/strong\u003e. In time, I hope to move out of the space of the amateur and turn pro but I know that it will take more than a few words and a lot of luck. It will require tenacity and a battle to the death with Resistance (see \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe War of Art\u003c/a\u003e\" by Steven Pressfield). But I\u0027m up for the challenge, and I really hope that enough people will come alive to true self as I develop my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I mean? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that what I share on Patreon goes well beyond the usual snake oil, \u0027buy this sucker\u0027 material but instead guides you towards true self. And no, I\u0027m not referring to the best version of you but the unlived you. If you\u0027re like me, it\u0027s that deep sense that your soul needs to be opened up and your genius self set free; but you need a way to unlock the hallowed gates to a bigger more intense world. And I hope that my patron-only shares will help you on your journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m currently working on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on my first book, \"awaken, to true self\". It\u0027s been in the offing for a number of years, but I\u0027m now committed to finishing it in the next few months, ready for publication before the end of the year (2018).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho knows, but one thing I\u0027m committed to is talking less (online and off) and writing more -- hopefully full time one day. I know with your support that I\u0027ll not only be inspired to create my very best material but I\u0027ll also get the feedback that\u0027s absolutely essential to move from the lower plane of doer to the higher plane where only the gods fear to tread. Ha ha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlessings\u003cbr\u003eJulian.\u003cbr\u003e"
