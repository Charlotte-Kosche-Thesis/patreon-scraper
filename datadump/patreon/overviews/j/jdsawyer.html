    "summary": "I\u0027ve been creating full-cast audiobooks for several years now. In the past, my actors have all worked as volunteers or for favor-trades, and I\u0027ve put the podcasts out on an as-I-have-the-time basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year, I produced \u003cem\u003eGail Carriger\u0027s Crudrat\u003c/em\u003e, which was an opportunity to throw some paid work to the actors and composer and support team that have worked with me all these years. Now, it\u0027s time to get back to podcasting again, and I want to be able to pay my team and justify the time these productions take away from my writing and other obligations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince those of you who love my audio stories also love the other books I write, I\u0027ve hit upon a cunning plan. I\u0027m writing a lot these days--I have several novels due out this year, and a number of short stories coming off contract that I\u0027ll be releasing as well (\u003ca href=\"http://jdsawyer.net/coming-soon/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esee current publication schedule here\u003c/a\u003e). I want to incentivize the regular production of my podcasts and give you all an easy way to get my new stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf enough of you sign up that this little operation turns a profit, I\u0027m going to roll that profit into producing more audiobooks. If/when we get to that point, those audiobooks will become part of the regular rewards that accrue to you, the patrons, and I will modify the rewards levels to reflect that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have all been with me through thick and thin, through times of regular releases and long silences. I want to get back to giving you all content every two weeks or more. Because, in the past, my deliveries have been irregular, I\u0027m setting this campaign up on a per-episode basis, with the plan to drop one story episode every other week. In turn, I am assuming that, for those of you on a budget, you will set your contribution limit so that if I drop extra story episodes, you won\u0027t be charged extra.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSign up with me for two episodes a month, and help me fund the creation of the current book (Free Will) and of many, many future books to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
