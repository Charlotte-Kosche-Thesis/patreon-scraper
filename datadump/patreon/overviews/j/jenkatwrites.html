I do a little bit of everything: prose fiction (novels and short stories), game design, book and game reviews, nerding out about the things I\u0027m passionate about (intersectional representation in gaming and in fiction; humanism and optimism in fantasy and sci-fi; cats).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support here allows me to take all of that to the next level. I\u0027ve got so many goals for my writing and gaming career, but I need your help to achieve them. Everything earned from this Patreon will be reinvested into bringing you more great content. I\u0027ve got a few things on the list already: a professional web redesign of my blog (\u003ca href=\"http://www.firstsightsecondthoughts.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFirst Sight Second Thoughts\u003c/a\u003e), podcasting equipment and software, apps like Photoshop and InDesign to make more professional-looking (and printable!) content. Future goals may include things like professional formatting and cover design for ebooks, video capabilities to livestream my RPG sessions on Twitch, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly you can help me make these things a reality, and I appreciate every penny you can throw my way. This is going to be a long journey - let\u0027s take it together."
