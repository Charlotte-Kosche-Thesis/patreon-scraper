My name is Jon. I\u0027m an author, poet, and speaker. In 2013, I took one of my poems and \n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWi5iXnguTU\u0026amp;t=38s\"\u003euploaded it to YouTube\u003c/a\u003e. I just wanted to share my creativity with the world, and hopefully glorify God. A month later though, that video had over 1,000,000 views, and was still climbing. Since then, I have posted over 500 videos to YouTube, spoken at over 100 conference, schools, and churches, and written 3 books. The point of it all? To communicate Biblical truth in a way that entertains and encourages, but also enlightens. The journey has been amazing, and I could not have done it without the amazing community that supports me by tuning in and giving every month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003ca href=\"https://imgbb.com/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/dFD447/Patreon_About_2.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI believe in the patronage model very much, and I am so grateful that you would consider helping support me in the word I do. As a patron of this page, you pledge a certain dollar amount per month. Please note that it does not charge per video. Only ONCE A MONTH. Based on your pledge level, you will receive access to various rewards (see column to the right). Pledges are collected monthly, and they help me do the work that I do, and spread the message of Christ on a larger scale. The money pledge by you will go towards new videos, camera equipment, hiring other artists to help me shoot, edit, and score my videos. My videos will always be free, but through Patreon, we can make them even better, and we can serve more people together.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003ca href=\"https://imgbb.com/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/cNzcP7/Patreon_About_3.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003c/strong\u003e NO - Pay in any currency!
