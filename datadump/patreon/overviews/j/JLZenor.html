By becoming a supporter you agree to give a donation, kind of like a tip, every time I release a new short story (about 2-4 per year).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, as a way to say \u003cem\u003eThank you\u003c/em\u003e, I will give you stuff! Mostly copies of what I\u0027m writing, as well as some other nifty things.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhen?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Typically it takes me a good three months to write a short story while real life is happening all around me. But as deadlines approach, as I learn how to write and edit more efficiently, and as I see my fans really wanting more of my writing I hope to get that down to one month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Writing is extremely time consuming and difficult. It isn\u0027t about just sitting down and writing whatever ideas come to my head. It takes many hours to plan, many more hours to write, and countless hours to edit revision after revision, to make sure the story will be enjoyable to all of my readers. And real life doesn\u0027t give me much time to put towards pursuing my dream when you have bills to pay and a family to feed and writing just doesn\u0027t pay much, yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon you help give a lot of motivation to take the time to sit down and finish these projects. Normally I have to spend my time doing things that bring in paychecks. If I get even $100 of support on Patreon it means that my time spent secluding myself from my family in the evenings can earn me something and be worthwhile, helping me reach the next step in becoming a best selling author. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though the money raised only goes towards writing (paying for an editor, cover artist, ordering books, business cards, conventions, etc), every dollar given means one less dollar I need to take out of my family budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eThank you\u003c/span\u003e so much for taking the time to check out my Patreon page. If you want to become a supporter, then I can\u0027t thank you enough for helping me live my dream.
