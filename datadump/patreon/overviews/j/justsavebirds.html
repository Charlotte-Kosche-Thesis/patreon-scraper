    "summary": "To all of the people who have reached out for help to make the world a safer place for birds, thank you! Let me know how I can be of further assistance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can help you stop birds from hitting windows.\u003cbr\u003eI can help you properly document and get a dead bird to an academic collection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I? \u003cbr\u003eOne human who absolutely cannot get over the fact that birds hit windows everywhere and we can do something tangible to fix it. Since 2003, I have been providing as much free support as my schedule allows to the public, including students, academics, and consultations for architects and organizations on the side. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePresentations, panels, assistance with data and spreadsheet templates are the tip of the iceberg, but I want to be able to do more (like send starter kits to new programs that don\u0027t have any funding). While I do address sources of bird mortality other than glass (cats, wind farms, cars, fences, power lines, etc), I would most likely refer people to other resources on those topics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do: Have state \u0026amp; federal permits through local academic collections.\u003cbr\u003eI do not: Keep any dead birds. They all go to academic collections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do: Assist people in finding nearby bird rehabbers or permitted collections.\u003cbr\u003eI do not: Do wildlife rehab, accept injured birds, or accept out-of-state birds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon? \u003cbr\u003eBecause I promise only a warm fuzzy feeling in return for your contribution. Amazon wish lists can help with zip loc bags and brown paper bags, but the bulk of the costs come from time and travel: speaking gigs and training sessions cut into my \"real\" job, so I use vacation time or take it as unpaid time: we all know and have felt the financial pinch, I am hoping to offset these costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy not a 501(c)3? \u003cbr\u003eI serve on three nonprofit boards, and forming a board for a one-person info-hub seems excessive. For now. Maybe someday! This is an odd niche and its reach is global, so there\u0027s plenty of room for growth eventually!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer part one!\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not just me: I strongly suggest supporting organizations like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://flap.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFLAP\u003c/a\u003e (now\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://birdsafe.ca\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebirdsafe.ca\u003c/a\u003e), the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://abcbirds.org/program/glass-collisions/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmerican Bird Conservancy\u003c/a\u003e, and local collision monitoring programs.
