I\u0027m Jean Grae.\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eYou probably know me from: For the past 20+ years, I\u0027ve been making/releasing music. As a lyricist, producer, engineer and performing artist, I\u0027ve traveled the world, released 9387938793 albums and done things independently. As the daughter of 2 legendary jazz musicians who lived a creative and independent lifestyle, I was pretty ready for it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://s33.postimg.org/gergq0oj3/unnamed_1.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 15px 15px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eBoth adorable, and ready.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s been rewarding and difficult. I\u0027ve been marginalized and critically acclaimed. It\u0027s been lucrative and broke city, y\u0027all. It\u0027s been an amazing roller coaster, where the limits of my creativity have been bound by money and time constraints. Don\u0027t have the time, because you have to think of how to make money, to make more time to make more money, to make more things. Blech.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nBUT\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve done the best I could and then challenged myself, with all my abilities put to use. Especially the ability to learn how to do things. Recording myself, mastering myself (heh) shooting/directing my own videos, editing... all the things. Knowledge and new skills are amazing (and always useful) but it\u0027s a bit hard to be in all of the places at once. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nOkay, it\u0027s \n\u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e hard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI have NOT learned how to make clones, due to a lack of funds AND the fact that they usually don\u0027t turn out well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/54798-image/Google-patents-method-for-fighting-evil-clones-in-the-Play-Store.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eA shame, because I think I\u0027d look quite distinguished with a goatee.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve always had the passion and the talent to do far more than things based in the music business. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe in living a polymath lifestyle and living up to, and beyond potential. That we should all be free to live a bunch of lives and feel limitless, regardless of what boundaries society places on us.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFuck those boundaries. Ptooey. Ew. Yuck. Hate \u0027em.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.revival.com/images/featured/3318_3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eLook at that eagle.

Not that last one, but, I\u0027ll take it up soon. That\u0027s me making a \n\u003cem\u003eshort\u003c/em\u003e list.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nIn just the past 4 years, I\u0027ve also released 15 self made projects on bandcamp. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis included a book and accompanying audiobook, that I scored and narrated.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://s33.postimg.org/c4ab0yd0v/albumscollage.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eYou can find all of these on my bandcamp site:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jeangrae.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHERE!

Even if the funds aren\u0027t there to do it, I do it anyway. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nSimply, you can\u0027t just sit here and wait for things to come to you. So I kept making them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, even all of these things could have been better. Mixed better, recorded better, had live musicians besides just myself, had visuals, or new cool ideas I had surrounding projects that just couldn\u0027t get accomplished without any money. BOOO!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example: I\u0027ve been telling the longest running single storyline (for 20+) about an assassin in all my releases, cameos, etc. It\u0027s incredibly cool, non-linear and deserves to live out its potential.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d love to go back and delve into it.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, yes. Whether it\u0027s music, or something else, these ideas should have the opportunity to be fully realized,\u00a0so that they can truly thrive and push the envelope. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nMan, no one wants to see ideas die. That is so damn sad. *\n\u003cem\u003egetting a tissue\u003c/em\u003e*\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLook how sad.\u00a0\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/14378783/3/stock-photo-14378783-unhappy-african-american-baby-girl-crying-while-holding-a-rattle.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 20px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I make it NOT sad, Jean?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, there\u0027s a monthly contribution, plus goals and of course, kick ass rewards.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s what we\u0027re talking about.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll be able to make all the badassery of everything. With your help.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe in supporting independent artists and independent ideas that break down doors. \n\u003cbr\u003eIf we all want to evolve, then we\u0027ve all got to do it together!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, you don\u0027t have to drain your pockets.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhichever tier works for you, I will be so grateful. There are a lot of super fun interactive rewards, cause I like being interactive.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are things that will be super exclusive for just patrons, because who doesn\u0027t like exclusive things?\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s a real question, but you can answer me later when we chat.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSee? We\u0027ll chat, listen to new things together, watch new things together. Have story time. Make some food. Have some drinks. Talk relationships. I\u0027ll show you some DIY home and life hacks. We\u0027ll share skill sets. Maybe have a staring contest.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ll have the Imaginatorium Symposium.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT THE HELL IS THAT?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOh, it\u0027s fantastic and you will find out.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI digress.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027ll get emails from me, maybe even a phone call, hey... I\u0027d even come put on a show! \n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat sounds wrong. You know what I mean.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ll simply have the best time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want us to communicate, so we can grow together.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat last part was very sweet, Jean.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI thought so too. Thank you. Thank you.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is this important, Jean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGuys, it\u0027s so important to me that imagination is able to be brought to life. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s incredibly important to me that narratives and visuals involving and by WOC and POC are DIVERSE and NEW. Our ideas and stories should be as diverse and have the opportunity to be.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s really easy to bring these new ideas to the \"machine,\" and get turned down because they\u0027re afraid of presenting us in a way that currently doesn\u0027t exist.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fainting-woman.jpg\" style=\"float: right; width: 242px; margin: 0px 0px 20px 10px;\"\u003eI\u0027m not afraid. I\u0027m excited.

To be represented as worthy and limitless beings.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, I\u0027ve learned how to make things out of nothing, and even just the idea of having an actual budget to make things, makes my soul very tingly. So doing things with a budget, 100% creative control and 100% ownership...\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eMan. People really just kept those smelling salts on DECK.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhatcha gonna use the money for, Jean?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eHookers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nAlright. NOT HOOKERS. I\u0027m kidding. Kidding.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*New equipment: cameras, computers, gear.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*Paying people: musicians, dancers, camera people, puppeteers, production managers...generally just anyone who is onboard for any project. People should get paid.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*Marketing and promotion: I really love marketing, social media, new branding ideas, making commercials. Those things need the dollars too. Well, in order to be REALLY efficient.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*Events/live streaming: From a talk show, to a play, to community events like the Hug Station, it would be awesome to share.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*Generally having a budget for projects: going into something, ANYTHING with funding, is a responsible way to do things. That would be awesome.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*Not being sad: self-explanatory.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIs that all, Jean?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eFor right now, yes. I guess so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nSo... are we in? Everyone\u0027s hands in? Steven, not your foot. Don\u0027t put your-- okay. There we go.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHell, yeah.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0027s change the world. Otherwise, what\u0027s the point?\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
