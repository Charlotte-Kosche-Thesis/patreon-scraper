I am a writer, artist, and game designer. I am a mixed race, Black enby (non-binary) queer person with chronic illness. My forthcoming novel \"The City With No Animals\" was shortlisted for Metonymy Press\u0027\u00a0 Gay Book Lovers Unite contest in 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer and designer, I\u2019m interested in telling stories that blend and blur reality, using art, technology, and an original storyline. My worlds contain a wide range of characters and motivations that reflect experiences not normally seen in writing but are a part of my family and life. Characters face challenges in terms of health, vulnerability, emotional growth, and understanding one\u2019s own desires. Their world also reflects what I know to be possible - spaces where consent, community care, financial stability, and the celebration of\u00a0 Black people of many genders and kinds of beauty can be the norm. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create works where readers can have a space to open themselves to stories that challenge them but that these stories do their best to ring true without replicating daily harm the audience may experience. I strive to write intelligent and complex work that can enrich the lives of readers. Stories can inspire us to demand more love, more care, more tenderness, and more celebration of our bodies whether that is through validating more of our boundaries or helping us to imagine more of the consensual intimacy we need.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this being said, I also want to deliver this work that allows me to take dreams and stories and tell them with poetry, technology, and magic. My projects cross mediums, genres, and realities to weave an experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service that allows you to directly support my work through pledging a monthly amount. You can donate any amount you like per month, stop whenever you like, and help me create something beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "\u265b Ciel Sainte-Marie is an elusive catdeer who likes to bite, romance, and talk about symbols \u0026amp; personal myth. She is a Black Caribbean, mixie, queer non-binary person who is slowly venturing out of the wilds of liminal spaces to create works that are conversations between love and desire, personal mythology, community care, vulnerability, emotional growth, and access/disability politics.  She uses storytelling, immersive installation, game design, and film to weave together visionary worlds where consent, community interdependence, financial stability, and the celebration of many genders and kinds of beauty can be the norm. She believes stories can inspire us to demand more love, more care, more tenderness, and more celebration of our bodies whether through validating more of our boundaries or helping us to imagine and create more of the consensual intimacy we need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCiel has performed and exhibited work in Winnipeg, Vancouver and Toronto including venues like Tangled Art + Disability, the Vancouver Queer Arts Festival, and The Gladstone Hotel. Ciel is a community-engaged arts facilitator and an alumni of the Parallel Tracks training program. A poet whose work has been read in classrooms and featured in keynotes, Ciel was recently published in \u003cem\u003eThe Deaf Poets Society\u003c/em\u003e\u2019s Crips in Space Issue. An excerpt of her upcoming film \u201calien cake romance\u201d was screened during Tangled London: Mediations - Media + Activism.
