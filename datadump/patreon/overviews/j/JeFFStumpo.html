You\u2019ll get two-sentence horror stories, drafts of poems, video poems, excerpts from the novel, and conceptual essays related to the creative process. You\u2019ll get teaching stories, the ability to ask questions about teaching, and thoughtful replies. If you\u2019ve seen his work on Facebook or Twitter, the best stuff is migrating here.\u003cbr\u003e"
