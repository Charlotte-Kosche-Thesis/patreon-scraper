You\u0027ve helped keep me going with my trans/multi-media/cross-genre work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is the same as it has always been: to produce art, and to facilitate the same for others. We like to hole up in our studios and get work done, but it\u0027s just as important to build connections and share ideas and even source materials -- build an art community both virtually and irl. I\u0027ve got a hard on for theory, and a sarcastic sense of humor as the video probably demonstrates, but in this I\u0027m dead serious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit about me: \u003c/strong\u003eThey say no one works just one job anymore. I\u2019ve embodied that since before it was cool to have 12 \u201cside hustles\u201d. Usually, my business cards have read \u201cartist,\u201d  \u201cauthor,\u201d \u201ceditor\u201d, \u201ccreative director\u201d, \u201cdesigner,\u201d or \u201ccat-shepherd.\u201d All true, at one time or another, especially the last one. Trying to produce independent media is like trying to get cats to dance in a parade. I\u0027m also a bit like a magpie, collecting whatever is shiny or novel, there\u0027s always something more interesting to connect this bit to over there. (Apparently magpies don\u0027t actually do that, but everyone thinks they do, which is good enough for a writer...)

     "about": "James Curcio\u2019s career as polymath or dilettante (depending who you ask) began around 2001 when he graduated Bard college with the world\u2019s most lucrative degree (Philosophy), and co-founded a media collective. Partially inspired by The Factory, they cranked out media by day for clients ranging from local business to Glaxo Smith Kline and Roche, and avant-garde art weirdness by night.\u003cbr\u003eHe left that partnership in NY to focus on a music project in LA, based on Jack Parson\u2019s Babalon Working, which worked out for them about as well as it did for Jack. Following that was ten years half lived on couches, futons, festivals, and conventions across America. During this time he worked on numerous transmedia projects. Some of these included \u003cem\u003eJoin My Cult!\u003c/em\u003e, a postmodern occult novel satirizing postmodern occultism published by New Falcon, (also of Aleister Crowley and RAW), Disinfo\u2019s anthology \u003cem\u003eGeneration Hex\u003c/em\u003e, which was launched at Alex and Allyson Grey\u2019s Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, and collaboration with Joseph Matheny and Dave Szulborski, two pioneers of Alternate Reality Games, on various popular ARG related comics, podcasts and websites. He co-starred in a bi-weekly \u201cGonzomentary\u201d web series. This LSD-soaked, mangled gibberish inexplicably won the Outstanding Lead Actor Award and Outstanding Writing by the 2013 LA Web Series Festival, while receiving an Honorable Mention for Best Documentary at the 6th Philadelphia Independent Film Festival.\u003cbr\u003eHe was editor-in-chief of Rebel News, an independent news outlet he founded with \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d consultant Gregg Housh. He keeps the dilettante tradition of corrupting the youth alive; his previous non-fiction anthologies, \u003cem\u003eApocalyptic Imaginary\u003c/em\u003eand The \u003cem\u003eImmanence of Myth\u003c/em\u003ewere both curriculum materials for several lit and philosophy courses at SUNY Binghamton. He ceased musical live performance in 2005 with an opening act for Front242, only since releasing studio collaborations on obscure labels you\u2019ve never heard of.\u003cbr\u003ePresent projects include \u003cem\u003eTales From When I Had A Face\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNarrative Machines: Modern Myth, Propaganda, and Revolution\u003c/em\u003e, and endless research for the forthcoming anthology, \u003cem\u003eMasks: Bowie and Artists of Artifice.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
