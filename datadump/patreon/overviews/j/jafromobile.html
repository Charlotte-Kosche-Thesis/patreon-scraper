    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon creator page! \u00a0I\u0027ve been sharing my automotive projects on YouTube since 2008 in an effort to entertain and satisfy the automotive enthusiast in all of us. \u00a0 People are busy... so I compress big jobs into relatively short videos that still include all the important details. \u00a0 I think that showing the guts of a project spread out on a workbench takes the fear out of the job for people with the willingness to try it themselves. \u00a0I\u0027m not ASE certified. \u00a0 I\u0027m not an auto mechanic by trade. \u00a0My background is in advertising, photography, higher education, and manufacturing. \u00a0I support Technology professionally, and have for over 23 years. \u00a0Drag racing and wrenching in my garage is just how I like to unwind. \u00a0It\u0027s my happy place. \u00a0I film my happy place and share it with you on YouTube. \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life\u0027s course has steeped my ability to create and deliver these videos and I\u0027m lucky to have kept myself surrounded by brilliant, talented and creative people who have kept me challenged. \u00a0 My content plays like a focused reality show to tell the stories of 4 turbo import car projects, and whatever else that provides me with inspiration. \u00a0I didn\u0027t want to be one of those channels that just uploads for the sake of a forced upload schedule with a rambling vlog or an incomplete video, so I\u0027ve uploaded videos however fast my monetized content could fund them, and I only upload material that\u0027s capable of satisfying my own high standards for entertainment. \u00a0My technical content is typically delivered at the speed of spinning helicopter blades, and thick with information... like Neo\u0027s red pill education in the movie The Matrix, plugged into a chair. \u00a0 Downloading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are exclusive videos here that YouTube viewers don\u0027t get to see. \u00a0Patrons get 24-48 hour early-access to my new uploads, and in addition to that, Patreon also offers a private forum where we can discuss my production, my challenges, and everything else without broadcasting it to millions of people. \u00a0The floor is always open here on Patreon to everyone who is invested in the continued production of my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor many years I insisted on making all investments in my production out of pocket; the tools, the parts, the machining, and even the featured cars themselves. \u00a0 I wanted to pay for every aspect of my production, and one of the ways I could do this was out of the ad-supported revenue this channel generates. \u00a0But YouTube\u0027s monetization algorithms and priorities have changed repeatedly, and creators have seen major declines in their revenue even as their content surges in popularity. \u00a0Since the adpocalypse began, Google has continued to receive a lot of bad press, management problems, censorship issues, copyright issues, channel-culling and they continue \"stepping in it\" socially in a ways that ultimately hurt the entire platform. \u00a0Many YouTube channels have made videos about this. \u00a0Many channels I loved watching have dried up and gone away because it\u0027s an inordinate amount of time and work to create in comparison to what ad revenue generates. \u00a0Each social faux-pas Google triggers in the media always results in further losses to creators. \u00a0Even the changes Google touts as solutions to these issues result in further looses to creators. \u00a0All of these things have affected my ability to operate out-of-pocket on the same monthly upload schedule that used to come easily to me.  Patreon has provided an opportunity to change this, but it can only work with your help.\u003cbr\u003e"
