    "summary": "Hi! Joseph Daigle here and I want to welcome you to Patreon, a membership platform designed to help artists continue their creative efforts and get paid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst, let me thank you for being here. Whether you\u2019re a patron or visitor, you\u2019re always welcome. I\u2019m a composer and musician and, while I\u2019ve worked in many styles of music over a lifetime, orchestral and world music traditions truly fascinate me. My current compositions reflect that passion and allow me to offer some peace and serenity to a world of stress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIts well-known that there are numerous emotional and physical disorders that have been linked to stress including depression, anxiety, heart attacks, stroke, hypertension, and the list goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCountless studies have shown that listening to music lowers anxiety, heart rate and blood pressure more effectively than sedative drugs. It activates anti-stress and anti-inflammatory pathways in the body and even reduces the allergic response of white blood cells. Music has a favorable impact on metabolism and our hormonal system. All this with no side effects!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI created this page because I want to share my music with you. In my travels around the world I have seen how music can bring people of diverse cultures together. My music has been used in documentary film and to complement yoga practices. It has been used to encourage focus for study and bring calm for relaxation. If I\u2019ve been successful, my music puts your body in a state that\u2019s incompatible with stress. That\u0027s right, music is also an answer to existential issues. I hope that, listening to and watching my informative, stress-free and ad-free music videos, I take you on a little journey that gives you a glimpse of how I view the world and how it plays itself through me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatronage, or sponsorship, of musicians and artists is a tradition extending back to ancient times. Patreon is the modern version of that tradition allowing you, as my patron, to contribute to my creative processes and research. If you appreciate my efforts\u2014thank you from the bottom of my heart\u2014and consider subscribing with any amount that matches your comfort level. As a subscriber, you will be the first to be notified of all of the compositions, videos and features that non-subscribers don\u0027t have access to. If you don\u0027t wish to subscribe, thank you anyway\u2014you still have free access to about one-third of the music on the site\u2014enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e"
