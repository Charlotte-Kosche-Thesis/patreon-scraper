    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the place where I shamelessly ask you for money in exchange for a completely intangible return. I\u2019ll break it down into steps:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep One:\u003c/strong\u003e I create a Patreon page, and promise that I will make something, in this case, written material. Political written material, satirical written material, think pieces, humor, what have you, in exchange for a small amount of money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep Two:\u003c/strong\u003e You say \u201cwow this material is so cool. He is so smart and charming and a great writer. Quite possibly he will be the next Mark Twain/Aaron Sorkin/Ta Nehisi Coates/fill in the blank.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep Three:\u003c/strong\u003e You say \u201cwow, I am so impressed by this material that I will give a small amount of money to be able to read his written materials and help him make more. I like this.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep Four:\u003c/strong\u003e I take this small amount of money and am able to dedicate time to creating stuff, eventually expanding the types of content we\u2019re making\u2026 podcasts, video essays. All of these could be in the cards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep Five:\u003c/strong\u003e We all win, and society is saved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay. Obviously, this is tongue-in-cheek. Or, at least obviously to me\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ll see that the description here says that I\u2019m creating \u201cintellectual content.\u201d That sounds ambiguous I know, but I think it\u2019s the best way to define what I want to do here. I want to make things that will give intellectual folks more things to think about, and will give people who don\u2019t consider themselves intellectuals a place to go to find all manner of issues discussed. Like I said, everything from politics, to film, to literature, to comedy to anything. Literally, there\u2019s not really a limit to things that could be done. All I want to do is help to facilitate a culture wherein people value the importance of good, intellectual thought. I think we\u2019ve lost this in so many ways, and if there\u2019s a chance that I can help to bring it back, even in a small way, than I\u2019m willing to try.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Little About Me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m just gonna list off everything I\u2019ve done:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrote and directed a feature-length documentary called \u003cem\u003eTargeted\u003c/em\u003e.
