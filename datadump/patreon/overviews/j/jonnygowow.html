    "summary": "The music industry is falling apart, and with it the means for musicians to support themselves. Many in my industry are troubled by this fact, but I couldn\u0027t be more excited. The breakdown of the traditional music economy means that I now have direct access to my fans, and that I can create exactly what I want to create for you. It also means that we artists have to start asking fans directly to support us - and that is what I\u0027m doing on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is this Jonny Gowow?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJonny is the moniker I\u0027ve given to my creative ego. I grew up in the hills and farms just north of Nashville, and began the study of music at an early age. It was during my late teens that I discovered that I had a message to deliver through music - and it was a message that was a little too queer for the music industry of Nashville. Since then I\u0027ve played honkey-tonks, dive bars, burlesque shows, blues clubs, gay bars, weddings and even funerals - and now I am performing directly for you, the fans. I thank you all for listening and watching - and now it\u0027s time for me to ask you to contribute a little bit to keep the music coming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy is Jonny asking for money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe short answer to that question is this: producing music is expensive, and I want to keep doing it for you. But let me break it down:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic takes time: \u003c/strong\u003ewe all know that time is money, and all well-crafted art takes time to germinate and be nurtured. I take time out of every day to sit down and work on perfecting at least one song or piece of music. Those who appreciate my music and the thought I put into it are paying me for that time, and for that I can\u0027t thank them enough.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic takes money: \u003c/strong\u003equality production is something I value, and something I want to deliver in my music - and production costs \u003cem\u003ea lot of money. \u003c/em\u003eA small studio in Nashville will charge a songwriter $650 to record one song - and that\u0027s just a demo version. Personally I have opted to build my own studio, which will be cheaper in the long run - but the equipment is still very, very expensive. Your contributions will cover those costs and increase the production value of my music.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does my patronage support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly expenses: \u003c/strong\u003ethese include video production, mixing fees, mastering fees, the rates my musicians charge to record, etc. These are currently accrued in the making of our \u003cem\u003eNashville Studio Tour \u003c/em\u003eweb series, that features performances and productions in many of Nashville\u0027s independent studios.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEquipment: \u003c/strong\u003ethis is where things get really pricey: microphones, cameras, pre-amps, tripods, virtual instruments, lenses, patch cables, mic cables, audio interfaces, drum sticks, guitar strings, keyboards, pens, notebooks, manuscript paper - this list is really endless, but you get the idea.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive performances: \u003c/strong\u003epeople may not be aware of all the expenses that go into live performances, but there are a lot. The major expense is time: rehearsal time, practice time, buying the time at the venue, etc. When it comes to touring, so we can come to those of you not situated in the Nashville area, there are van rental fees, hotel rates, per diems (a daily allowance to everyone on the tour for food, drink and personal expenses), gas, toll roads (hello New York!) and a host of other expenses that pop up on the road. Help us bring the performances to you - I promise, you won\u0027t regret it.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy doesn\u0027t Jonny just sign a record contract?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is a fair question, because hypothetically a record label would cover all these expenses and allow me to produce and perform my music without spending my own money. There is a threefold answer to this little bugger:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecord contracts don\u0027t grow on trees: \u003c/strong\u003ethey may be made of paper, but they\u0027re not very easy to come by. Inborn talent and years of practice make a great musician - but luck and bumping into the right people are what recording contracts are made of.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecord contracts aren\u0027t free: \u003c/strong\u003ethe record label that signs an artist is not just handing money over for the artist to produce and tour their music - they are giving you a loan, with lots of strings, and you will have to pay that loan back.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecord contracts bind the artist to a specific image: \u003c/strong\u003ethis is the most important reason artists should avoid record contracts if they want to produce freely. A record label is not interested in music that critiques society, delves into the human condition, or challenges the status quo; a record label wants commercially viable songs that ultimately make the record label a lot of money. But my goal with music is much bigger than making money. I will live and die satisfied if my music is enjoyed by the few who truly understand and appreciate it, and I wouldn\u0027t trade that satisfaction for all the screaming teenage fans in the world. You are my fans - that is enough.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo...why should I patronize this loon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, because you love music. I\u0027m here to create for you, and I\u0027d appreciate a little something in return. Anything you give is helpful - be it a dollar, a like or a share - but the more you and others can contribute to me, the more I can produce for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
