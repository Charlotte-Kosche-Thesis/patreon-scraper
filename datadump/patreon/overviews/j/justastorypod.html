    "summary": "After a year of producing Just A Story: The Urban Legend Podcast, we\u0027re asking listeners to help us grow. Through the last 52 weeks of sharing, dissecting, analyzing and spreading urban legends, we have realized that the community surrounding this show is incredibly rich, diverse, creative and supportive. Our audience is so often our inspiration, and we want to thank you all for everything you do to support and enrich Just A Story. We are launching our Patreon page as part of our one year anniversary celebration. As you all write or call in with your own legends, as we broaden our focus to the rich traditions of modern folklore around the globe; as we explore history and records of lore; we cannot help but feel we\u0027ve only scratched the surface of the world of urban legends. We want to keep going and learning for a long time to come. As we explore the fears, fables; myths and misdeeds that define us as humans each week, we find many avenues begging to be explored. Your support here on Patreon will enable us to explore that territory. In addition to covering the standard costs associated with podcast production, we plan to use any funds generated on this platform to purchase access to journal databases, newspaper archives and other specialized sources that will allow us to bring you even more thorough and thoughtful analysis of the urban legends that keep this show going. We are lucky to have the loveliest listeners around, and we are genuinely grateful for every single one of you. Your support here will make a difference to us and to the show, and that is not, just a story."
