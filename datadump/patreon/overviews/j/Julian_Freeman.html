This comes across in the filmed interviews, where it is obvious that they found you easy to speak to\" \u003cem\u003eMaria Kingham, Redcar Adult Learning\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"\u003c/em\u003eWhat I enjoy is how you make the space that you are filming in, safe and comfortable for the conversation to unfold.
