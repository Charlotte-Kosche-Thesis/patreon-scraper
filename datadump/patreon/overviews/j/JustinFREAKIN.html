    "summary": "Thank you for considering backing me on Patreon.\u00a0 Over the last few years, I have had some incredible ideas that haven\u0027t been able to come to fruition thanks to a lack of resources.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015 I wrote a treatment for a movie called \u003cem\u003e14 Words\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 It\u0027s based on a slogan used by white nationalists.\u00a0 The movie detailed an Iraq veteran who returned home to a dismal economy in his home state and a sister that had been disowned by her family for her interracial relationship.\u00a0 He was then recruited by the KKK, which had become entrenched in the local sheriff\u0027s department. They get him a job as a deputy even though he continues to struggle with the topic of racism.\u00a0 It climaxes with him in riot gear after the shooting of an unarmed black man by the department. This movie was incredibly moving and insanely topical. Even more so than when I came up with the conception.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 I wrote an adult animated sitcom called \u003cem\u003eCorporate Christ \u003c/em\u003ewhere Jesus returns to take a job as a mid level manager.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 I outlined a documentary called \u003cem\u003eSee Me Pee \u003c/em\u003ewhich had the tag line: Urine for a wild ride! The documentary was about the financial collapse and my penchant for pissing on banks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011 I came up with the concept for a children\u0027s cartoon I call \u003cem\u003eCat-tastrophy! \u003c/em\u003ewhich is based on my love for cats and education.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was not able to follow through on any of these projects because production is expensive and I was born poor in Eastern Kentucky.\u00a0 \u00a0If you would like to see me bring these concepts and more to life, please consider backing me. I want to be able to share my unique prospective and voice with the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eJustinFREAKIN"
