    "summary": "My name is John Stacy Worth. I\u0027m a God loving, grace embracing, father, husband, author, artist, and comic book enthusiast. Oh yeah!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are the perks of becoming a Patron.\u00a0 First, I\u0027m making my entire ebook Trilogy, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Grace Finder Saga\u003c/strong\u003e, available for all Patrons pledging at least $1 a month.\u00a0 You\u0027ll also get access to works in progress as they emerge fresh from the depths of my overflowing inkwell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a short description of my Trilogy, with the cover I designed for book one:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEnter a world of prophets, warriors, street urchins, and royalty; political intrigue and personal betrayal; dragons, giants, a ragtag band of misfits; sword fights and drawn bows; visions and incantations; love, sacrifice, and redemption.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in the face of impending annihilation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://fictionworthreading.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/book-1-1000.jpg\" style=\"width: 359px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy fiction is found at \u003ca href=\"https://fictionworthreading.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFiction Worth Reading\u003c/a\u003e, where\u00a0you can also join my readers group.\u00a0My work\u00a0ranges from the completed Trilogy, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Grace Finder Saga\u003c/strong\u003e, to my short story collection, \u003cstrong\u003eTransdimensional Detours\u003c/strong\u003e. Another book is currently underway. But be aware, not everything in my fiction is appropriate for young children (think PG-13), due to the fantasy type violence and adult themes inherent to the dystopian milieu of my trilogy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you have young children, don\u0027t worry. As fate would have it, writing fiction just isn\u0027t enough. I also create online comics at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kidfriendlycomics.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKidfriendly Comics\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 (I did say my inkwell overfloweth.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, one of the most rewarding moments of my life was captured in this photograph: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://test68.webcomic.ws/files/calebreading.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s my oldest son, reading the printed copy of the comic book I created for him and his little brother.\u00a0 Since then they\u0027ve helped me color and ink a second issue of that particular comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy webcomics are hosted by Comicfury.\u00a0 You\u0027ll find nothing on my site that I consider inappropriate -- no gore, nothing profane, and no excessive or graphic violence.\u00a0 My goal is to create comics that inspire creativity, engage the imagination, and of course are FUN!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do work a day job, for which I am eternally grateful, as it pays the bills and blesses my family in multiple ways. It is completely separate and different from my artistic endeavors, which I also see as a good thing. All that said, there are only so many hours in the day. I just wish that somehow more hours could be set aside for art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, I hope to expand the websites to include more of my creations, whether that means novels, more comics, drawings and/or paintings. Your contributions could help me hire a colorist, provide advertising dollars, or help fund my art in a myriad of ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now I will continue to plug along at work, at home, and make art when I can. \u00a0Thanks in advance for any pledges, shares, or simply good wishes. \u00a0I appreciate it all. Going forward, I\u0027ll post updates here and at my various sites, and will leave you with the advice that I give my sons, when coaching them in their own artistic endeavors:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDraw big, color bold, and stay loose!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn Stacy Worth\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
