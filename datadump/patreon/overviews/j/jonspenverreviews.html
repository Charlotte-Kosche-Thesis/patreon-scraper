If you would still like to support me here, you can, but please be aware that reward tiers will NOT be honored here effective immediately. I may come back to using this website if there is a large enough call for it and the revenue stream warrants it. For now though, Patreon was not doing what I had originally intended and is not something I am actively pursuing at this time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://jonspencerreviews.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJon Spencer Reviews\u003c/a\u003e started out as a passion project in 2015. It was a way for me to discuss, critique, and share the stuff I am into from anime to board games, and so much more! The goal has always been to provide a platform for people to share and discuss the things they love most. Over the years, the site has gotten bigger and better than ever before and it\u0027s all thanks to such wonderful people like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t done everything on my own though. I\u0027ve had help from contributors and fans alike. Established contributors of Jon Spencer Reviews, such as Jacob (\u003ca href=\"https://jonspencerreviews.wordpress.com/tag/jacob-bramlett/\"\u003ehe reviews movies, check out his work here\u003c/a\u003e) will earn a percentage of all earnings associated with this Patreon. By supporting me, you are also helping out other creators. Even if I earn only $1 or $100,000,000 on here, I\u0027ll be sure to share with my contributors all the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of the wonderful community Jon Spencer Reviews is proud to present \u003ca href=\"https://jonspencerreviews.wordpress.com/jons-creator-showcase/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJon\u0027s Creator Showcase\u003c/a\u003e. Originally started as a project by me during January 2018 as a way to promote and discover cool content, the project was unfortunately retired after just one publication run\u00a0showcasing creations\u00a0from December 2017; or so I thought.\u00a0Thanks to \u003ca href=\"https://raistlin0903.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRaistlin\u003c/a\u003e and his call for action, Jon\u0027s Creator Showcase was able to continue by becoming a community effort. Each month the showcase is hosted by a different AMAZING creator in conjunction with me to promote and discover all sorts of GREAT content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I am currently unemployed. I do have a small job 2 hours a week at my church that pays like $50 a month but that is not enough. Your help is really important to me as it allows me to continue to not only produce content, but actually, you know, live. Even if it is just $1, your contribution is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I created this Patreon. Writing has been a hobby of mine, but I would like to take it as seriously as possible. With your help, this dream can become reality. Together, we can make Jon Spencer Reviews even better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, concerns, or just want to say, \"Hi!\" Email me at:\u00a0 jonspencerreviews@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for taking a look!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
