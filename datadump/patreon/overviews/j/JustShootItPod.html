For years we\u0027ve been interviewing directors on the craft of filmmaking, pitching, brainstorming, dealmaking, and all the other behind the scenes aspects of being a working director.\u00a0We\u0027re a place to ask questions, problem solve, and get real about what a filmmaker does, day to day. We wanted to make the resource we wish we had when we first started, and to motivate our community of filmmakers to get out there and JUST SHOOT IT."
