I do this through writing about my own experiences, and being a positive force through writing blogs/articles and videos on YouTube. I will also be doing activist work when I can. I still work full time, as well as run a wellness business so I don\u0027t have a lot of free time. Every little bit here will help me work towards not having to work full time so I can dedicate more time to activism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI know that I will not get everyone to change their ways, but my hope is that I will influence some people and at least get the majority of them to start thinking about what their food started out as. Planting that seed is better than nothing. It might end up blooming into something.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI love to write, and it often comes pretty easily for me, so I figured I would use this talent for some good. I\u0027ve always been an animal lover and advocate. Four months ago I had the epiphany that to be a real animal advocate I had to stop consuming (and using) animal products. Shortly after this I realized that I wanted to spread my message to other people. Going vegan isn\u0027t just a good thing we can do to end animal cruelty; it will also help cure many diseases, it\u0027s a step towards ending hunger, and it will go a long way to saving the Earth herself.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

My journey that brought me here started a year ago, and was completely different. But evolution is a funny thing and sometimes you just have to let things happen they way they will. I will say I am a normal woman from the Midwest of the United States; and I grew up in rural MN in the 80s and 90s. I went pescatarian in 2013, and vegetarian shortly after, mostly for my health. I have been vegan five months now, and it was three and a half months ago that things really started to change for me. I wouldn\u0027t change it for the world. I was watching Joey Carbstrong, Earthling Ed, James Aspey and Mic. The Vegan videos on YouTube. Those guys influenced me in a way that no one ever has before. Watching those videos made me want to do something. They made me realize that just being vegan wasn\u0027t enough; that if I wanted things to change I would have to take some type of action. So here I am, taking action; doing what I can to make a positive change in the world and save lives while I am at it.\u00a0",
