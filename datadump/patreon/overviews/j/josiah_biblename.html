    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\"I take pictures of Humans. This is my Humanism.\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tI\u0027ve taken to using this as a kind of tagline, because it\u0027s true.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\n\t\tI love to shoot conferences, especially atheist/humanist/secular conferences. Geeky conferences. I love creating pictures at any conference full of people completely immersed in enjoying their particular brand of geekery, and in being a part of their chosen communities.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I love, and what I am good at, is humanizing them--us--making us more real and substantial and recognized and understood in the world around us. And I shoot to make these communities themselves more inclusive and welcoming, celebrating these values where I find them. That\u0027s what I see and what I capture. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tThe communities of people that I love to photograph are othered, marginalized, dehumanized, and thus, all too often hated. But as the saying goes, once you get to know someone and you make them real, once you humanize them, they move from those dark margins and fringes to a more accepted, recognized, and welcomed existence. This is what I work for.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tMy photography is not *just* capturing treasured memories and moments (although it is that, too!). It is making people look and see. It\u0027s taking all those flat caricatures of people that society dismisses and tosses aside and replacing them, giving their subjects solid weight and dimensionality in the world. The pictures that I take humanize.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPatreon will help me do that. Conferences aren\u0027t free, and most of them aren\u0027t in Omaha. If you support my work, you\u0027ll help me attend more conferences and create more pictures. You\u0027ll give me the freedom to focus on my subjects instead of figuring out how to afford to get to them. You\u0027ll help me show that more of us are fully human.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy facebook and twitter links are above, and here\u0027s my Instagram: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/josiahmannion/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/josiahmannion/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my public posts will be available via those social media sites. I treat all of them individually, and vary the content produced at each of those according to what seems like it fits those platforms best. In other words, they\u0027re not all linked, and there\u0027s not an overly large amount of cross posting between them. In other other words, depending on your preferred social media, you may actually want to find and follow each of mine. ;-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan\u0027t commit to a monthly thing but still want to support me with a tip from time to time?

     "description": "When we reach this goal, it will allow me to begin to expand my current list of equipment. Right now, I shoot everything with basically two lenses, and process everything on a Lenovo IdeaPad. I love those lenses, and this little laptop, but I need to expand, and glass is expensive. I\u0027m looking first to get a 70-200mm, f2.8 lens. This is a workhorse of a lens, and it will significantly expand the range of shots that I can take at any given venue, (and the range of paying gigs that I can take as well). It\u0027s a gorgeous lens, and it\u0027s also *super* expensive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d also be getting a desktop computer that can keep up with the processing power that I need in order to effectively edit photos at the level and volume at which I should be working. Only working on this little Lenovo, awesome as it is, definitely impacts the speed at which I can process photos, and really impacts the time that I have available for other tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also love to be able to work toward getting a basic set of portable lighting that can travel with me.",
