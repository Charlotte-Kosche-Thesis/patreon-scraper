It\u0027s set up to motivate me to produce content. So, if you intend to donate a total of $10 per month, make a pledge of $2 (I\u0027m trying to average 5 photoshoots per month).\u00a0The funding system is very flexible. You can cap the amount pledged at a certain amount, or just pledge $1 or $2 and let it ride. I\u0027m always here to answer any questions you might have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTRIGGER WARNING:\u003c/strong\u003e Some of the content in my portfolio deals with some very dark places. My personal belief is that we have to face our inner demons in order to overcome them. As such, I often flirt with ideas that scare us... domestic violence, murder, rape, suicide... things that society often find taboo and hide in the dark. Bad things breed in dark. All I try to do is toss the ideas around and understand the evil that people do. It intrigues me in a way, looking at the things that scare me about the human soul. You\u0027ve been warned. Any posts containing nudity will be viewable to patrons only on this site. If you want the full \u0027John Dick Experience\u0027, become a sponsor of my work today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s28.postimg.org/q66j59p31/blood_recipe.jpg\" style=\"float: right; width: 349px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT MY CAMPAIGN: \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve always had an eye for how to compose an image. I\u0027ve always had a penchant for expressing the dark imagery that bubbles just under the surface of us all. There are so many ideas that I want to build and capture... but these things take resources which I do not have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery small amount donated allows me to build ever more elaborate sets... to purchase new makeup and effects... lights, lenses and things that allow me to make better and deeper imagery.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you again for your support. As a gift to you, and incentive to grant me your patronage, please feel free to make use of my Fake Blood Recipe. This has been honed by me personally through years of experience. Yours to enjoy. I\u0027ll periodically be giving away more tips, tricks and behind the scenes information exclusively to patrons. It\u0027s a minor cost to you... probably less than you\u0027d spend on a single latte. Sign up today.\n\u003cbr\u003e"

At this funding level, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be able to afford \u0027pro\u0027 lights... but I\u0027ll be able to hit the hardware store and get the sockets and wiring to create an adjustable array of lights mounted to the ceiling and walls around the entire set. This will allow me a tremendous range of lighting possibilities to experiment with different emotions and lighting effects in my work.\u003c/div\u003e",

I cut them up for capes or sew them up to make costumes. They can be purchased relatively inexpensively at thrift stores. I just bloodied up my last set of white linens, though... and desperately need to restock. Please make a pledge. Once I reach the modest amount of $10 per shoot, I can justify keeping my supply of sheets stocked for any occasion that I may need them for.\u003c/div\u003e",

I\u0027m gonna do a random drawing every month. One lucky patron each month will receive a free, high quality print of one of my favorite pieces from the previous month. I\u0027ll contact you to get your mailing address where you want it sent, of course. But, for the low rate of just a $1 pledge, you will be entered in the running for a free print each and every month.
