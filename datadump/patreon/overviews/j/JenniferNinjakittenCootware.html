    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0 Hello, all! You found my Patreon page! Thank you so much for checking out my art!\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf\u00a0you have a short attention span, read the stuff in bold print as I know this is long\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0I currently \u003cstrong\u003emake wildlife drawings, usually pen and ink,\u00a0sometimes in colored pencil, and currently playing with colored inks\u003c/strong\u003e, with the expectation that I will eventually be using other media such as oils, scratchboard, watercolor, and acrylics. My intent is to \u003cstrong\u003emake wildlife art pieces respecting their anatomy, behavior, and environments, so that most of the pieces can be both aesthetically pleasing and intending to be scientifically\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eaccurate\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eand may be used for anything from a wildlife lovers wall, to a poster that shows the morphological differences between similar species, to the functionality of the hind wings of\u00a0a beetle for flight, while the fore wings\u00a0make up its protective shell.\u003c/strong\u003e In the future, I may (or may not) expand my subjects to be religious, fantasy,\u00a0science fiction, and/or nerdy in nature, much of which would use the zoology knowledge I have to bring some possible reality to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Something I\u0027m considering doing is filling a gap that seems not able to be Googled well involving being an artist of variable abilities because of a neurological disorder, and being able to brave a theme park and/or museum to sketch for their own art. This could be an evolving blog-type thing (and when I\u0027m making enough here, video and live streams) and will likely be a part of this Patreon page (some of it for Patreon patrons only), and probably my Facebook page when I create one specifically for my art (except for Patreon patron exclusive content, but they will likely be announced on Facebook as well as here).\u00a0 This is something I want to do for myself and to sketch more zoo animals and skulls at the local natural history museum (which as of March 2018 I am now a volunteer with the Paleontology department, so YAY!), and figure that since fatigue is one major issue almost everyone with a neurological condition has, it would be worthwhile sharing with you what I learn along the way, and my struggles that you or a loved one may be facing and may be considering your own art and/or craft as an option.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a former volunteer/intern zookeeper, wildlife interpreter, and zoo nutrition tech\u00a0with a Bachelor\u0027s in Zoology\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e(Wildlife Management minor)\u003c/strong\u003e that had to move on from that dream to make money (wasn\u0027t getting any younger and did all that later in life rather than earlier), and then ended up with multiple sclerosis a few years after that which affects me\u00a0physically and mentally more\u00a0than I would like, limiting my options to physically or mentally be employed or even volunteer for that kind of work (can\u0027t even be a volunteer zookeeper or wildlife interpreter anymore :-( ). That\u0027s part of why I\u0027m falling back on using that experience and redirecting it toward my art talent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I forget who exactly introduced me to Patreon, but it\u0027s a wonderful platform to get people to sign up with money in a subscription sort of way instead of a one time\u00a0crowd-funding\u00a0thing\u00a0to encourage people to be your patrons/supporters in a creative skill/art/craft/etc. you want to do, whether you want to do it as a hobby or try to start a business like I\u0027m wanting to do. The hardest thing about setting up your page is figuring how to blab about stuff like\u00a0I\u0027m doing right this moment on this \"About page\", and coming up with rewards you can stick to if you\u0027re having psychological and variable physical issues like I struggle with.\u00a0I encourage you to check out other pages here on Patreon as well, as there is stuff I didn\u0027t know was here that I want to support myself that I already really like (such as StarTalk, Peter Hollens, and TeamFourStar).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebout the artist\u003c/strong\u003e. One thing about me that I put on the back burner once I entered adulthood was my artistic skill. I became jaded over feeling like in order to make money with art, I either had to be able to make masterpieces that sold for a lot, or work for an advertising agency to sell products I didn\u0027t want to use my art for (the \u002790s had fewer options than now by far), so I put my artistic skill aside for \"practical reasons\". Then I majored in psychology (I said, \"practical\", right?\u00a0 Um...), left college to work a light industrial job, and eventually met my fianc\u00e9 (who I have now been with for over 20 years) in ninjitsu class (and, yes, I love kittens, hence the \"Ninjakitten\" nickname). He inspired me to go back to school because I also apparently really liked science and had a knack for biology, but wasn\u0027t encouraged growing up to explore scientific fields or to follow people like Carl Sagan to inspire me to truly explore it, and found my muse again when I took a \u003cstrong\u003esingle\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003escientific illustration\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ecourse\u003c/strong\u003e (where I learned pen and ink isn\u0027t so intimidating a medium\u00a0after all), which got triggered again eventually when I started volunteering for a local wolf center (\u003cstrong\u003eI love and miss you guys so much at California Wolf Center! Check them out if you\u0027re in San Diego County near Julian, CA!\u003c/strong\u003e), and then again now that I have all that cool \u003cstrong\u003escience, wildlife, and behavior knowledge and experience with artistic skill from when I was younger\u003c/strong\u003e, to mesh into the art you see now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I want to \u003cstrong\u003ethank my friends, family, and supporters\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0that have stood behind me and helped me to start believing in myself (even if it did take 20-30 years), encouraged me to go back to school and dare realize I had pursuable interests beyond \"just working a job\", and\u00a0the continuing love and support now that I have multiple sclerosis, which is very essential to anyone suffering a similar condition to function in everyday life much less pursue a passion. I may not have solidified my dream to become a zookeeper, but now I start on this new chapter, which you have encouraged all along, but I hope it that it will manifest that dream into a form I didn\u0027t consider until I put all of this in perspective.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I also want to deeply and undeniably\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ethank my fianc\u00e9\u003c/strong\u003e, Ben, who has loved me enough for so long, believed in my better self, and was (and still is) patient with me. True love promotes growth in an unselfish way, especially when that love becomes a part of growing together. I love you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI also want to thank those of you who choose to be my patrons.\u003c/strong\u003e I hope to make you all proud that you have chosen to show support for what I\u0027m doing, and want to use your patronage to create a future for myself where, despite my disability, I can financially support myself, and in turn I hope I can help you or your friends and family learn more about creating art, as well as managing a creative pursuit while suffering from disabilities. I want to turn your patronage into a win-win situation if I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
