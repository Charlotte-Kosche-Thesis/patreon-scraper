    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for visiting my Patreon page for Spire of Souls! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA game to be enjoyed with friends which combines the best aspects of role-playing games, trading card games, board games, and choose your own adventure novels.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a life-long creative with professional experience in graphic/web design and illustration. I love games of all kinds: board games, card games, video games, and maybe mind games, too. I am HYPED to bring my vision to life! I will combine a bunch of my passions from my hyper-creative mind into a single project; a passion project! It. will. be. epic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Spire of Souls?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpire of Souls is a tabletop card game set in a brooding fantasy setting meant to be enjoyed by you and your friends over multiple sessions. Alongside deck-building, the game will also feature role-playing progression elements, a point system to keep track of who wins the game, and an emphasis on immersing the players in a brand new adventure every time they play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeginning the game, you discover you are a recently departed spirit\u2014a fragment of your former self\u2014and have been trapped within a mysterious tower. To escape and recover your identity, you must enter an equally mysterious nearby portal. Every time you enter, however, you find you\u0027re in a different world and must solve its mysteries in order to ascend to the top and escape your new purgatory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is it about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is in these randomly selected adventures where your party encounters different cards to overcome: traps, obstacles, enemies, etc. It is also where your party makes meaningful decisions on how to play, proceed, and resolve quests\u2014just like you would in a choose your own adventure novel. Stories branch in and out and end differently depending on the choices you make as a team. These fate-changing choices often have no correct answer and the consequences will be yours to bear forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, you will be rewarded with new powers, abilities, items, and the option to restore derelict parts of the tower as you progress towards the spire. After meeting certain conditions, you can also unlock more clues about your past life as well as additional (and sometimes more complex) features of the game for further replayability and depth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you play, you will specialize in certain skills and abilities which come in the form of cards and affect your usefulness in different situations. You may excel at defeating enemies while your friends can have a greater effect on decision-making and the outcome of a scenario. You will also draw a virtue, alignment, or objective card each game. Fulfilling your secret criterion, working with your party, or playing a particular way will reward you points called quintessence. Quintessence can be spent to increase your power, upgrade/ascend the tower, or on other benefits.\u00a0At the end of the game, if you have the most collected quintessence, you win and are released from the tower. The rest of your team are sent back to the bottom, still trapped to do the tower\u0027s bidding.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, the scope of the game is huge and, although the journey of creation will be a labor of love, it is labor still. All pledges and support will be directly responsible for allowing me to continue working and making a great game. In the meantime, you\u0027ll get exclusive access to cool rewards like development updates, design iterations, print-and-play demos for alpha/beta testing, and more through my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does your money actually pay for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\tThe Patreon funds cover a variety of things (printing materials such as cards and books for testing, hiring a small army of creatives to write and design, assembly, and keeping the lights on), which in turn allows me to consistently develop the game and push it towards completion.\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tHow can you support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\tYou can join me by contributing to the Patreon. For as little as a dollar ($1) a month you can provide me with the means to continue creating Spire of Souls for the world to enjoy once it\u2019s complete.\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t\tWhat do you get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t\tDid I mention rewards? Check it out: any amount gets you an exclusive look at regular development updates and listed in the thank you section of the game; higher tiers will unlock previous rewards and! Primo.\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\tLastly, I want to say THANK YOU!
