    "summary": "Hi! thanks for looking at my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA quick explanation about Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e you can help support creative people if you like their work, by pledging $1 (or more if you like) for each piece of content. That means, when I post something (a video, tutorial or sneak peek etc) then your pledge means you can see it and use it. You can put a cap on how many posts you want to see a month, so even if I post 100 times, if you\u0027ve capped it at 4, you only get charged for 4.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom my hobbit hole studio at the end of my wild garden, funny things have been happening. Ideas that start like a friendly bumble bee buzzing around, end up on a page, either as a book for children or as a piece of art. I spend some of my time doing pet \u0026amp; people portraits that make my customers go a bit gooey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 180px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/91/2c/6a/912c6ab78d35bc7714336c54cdfd8519.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWorking as an illustrator for 20 years, I\u0027ve had a secret passion: children\u0027s fiction. In 2012, I decided to take the plunge and indie publish my first children\u0027s picture book, Vincent and the Vampires - about a vegetarian vampire bat who is scared of the sight of blood. It sold quickly and that started me on a delicious path. I am currently working on number 9, Fidget, and here\u0027s a picture from the book -\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAMqwwLXcAUeZSb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.julesmarrinerbooks.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAMqwwLXcAUeZSb.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome books that kids are exposed to (\u003cem\u003eor made to read in school\u003c/em\u003e) can be pretty dull. I make stories that start with a \u0027what if...\u0027 moment, often about something quite random, or a conversation that I\u0027ve overheard in the supermarket.

At the end of the research, development, illustrating and editing, I need to print and buy copies of my new book to get them on the shelves. Now, I am also making videos so that children can watch my stories too, your pledge can help me do all of these things and bring them to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become one of my patrons, you will be able to unlock posts and other goodies that will make you go \u0027woo-hoo\u0027 or \u0027holy moly\u0027 or even sometimes, \u0027wowsers-trousers\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to say a big thank you for just looking at my page - but if you become my patron, I will be sending you virtual hugs across the airwaves and raising a cup of tea in your name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp me get funny stories around the world.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
