    "summary": "I\u0027m so excited to use this platform to connect with you on a deeper level! This place is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to show Chile off to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s videos about Chile and showing off these beautiful locations to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this channel with all my heart. It\u0027s helping others (like you and me both!) bring more value to the world by making it financially sustainable long-term. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like) per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gears.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I tend to publish about 16 YouTube videos to the Video Creators channel. Each time I do so, I share that YouTube video here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of YouTube videos I publish that month determines how much you contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, \u003cstrong\u003eif you pledge $1 per YouTube training and that month I publish 16 videos, you\u0027ll contribute $16 for that month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there are no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you can pledge $10 per YouTube video, get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $10, thus supporting 10 YouTube videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either. You will still continue to get my YouTube videos even if I publish additional YouTube videos on Patreon that go beyond your maximum contribution limit for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/give-money.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to invest into producing free YouTube videos for the YouTube community of creators who have a big mission behind their work online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do more important things, like investing time into my wife and kids! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eShoot, I don\u0027t have money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/no-money1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem at all! Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money or are struggling financially. I know what that feels like and want you to take care of more important priorities first. I will continue to make videos that I hope will help you and give you a smile in your day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jon Gross and I\u0027ve been a YouTube creator since October of 2016. In 2015 my wife and I moved to Chile and are on a crazy adventure! During that time I used YouTube to publish videos showing Chile to my family living in the United States. At the time I was just having fun. Now those videos are known as \"Fun with Tio Jon.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2952738?hl=en\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/youtube-certified-dark.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 25px 15px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eToday I have created and published over 300 YouTube videos and amassed millions of views. I\u0027ve met some really great people in my last year and can\u0027t wait to meet even more people in 2018.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeeing the unmatched potential of video to reach and influence people, I decided to jump head on and do YouTube more permanently in 2018. I would love your support to make this happen and can\u0027t wait to continue to Explore Chile with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! I really does mean a lot to me. My family and I really appreciate it!"
