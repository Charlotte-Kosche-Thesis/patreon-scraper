My writing has been featured in Sweatpants \u0026amp; Coffee, Lady/Liberty/Lit, Mookychick, Nailed Magazine, Annapurna Living, The Baltimore Review, and more. I\u0027m also an editor and mentor for other writers, and I facilitate retreats and workshops. If you like, feel free to call me the Original Detective of Joy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you\u0027ve been reading my sing-song holiday poetry since I was five, have been a long time subscriber to my newsletters (a.k.a. love letters), have read my novel or essays or short stories, or are just showing up right at this very moment, I\u0027m so grateful and delighted that you\u0027re here. It matters that we\u0027re here together, and I thank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to our story sanctuary.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nSTORY SANCTUARY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI say our, because this space is for you and for me. Where I am, so too is there chocolate, irreverence, and whale paraphernalia. Also this: at the beginning of any workshop or retreat I lead, I tell the group that I\u0027m committed to creating sanctuary for stories and the people who need to tell them, and I ask them to co-create that sanctuary with me. So I ask the same of you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat means that this space must be both a soft place for us to land and springy enough to bounce us back up. Relief + Rejuvenation. Receive + Give. Which brings me to sacred exchange.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nSACRED EXCHANGE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo me, that\u0027s what Patreon is about. A way for me to treasure you through the words and stories I offer, and for you to treasure me, through patronizing me and what I create. Not patronizing like you pat me on the head and sarcastically tell me that my crayon drawing is nice. Rather, patronizing as in valuing the word art I create by making a monthly offering.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I write, I give my all. I let it loose from the center of me. When I write, I allow myself to be transformed, to learn something, to grow, to explore, to play, and often to heal. I surrender myself to the process, and all of that goes into the stories I\u0027ll give to you here. Essays, stories, form-defying word conglomerations, blessings, whatever it may be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, I give, and you receive.

Am I too heavy? Does this mean someone\u0027s going to touch my butt? Should I have put on perfume, or peed first? What if they drop me? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eTerrifying. And exciting. As is this now. I surrender to the stories, to the words that run hot through my veins, that tumble like tiny, shiny acrobats out of my lips and fingertips, and in so doing, share my heart and skill with you, and I trust you to catch me, to give me a soft, strong place to land. A sacred exchange.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWHAT WILL PATRONAGE DO FOR YOU?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron, you will be rewarded! How? Well, first with words from me. Hot-off-the-presses and dipped-from-the-bubbling-story-cauldron words, before anyone else reads them. Other reward possibilities include writing prompts and rituals for you to use and enjoy, as well as the possibility of a creative consult with me, or editorial feedback on your writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you know, I could tell you what my writing will do for you, but I thought it might be even more helpful for you to know what it does for other readers. So I asked them, on Facebook. And then I read what they wrote and cried, like I do:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou make me feel real. I\u0027m not kidding or exaggerating.

She has a natural ability to get myself and \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eothers to want to open up through our own writing, to wish and want to follow her lead through every possible emotion that might come up.

And often, I find my time and effort tilts to the teaching, mentoring and editing. Which pays the bills. Often then, my own writing becomes secondary, and if I want to do something to nurture it (go to a quiet place for a week or two to write, revise, and polish work for publication; take a course to deepen my art and craft; update the technology I use), it becomes a luxury expense I have to pay for, rather than something I share freely.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I gladly put blood, sweat, and tears into my writing and I will willingly go to bat for the right to use my voice, I don\u0027t want writing itself to feel like something I have to fight for. Instead, I want it to be something I give, with ease and with joy. I\u0027m done with the Starving/Struggling Artist archetype.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jenvioli.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/joy-blocks.png?w=700\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn fact, I want 2018 to be a Golden Age of Delight! That term popped into my head a few months ago, and has stayed with me. It feels ridiculous to declare a Golden Age of Delight, given everything happening in the world, and given the personal grief that nearly drowned me this past year. But even just saying \"Golden Age of Delight\" makes me smile. I can\u0027t help it. Try it. For real. Say it with flourish, and see how it feels.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t know about you, but for me it feels better. It lifts me and gives me the energy I need to take one more brave step in the world. And so that\u0027s what I declare this year to be: A Golden Age of Delight!\u00a0One in which I devote myself to the practice of writing, shake loose whatever beliefs and structures hold me back, pay off debts, and finish a new book to share with you. If it helps, please feel free to declare your own Golden Age of Delight, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jenvioli.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/whale-stickers-2.png?w=430\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere\u0027s some of what this sacred exchange will allow me to do: \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003emy first computer upgrade since 2008 (eep!), for ease in creating everything, including, I hope, fun and useful videos to support you and your writing. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003efund the time and space for me to finish my next book.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ecreate an ergonomic work space that doesn\u0027t compromise my shoulders and neck.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003etake workshops to support my continued growth as a writer.

I have much to learn and want to continue deepening my art and craft.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eand I\u0027ll be honest here. Whatever comes to me through Patreon will also be part of my monthly income, which means each time I reach one of the goals I identify (see the goals page!), it will also help me to pay rent, pay off debt, and further enter The Golden Age of Delight.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\nI haven\u0027t followed a traditional path, and I don\u0027t think that makes me better or worse than anyone else.

It means that a creative approach is needed, which is why I\u0027m here, with you. Making it up as I go along. Which is, frankly, what I\u0027ve always done, late bloomer that I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jenvioli.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-11-13.10.58.jpg?resize=300%2C169\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nLATE BLOOMER\u0027S CLUB\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a card-carrying member of the Late Bloomer\u0027s Club. Actually, we don\u0027t have cards yet because the person who will be making them hasn\u0027t bloomed yet. But I trust they\u0027ll be along when the time is right.

Late blooming means many things, including these:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eNormal schedules and systems and supposed to\u0027s generally don\u0027t work for me. Maybe you can relate. This year, I turn 45, and feel like I should own a house, be married, have a regular job. I don\u0027t. I\u0027m not. I probably never will.

Speaking of which...\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI take myself seriously and not seriously at all, in equal parts. Having been off-time for most of my life, I\u0027ve had to learn to shift expectations and perception of myself and everything else. I\u0027ve learned to straddle the in-between, to dwell in the mystery, to find the right moment within myself. This means I get to see things differently, often seeing through bullshit and right to the invisible heart at the center. This means that when I write, I make the heart visible to you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003eSo, with all the hormonal intensity of a teenager in a high school gym decked out with streamers and balloons, all the sincerity of Mr. Rogers, and all the pizazz of an ocean of twinkly lights, I ask:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCould you be mine?
