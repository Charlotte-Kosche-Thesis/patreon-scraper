I\u0027ve been a professional writer since I was a teen, but I\u0027ve never faced a challenge like I do right now, and if anybody is in a position to help me, that would be a great relief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a comedy historian, and Douglas Adams\u0027 official biographer (as well as Fry \u0026amp; Laurie, Blackadder and ISIHAC) but my main passion at the moment is TALESOFBRITAIN.COM \u2013 a campaign to promote and revive the joint Scottish, Welsh and English treasury of ancient stories, and UK tourism, with a book, audio podcast, and maybe even TV and more. This passion started over 13 years ago when my first nephew was born, and I\u0027ve been retelling British folktales ever since, taking out religious dogma, misogyny, anything that lets these stories down for a 21st century audience, and above all, making them FUN.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very glads the book is launching on Unbound, and I hope it captures the public\u0027s imagination \u2013 I also love performing these tales in live events, but never make any money doing do. And as my latest book, delivered two months ago, has been delayed by publishers, I suddenly find myself drowning in unpaid writing work, on the promise of income maybe 18 months in the future \u2013 so I have to survive until then, somehow. I freelance all I can, and am available for all sorts of editorial work, but any assistance you can provide, keeping me going, telling these stories and promoting UK culture and tourism, I will very gratefully accept. I\u0027m happy to take uke cover requests too.",
