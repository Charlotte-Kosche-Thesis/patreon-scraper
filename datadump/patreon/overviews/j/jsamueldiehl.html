    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eTo create other worlds and places is an exciting experience. It\u0027s also a long drawn out experience full of ups and downs and twists and confusing loops holes that take a lot of Caffeine to fill. It\u0027s also a lot more these days than just sitting down and writing (although that\u0027s still the core experience). Helping to sponsor me on this quest will help pave that road. With that I\u0027ll be sharing through blog and podcast how things are going, some writing examples, samples of current works, and asking for opinions on forks along the path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what does your patronage do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePay for server space and software initially. Eventually it\u0027ll lead to a better site, and better equipment for both the writing and the podcasting. This allows me to create multiple times a week flash fiction, podcast episodes, short stories, and serials on a regular basis. It also serves as a supplement to long form fiction between major releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get from being a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially you get early access to any fiction destined to be free on the site. Flash fiction, serials, short stories, and audio fiction for the podcast will come to patrons at least a week earlier than the main feeds. You\u0027ll also get to see sample chapters that might not even make it to the site. Higher Tier supporters will get access to pre-release copies of direct publishing novels and collections before they go up as exclusives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will you see results?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFlash Fiction, and podcast episodes each will drop a minimum of three times a week, with occasional bonus episodes. Short Stories will appear at least once each quarter. When serials are active, they will take a slot from flash fiction each week. Novels will appear on an as created basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You for your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour donation is extremely appreciated, and I\u0027ll be happy to shout out on the show and the blog those of you who chip in. Even if you\u0027re only able to take part for a few months or are in it for the long haul, thank you. Every penny counts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
