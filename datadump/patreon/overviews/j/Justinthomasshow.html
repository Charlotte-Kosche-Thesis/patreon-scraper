Just a small donation once a month will allow me to improve the quality of my content as well as provide you guys with all sorts of cool perks and giveaways and more importantly we will be building a community of like minded creative individuals who all share the same love for these fandoms. By becoming a member you become so much more than simply financiers you will become apart of the creative process. I love creating content and will always keep working to improve the quality and a small amount of finicial support as low as 3 dollars a month would be barley noticeable to most and would make a huge difference for myself and this channel . Please consider becoming a part of this journey with me and sign up today!!"
