    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003c/strong\u003e for making your way to my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a digital abstract/modern artist with some radical ideas about sharing my art to more people than has ever been done before outside of museum paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you like change, I offer \"print them yourself\" rewards in exchange for a small donation. You can change your wall art frequently and affordably. You can sign up and cancel to get the current month offerings without charge, since your credit card will not be charged until the 1st of the month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get for supporting me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Shared credit in spreading my art to the eyes and benefit of a larger audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Free access to selected full resolution images.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 You print at the size you want or use a local printer like Walgreens.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Rotate your wall decorations like a museum at very low cost. \u003cbr\u003e\u2022 You can use the same frame to house a print of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 My images will add color, and conversation pieces to your walls. \u003cbr\u003e\u2022 If you are an artist, you can learn from my sharing of techniques.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Ways to create digital art of your own the easy way\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 My workflow and the kinds of low cost applications I use for each step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life has taken some amazing turns for the better by learning to raise my consciousness a little. I feel I am now living much more in the moment and able to somewhat control my thoughts rather than have them control me. \u00a0Life is about choices. We cannot change what has already happened, but we can stop having our attitude governed by the past. I want to bring more joy to the lives of thousands of people by sharing cutting edge inspirational images.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccomplishing My Vision\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI envision sharing my images to a world-wide audience of millions via the Internet constantly adjusting their positive message. \u00a0I am hoping you might like to share in my vision and possible invest in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel the impact of my positive messages helpful personally, hopefully you will refer me to others and help grow my audience. Hopefully I can help more and more people leave positive and joyful lives by changing their thoughts one painting at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFollowing Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy latest images can be seen at my \u003ca href=\"http://www.risingrims.com\"\u003ewww.risingrims.com\u003c/a\u003e Web site. You will see the current weeks work on entering my site. \u00a0Scroll down on the RisingRims website\u003cbr\u003e to see the 200 most current paintings and 200 previous to the current paintings. At the moment, the best way to get my positive messages is via Instagram @risingabstracts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am interested in growing my views per image as well as continuing to produce a lot of interesting images. I can also providing low cost images that can be enjoyed electronically or downloaded. I envision being able to distribute your requested images and my favorite images for low cost for you to print locally and frame as you see fit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I usually submit 3 or 6 of the days best images on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInvest in my vision and help support my studio.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the stated awards, higher tier patrons will be able to request their favorite monthly image as a full sized digital file to print and frame for themselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I am asking for your support:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u2022 I want to spend my time creating, rather than exhibiting to try and sell work. I don\u0027t want to become an Internet ordering center taking print orders to send out either.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I want to continue to offer my work to a wider audience by eliminating exhibit and printing expenses.\u003cbr\u003e* Running my studio costs me money.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I tend to purchase new software related to image creating each month. At last count I use about 60 different programs.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I have an appetite (but not the budget) to use speedy new hardware and replace aging equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I love to create and view Abstract and Inspirational art? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel more alive when I can get up above a landscape that I am immersed in and can see the overview. I love the overall perspective in art and other things. This is probably why I love spaces with a view like mountain hikes and my house halfway up the Rimrocks with an overview of Billings.\u003cbr\u003eI also like to explore new places and things to expand my perspective. There is nothing newer than an abstract you have never seen before.\u003cbr\u003eAlso this new career allows me to explore and use new digital tools every day. My tool kit is huge and growing fast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading. Spread the word via the share button if you know others who might be interested in helping. \u00a0 Contact me directly for more details. \u00a0joel@risingrims.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
