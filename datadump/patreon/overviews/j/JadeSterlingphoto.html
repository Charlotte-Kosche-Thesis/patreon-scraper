    "summary": "My name is Jade and I\u0027ve been making some form of art since I was a child. I started photography in 2008 and love using it as a medium to create and tell stories. I also like to paint and sketch, which then become the framework for future photo sets. Sometimes my sketches take on a life of their own and become an individual art piece.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal on Patreon is to use my art to create stories through portraits and painting. I hope to evoke emotions in my patrons and receive feedback on what my art makes them feel. Art is subjective and I\u0027m very interested in knowing what each of my pieces means to someone. The way that people see and feel things differently is fascinating to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you will help me offset some of the costs for props, models and access to locations I use in my shoots. Additionally, you\u0027ll be giving me the ability to expand to more complex ideas in the future, as I will be able to concentrate more fully on my art (and release more content).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that can be used by artists, musicians and other creatives as a means to create and release content to their patrons. Patrons are people who donate a small recurring fee to help artists create art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003eBesides being a superbly awesome person and supporting the arts, you get to see into the creative process of an artist as well as help collaborate on future art, as questions, see behind the scenes content to name a few. You also get some cool rewards that are listed in the \"reward tier\" portion of the page. You get different rewards based on the amount you donate."
