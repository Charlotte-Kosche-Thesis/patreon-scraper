My work has topped the Amazon charts multiple times, won the 2015 Kindle Scout Program, and picked up two 2017 ATAI awards - for Best Thriller and Best General Fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing since 2013, and it\u0027s been my full-time job since June 2016. To write for a living has been my dream since I was a child. It\u0027s hard work. I pull long hours, get no sleep (thanks to a brain that never switches off), and have a Internet search history that would make most government agencies blush!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an full-time indie author, there\u0027s a lot of pressure to maintain an online presence and to regularly engage with my audience.\u00a0One of the things I love most about writing is being able to interact with my readers and give them the information and experience they want. It\u0027s not easy, because people want different things. I try to avoid sending every update I have via e-mail, because I know not everyone wants that level of detail in exchange for their support. Over the last twelve months or so, I\u0027ve spread myself very thin trying to keep the various social media accounts and e-mail lists up-to-date.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003ePATREON\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I host my blog, which I update a couple of times a week, so readers who are interested in that next level of detail can get an extra insight into what it takes to maintain a successful author career. It\u0027s also the main place for any important announcements and new release information. All posts are free and are tagged so you can easily find what you\u0027re looking for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, because it also functions as a sort of crowdfunding site for content creators, it allows me to offer you really cool stuff in exchange for sponsorship, which is awesome for all concerned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to check out my books, you can buy them directly from me via my online store -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jamespsumner.com/store\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLINK\u003c/a\u003e. It also has some cool merchandise on there, if you\u0027re interested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy GOALS, which you\u0027ll see on the left, break down the cost of running an author business into three stages. That way, if you\u0027re kind enough to sponsor my work, you can see exactly what your patronage is put towards - the ultimate goal of a self-sufficient business!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for checking me out. I hope you decide to stick around!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake care,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJames\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
