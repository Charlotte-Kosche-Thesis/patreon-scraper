The fact that you\u0027re even on this page means the world to us. We love to have a good time and joke around (as our video demonstrates!), but every kind word, every slightest consideration, every single supporter - no matter how big or how small - completely changes our world. We make these games \u003cem\u003efor you\u003c/em\u003e, and it means everything to us when you play them, root for them, and support them. You are the heart of what we do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jenito.com/patreon/PatreonImg2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth Tim and I have a huge passion for making games. We want to constantly push ourselves to be better. We want to always be trying new things and new genres. We want to listen to what our community is telling us and both add and remove features to make the game exactly what it should be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now our big project is \u003cem\u003eCheonsa\u003c/em\u003e, and if you\u0027re here you\u0027ve probably already seen or played it a good bit. But we don\u0027t want you to think that you\u0027re just supporting one project. You\u0027re supporting Jenito, and that means continual access to a community that\u0027s all about making fun games. We don\u0027t want to become a \"one-hit wonder\" kind of studio that makes a game and then spends the next fifteen years doing nothing but talking about that one success. We want to support it through its life-cycle, give you the best experience you can get out of it, and then move on the next big project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.jenito.com/patreon/PatreonImg3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me be frank: making games is tough work. There is a perception among a lot of people that making games is either super easy or that every game maker out there is super successful and sitting around in piles of money. Neither is true, and we have had firsthand experience with the bitter financial realities of watching games bring in only $5 or $10 dollars here and there and fizzling out after a very short time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what we don\u0027t want is to become some guys just asking you for your money. Our reward tiers are meant to offer real, tangible products from which you can truly benefit. For example, the $5 a month tier gives you early access to any game that we have in that phase. Right now \u003cem\u003eCheonsa\u003c/em\u003e might be the main push, but that doesn\u0027t mean we won\u0027t be working on other smaller projects. And when that time comes, not only will you be the first to know about it, but you\u0027ll be the first to \u003cem\u003eplay it\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond playing the latest games from Jenito, we also want you to become part of an online community that really has a say in what we\u0027re doing. No, we can\u0027t implement every new idea presented to us. But we want to talk them over. We want to do community polls. We want to see what you want and make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn closing, we want to be clear that we appreciate every single Patreon. Whether you donate $1 a month or $50 a month, words cannot express our gratitude to you for helping us achieve this amazing dream. You are now and always a part of the Jenito team, and we love you all!\u003cbr\u003e"
