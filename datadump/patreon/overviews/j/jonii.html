    "summary": "Hi there. If you\u0027re my mom, my girlfriend or my brother, you can skip this part and go straight to the donating bit. If not, let me explain myself. I\u0027m Joni van der Leeuw, a dutch composer, singer and musician. In another life I rehearsed twice a week and did many great gigs with my band\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bandcamp.com/oiiomusic\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOIIO\u003c/a\u003e, but nowadays I\u0027m mainly occupied with creating soundtracks for and supporting development at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.abbeygames.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAbbey Games\u003c/a\u003e; the dutch games studio that created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.reusgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eReus\u003c/a\u003e. If you played and/or bought it: thanks, you\u0027ve put my life up side down. In a very, very good way! I\u0027m working with music and games every day now and I wouldn\u0027t wish for any other job, ever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy new life as a game developer/composer also brought a small unexpected downside with it, though: I kind of lost touch with my love for making pop music. And I\u0027ve decided to turn that around. From january 2015 on I\u0027ll be creating and uploading songs, tracks, demos, snippets, maybe even work in progress videos. I\u0027d also love to put up some instrumental soundtrack work, just to keep the two sides of my work connected. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t need any money to do any of that. That\u0027s why all my content will always be available to listen and watch for free. \u00a0But I can use all the motivational help that I can get. By supporting my campaign, I know that people are waiting for more music and nothing is more motivating than that kind of pressure. And money is always nice, of course :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027d like to be involved in supporting me, please feel free to do so and become my patron on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/a\u003e. You\u0027ll immediately get acces to my exclusive Patreon stream, where I\u0027ll post updates on what I\u0027m working on and where we can communicate. And don\u0027t worry about me draining all your money: you can set a maximum amount per month and pay just as much or as little as you like!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf and when this project grows bigger, if the number of songs starts to form a critical mass and if enough people are hungry for more, I will start to think about things like a professionally recorded EP or album, a band, live performances, tours, whatever. But not before. For now I would very much like to keep this thing small and between us: the creator and the patron. I hope we\u0027ll have a great time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnjoy,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Jonii"
