Chances are most of you know me from my previous work on The Movie Blog, AMC Movie News or most recently Collider Video. At my core I\u0027m a film pundit and fan. I love to analyze, examine and talk about movies and TV like a sports fan talks about their favorite teams.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003eWHY I NEED YOUR HELP\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter having a lot of success and a fair amount of fun I decided in June that it was time for me to no longer work under a corporate owned entity. I\u0027ve been lucky in my career to work with wonderful corporations like AMC Theatres, Complex Networks and Verizon, but trying to work as a creative under corporate overlords became tiring. I found myself yearning for the days when I used to run my old website \"The Movie Blog\" as a creative independent with all the honesty, creative freedom and personal standards that doing so allowed me. And so, after the death of a dear friend which reminded me that life is short, I left Collider to re-launch my Youtube channel as an independent creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn doing so, I took a giant leap of faith with a solid belief in my mission - \"To contribute to the fan community by creating informative, challenging and entertaining content for fans everywhere.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do so full-time (creating 70-90 videos per month on my own takes a lot of time) is an expensive endeavor. It was actually my viewers who told me about Patreon and encouraged me to use it because they also believed in my mission and wanted a way to contribute to its success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003eEVERY BIT MAKES A DIFFERENCE\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, if you are someone who takes time out of your day to watch my content, then I am truly honored. Just your viewership helps the channel, so thank you! If you\u0027re broke or someone who doesn\u0027t have enough money to do much more than make ends meet, then I don\u0027t want your money. Your participation as a viewer and commenter is more than enough! Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re able to join any of the $2/month, $5/month or $15/month levels, then your contribution to the channel and mission of the videos can\u0027t adequately be put into words. You are, quite accurately, the very life blood of The John Campea Youtube channel. Not only does it allow me to create all this monthly content on an ongoing basis, but it also inches us closer to being able to hire other creative people to help with editing, graphics and other on-camera talent to increase the quality of my videos. You are not only an observer of my\u00a0journey, you are on the journey with me! Thank you!"
