I am a mother of five children, grandmother of one adorable little girl, and wife to an awesome man. I am a creative, with writing being my first passion. I\u0027ve been writing ever since I was a child and always knew that my entire life would revolve around writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a full time writer and have about thirty titles published on Amazon. Most of my work is paranormal/Urban Fantasy/Romance. I run a book promotion business, as well as take care of the household stuff. One of the best things about writing is that I can be here for my kids, who are always my main focus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my goal for this page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to bring you a chapter a week of a novel that will be exclusive to Patreon. Once the novel is completed, it will be published. You will also get new short stories, videos, swag and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere the money goes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have four kids still at home. That is pretty much the whole of it. Kids cost money and I want to provide the absolute best life I can for them. Of course, I might spring for a present for myself here and there. Also, I will be investing a good portion of the funds from this project into swag for rewards. I am hoping to have book boxes available after a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI hope you enjoy my work.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI am really looking forward to the first project I have planned,\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a dystopian vampire novel called, Fighting For Blood (New Earth Chronicles). It\u0027s going to be AH-Mazing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
