I was in the prayer room at my local church asking God for help, wisdom and direction. I really prayed that early morning, laying my life out before God with my words. I really wasn\u0027t praying for myself that morning but was concerned about my church and the people in it. As I prayed I began to think how I might better serve the people in my life and I ended up saying \"God, if you want me to do music then you\u0027re going to have to swing open the doors for me and fast!\" I walked out of the prayer room and within an hour and a half a producer/friend of mine that I hadn\u0027t talked to in over 10 years \"accidentally\" calls me. Some people call it coincidence\u00a0but I knew it was God helping me. Faith told me that. I called him back almost immediately and we began to talk. He told me how God had been speaking to him about teaming up with an artist and I told him how God had been speaking to me about teaming up with a producer. It was a divine appointment. We sensed in the conversation that God was doing something special.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIsaiah 55:8 says \"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways declares the Lord.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what my sweet friend Ms. Julie Perez says \"when God does it, He does it good!\" \u003cbr\u003eI hope you get the sense that you are stepping into a miracle because that\u0027s what it is. God is in this so welcome to the miracle! My friend and I are working hard on the music for this album RIGHT NOW and we have already sensed the help of the Holy Spirit guiding and leading us upon it\u0027s creation. It\u0027s an exciting time and I can\u0027t WAIT to share these God-inspired, Christ-centered, Holy Spirit-filled musical inspirations with you this year! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome be a part of what God is doing and YOU WILL BE BLESSED! \u003cbr\u003eFor all of you that have encourgaed\u00a0me in my musical life until now..\u00a0hear my heartfelt \"thank you.\" For all of you just meeting me, welcome to the journey, I know you\u0027ll be encouraged."
