I\u0027ve been a long-time contributor to the \u003ca href=\"http://mcstories.com/Authors/Jukebox.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eErotic Mind Control Stories Archive\u003c/a\u003e, with over 200 short stories to my name. My writing tends to be eclectic, but it all shares a common theme of that very exciting place where the mind loses control and desire takes over. Whether it\u0027s vampire kink, telepathy, subliminal messages, or erotic hypnosis, all of my stories focus on the ways that giving up one\u0027s will (temporarily or permanently) can be one of the most sensual experiences of all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking for your support for my stories--the more people who pledge, the more stories I can create. I will be posting my stories to the EMCSA, to \u003ca href=\"https://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?uid=1236860\u0026amp;page=submissions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiterotica\u003c/a\u003e, and to \u003ca href=\"https://fetlife.com/groups/1324\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Erotica group\u003c/a\u003e on FetLife. With more of your support, I\u0027ll be able to publish them as ebooks as well. The more you help me, the more we\u0027ll get out of it together!\u003cbr\u003e"
