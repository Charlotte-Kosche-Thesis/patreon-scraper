Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a writer, musician, and impresario living in Vancouver, Canada. This Patreon page follows my continuing adventures, including my family\u0027s recently-concluded travels around Europe, as well as the new adventure of figuring out where we will live and how we will make the most of the city. Think of this page as a handy spigot from which flows the products of my artistic practice, including their documentation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo tell you a bit about my work as\u00a0a writer--in 2014, I won the 2014 Robert Kroetsch Award for\nInnovative Poetry for \u003cem\u003eHidden City\u003c/em\u003e\n(Invisible Publishing). I am also the author of \u003cem\u003e(flood basement\u003c/em\u003e (Caitlin Press 2009).\nMy work has appeared in \u003cem\u003eGeist, Lemon\nHound, Open Letter, \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eCanadian Literature \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e PRISM International,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eamong other places.\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI have a M.A. in English with a focus on creative writing and literary theory. I am\u00a0currently at work on a novel about Sancho Panza\u2019s donkey taking a journey through hell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a self-taught guitarist, singer, improviser, and songwriter. My music is on the spectrum of Neil Young and Nirvana to freely improvised noise rock. I\u0027ve toured Canada, sharing stages and/or collaborating with artists like Oxbow, Lightning Bolt, Geoff Berner, Wax Mannequin, Stanley Jason Zappa, Catherine Sikora, Matt Weston, Andrew Wedman, Harold Klunder and Catherine Carmichael, Dave Chokroun, Jonathon Wilcke, Darren Williams, Marcel Gagnon, and Raghu Lokanathan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also create events. I recently joined City Opera Vancouver as the General Manager. I have over twenty years of experience in the arts, from promoting my own punk and metal concerts as a teenager to becoming founder and board chair of Casse-T\u00eate: A Festival of Experimental Music. Highlights include two and a half years as General Manager of the Prince George Symphony Orchestra; three and a half years as Marketing \u0026amp; Development Officer of Theatre North West; a summer as ArtsWells Festival Coordinator; owning and managing Dreamland School of the Arts; and founding and publishing Dreamland Magazine.
