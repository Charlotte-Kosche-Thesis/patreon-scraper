I\u0027m Jodie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI love writing. My username\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fictionpress.com/u/721548/Jodiexxx\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJodiexxx\u003c/a\u003e as well on \u003cem\u003eFictionPress\u003c/em\u003e for reference, but a lot of that writing\u0027s old, and my writing style has changed and evolved over the years as I continued writing and practicing. My main story there,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2843393/1/Happiness\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHappiness\u003c/a\u003e, has really slow updates because I just can\u0027t afford the time it\u0027d take to write each chapter. I write little bits a little at a time, and it\u0027s just not enough to complete a chapter quickly since I can\u0027t stop worrying about the financial aspect; spending a large part of my time writing for free isn\u0027t going to put food on the table. So becoming my patron also goes towards my production of the story! I really want to finish it before I start growing a beard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat I Will Do\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue writing updates for Happiness entirely for free of course,\u00a0but also potentially\u00a0include side-stories for Happiness here for my patron-only feed.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not going to arrange my stories by patron/pledge-tier; as long as you\u0027re my patron, you get to see all the new stories I\u0027m posting here.\u003cbr\u003eI will also be posting new stories and their chapters, as well as various one-shots with repeating characters here, exclusive to Patreon,\u00a0in alternating turns at least once a month, and up to twice a month. Of course, if I get more pledges, I\u0027ll be able to afford to spend more time writing and the time interval between my updates will gradually shorten.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eMy Writing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe first chapters of all my stories posted here are free for everyone to view! Please feel free to check them out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eIMPORTANT, PLEASE NOTE\u003c/span\u003e: I mostly write taboo romances (notably, \u0027brothercest\u0027) of the gay variety. There will be a lot of them. I write them because I enjoy exploring the inner conflict within the character as they try to maneuver around their feelings, and because, let\u0027s face it, this type of relationship allows for the most drama.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0If this type of content turns you off, my works are not for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eGenre\u003c/em\u003e: My strengths lie in the development of relationships between characters; either platonic or non-platonic, but since you usually get more angst with romantic relationships, most of my writing leans towards that. I specialize in slow-burn (slow build-up) romance fiction. I may try my hand at other genres with time! (I\u0027ve been really into the fantasy/adventure types recently)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e:-:-:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTypes\u003c/em\u003e: If you\u0027ve visited the profile I linked above, you must know I love writing about taboo relationships (only between peers of the same age *e.g. brother/brother, cousin/cousin, no uncle/nephew*, and only between two guys). I also mostly write slash/gay romance fiction, focusing on the development of the relationships and characters. I do occasionally write hetero romances, but they generally focus first and foremost on the budding friendship between the two characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e:-:-:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePOV\u003c/em\u003e: I mostly write in first-person and third-person narratives, although I\u0027ve experimented here and there with second-person narrative. If you pledge enough to request a fic from me, you can choose between first- and third-, because I can\u0027t guarantee the quality of second- unless you insist and don\u0027t mind the possibility of a poorer outcome. Also, hey! My writing style differs quite significantly when I switch from first-person to second-person, so remember to take that into consideration when making your request(s)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t write sexually explicit material.

I\u0027d love to write full-time, and any pledges at all go a long way in helping me to achieve that dream. This means I get to spend more time working on my writing. Currently I\u0027m studying full-time, but graduating in half a year, and then I\u0027ll have to work full-time. My goal is to focus on writing and honing my skills, because it takes me a long time to produce something I\u0027m proud of when I get to write only snippets for a few minutes at night when I\u0027ve been busy with work/school for the whole day.\u003cbr\u003eI also need the money to move out of here for my mental health, and can\u0027t focus properly on writing when I need to work a minimum-wage job for money to slowly save up. That is actually my main reason I\u0027m on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003eI am on here for the long-term though, so I\u0027ll just be writing and writing and writing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m Friendly! :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to get to know my patrons!
