    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU, PATRONS!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I would prefer to let my writing do the talking, I want to give you more context about my motivations as a writer and what defines my aesthetic value system as an artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I am idealistic \u0026amp; romantic, yet I am brutally honest\u00a0about human nature, so ultimately I am a pragmatist that takes what can only be expected and considers anything better, moral, beautiful, or true, as a gift. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wish is to revive\u00a0American\u00a0transcendentalism as a salve to postmodern degradation of the culture of the USA. To that end the speaker in some of my works is a conflation of the jester, the prophet, the aged, and the child.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you care about my politics: my politics are driven by classical liberal ideals with a roving skepticism toward those in power and a deep love for humanity and nature. As a student of philosophy, literature, and law, I try to understand the why in everything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim in creative writing is to create captivating and beautiful if not sublime ideas and feelings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in my\u00a0nonfiction work: there I seek to bridge humanities and technology to reconcile social, economic, and environmental imperatives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page, I post some of my unorganized poems--those short outbursts of language that need no further context.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to short poems that occur to me, over my writing career I intend to carry out a few other projects. These long term projects may be posted in excerpts here. The list:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- A long form poem (40+ pages) in the form of a dramatic dialog, called The Gemini, as if Khalil Gibran\u0027s The Prophet and Nietzsche\u0027s Zarathustra has a baby and it was bipolar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- A novella written in iambic pentameter, set in the 1820s, called Carpenter\u0027s Daughter, which is a sequel to my undergraduate thesis, the novella Minister\u0027s Son.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- A sequence of Villanelles on themes of rewilding \u0026amp; yearnings of the human spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- A comedic travelog set in Appalachia over Independence Day, called Whitewater, kind of an environmentally themed Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas meets The Hangover Trilogy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- A PG13 screenplay about a rogue, coach-less high school water polo team that manages to tie every single match played in their first and only season.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
