    "summary": "First off, thank you all so much for your interest in supporting the videos I create on my youtube channels Watch Me Watch Stuff and Jessi Does Stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started as having fun posting videos of me reacting to tv shows to send to my mom, has turned into something bigger than I ever thought. Something crazy happened, people started watching them, a lot of people. I branched out and started doing reactions and recaps for several different shows. I love the opportunity to enjoy shows I adore and interact with fellow fans all over the world. I fell in love with the Youtube community and interaction so much I even started another vlog style channel to stay engaged with everyone between reaction videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had dismissed the idea of using Patreon for a long time. At first it didn\u0027t seem right to ask for money for doing something I love. But then it dawned on me, it\u0027s that the dream? Isn\u0027t creating something people enjoy so much they want to support it a good thing?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo whether you\u0027ve been following me for years or have just found my videos. If you\u0027ve enjoyed them and had a few good laughs I hope you\u0027d consider becoming a patron. Your support can help me focus more time and energy into making great videos for you all to enjoy."
