I create illustrations and poetry and love cinematography.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe poetry world is changing. We\u0027re not the print society we once were, and the poetry scene is consequently adapting, becoming visual, and moving online. I don\u0027t want to create poetry that is difficult or esoteric, I want to create art that people respond to on multiple levels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about my background - I have been writing and illustrating poems as long as I can recall and In 2013 I independently published a book of poetry called Songs of the River. I teach creative writing workshops. For my \u0027day job\u0027 I tutor, and I\u0027m finishing off a PhD in English Lit that looks at collaboration in literature, in particularly Mary and Percy Shelley. I have a great faith in the positive power of literature and the arts, and want to be a part of that - so I\u0027m committed to creating poetry that expresses truth and always aims to ameliorate.\u00a0Poetry is for pleasure, but is also part of contemporary discourse, and so I wish to add poems of worth and value.\u003cbr\u003e"
