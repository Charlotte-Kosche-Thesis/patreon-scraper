I sell some of my work in my Etsy shop here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/JennDePaolaArt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.etsy.com/shop/JennDePaolaArt\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0And I also have t-shirts up for sale at TeePublic here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/user/JennDePaolaArt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.teepublic.com/user/JennDePaolaArt\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, I\u0027d also like to be able to release some digital painting tutorials to help other artists out who have the same passion and thirst for knowledge, and perfecting their skills, as I do. \u00a0I feel that that is what links us all together... our love for art, whether we\u0027re creating it, studying it, admiring it, or whatever. \u00a0We are all creatives, and we gotta stick together and help one another out. :)\u003cbr\u003e",
