Along the way, I like to capture certain moments and bring new ideas surrounding the music to life. I do this for myself and for others. I love seeing a dream or idea come to life. This stuff costs money. I don\u0027t expect to be paid for it, but given that it is my living, I shouldn\u0027t deny the folks that want to donate the chance to do so. If you like what you see and hear and want to contribute, I\u0027m honored. And it will only fuel my fire and make me want to do more. Thank you for being an appreciator of the arts!\u00a0"

With this album, Jeff fulfilled his promise to stay true to the songwriting style that P\u0026amp;B fans have come to know but also to test some boundaries with production, approach and style. \"Stop and Go\" also boasts guest performances from several of the Bay area\u0027s finest musicians, including Megan Slankard, Brad Brooks, Austin Willacy and James DePrato, who not only offered their performance talents, but also lent their hands with songwriting, arrangements and production. A live audio/video reproduction of the album was recorded and released later in 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJeff has been touring the US to support these new releases since the fall of 2011 and will continue to do so throughout 2012 and beyond and will not stop until his piece of history is defined. He has played hundreds of shows in dozens of cities and continues to build a loyal following through live performances with personality everywhere he goes.\u003c/p\u003e- See more at: http://jeffcampbellmusic.com/bio#sthash.zSe0XKpX.dpuf\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
