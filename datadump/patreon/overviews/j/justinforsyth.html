    "summary": "Who am I...well, my name is Justin, but JF works just fine - nice to meet you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore we continue I\u0027d like to say thank you. To you, for stopping in a reading this, and to all of my fans, friends, supporters and listeners around the world for being a part of my life and a part of my journey. You\u0027re incredible, and even if this is the first time you\u0027ve ever met me, THANK YOU. None of what I have done or will do would be possible without you...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a man of many hats, but musician has always been my favourite one to wear. After spending just over a decade in Canada as the frontman in some moderately successful rock bands searching for that all-important record deal, I finally decided that it just wasn\u0027t worth it anymore. I found myself getting jaded and frustrated with the music industry and all of it\u0027s bullshit, and becoming exhausted at the never-ending barrage of hoops to jump through. At the end of it all, it became obvious that the music industry wasn\u0027t about music at all...and hadn\u0027t been for a long time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlas, my band parted ways, and I shipped myself off to Australia to start a new life in a new world. Inevitably, I missed the band days, and missed that feeling of creating new music - so now, after a few years\u0027 hiatus, I decided to get back to it, but this time it would be on my terms...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruthfully, a part of me has always despised the ridiculous levels of production and polish that became a requirement to make \"good\" music. I hated that everything had to be perfect - perfect sound, perfect hook, perfect pitch, perfect time - a song had to be condensed to less than 4 minutes, and the chorus had to hit within 45 seconds...where did the human aspect disappear to? This question became my goal, and creating music that broke all of these rules became the answer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I began creating...and haven\u0027t stopped. No studio. No high-end production. No producer. Nothing but me, a few instruments, and the basic equipment needed to record. That\u0027s it. The sounds are raw and real, and aren\u0027t designed to be \"radio friendly\". I don\u0027t care about making a \"hit\". I don\u0027t give a shit about any of that. I just want to make music that speaks to me, and hopefully speaks to you too. I\u0027ll be the first to admit that I am by no means a fantastic \"musician\" - but I make music, and for the first time in a long time, it feels right.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to thank you for taking the time to read this, and for popping by. Hopefully you stick around and follow me through this fantastic journey!\u003cbr\u003e"
