    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u003c/strong\u003e My name is JY Yang and I write science fiction and fantasy. I\u0027m the author of the Tensorate series of novellas with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://publishing.tor.com/author/jyyang/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTor.com Publishing\u003c/a\u003e, THE BLACK TIDES OF HEAVEN and THE RED THREADS OF FORTUNE, with two more on the way!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy short fiction veers between body horror and thinly-veiled smut; I famously once sold a short story about tentacle sex (and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://lackingtons.com/2016/01/20/song-of-the-krakenmaid-by-jy-yang/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egot it ILLUSTRATED\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cstrong\u003e**\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003e A while ago, I mooted the idea of a Patreon for all the explicitly smutty scenes that\u0027ll never make it into the novel I\u0027m writing because I want it to be vaguely kid-friendly. People \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eloved\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0the idea, so here I am!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Rewards\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027m offering two different things on this Patreon: a monthly piece of smutty writing, and a monthly bit of art.\u00a0\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch4\u003e$3: The Monthly Smut\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027It\u0027s literature! ...Smutty literature!\u0027 \u003c/strong\u003eOnce a month I\u0027ll post a short piece of fiction that will take various forms depending on what inspiration strikes me. Could be a standalone short story, could be a pure PWP vignette of Tab A/Slot B, could be all the sex I imagine the characters in my WIPs having, which I won\u0027t put into the book because it doesn\u0027t advance the plot... but I want to write anyway because I\u0027m thirsty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know my work, you know that I write stories that are queer af, and often mess around with gender. You\u0027ll also know that I like angst, and being terrible to my characters. The work here will be the same. This is not the place to find meet-cutes and sexy fluff. There might be some hurt/comfort. Proooobably more \u003cem\u003ehurt\u003c/em\u003e than \u003cem\u003ecomfort\u003c/em\u003e. Immerse yourself in a world of fucky gods, sex robots, and the clever use of cunnilingus to charge your superpowers.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd oh yes-- by WIPs I include the novel I\u0027m working on, so if you want a sneaky taste of what I\u0027ve got simmering in the kitchen, this is the place to be. Man, even my \u003cem\u003eagent\u003c/em\u003e won\u0027t have seen this stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5: A Spot of Art\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eON TOP of the smutty literature, you can also get art from me!\u003c/strong\u003e One of my goals in 2018 is to improve on my art skills. Drawing is a hobby of mine, and I want to get better at it! I\u0027ve set aside time every week to work on this goal, and I\u0027m happy to share a high-res scan of my favorite piece every month. (Fair warning: it\u0027s probably going to be fanart!) I work with traditional media (bc I\u0027m too broke to afford a drawing tablet); right now I\u0027m learning to watercolor, and I plan to pick up gouache or acrylics sometime this year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see a couple of examples of my work in the header up top, but it\u0027s also likely to include lineart and designs like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jyyang.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/screamingrexsmall.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eASIDE FROM THE OCCASIONAL OUTBREAK OF THE SWEARS, the art will be delightfully PG-13.

For you, I have nothing but my deepest gratitude! I\u0027ll send you a monthly roundup of my writing progress, and also pictures of my dog when she isn\u0027t actively running away from the camera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePosts and rewards go live the first weekend of every month!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Stretch Goal\u003c/h3\u003eAt $750, I will serialize\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Nameless Blade\u003c/em\u003e, the erotica project of my heart. Conceived in 2016 as series of novella-length instalments, it\u0027s high fantasy centered on the Nameless Blade--an elite warrior with no name for the gods to control--and the forbidden relationship she conducts with the witch-princess of the nation they\u0027re at war with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in 2016 I picked out a erotica-writing pseudonym should I ever bring the project to fruition. I even made them a Twitter account! But time and the need to pay my bills got in the way. Now, we can make this a reality. \u003cstrong\u003eWhen we hit $750, I will release a chapter of the serial every month, and it will be available to Patrons at every tier level. \u003c/strong\u003eYes all of them!! So if you want to read some smut of mine, but can\u0027t afford $3 a month, here\u0027s the solution: get 750 of your friends to pledge a dollar, and we\u0027re all set!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen this happens, people at the $3 and $5 levels will also get to choose, via request + poll, what they want in next month\u0027s smut short.
