I am committed to making art that enriches every day life and everyday life comes with a few bills that need to be paid. I\u0027ll be honest, what I\u0027m laying out here is what I would do for free because creating is like breathing for me. This Patreon is an invitation to a community of creatives who think that art is for everybody. This Patreon is an opportunity, to get a behind the scenes look look at the creation process and learn the tools and tricks that go into the process. This Patreon is a statement, that you believe creatives deserve to make a living off of their life\u0027s work, that the starving artist cliche has long outlived its usefulness. It\u0027s an affirmation that you love the characters and sketches that flow from my pen (and pencils and digital pens and watercolors and and ...), and you want the world to have more of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what you will get by supporting this Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.joshings.com/PatreonImages/Pinups.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make pinups and illustrations where \u003cstrong\u003ethe\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003esubject is never just an object\u003c/strong\u003e, characters and creatures that you want to get to know wrapped in the aesthetic candy of the pinup form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least once a week you\u0027ll get early access to a pinup illustration, either digital or analog. All patrons will be invited contribute ideas during a monthly chat session. Each will come with a making of video, preliminary sketches and a digital download package of wallpapers and social media badges. Higher reward tiers will open access to discounted/free prints and early opportunities to purchase originals at a discounted rate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.joshings.com/PatreonImages/LiveShows.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy other main body of work is reportage art. I document the coolest underground and independent concerts and performances in the Bay Area and around the world (travel permitting) and bring back drawings and experiences to share with you. \u003cstrong\u003eIndie circuses, breakout bands, and postmodern variety shows will all be captured on paper\u003c/strong\u003e live on site.\u00a0 Patrons will get early access to all art, a written review of the shows, BTS process videos when available and digital downloads of\u00a0 wallpapers and social media badges.
