    "summary": "My name is Jean, and I write fiction. Currently, I\u0027m a full-time freelance web content writer/editor/e-book formatter who writes fiction on the side. What I WANT to be is a fiction writer who occasionally does freelance stuff on the side. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Write\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI mainly write novels that would fall best under the genres of paranormal romance, urban fantasy, and dark/dystopian fantasy. I also write short fiction that ranges from outright horror to romantic steampunk fairytales. Ideas currently percolating in my brain include Lovecraftian-inspired horror, a Jazz-age spiritualist mystery, contemporary romantic comedy and a Weird Western.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been compared to authors as diverse as Richard Bachman and Jennifer Crusie. My influences include Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, Pamela Ribon, Lani Diane Rich and Joss Whedon.

Late last year, this book was picked up by Vinspire Publishing, who will be releasing a shiny new edition in October of this year. Vinspire also contracted me to write two more books in this series, the first of which will be released in 2017. I\u0027m HOPING that eventually sales of that series will be enough to boost my other books and to support my fiction writing, but it\u0027s going to be at least another year or two before that happens (traditional publishing moves at a snail\u0027s pace, in case you\u0027re not aware).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tCurrently, I manage to carve out about 30 minutes to an hour each day to write the books I\u0027m under contract to write--which amounts to about 600-800 words per day, on average. The rest of my work day is devoted to freelance duties. I also run two blogs--\u003ca href=\"http://jeanmariebauhaus.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy author blog\u003c/a\u003e, where I would very much like to write about pop culture and offer writing and publishing advice, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jmbauhaus.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDaydream Believer\u003c/a\u003e, an inspirational faith blog where I currently manage to post about two or three encouraging devotionals per month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWith your support, I can cut down on my freelance hours and increase my writing time--which means I\u0027d be able to finish \n\t\u003cem\u003eGhost of a Chance--\u003c/em\u003ethe first sequel to \u003cem\u003eRestless Spirits--\u003c/em\u003ein half the time it\u0027s currently taking me. This would in turn mean that I would be able to fit in another planned sequel--the next book in my self-published post-apocalyptic vampire/zombie epic series, \u003cem\u003eDominion of the Damned--\u003c/em\u003ebefore I have to write the second \u003cem\u003eRS\u003c/em\u003e sequel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf my support goals are met, I\u0027d also be able to make time for the occasional short story, to write the kind of content I want to write for my author blog but never have time to, and to post more regularly to my devotional blog. I also hope to be able to make time to create some online classes--I have a strong desire to teach what I know, but never enough time to do it effectively--and your support would also empower me to follow up on other creative ideas as they come.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\tFor as little as a buck a month, you\u0027ll get an exclusive first look at every piece of fiction I write.

You\u0027ll get access to everything described above for as little as $1 per month. Higher levels of support starting at $5 per month will get extra perks (see below). Whatever level of patronage you choose will be appreciated, and will likely make me do a little dance of joy.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
