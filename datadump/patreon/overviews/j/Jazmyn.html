I used to be passionate in every avenue of my life. \u00a0I try to live with purpose, but I cannot find purpose in pushing digital paper and wasting life away on busy work for companies that don\u0027t want to invest in me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my personal goal to be genuine and honest, happy to create, explore, and be challenged by new tools and concepts, always sharpen my skills. I have started this patron to get that person back in full force.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith you support I can create the things dreams are made of, and I will be able to dedicate more of my time to making new and beautiful things! Instead of wasting away in a back office can think out of the cubicle again and show people the beauty I dream to be a reality."
