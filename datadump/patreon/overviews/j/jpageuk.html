I didn\u0027t really know where to begin, but it felt like I had all the time in the world to figure it out! I\u0027d only just left college and although I\u0027d signed up for university, I wasn\u0027t really sure if it was for me. Music was all I could think about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout three months into my musical journey, I heard about an online music platform called MySpace. A few of my friends had been using it to listen to their new favourite bands. Bands that were unsigned, and apparently accumulating quite big followings. I started to wonder if there was an audience for my music. I\u0027d not really shown anybody any of my songs and thought this would be a great way to get some feedback! I recorded and uploaded four original songs expecting very little to happen, but\u00a0within a matter of months my fanbase went from 0 up to around 10,000. It might not sound a lot in the current climate, but considering social media was quite new and it was the first time I\u0027d showcased my songs, this was massive to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings went from strength to strength during my first two years. I started a YouTube channel where my videos were hitting over 30,000 views, and I was being awarded digital rosettes stating I was the \u0027#1 Most Viewed UK Musician\u0027 and the likes. Radio shows were getting in touch to ask if they could play my music and if I could pop in to perform and be interviewed live. I was even approached with a record deal! I couldn\u0027t believe it!\u00a0The problem was, I\u0027d never performed live and when it finally came to it\u00a0I was a nervous wreck. I might have been comfortable singing in my own home, but I wasn\u0027t ready to perform in front of a crowd of people. As a result, I fell into my \u0027little box\u0027, completed university and walked straight into a teaching job. I deleted all my online content and just gave up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of years after all of the above, a friend invited me to go to a buskers night. I don\u0027t know why I said yes, but I did. My intention wasn\u0027t to perform, but peer pressure often has its way! I got up on stage and didn\u0027t feel the fear I had when trying to gig previously. Maybe it was the years of teaching experience. Maybe I\u0027d just grown. Either way, the one thing that stopped me doing what I loved wasn\u0027t stopping me anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLate on in 2016, I decided to leave my job as a teacher and make 2017 the year I started creating music again! Patreon is going to play a big part in making that happen! If there is anything I\u0027ve learned from previous experience, it\u0027s that nothing is achievable without support. The point I\u0027m trying to make is that without your help, this little adventure will more than likely amount to nothing more than ordinary. That\u0027s why I\u0027m asking you to support me financially by becoming a patron. It\u0027s easy to do! Just choose a tier and follow the steps to get the ball rolling. Each tier comes with its own great rewards, from access to my patron only stream, early access, exclusive content, live streams, video calls and having your say on content creation, so make sure you check them out! If you can\u0027t become a patron, don\u0027t worry! You can still be a huge help by\u00a0liking/subscribing to/following my social sites, listening to and sharing my music and checking out my latest video content! Your support is appreciated in ways only imaginable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eTHE PLAN\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy goal is to jump right back into writing, recording and releasing original songs, making videos and creating cool merchandise. Any funding I receive will go towards achieving these goals. The more funding I receive, the better and more frequent the content and rewards will be. I\u0027m currently aiming to create two pieces of content per month, which will be released publicly, and one piece of exclusive, patron only, content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
