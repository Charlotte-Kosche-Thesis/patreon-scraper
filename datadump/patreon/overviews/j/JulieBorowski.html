    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Julie. I make YouTube videos about politics, culture, and anything current event related.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be honest. I feel awkward about this. I\u0027ve put it off for a while. But I know it could be a good way to help me grow my channel and reach more people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal with my channel is to spread the message of liberty. I try to do that in an entertaining way. (Key word: try...) YouTube is liberal dominated and it\u0027s what young people watch. I found out about libertarianism online when I was a teenager and I\u0027d love to be able to expose more people to it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are other organizations that have the same goals as me. They have at least a dozen members of staff, rich donors, and multi-million dollar budgets. I have nothing like that. I\u0027m a one woman team. I write, research, film, edit, upload, and respond... everything I do is me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a freelancer right now and seeing if it\u0027s going to work. Maybe it is... \u00a0maybe it isn\u0027t. I thought I\u0027d give it a shot.\u00a0Anything that you can give would help me out. Making videos isn\u0027t cheap. I would like a better camera, better lighting, a new laptop for editing, etc. It gets expensive. I also have to pay money to keep my website up and send out my email newsletter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to be solely focused on making YouTube videos and writing/speaking about liberty. Of course, I like to eat. Eating is good. I don\u0027t want to stop doing that. Helping me out on Patreon would ensure that I can continue doing what I do and stop looking for side projects to pay the bills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could probably make more money with ads. The ads that make the most money are super annoying. Those pop up ads. I know that you guys don\u0027t like that kind of stuff and I\u0027d prefer not to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is only if you\u0027re willing and able to give. There\u0027s no coercion here! If you can\u0027t, I understand. Thank you for watching my videos! I want to make sure that my videos are always 100% free for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those who can help me out, I want to offer you some \"rewards\" in exchange. Basically, everything is designed to improve communication between us--and each other. I think it would be really cool if we became a community or something cheesy like that.\u00a0I know some of you may not agree with me about everything. That\u0027s OK. It would be boring, otherwise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, again!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
