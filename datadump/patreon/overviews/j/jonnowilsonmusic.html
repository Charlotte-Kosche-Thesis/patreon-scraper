    "summary": "Hey there! I would like to play for you... a bunch of songs. Most have words. Some are serious. Some are not. The styles/genres are varied (I have a short attention span kind of like the dog from Up). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few covers, but mainly of songs that I really love, and that I think I can do justice to (some songs are so perfect that although I would love to cover them, I don\u0027t think I can do better than the original..but I digress).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write all my own material (apart from the covers of course, and occasional collaborations), I play all the instruments, I mix everything, edit the videos, and share it with YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have over 30 finished songs just waiting to go, plus probably over 100 sketches that can (SHOULD!) be sculpted into diamonds. And I usually find that whenever I pick up an instrument new ideas are coming out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be recording my songs and creating videos (Videosong style, inspired by Jack Conte and Pomplamoose). YouTube is such a great medium for getting material out there, but you need something to watch (I know I don\u0027t watch many lyric videos!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be creating Videosongs (where you see everything you hear). These are easier to create on my own than a high concept music video, and you get to see the different parts, how it all fits together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am 33 years old, married with two children. I work part time as a teacher, and I am asking for your support to enable to take my music from a part time hobby to a full time endeavour. If you like what I do, please consider getting involved as my patron!"
