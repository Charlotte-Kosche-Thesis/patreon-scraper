    "summary": "I have been working as a musician for the past 19 years, I played in several bands over the years, toured all around Europe, played thousands of shows in bars, clubs and festivals. But I was always part of an entity, rather than doing what was truly in my heart. Even though in many ways I was living a dream, there was a void in me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn late 2013 I decided to finally do something about this situation. I set up my own website with a blog and set out to write, record and release 52 songs in 52 weeks. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect things to grow the way it did. By the end of 2014 I looked back on the year I had, where I released not only my first solo album, but altogether four albums and an EP. A journey I had started very much on my own, had grown into something amazing! I was blogging daily, people were exited about every new song, every new blog post. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point I knew the year had been too much fun to just leave it at that. I decided to continue the journey. And the further I went the more my journey became part of everything I do. And as I had an interest in video for a long time, and had some TV experience in my past, I set out to share my journey in a form of a daily vlog. These vlogs are my life, which I am openly sharing with you guys. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment all of this is taking most of my time, but it still is a side project. I am hoping that together we can change this into my full time project. I hope to keep writing, recording and releasing a song every week. I hope to keep making my vlogs better. I hope to get to play some shows home and a broad, but do it all in my own terms. I want the shows to be about music, not selling beer. I hope to travel abroad and record my weekly songs with some local musicians where ever I travel. I hope to be inspired by my surroundings where ever I go. And most of all I want to inspire you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo pledge as much or as little as you can. By doing so you are not only supporting me, but also allowing me to share this stuff with the world and hopefully make it just that little bit better place :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJ.P.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Ok, I\u0027ll try to be as hones and transparent here as I can. At the time of writing this I have been releasing a song a week on my blog, and blogging actively for one year and nine months. It has been a learning curve, trying to figure out what works and what does not. But by now I have learned how to optimise my lean song recording/releasing process. I am no where near breaking even here yet. Between all the costs involved, I figured out that $375 is the bare minimum I need every month to keep things going. Don;t get me wrong, I have paid it out of my own pocket so far, and I won\u0027t stop doing so. But it would take a lot of pressure of me if we would reach this goal. Honestly, there has been few weeks where I was releasing songs at the risk of having to pay my rent late... And I do like having a roof over my head :-D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0Oh yeah and as I am on the honest streak, you might be wondering \"what about the album and song sales?\" Here\u0027s the thing, due to a lot of the streaming services most people don\u0027t buy music anymore. That is part of the reason why I joined Patreon. I actually boosted my income from the songs a bit after starting to release them on Bandcamp with the option of people naming their own price :-) But at the very bets, I made about 10% of what I spent. So yeah, this is kind of important goal in the long run for me to be able to keep going.",

     "description": "Ok, I have a dream :-) I would like to make a full tour documentary. Where I would let cameras a full access to the good, the bad and the ugly. The pre tour rehearsals, the traveling, the trains, plains, ferries, cars, vans, busses, all of it. I often watched tour documentaries, and kind of wished they would be bit more... So this would be my take on it. You know I am pretty open about my stuff, but this would be all access. I know it\u0027s a lot of money, and it would take us a long time to make, but I promise it would be something pretty amazing! Think of it as a kind of cinematic version of my humble vlogs.",
