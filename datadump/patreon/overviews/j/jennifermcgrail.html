    "summary": "Hey!\u00a0 You found me on\nPatreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m Jen, and I write stuff.\u00a0 Since \u201cstuff\u201d is a little vague:\u00a0 I write a lot of fiction (more on that later), I\u2019ve done some freelance\nwork for printed publications, I write regular book reviews, I\u2019ve dabbled in\npoetry.\u00a0 But my main focus for the past 12 years has been my blog, \u003ca href=\"http://www.jennifermcgrail.com\"\u003eThe Path Less Taken\u003c/a\u003e, and its accompanying \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thepathlesstakenblog/\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e. That\u2019s likely how you got here, and if so: \u003cstrong\u003eThank you.\u00a0 And you\u2019re awesome\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Path Less Taken started out as a sort of online journal\nof my unschooling days with my kids who, at the time, were still quite\nsmall.\u00a0 It gradually and organically grew\ninto what it is today\u2026 a space where I mostly write in a more general way about\nunschooling and gentle, respectful parenting. I am passionate about spreading the word about living more peacefully with your children.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile those topics are still the heart and soul of my blog, I\u2019ve\nbranched out even more and also write about random slice of life stuff, issues of faith (I\u2019m one of those\nweirdo liberal Christians who believes that Christianity should be about\nloving people rather than judging them), current events, having bipolar, and\nmental health in general.\u00a0 All of the\nabove breaks just about every rule of the \u201cYou need to stick to a very specific\nNICHE!\u201d people, but I\u2019ve never been much of a rule follower. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo why am I on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live to write.\u00a0 To me, writing is like breathing.\u00a0 But it also requires a lot of time, a lot of mental energy,\nand a lot of coffee.\u00a0 And being\ncompensated financially for any sort of freelance writing (especially blogging)\nis\u2026. tricky.\u00a0 Like a lot of bloggers, I\u2019ve\nmade a few dollars here and there with things like ads and affiliate\nsales.\u00a0 I\u2019ve also made some money writing\narticles for offline publications. To be honest, I very much prefer\nblogging. Why?\u00a0 It\u2019s more personal. Blogging is as much about the community as it\nis about the writing. I love the comments, the messages you send me, the conversations on Facebook. Blogging is about YOU just as\nmuch as it is about me.\u00a0 It\u2019s also some\nof the most intimate writing I\u2019ve ever done, and I don\u2019t see myself ever\nstopping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a time, I had a\nvirtual \u201ctip jar\u201d installed on my page. I figured\nit was a low pressure way for people to voluntarily help out, and was way more personal - and relevant - than the couple of cents I\u2019d\nget for someone clicking on a Google ad.\u00a0 Several people generously donated (THANK YOU!!), but it didn\u2019t take\nlong for me to realize that that system was limited and uncomfortably one-sided.\u00a0 While it gave you a chance to say, \u201cHey, I\nlike your work. Thank you\u201d, it didn\u2019t\nprovide me with any way to thank YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s where Patreon comes in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Patreon platform lets you get directly involved in what I\u0027m making.\u00a0 It makes it easy for anyone who wants to\nfinancially back my work to do so (you can pledge a recurring monthly donation of $1 a month, $3, $5, whatever\nfits your budget and your comfort level), AND it gives me a way to give back to\nyou too!!\u00a0 When you become a Patron, you\nbecome an even more active participant in my writing process.\u00a0 You\u0027ll be invited to join a secret Facebook group just for Patrons.\u00a0 You\u2019ll also be able to access Patron-only content\nsuch as written posts and videos, and behind-the-scene looks at what I\u0027m working on next.\u00a0 You can communicate with other Patrons; and you\ncan message me and let me know about any unschooling or parenting-related topics you\u2019d like me to write about on the blog.\u00a0 And remember when I said I liked to write fiction?\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m starting a new novel, and would\nlove to share it with all you!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd finally, you have my deepest and sincerest\ngratitude. \u003cstrong\u003eAll of you\u003c/strong\u003e. Whether you become a Patron or whether you\ncontinue to read my posts as before.\u00a0 I\nso, so appreciate you for reading what I write, for sharing my posts, for your \u201clikes\u201d\nand comments and shares.\u00a0 You rock and\nyou\u2019re awesome and I love you.\u00a0 Your support means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e"
