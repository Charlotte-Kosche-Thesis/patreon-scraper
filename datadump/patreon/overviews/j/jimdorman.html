    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://wp.jimdorman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MIR_1720-1.jpg\"\u003eHi there!  My name\u0027s Jim Dorman and I create things.  I\u0027ll bet you want to know what I do and why you should give me some of your hard-earned money.  So let\u0027s do that!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u0027m a musician, writer, teacher, motivational speaker, and tour guide on a submarine (yes, really).  I have an EP and a CD out now, and am working on a new full-length album as well as some collaborative music projects with other players.  I have one children\u0027s book in the draft stages and ideas for at least two more.  I teach music, juggling, and stagecraft to anyone who wants to learn.  I run a program called \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.bandmakers.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBandmakers\u003c/a\u003e that helps musicians learn what it\u0027s like to play in a band.  I talk with audiences about disability (I am blind), and draw upon my own experiences to motivate people to reach their full potential, no matter what others try to tell them they can\u0027t do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI play acoustic \u0026amp; electric guitars, electric bass, harp guitar, and Japanese koto, which you can hear on \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.jimdorman.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy music website\u003c/a\u003e.  I have a Native American flute that I\u0027m trying to make friends with, and am interested in learning to play piano/keyboard.  I\u0027d also like to try my hand at mandolin or mandocello, as well as a lot of exotic instruments from around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy You Should Give Me Some Of Your Hard-Earned Money\u003c/h3\u003e\nBecause I\u0027m going to use your money to create things that will enrich our collective existence on this planet.  I want to work for you--the creation of anything is inspired by the artist\u0027s own desire to make something, but I feel that the real motivation to make something fantastic comes from the feeling you get when you give something you\u0027ve made to someone else, because you want the thing you give to be the best it can possibly be.\nSome of the things I hope to create with your money include...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMusic, both solo and ensemble\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eStories for all ages\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eClasses and other ways to help folks embrace and explore their own creativity\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eEntertainment that will make you laugh or cry or think\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePrograms to help raise awareness about disability and eliminate fear\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nI will be talking about my ideas for each of these things and more in my patron-only posts, and encouraging everyone to add their own ideas to the mix.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy I\u0027m Doing This\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI have been working in the performing arts for over 35 years.  I love it.  In all the jobs I\u0027ve had, none make me as happy as creating art, either by myself or with others.  I find the entire process exciting--from coming up with a new idea to seeing it through to completion and then presenting it to an audience.  The tools now exist for a large number of artists to be supported by more than a billion people worldwide, and I want to be one of those artists.  In short, I want a dream job: doing something I love and getting paid for it.  This Patreon campaign is all about making that dream come true.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003eNot Why I\u0027m Doing This\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI am not migrating to Patreon because YouTube doesn\u0027t pay me enough for my videos.  I am not interested in the word \u0027monetize\u0027 and I don\u0027t want my audience to be anonymous.  One reason that I have not made very many videos is because YouTube is faceless and soulless, and what kind of environment is that for people to create?  Art requires both a creator and a consumer, and posting videos into the either eliminates the connection between the two.  I\u0027ve surveyed a number of options to fund my work, and I feel that Patreon will allow me to acquire that funding \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eand\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e communicate effectively with those who show an interest in what I do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are you going to do with our money?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour money will help do a lot of things, including, but not limited to...\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eVideo editing and other services that I don\u0027t have the eyesight or expertise to do myself\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePurchase \u0026amp; maintenance of instruments and other equipment\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCompensation for others who will assist me such as cast members for more involved videos or recordings\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eStudio time\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTravel to locations, seminars, and artist residencies which provide unique environments for on-the-spot content as well as inspiration and new ideas\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDevelopment of merchandise and other tangible goods (that patrons will get in on first!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nMost of all, your pledge will give me the freedom to work on projects without worrying about money all the time.  Nearly all of us have had to deal with tight budgets at some point, and the stress, lack of sleep, and overall worry takes all your energy and leaves very little for anything else.  The idea of giving artists the freedom to do what they do is what patronage is all about--an idea that has existed for centuries and still works today, even better thanks to the power of the internet, where crowdfunding is possible.  Everyone wins!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHow often will we see new content?\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI can\u0027t say for sure, because I don\u0027t know for sure.  A lot depends on how much I get in pledges, because that influences how much time I have to work on projects.  If I am able to do this full-time, you can expect something a few times a week.  That could be posts, progress updates, or finished work.  Obviously some projects are going to take longer than others, but I feel it\u0027s important to let my patrons know what I\u0027m doing and that I am working for them.  This is a win-win situation, because it\u0027s easy for artists to get involved in their own work to the point where they isolate themselves too much.  We all need time to create, but communicating with an audience is a big inspiration and it helps keep me excited about my work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHow much can I pledge?

When you reach a new reward tier, you will get those rewards at any amount above it until you reach the next tier.  Patreon allows you to select and change how much you pledge at any time.  If you would like to pledge more than the maximum tier amount of $100 per month, go right ahead!  I\u0027ll be happy to create a custom reward just for you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHow long is my commitment?\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs long as you want it to be.
