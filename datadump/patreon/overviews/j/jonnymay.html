    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHey!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Jonny May, and thank for coming to my Patreon page! I\u0027d like to tell you a little bit about myself and why I\u0027m here on Patron. \u00a0I come from a huge family of musicians. I\u0027m one 8 kids, we all play an instrument. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4438/36702993870_c51367ba2a_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy father was a jazz bassist, and one of my favorite memories as a kid was listening to my dad play live jazz.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4392/36264205534_1568d53133_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI fell in love with music at an early age, and decided to dedicate my life to sharing it with the world. At age 18, I was hired as the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PawbRW0-Emc\"\u003eyoungest pianist to work for Disneyland\u003c/a\u003e, where I played ragtime piano, and ever since then I\u0027ve made a living performing music everywhere from Universal Studios and Comedy Central to the Kennedy Center.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4352/36910857416_dde3c0deb8_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA few years ago, I started posting my performances on YouTube, and something really magical happened. People started sharing my videos, and I quickly gained a following of dedicated listeners. Now, I have over 150k YouTube subscribers and my videos have been viewed over 25 million times!! This is awesome, but what\u0027s even more awesome is getting to hear people\u0027s stories of how my music has impacted them. So a few years ago, I did something pretty gutsy - I left much of my work as a professional musician to focus on creating and sharing my music online. And as a result, some pretty amazing things have happened. Lucid Pianos, who makes the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfkK-tCtXlo\"\u003eBl\u00fcthner Crystal Grand Pianos\u003c/a\u003e, has partnered with me by providing a piano for me to record future videos on, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.musicnotes.com/sheet-music/artist/jonny-may\"\u003eMusicNotes.com\u003c/a\u003e has asked me to be one of their signature artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is all exciting and amazing, and now that I have a Patreon page, YOU can be a part of what I am doing on a very personal level!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform where fans can support creators - it\u0027s like a tipping service. Each time I release a new music video, you have the opportunity to tip me, and that\u0027s your way of saying, \"Hey Jonny, I like your music - keep making more of it!\" For as little as $1 per video, you can become my patron, and for each level of giving, you get rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become my patron, you get to go behind-the-scenes with me and see my creative process. You get to watch exclusive patron-only online concerts, where I\u0027ll play your song requests live. You get early access to my latest videos before anyone else sees them, free albums, and MP3s. We do monthly Google hangouts where we\u0027 get to know each other and you can ask me anything, and as a patron, you can get personalized piano videos from me on your special occasion, like your birthday. As a patron, you can pick the next song I cover, and you can even have me travel to your home and give a private house concert. So many awesome things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd you have complete control over how much you give - in fact, you can set a monthly maximum, so if I happen to release more videos in a given month you will not be charged more than you\u0027re comfortable with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you love the music I create, you can personally help me by becoming my patron. Any amount of support - even $1 a video - helps me to continue creating and sharing this music that I love. And even if I don\u0027t receive any support on Patreon, I will continue creating piano music in whatever way I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering being part of my team, and helping me reach more of the world with my music, and I look forward to the exciting music to come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4352/36928897262_51460cbedf_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShenanigans at the Coke Corner piano...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4332/36702993320_e9f50f280f_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStudying with the legendary Disneyland Ragtime Pianist, Johnny Hodges (I\u0027ve lost quite a bit of weight since then!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4354/36910857496_f8a7efd8ea_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my favorite pictures in the world... this is me at age 15 playing the Coke Corner ragtime piano with my teacher, Johnny Hodges, in the background. \u00a0Little did I know that three years later, I would become the Disneyland Ragtime Pianist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"640\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4378/36286368733_7491568088_z.jpg\" width=\"445\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaha... little Jonny looking cool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4377/36702993780_f6f3216a5f_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBig Jonny trying to be cool... \ud83d\ude02\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4376/36702993610_7b7084c87c_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe and my nephew...

I\u0027m sure you can imagine how loud our home was with 8 kids playing piano, drums, guitar, and singing. \u00a0But I loved it... At age 18, I was hired as the youngest pianist to play at Disneyland, and I played ragtime piano for 9 nears. \u00a0In 2014, I took a leap of faith and left Disneyland to focus on my own music, and I started a YouTube channel. \u00a0Since then, my channel has earned over 18 million views and I have 112k YouTube subscribers... it\u0027s awesome!!! \u00a0Now, I spend most of my time creating new arrangements and recording amazing music videos that I share on YouTube. \u00a0I also create piano video tutorials for PianoWithJonny.com, where we have an awesome community of students. \u00a0 I\u0027m married to my lovely wife Crystal, and for fun I love to go snowboarding, read, volunteer at my church, and create new piano pieces. \u00a0I look forward to getting to know YOU better :)",
