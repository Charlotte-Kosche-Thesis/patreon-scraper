The only thing I had back then was a true passion for content creation, and my motivation which never changed : Trying to share Knowledge, Emotion, and Entertainment through video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep by step, day after day, month after month, I\u2019ve never stopped working on new projects, new ideas, I have always been inspired to create, to explore, to do what I love. Over time, I saw my audience on YouTube growing, and I started to receive messages from viewers, subscribers, hobbyists, YouTube channels, and friends, who all gave me amazing support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the best things in my life is to know that my content is enjoyed by so many people, and to realize that I am able to share a little of myself with all of you through it. Back then, I would never have imagined that I could truly reach the number of Subscribers I have now, it\u2019s amazing and crazy for me.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m always working hard on my next projects and I\u2019m really proud of them. Good things are coming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote this with a lot of love and with a very special goal in mind : Saying Thank you to all of you for supporting me. You are giving me the motivation to keep going and to never stop what I love. You are the best. Thank You!\u003cbr\u003e"
