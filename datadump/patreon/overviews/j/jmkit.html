You can think of it as a virtual toy set, with the potential of more and more additions and updates as the game progresses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jmkit01.worldsecuresystems.com/images/patreon/WhatIs.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy New PlaySets?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe current JMKit PlaySets Game is on my website (Play\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jmkit.com/play-sets.html\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e) and have proved to be very popular, with fans posting their stories in the comments area below and creating videos of their stories for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?sp=CAFQFA%253D%253D\u0026amp;q=jmkit\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e - However that game was made with Adobe Animate (previously Adobe Flash) and it\u2019s looking likely that Flash in browsers will become obsolete by 2020 meaning games entirely relying on this technology will not be playable anymore! - There are also positives to moving to HTML5 such as being able to play the game on mobile devices like phones and tablets!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jmkit01.worldsecuresystems.com/images/patreon/NewPreview.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will Be Ne\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ew?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRebuilding the game from scratch will enable me to introduce whole new ideas and features, as well as expanding on ideas that have already been successful, and all these can be built on in future updates, so the game will continue to grow. Ideas already in mind include the ability for characters to pick up items (like the popular \u2018props\u2019 feature) and interact with world objects (such as getting into beds / sitting on chairs and even riding vehicles) These are just a few ideas and as a member you\u2019ll be able to vote on features as well as demoing them as they are being made!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy JMKit Is On Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have always valued the support and patience of the fans at \u003ca href=\"http://JMKit.com\"\u003eJMKit.com\u003c/a\u003e, and if this is you - THANK YOU! However so far the only way your support was coming back to me financially was via adverts, banners and video pre-rolls that a lot of the time people either find irritating or intrusive, this can lead to ad-blocks being used and me getting less financial support and fans having to feel guilty they can\u2019t support me any other way, well here\u2019s a way they can, and get even more back for their valued support in the form of exclusive rewards and the knowledge you\u2019ll be a key part of this new exciting project!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
