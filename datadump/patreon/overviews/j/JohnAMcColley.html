    "summary": "Greetings, Earth creature. We have now concluded our broadcast serialization of Breaking The Word. Thanks to all who rode along with us. It was a bumpy ride in some places, but we had fun. We will return to Celus and crew later this year. What havoc will come from the destruction of the first word? How will Celus deal with it? When will Phlorr return for round two? We\u0027ll all find out in a few months.\u003cbr\u003eOur next main feature joins Elamon, a young man living in an isolated, but scientifically advanced culture. Like many young people, he seeks to expand his understanding of the world, to move beyond the bounds set by his society and his family. Unlike most young people, his journey takes him far from home, on a sometimes magical quest to reveal the fate of his grandfather. Many rise up along his path to join with, escape from, and fight against. Can he find a greater truth that has been hidden from his people and return home before it\u0027s too late to share this wisdom?\u003cbr\u003eOn this hero\u0027s journey, Elamon gathers people like himself, unlike himself, and unlike anything he\u0027s imagined, to face an enemy he never expected. Welcome to Ambervale. Have a seat in the gallery and watch the shifting block of amber as it spreads and rises, forming birds, flowers, trees, and a young man walking along a path from the hot jungle of the \u0027Vale into the mountains...\u003cbr\u003e"
