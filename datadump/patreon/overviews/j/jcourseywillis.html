    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eNew project video\u00a0coming soon! In the meantime, please keep reading ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is J. Coursey Willis?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m an American singer/songwriter and recording artist. Welcome to my Patreon page.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was adopted by the best parents I could ask for at a very young age. I grew up on Kent Island in the Chesapeake Bay. I received my first guitar for Christmas when I was nine. I\u2019ve been writing music since I was 10, annoying my parents and neighbors with garage band practice since I was 12, performing live since I was 14, and recording for the last five years. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am more than just a musician though. I am a creator. I create a feeling, and memories, and a movement. For lack of a better term, lets call it \u201csoul therapy\u201d. Thats what music is, isn\u2019t it? It becomes a part of your life, both good and bad. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can remember the first time I heard Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine. Hearing what those bands created changed me and imprinted me with a memory. I remember where I was, who I was with, what I was doing, and the feelings became nostalgic for me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow through Patreon you can subscribe to that feeling and join the movement. Let me provide your \u201csoul therapy\u201d \u2026 as scary as that may sound. Patreon enables creators, such as myself, to include you in our journey, while at the same time, allowing us to get paid for what we create. Now, let me introduce you to my new adventure. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI never considered pursuing my career in music without a recording label until recently. Every young musician in my generation grew up wanting to \u201cget signed,\u201d but that is not the way things work anymore and herein lies my dilemma.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe era of getting signed to a recording label and \u201cmaking it\u201d is no more. These days, hoping to hit the label lottery by chance or luck is a waste of time. Musicians must forge their own paths and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do. This is where you and Patreon come in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are some financial challenges I face?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is an opportunity for both of us. I want you to be my substitute record label. I am devoted to you just as much as you\u2019re dedicated to me. Like I said, my music is your \u201csoul therapy,\u201d but without earning a reliable music income, it is extremely hard to keep up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe costs incurred in making and releasing my debut six song EP, Missing October, amounted to about $10,000. The music videos that go along with an album are equally, if not more expensive. Then there are all of those other pesky associated costs of running a business, because that is what this is: the website, newsletter, and equipment maintenance \u0026amp; repair.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow you might suggest I just go play more shows and sell more music. Ah, I too have thought about this. However, gone are the days of fans buying physical albums. These are the days of digital streaming media; artist royalties collected on digital music amount to almost nothing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I were to tell you how much royalty revenue I collect from one song stream on any of the music platforms, you would first laugh, and then not believe me, or vice versa. It is a fraction of a cent. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow I know what I got myself into and I\u2019m willing to accept the challenge as I\u2019ve been doing for years, but I\u2019m ready to take a leap. I\u2019d like you to join me on Patreon so I can show everyone just what I\u2019m made of. You give me that and I will earn your faith.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work and what do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo here\u2019s how this works and what\u2019s really in it for you \u2026 besides \u201csoul therapy.\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have created tiered subscription rewards packages from $1 to $100 per month. You can change your choice or cancel at anytime, no strings attached, and I promise I wont go cry in a dark room by myself (for too long).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLets say you choose the $5 per month package. Your credit card will be charged $5 each month and in turn, you will become an official patron of J. Coursey Willis and I will send you all my love \u2026 obviously. But you will also receive full access to my patron-only feed for blog posts, picture \u0026amp; video updates, exclusive MP3 downloads, and early access to all content I create.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hear you right now saying \u201c$5 per month?!? Bah, that is surely not enough!\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI knew you had it in you, so lets assume you select the $15 per month package. Now you will receive everything previously mentioned as well as a newly designed, always made in the USA, t-shirt each year. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDifferent packages offer all kinds of JCW patron insider offerings such as Skype interviews, blooper \u0026amp; outtake videos, sample demo songs from upcoming albums, and other personalized items. Check out all of my subscriber rewards packages to the right. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with all of this money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs my patron force grows, I will be fulfilling different goals for each financial level I reach. For instance, at $500 per month I will record special intimate acoustic versions of all my studio-released songs every six months with exclusive patron-only early access. At the $1,000 mark, I will record and release to my patrons only, the first song of my follow up EP ... \u201cDangerous.\u201d Then I\u2019ll continue recording one song per month for six months to be included on that same EP release.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m going to see how far this journey will take us. The sky is the limit and I joined Patreon so that I can involve you in my quest to shoot for the moon. From now on I\u2019m doing what I love and I will find a way to make a living doing it or else I will die trying.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHave a look and a listen for yourself. I invite you into my world. I just may have what you\u2019ve been looking for. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWelcome to J. Coursey Willis \u2026 all aboard the train to windy hill.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Stitching together elements of rock, blues, country, and grunge on an acoustic foundation, J. Coursey Willis walks a dark road filled with a rage that creeps through his soulful vocals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn Joshua Bryan Willis in Wilmington, Delaware, the middle of several children. He and his brother, Derek, were adopted by Robert and Sheila Willis and were raised on Kent Island, seated in the Chesapeake Bay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up in the influential age of the 90\u2019s, Willis gathered inspiration from such bands as Alice In Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins.  Earlier music pioneers like the great Led Zeppelin, Muddy Waters, and Johnny Cash also attributed to his outspoken style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile attending Kent Island High School, Willis began writing and performing music in his first band, Negative Creep. He performed in various other bands through his early years, but most recently settled in as frontman and guitarist for the band Defrayal in 2010. Willis has opened for KIX and Linwood Taylor as well as shared the stage with Days of the New, Jimmie\u2019s Chicken Shack, L.A. Guns, Charm City Devils, Marky Ramone, Chesapeake Sons, The Kelly Bell Band, Blackfoot, Derek St. Holmes of Ted Nugent, and many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn late 2010, Willis set off on a solo venture performing under the name \u201cJ. Coursey Willis\u201d in homage to his mother\u2019s family maiden name. He released his debut EP, Missing October, on May 31, 2015 and continues to write in preparation for future studio releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWillis currently performs on stage with many talented musicians including Bryan Ewald of Jimmie\u0027s Chicken Shack \u0026amp; The Jarflys, Frank Grocholski of Jimmie\u0027s Chicken Shack, Dan Carlisle of Rachael Yamagata, and Matt Bowers of Derek St. Holmes. He also plays numerous solo and occasional duo acoustic shows with such musicians as Scott Spivey of Starcrush, Forrest and Jonathan Frase of Hot Tub Limo, and Jeff Klinetob of Peterbilt.\u003cbr\u003e",
