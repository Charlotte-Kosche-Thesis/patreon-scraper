My first book of collected short fiction, \u003cem\u003eThe Angels of Our Better Beasts\u003c/em\u003e, came out last year from ChiZine Publications. \u00a0I\u2019m a Clarion graduate, a Lambda Literary Fellow, and a Milton Fellow. I write science fiction, fantasy, and literary short stories and am working into novellas and novels. My work has been published in \u003cem\u003eLightspeed\u2019s Queers Destroy Science Fiction, Fantasy, Geist, Geez, On Spec, Joyland\u003c/em\u003e.

She didn\u2019t always walk through Kentucky.  She tried to cover every state of the country\nin a year.  So if you were poor or tired\nor the huddled masses, you could look up from the street and see her grey body\npassing overhead, see her torch light up your face and find yourself taken up\nin her skirts as she passed.  It was the\nbest thing for the poor, they said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  \n\nMy\nfamily would gather on the porch with our binoculars when she passed once a\nyear.  We couldn\u2019t stay outside to see\nher pass directly overhead; looking up, letting the light fall on you\u2014that\nwould pull you in, so you had to be hidden. \nBut she was beautiful to see on the horizon\u2014sometimes just her crown,\nmoving like a slow train across the land. \nThen later, we would see her head with her torch held low below the\nhorizon, blazing in a constant stream of orange, combing the streets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  \n\nHer\nfeet never crushed anything, her skirts never tossed cars or knocked down\nbuildings, she just walked and searched, looking and looking like a mother for\nher children, and then\u2014I saw this on TV\u2014she disappeared at the first morning\u2019s\nlight and appeared back on her base on Liberty Island.  I think she was my favorite of the gods,\nmaybe because she was consistent and regular, and the rest of them we didn\u2019t\nsee up close and personal.

Through Patreon I can build\nan audience for the novels and my other writing, and also give things to you\nthat no one else will get---all the extras of my worldbuilding, writing,\nsketches, etc, and you become a part of the writing process.  You can also help an author out by keeping\nhim solvent while writing\u2014something that\u2019s often hard to do\u2014even with two jobs.  You help by giving me as little as a dollar a\nmonth, and I have perks for those who give.

I\u2019ll do some illustrations for the novel that\nprobably won\u2019t make it into the finished novel\u2014sketches, maybe some\npaintings.  You\u2019ll see them as we go.  I didn\u2019t pitch this novel as an illustrated\none, and certainly not in colour.

There will also be cut scenes and\ndescriptions of world-building through Danny\u2019s eyes\u2014as he watches a lot of\ntelevision, collects collectibles, has opinions about his culture.  In many ways, Danny is the Field Guide to\nthis America. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can also have access to all the blog posts I write\nconcerning this project as I go\u2014fleshing out parts of America, with some of my\ntrue stories of going there.  I\u2019m taking\na route from Paducah, KY up the Mississippi through Caruthersville and St.\nGenevieve, through St. Louis, then over through Columbia, Kansas City, parts of\nNebraska, South Dakota, Montana, on my way north to Canada\u2014with detours.  My blog posts will be about what most\nimpressed me about these places, and what I want to do with them, and where I\u2019m\nat in the writing of the book.  There\nwill be craft discussions with you, and basically I\u2019ll interact with you on the\nblog, as much as I can.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, you can get exclusive sketches and paintings,\nprogress reports and field notes, excerpts and extra stories that probably\nwon\u2019t be included in the novel.
