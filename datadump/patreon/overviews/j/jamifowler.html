    "summary": "Who am I? Isn\u2019t that a question we continually ask ourselves and refine the answers too? We start out as a blank canvas, and yet we are painted with everything we could ever be in a lifetime. As we grow, the paint thinner is applied in the same way that paint is applied, one stroke at a time. We take away what we don\u2019t like, and add a touch here and there. A painting is born, a soul blossoms, a life takes shape.\u003cbr\u003eI see it every day with my daughters. One day they like puzzles, the next they don\u2019t. They are constantly striving to discover who they are. At my \u201cripe old age\u201d of 30-something, I am seeing that that process never stops. Sure, it waxes and wanes like the tides, some days I\u2019m stripping away more than I add, and some weeks I just keep adding without taking anything away.\u003cbr\u003eI can\u2019t answer who I am, or what I\u2019m about, and I hope to never have that answer.\u003cbr\u003eRecently I have re-learned that I am an artist. I have the heART and soul of an artist. I see life in bright, vivid colors, that I want to mold with my hands into tangible creations that can be picked up and viewed and inspected from multiple angles. I want to be an inspiration, I want people to look at what I am doing, what I am learning and want to copy me.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s in the copying that new art is made. When we are inspired by something, we strive to recreate it, to learn how that thing came into existence. And in the very act of copying, a new piece of art comes to life. No two works are ever identical, every artist leaves their signature, as unique as the person themselves.\u003cbr\u003eCopy me, be me, but don\u2019t forget to be you. And I will do the same.\u003cbr\u003eAll my love and bliss is yours to take, because the more I give away, the more I get back in return.\u003cbr\u003e"
