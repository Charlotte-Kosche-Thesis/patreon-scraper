    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page. \u00a0I am grateful for your interest in my work. \u00a0I have created this page is to help support a special project of mine:\u00a0 A Year of Embodiment\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a woman raised in a feminist home in our American culture, I grew up surrounded by contradiction when it\ncame to my own body. I was told my body\nwas mine alone, and yet I existed within a culture that told me my body only\nexisted to serve others.\u00a0 My copy of the book \u003ca href=\"https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/\"\u003eOur Bodies Ourselves\u003c/a\u003e told me that I should love my body\u2019s form no matter what its size or\nshape, but I was also hit daily with messages that if my body did not conform to a certain standard that neither I, nor it, was worthy of love.\u00a0 I was taught that sex was something to be celebrated and shared between two mutually consenting\npartners, yet time and again, my experience was that my consent didn\u2019t matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI came to live with the contradiction of being in my body, but wanting to detach from it. I felt betrayed by my femaleness. This led to a sense of self-objectification. I began to see my body\nas an object to be manipulated to fit the standards imposed upon it, or one to be ignored when it did not comply.\u00a0 My body was something apart from me and as such, it did not have a voice in my\nlife. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt has been dance and movement, particularly the practices of Authentic Movement and Contemplative Dance, that have changed how I relate to my body.\u00a0 I began to see my body not as an a burden that I\nhave had the ill luck to be saddled with as a woman, but as my home.\u00a0 And slowly,\nincrementally over a period of years, I began to recognize that my body is not just a vehicle for the\nnon-corporeal \u2018stuff\u2019 that is me, it is me; all of me - blood, bone, heart, spirit - and it has a voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis decade of work has inspired me to create a Year of Embodiment.\u00a0 As a woman about to enter midlife, this message of embodiment has become\nsomething I want to share with others; people of all genders and ages who feel alienated\nfrom their physical selves, so they may begin to move forward in life as whole beings. As survivor\nof sexual abuse and assault, I want to create avenues for other survivors to\ncome home to their bodies.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year of embodiment begins on February 1st, my birthday.\u00a0 It will cover several projects including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOn going embodiment workshops many of which I will make available to all regardless of economic circumstances.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRegular blog posts on the subject of embodiment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe creation of a performance art piece, \u003cem\u003eIn My Own Skin, \u003c/em\u003einspired my own journey from separation to embodiment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn embodiment show to take place in February 2019 for artists from a variety of disciplines to share works that speak to the concept of embodiment and to share their body\u0027s story.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd other possibilities such as monthly podcasts, video blogs, classes, art and more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny contribution will help, and all contributors of $3 or more are entered into a drawing for a signed print of my \u003cem\u003eIn Her Own Skin\u003c/em\u003e visual art series.\u00a0 Also, for any annual contribution of $100 or more I will pass $5 along to another Patreon artist because I love supporting artists too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and I look forward to sharing with you!"
