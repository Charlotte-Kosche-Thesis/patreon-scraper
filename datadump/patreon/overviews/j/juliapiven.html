I just gotta do this. Art is my thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m your typical fiery enthusiast when it comes to all things art, creeps down the neck,\u00a0and obscure. I spend a ridiculous amount of time (all of it) running a non-profit national organisation for alternative artists here in Sweden (except for when I\u2019m at school). With the organisation and all, I don\u2019t have time to work extra and art is an expensive habit. Please do help me waste my life away! on art, it\u2019s all I wanna do. I do hope I find some supporters here. It would thaw my rigid innards I swear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m an alternative artist based in Sweden. I study at Gothenburg School of Art and just want to do art for as long as possible. I\u2019m one of them ambitious gals, always striving to improve and accomplish new feats. I have goals for my development as an artist and as an individual. I have several non-profit engagements in my spare time including a suicide chat hotline and running an organisation for alternative artists. I want to create spaces for artists to meet and get all up in that cloud of creativity, together. If I help artists succeed, I\u2019ll not only feel like a decent piece of flesh, but I\u2019ll have done my part to strengthen the arts as a whole. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp an an artist out!
