    "summary": "So, I am a nerd, who likes reading, likes sex, and figured I\u0027d do what so many other nerds with similar hobbies do and smash the two of those together like furiously fornicating teenagers. I started writing Justified Means, an overly ambitious project that is trying to do way too many things all at once, but I\u0027ve enjoyed the process so screw it :) Unfortunately life has taken an interesting turn, and in order to continue justifying the time for this hobby (heh, see what I did there?) I have to monetize it. And so, the Patreon is born! The goal of this page is for people who enjoy my writing to help encourage me to write by giving me the sweet sweet monies. That being said, I don\u0027t plan on asking you to pay me on the hope that I eventually squeeze out a new chapter because that would be totally unreasonable. Instead I\u0027m putting this together as a pay per product page that means you only pay me if I write! Every new chapter of Justified Means that I post will be a chapter I get paid for and hopefully this will become a self reinforcing cycle with you lovely people getting content you enjoy, and me not feeling like I\u0027m ignoring my real world responsibilities every time I write instead of doing something for work. But JM isn\u0027t all that I will be writing. In addition to the core story, I\u0027ll be writing at least one short a month, and you wonderful perverts will get to help me pick what to write about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are other awesome benefits for becoming a patron, such as access to my works in progress page, and some other stuff I will come up with as I go along (I am open to suggestions) This is primarily dedicated to writing Justified Means and its follow up stories, but the shorts aren\u0027t restricted to Mass Effect. I am familiar enough with: Avatar, RWBY, The Dresden Files, DC Comics and TV, The 100, Wynonna Earp, Fallout, Mass Effect, and Stargate to be willing to write in them, and I\u0027m open to ideas from other fandoms though I\u0027m likely less familiar with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll characters I write about are 18+ If you\u0027d like a commission or want to suggest a short and need to know what my guidelines are, ask. But Rape and Non-con is always a no.\u00a0"
