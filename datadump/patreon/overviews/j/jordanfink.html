    "summary": "For most of my life I wanted to know: \u003cstrong\u003e\"what will it take for us to repair the climate, feed people, restore the landscape?\"\u003c/strong\u003e So I spent a decade working in nonprofits devoted to repairing the relationships of people and place. I learned Permaculture a method of ecological design that allows us to repair the earth while supporting thriving community.\u00a0In college i studied plant ecology and ethnoecology and learned as much as a could about plants and soil. I went to graduate school for sustainable landscape planning and design to learn the necessary skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 20 years of searching, I am confident that I have found my calling. I now understand the significant role that the release of soil carbon has played in climate change.\u003cstrong\u003e I believe that we can repair the climate in our lifetimes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m creating a project called World Tree that will start as research, writing, and design, and will grow into a worker-owned, climate- repairing development project that will employ and empower people to fix the climate. I have a plan for how it can work and I feel confident that, once launched, it can be a powerful force for change.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently putting as much time as i can to get this project running. Some health complications and a surgery, as well as the struggle to stay on my feet while making something new happen is challenging. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy helping me on Patreon, you are helping me reclaim my attention from a period of worrying about finances and my own well-being, to directing it more fully on working through the ideas, writing, presentation, and storytelling needed to get World Tree growing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe support I receive will buy back my time so that i can make regular blog posts and videos, share documentation of the projects that prove what\u0027s possible, build presentations and workshops, and craft the build model i need to show investors how to give in ways that reverse climate change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much in advance for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJordan Fink\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
