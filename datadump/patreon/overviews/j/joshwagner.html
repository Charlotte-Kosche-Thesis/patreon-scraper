    "summary": "\"We are children of the almost\u0027s and the not-quite-there\u0027s. We are more than nothing, but less than something.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year I traded my semi-stable life for a one-way ticket to Europe. In March I moved to Japan. I left home with no job, no professional contacts, and no long-stay visas. Just a will to travel, and a story to tell. A story about ancient monsters trapped in human form, trying to escape a world where they\u0027ve lost their relevance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy monsters have taken on many forms over the centuries: dragons, bears, dogs, trees, bridges, walls, kitchen appliances, creatures of the deep, memories, desires, and even ideas. But by the end of the second World War, they\u0027ve run out of places to hide. The earth no longer feels like home. A group of 47 monsters agree to erase themselves, become mortal, and die in peace. But now something is waking them up. Old memories start to resurface, and the 47 are drawn back into community to face their true nature.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe characters and stories of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Changing Things\u003c/em\u003e have been percolating for nearly 15 years. It looks like it wants to be a collection\u00a0of short, interconnected novels (a \"parallel\" rather than a \"series\"), whose\u00a0side-plots include a girl exploited by a narcissistic pop music producer, a man whose one desire is to lose his arms and legs, a real life superhero trying to balance a normal life, a theatre troupe living in the turmoil of 1870s Japan, a man whose ugliness is irresistible to women, a woman in love with a tree,\u00a0a scientific institution on the verge of discovering a new sense, a transmortalism cult looking for the keys to eternal life, a religious plot to overthrow the government from within. It\u0027s a baroque and gritty plunge down a rabbit hole of broken-hearted, paranoid, and sometimes marginalized outcasts facing the profound possibility of supernatural origins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve dedicated the last two years of my life to research, character development, and scene writing. The next phase has taken me to Japan and other parts of Asia. Once my research is done I\u0027ll come back home again to finish writing and publish the books. Like my own journey, their plots will span a range of countries and continents. I\u0027ve just been going wherever the story takes me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, if you\u0027ve read this far, there\u0027s one VERY IMPORTANT detail I need to point out:\u00a0Patreon is not like Kickstarter. Rather than a single up-front payment, backers are charged per-release. Payments are made automatically through the Patreon site when I submit a new story, chapter, etc... This won\u0027t happen more than once a month (max 12 times per year if I\u0027m feeling ambitious). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, you\u0027re free to cancel or adjust your backing level at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that\u0027s out of the way let\u0027s talk about what you get. Even the lowest tier patrons ($1/month) get access to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Content:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResearch notes and insights, character development, early drafts, short stories, and ultimately (with most backing levels) the finished books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMe and my Process:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI call Montana home but I spend a lot of time traveling and living abroad. This will be my fourth novel inspired in some way by my nomadic lifestyle. I want to let you guys in on the personal side of the process, so patrons will have exclusive access to travel blogs, videos, images, ask-me-anything and google hangout sessions. I\u0027ll be offering a peek into my emotional pendulum, my struggles and accomplishments, the days when I want to give up and the ways I manage to press on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe World:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will not only have access to observe a little bit about my process, but a privileged opportunity to participate in the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a long-time believer in the value of collaboration and multi-disciplinary approaches to storytelling, I\u0027ve been recently mulling over what the idea of an \"open source\" novel might look like. Is there a way for long form fiction to be collaborative? I have a plan to partially develop\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Changing Things\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0with both inclusive and interdependent aspects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to see what happens when other creators contribute their take on the world \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e the final project is complete. In this way, collaborator work can be integrated in subtle ways into the developing story. Along with the release of \u003cem\u003eThe Changing Things\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0books,\u00a0I will be curating one or more books of companion content filled with spin-off stories, artistic interpretations, and other collaborator input (all companion proceeds will go to the partner artists). Interested patrons will get advanced access to this process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thanks for reading, watching, and listening. It\u2019s already been an eye-opening journey, and I\u0027m excited to have you guys along for the remainder of the ride: whether as collaborators, creators, patrons, readers or all four. We\u0027re going to build a beautiful, complex,\u00a0spontaneously evolving monster of a world of words.\u003cbr\u003e"
