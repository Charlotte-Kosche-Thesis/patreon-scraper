It\u0027s different from other sites such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe because you aren\u0027t paying to support one huge project but instead supporting me as a content creator to the video game scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently I am a senior in High School who\u0027s most likely going to college next year, which means that most likely I will have to spend a huge amount of money on college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means I can\u0027t prioritize the equipment I\u0027d like to continue with creating quality content. Some people have also asked if I had paid lessons, which I always considered it, but never decided if I wanted to go that route because of time issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to get new equipment and start working on more content because I love making videos/blogs/etc for everyone because it\u0027s fun, people send me messages saying that its helpful and that they enjoy it but unfortunately Youtube\u0027s Ad Revenue is small for channels like me.\u00a0Adblock also being a factor to less contribution, to help me with my editing software/equipment, I feel Patreon would be a great way to have people directly support me for the\u00a0content I make\u00a0and I think the money is more well spent on the perks I have for my viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith 2017 coming out and a large potential for VGC and the community to expand, I want to provide the best possible content that I can create to help newer players learn and grow\u00a0while helping\u00a0veterans sharpen their skills. That\u0027s when I decided to create a Patreon in order to help raise funds for new equipment and upgrades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoing YouTube seriously takes a lot of effort and a lot of money. You have to pay for webcams, editing softwares, recording softwares, microphones, capture cards, layouts, good computers for streaming, etc. The money raised by the Patreon will be put into the channel to help the growth of quality in the content that is produced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat You Can Expect\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon supporters will be given these rewards and benefits (More may be added later on depending on how successful and popular this becomes)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(198, 217, 240);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e- All Ev Spreads and Team Information\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e about teams I have used in past tournament even early access to spreads that\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e aren\u0027t even released publicly at the time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eAutomatic \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEntry into all raffles for giveaways for amazing stuff including Video Game Merch/ Gift cards and \u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eexclusive\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e Pok\u00e9mon Tournament things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Priority over normal viewers when doing Viewer Battles on YouTube or Twitch Streams.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- An extra exclusive video every week \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eONLY YOU\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e will be able to view and have access to.
