This is the moment where I tell you that I am a nerd without absolutely no life, no friends outside of work, and no hope for any kind of social life whatsoever. It\u2019s not a bad thing I happen to quite like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs states before I am a nerd, and as a nerd I have written many a fan fiction, short story and pseudo novel you can imagine with a sci-fi genre or fantasy genre. When I wasn\u2019t around \u00a0seven I remember writing a story about how my family were a bunch of lizards wearing human skin, very Goosebumps worthy material to be sure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow for my very short, very witty, very appropriate mission statement: I have several story ideas, but none of themselves were too original when they\u2019d came through their first draft so I soon put them on hold until I could think of something better, and Modded Humans was it. If you love science fiction, action, a dash of intrigue with a sprinkle of romance then I hope you will love this story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral years ago a scientist came up with the idea of enhancing people\u2019s natural talents into something super human. His idea became reality when he founded the School for the Highly Gifted. Not all was how it seemed ;however, and those that thought they were gifted quickly found out they were cursed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead about how Christine, Louis, Drake and other victims of NGen learn to cope, and try to live a normal life while avoiding the eyes of Dr. Gregory J. Abrahms.\u003cbr\u003e",
