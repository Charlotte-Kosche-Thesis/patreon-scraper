    "summary": "Hi, my name is Jake Gardner. I am a twenty four year old male out of Colorado, U.S. I graduated from the University of Northern Colorado in 2015 with a bachelors in English and a minor degree in Film. I am also a mixed martial artist. I have been training in several martial arts individually for nearly a decade and have brought it all together this past year into the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA). For years I have watched, studied, and rehearsed fights to an obsession, seriously I have lost friendships over this sport.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this blog I will discuss the philosophies and rituals I use in my training, go over my schedule of training and break down lessons and sequences I use for my success, discuss the success and failures of my diet and as well just share food ideas and recipes so readers may get actual physical gain from my blogs. Thus far I am an amateur MMA fighter, but in two fights I am ranked in the top ten of my state and top one hundred out of the west coast of the United States with claiming amateur title belt on the side. Follow me and I will provide literate blog posts about what it is truly like to devote life to not only an MMA fighter but a few other passions of mine as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis blog will include stories of my life and passions for example my outdoor adventures in the Rocky Mountains including hiking fourteen thousand feet mountains, camping, and paddle boarding during the summer, and snow shoeing and winter camping during the winter. I have began working on writing on a novel and a few short stories on my experiences in the mountains, as well as the ocean with surfing and scuba diving, and am looking forward to sharing more on this blog.\u00a0I am a kickboxing instructor for Catalyst Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Windsor, CO. I give private lessons for any requests whether self defense, getting in better shape, or more of the fighter types as well. I also teach adult beginners Wednesday nights and kids 7-13 class Thursday nights. Check out the gym for any interest. Though I might include experiences with certain individuals, I will try to not include specific names of people I spend time with in my blog unless they request otherwise. I might make up a name though, no harm in that, blogger power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this blog I want to share ideas, philosophies, propose and break down areas of thought. My time at the university showed me the power of research and how to approach an idea from multiple angles in order to perceive it to the best of my own ability. Please join me on my blog posts as I attempt to not only chase my dream as an eventual professional mixed martial artist but as well for a brief autobiography. Thank you for your time."
