Please don\u0027t leave just yet, though. I have some questions and answers to share!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eDo you like video games?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know I do! I\u0027ve been playing games for just about three decades. One might reasonably argue that I\u0027ve built my life around them. I have an extensive games library at my disposal, acquired over years spent skipping meals, staying home on vacation, watching for sales, and sometimes obtaining review copies to cover around the Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eDo you like reading about video games?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome people only like\u00a0videos. But if you do like reading about games, that\u0027s exciting to me because I like writing about them! I\u0027ve gotten good enough at writing about games that people sometimes pay me to put my skills to work on their sites. I wrote for Hardcore Gamer Magazine during its entire print run, plus my freelance work has appeared on sites like IGN, GameSpot, Polygon and GamesRadar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy am I asking for some of your money?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery year, it seems like there\u0027s less money in writing about games. I have a hard time finding editors who want freelance contributions, and I don\u0027t currently have a full-time gig anywhere. My dream is to\u00a0produce game-related content full-time, without answering to anyone other than my readers. I figure that\u0027s feasible if I can find 2,500 or more people who are willing to consistently back me at $1/month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat will I do if I \u003cem\u003edon\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e get that money?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m already working as a freelancer, and I\u0027ll keep at it. Around any obligations that pay my bills, I\u0027ll continue playing and writing about games on my site, and sharing that work on social media. I\u0027m not going anywhere, in other words, and you should expect to see more game-related content from me no matter what.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat will I do if I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e raise $2,500 or more each month?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll spend nearly every waking hour playing games, writing about them and studying them. I\u0027ll also continue laboring behind-the-scenes on my web site,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.honestgamers.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHonestGamers\u003c/a\u003e, to ensure it remains a fantastic community for other people to share their passion for games (a lot of time-consuming work goes into that site that people never know about). Sometimes, I\u0027ll take necessary time away from the computer to enjoy walks in nature or to spend time with my wife, and I\u0027m taking classes online part-time, but the bulk of my time will be spent producing great content for my backers. If you\u0027re a backer, make sure you let me know what you\u0027d like to see, so I can deliver it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eHow much and what sort of content should you anticipate?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s up to you! By default, I\u0027ll continue reviewing games. I tend to stick mostly to Nintendo-related content, but I have most consoles and a gaming-class PC, so I can cover almost anything. And I can stream and create videos if that\u0027s what people want to see, though I\u0027m most comfortable producing written work (including the occasional game guide). Do keep this in mind: whatever content you see me producing right now, it\u0027s just a sample of what I can produce if I have enough patrons to work at this full-time. A growing and engaged audience should also mean new coverage opportunities, like exclusive interviews and more first looks at upcoming games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhere can you find some of my current content, so you know if I\u0027m actually any good?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a page listing the more than 700 reviews I\u0027ve written for HonestGamers over the last two decades, starting with the newest ones first:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.honestgamers.com/honestgamer/blog/list/reviews/2/1.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.honestgamers.com/honestgamer/blog/list/reviews/2/1.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is my blog\u0027s homepage at HonestGamers, which includes my recent news coverage (you can even subscribe to an RSS feed to receive alerts when new posts are available):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.honestgamers.com/honestgamer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.honestgamers.com/honestgamer\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work is also available on other sites, and Google can help with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eIs all of the above worth your $1?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly pledge of $1 or more will help give me the time and resources to produce more of the content you love. It will be exclusive content that you\u0027ll find only on HonestGamers and my YouTube and streaming channels, and the quantity and quality of output will improve with additional support. You can pay a role in all of that, by spending less each month than it costs to purchase a single soda from a vending machine. Please make your pledge today!"
