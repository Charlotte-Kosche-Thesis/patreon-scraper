I\u0027ve been creating videos on this YouTube channel since 2008, and it has over 70,000 subscribers and 19,000,000 views. \u00a0Now I am ready to bring you even better videos than ever before. \u003cstrong\u003eBut first, I need to get to the point where it is not costing me to create videos and maintain my website.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0Whether you decide to pledge or not, you\u0027re awesome, and I thank you for watching my videos, and I hope you continue to find them useful.  By helping people be able to work on their own car in their garage and saving them money is what motivates me.  If fact, the \u003cstrong\u003eDIYers out there play a big role in exposing automotive related careers to the younger generation, which we need.  I started out as a DIYer as a kid, and I\u0027ve been doing it since then.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging only $1 per month, you can help relieve my the financial stress of the costs to create videos and maintain the website. \u00a0After that point, I can start thinking about new equipment and ways to improve the videos. \u00a0I usually upload 4 videos per month, but will probably\u00a0start posting fewer unless I get more support. \u00a0I may start posting one video per month due to the time, effort and costs involved with creating videos. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout The Channel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Garage Butler offers step-by-step car and truck repair training videos for the car enthusiasts, DIY, students, or the professional technician. The videos are easy to understand and taught by a Master ASE certified instructor. You will learn how you can get in your garage and work on your car or truck yourself and save money. You will learn about car maintenance, bondo, auto body repair, how to prep a car for paint, how to paint a car, headlight restoration, washing cars, polishing cars, waxing cars, parts installations, and much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t do it alone....when you have The Garage Butler to help you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRomans 5:8\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwvUjAv6pxg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
