I also help out with a couple API libraries, and try \nto improve the development community where I can. I always appreciate donations, because they help cover the costs, provide incentive to keep working, and are strong proof that people value what I do. That being said, I don\u0027t do all this development for money; I do the things I do because I want to help people.
