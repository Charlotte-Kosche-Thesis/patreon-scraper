For those of you understanding now why you need to support our important work, please take a few moments to read on ....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy\nWe Fight\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe stand at a crossroads. The forces of darkness are more powerful today than they have been in living memory. I am a warrior with fire in his heart. I am engaged in a relentless struggle of life or death. You understand the importance of this struggle. You also make sacrifices to help us win this fight.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe people are worth fighting for. Our children will inherit whatever remains of this planet, and the change begins today and it begins with us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will not rest until the fight for freedom, justice, and revolution\nhas been won. I have worked hard to develop\nmy skills to become a more effective fighter. Others have joined me in my fight, as I have joined others\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn supporting me, you also support a whole platoon of soldiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have built a movement and a team who share our values and work tirelessly for everything that must be done. We are highly disciplined, focused, and resolute.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou too have a choice to make. Together we\ncan make a difference. Please support my work in any way you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have built\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fort-russ.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFort Russ News\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://syncreticstudies.com/\"\u003eThe Center for Syncretic Studies\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://openrevolt.info/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNew Resistance\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have moved beyond the left/right paradigm, but haven\u0027t left anyone behind along the way. You are with us regardless of how you see yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI am Joaquin Flores - an experienced political\norganizer, educator, and analyst of geo-strategy and international\nrelations.  I also have a strong\nbackground in grass-roots community organizing; being an effective communicator\nand a  reliable organizer of work,\nprojects, and people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began my life\u0027s work as a fighter for worker\u0027s\nrights and socio-economic justice in Los Angeles in 1991,\nwhere as a teenager my passion for these issues led me to understand the role\nof solidarity, strategy, and organization in making a lasting impact on\nsociety.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI have\nhumbled myself before the great men and women who have walked my path before\nme. I am inspired by the tremendous work of my mentors and heroes. The repressive political climate in the U.S made practical living\nunreasonably difficult. Harassed by the FBI and the LAPD, I made another\nchoice, a choice to leave. I have retreated to higher ground, a more defensible position.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am now an expatriate living and working in Belgrade,\nSerbia. This region\nwill also likely be the flashpoint of any future major global conflict. I am\nhere, along with others, ready for it. Some of the things I, we, have done here can\u0027t be written about for many years to come. We believe you\u0027d be proud and encouraged if you knew. Statutes of limitation have to pass. But we can say there\u0027s been lots of organized solidarity from Belgrade to the Donbass.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOn my journey, I also began to realize that the\nanswers to the problems we face are not easy. This world has many mysteries and\ntruths obscured from our sight. There is much more to humanity and the human\nexperience than can be explained away by the present paradigm. The forces of darkness have\nforced upon humanity a stunted vision of\nhuman potential. With an open mind and heart, this has led me to broaden my\nscope, and has opened my eyes to what is possible and what is necessary.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you will be contributing to with Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\nwill be contributing to a good deal of work already in progress, and new and exciting projects yet to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have proven results. The Center for Syncretic Studies has hosted global conferences, advised other teams of activists and developed their projects, and distributed high quality peer review journals such as the Journal for Eurasian Affairs and the upcoming Journal for Syncretic Studies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFort Russ is our daily newspaper, online since 2014 with 100,000 daily reads. We produce top quality journalism, analysis, translations, and op-eds from the world\u0027s hotspots and from some of the best writers out there today. Not the same, though talented, syndicated readers one can find anywhere else. We have a unique editorial line, and a superior filter that allows us to cut through the noise and understand the information we are filtering within the context of Fourth Generation Warfare in the area of the Information war.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have proven\nour capacity to deliver. Your sustained help will allow us to focus on this work more\neffectively\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have given public lectures across Europe, and been a\npanelist in official public educationals, endorsed and attended by\nrepresentatives of the consular offices of Syria, Palestine, Iraq, Tunisia, and\nIran, on the subject of the US led war against Syria, being supportive of the\nSyrian people and their duly elected government.  I became a regularly appearing analyst of\ncurrent events on PressTV, Russia Today (RT), and also on Al Etejah from\nLebanon and Iraq, as well as regularly giving analysis on various other popular\nwebcasts and podcasts in new media.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI presently serve as the Editor\nin Chief of Fort Russ News. I served as the President of the Berlin based NGO,\nthe Independent Journalist Association for Peace (AJKF). In my capacity at\nAJKF, I raised and gave over $100,000 in grants for research and investigative\njournalist projects to grant winners - independent journalists and analysts who\notherwise would not have been able to carry out their important work.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nUntil March of 2017, I served as the copy-editor and\npolitical consultant on American Affairs for the Katehon think tank, and had\nthe honor to serve under notable Russian political figures and theoreticians\nsuch as Sergei Glaziev and Alexander Dugin.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll\nof this I managed to do without turning to the public for support. Since\nJanuary of 2017, Google and its Adsense subsidiary have declared open war on\nindependent journalists and analysts. Fort Russ has suffered an over 70%\nreduction in ad revenues which pay for journalists\u0027 work, as a result.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we are not giving up the fight.
