We do this through our (mostly) satirical content revolving around anime and other nerdy things of that nature. We consider it our job to have people leave our videos with either a smile on their face or at least an experience that they won\u2019t regret\u2026(completely). Can\u2019t win them all! If I had to describe Johkerr in a way that could do it justice, it\u2019s our way of reaching out to the communities we love and allowing us all to joke around, which is something that we don\u2019t often do these days!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UM7zD8Wh.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Johkerr is not a one-man job, as there are many moving parts behind the scenes. The voice and middle-man of the channel is me, Joseph Alari! I am a freelance artist and constant dreamer. I created this channel with the idea to get people laughing! I handle the artwork, audio, scripts, direction, as well as try my best to respond to all of you. Then there is my partner in crime, Frankling Ciprian! He\u2019s our editor and we wouldn\u2019t be here without his immense talent and above average skills in both design and after effects. Lastly, there\u2019s all our subscribers! I deemed this introduction necessary because if it wasn\u2019t for all of you, Frank and I wouldn\u2019t be here or happy. You all gave us the validation we needed to continue to make content online! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8Cdkkjsh.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I want to be as clear as possible when I tell you where the money goes. My goal is to never leave you all in the dark on our decisions. The money will either go to one of two things; the equipment for the channel to improve the quality of our content, or to Frank and I (or anyone else) to help create content. I know that it is sometimes frowned upon to use the money for ourselves, but Frank and I do this full time, and sadly YouTube doesn\u2019t offer enough money for us to do this as a living. If we get enough money, we could put out even more premium content without the fear of starving!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5iuOjajh.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cannot honestly thank all of you enough! Please do not feel pressured into donating (unless it\u2019s because the rewards are looking great). I want you all to know we love doing this and what donating does is allow Frank and I to further thrust ourselves into our work providing more quality content videos. Whether it is 1 dollar to 100 dollars, or even if you just share our work, I want you all to know that we love and appreciation for everything you do for us! I always say you all mean the world to me, and I genuinely mean it with every fiber of my being! Thank you, and G\u0027byeee\u003cbr\u003e"
