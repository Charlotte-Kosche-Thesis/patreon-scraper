    "summary": "Based out of The Great Project, a shared studio space of creatives that he has envisioned \u0026amp; started within the burgeoning MASS District (Music \u0026amp; Arts South of Sunrise) of Downtown Fort Lauderdale, Jean-Luc Thebaud of BLK INK. LLC \u0026amp; participating board member in the MASS District provides custom commissioned artwork and art education classes specializing in acrylic \u0026amp; mixed media.\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Nantes, France. My father was an architect. I grew up surrounded by his work and his passion for Van Gogh, Picasso and Degas. I moved to Paris and had the chance to meet the well-known film director, Marcel Carne (\u201cThe Children of Paradise\u201d). He encouraged me and helped me to use my creativity to express myself until his death. The work of M.C. Escher has influenced me to come back to my first love of artwork \u0026amp; architecture. In the \u201ccube\u201d, I incorporate architecture to create 3-dimensional geometric drawings in black and white.\u003cbr\u003eWhen I moved to the USA, the shock between the old and the new continents marked my transition to a new medium. From the desert of Arizona to the ocean of Florida, I have been inspired to use oil paint and deep, intense colors.\u003cbr\u003eMy pen and ink work is like a \u201csearch of lost time.\u201d Through the details of a door, a street, a monument or a Parisian scene, I have been able to capture the early European Architecture of the 16th-19th centuries.\u003cbr\u003eOne of my latest works, \u201cMegalopolis\u201d, is a perfect fusion of my passions. I used ink and colors to express my vision of the metallic, flamboyant, glassy texture of large American cities. To this day, I am still fascinated by mixing colors and texture.\u003cbr\u003eI have created a painted series on large canvas, known as my \u201cTriptych\u201d line, which is based on a contemporary style using mostly acrylic, and some in oil. This line of work has provided great success and a sense of accomplishment to me.\u003cbr\u003eI perform commission artwork jobs, one of which was to design custom table tops, using a unique scene from Florida with a nice resin-shine finish to enhance \u0026amp; protect them.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently influenced by the beautiful tropical scenery of South Florida, I have been inspired to create a \u201cTropical Feeling\u201d line of painted natural scenery using vibrant colors in small and large formats on natural wood.\u003cbr\u003e"
