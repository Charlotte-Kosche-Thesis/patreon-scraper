    "summary": "Hello,\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jenny Lee, and I create YouTube videos mainly focusing on Betta Fish!\u003cbr\u003eI posted my FIRST fish related video back in 2017, and it was about Unboxing 108 pounds of Driftwood!\u003cbr\u003eIf you told me a year ago, that I would reach THIS FAR in my YouTube career, I\u0027d probably laugh at you! I started YouTube to share my hobby with other Fish Hobbyist; and I definitely didn\u0027t think that I would come this far into this exciting journey of Fish keeping...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy Subscribers and my Fans mean the whole world to me. I cannot explain all the gratitude that I have for all my supporters. \u003cbr\u003eI still cannot grasp the fact that another person would care so much for a stranger. Yet, they sincerely care for that stranger, and willing to spend 4 or even 8 minutes of their own time to watch the videos I put up. THAT itself means a whole lot to me...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has definitely made me into a patient, humble, confident, and a positive person.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI love when I get comments like, \"Your videos always lighten up my day...\" OR \"I binge watch your videos...\" I literally smile until my cheeks hurt when I read those comments! Also, it makes me want to bring better videos that I could offer to the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have been watching few of my videos, you guys know that I end the video off with, \"...and don\u0027t forget to STAY BUBBLY!\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe word \"STAY BUBBLY,\" means that you should stay POSITIVE, no matter what the situation is. Not everyone may go through the exact same situation as you do; but we all face a rough time in our lives. However, it\u0027s our MIND that changes how we live our LIFE.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo try to fill your brain with positive thoughts, and release that negative energy. \u003cbr\u003eI promise you, that life will be so much better when you look at it in a POSITIVE way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong; nobody can always \"STAY BUBBLY.\" \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s NOT humanly possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou can\u0027t always be happy and stay positive, but at the same time; you shouldn\u0027t be sad for a long time either.\u003cbr\u003eCRY, SHOUT, and SCREAM if you have to. Let those negative feelings out, then bring yourself together. \u003cbr\u003eStraighten up that crown, and put on that beautiful smile. \u003cbr\u003eTell the world that you can face any challenges; because you\u0027d probably have faced similar situation before. You never know what life is going to throw at you. You have good days, and then all of the sudden; you feel like everything is falling apart. \u003cbr\u003eNobody knows what the future will bring; but I think that\u0027s the beauty of life...\u003cbr\u003eHuman beings are NATURALLY scared of the unknown. However, instead of fearing it; try to enjoy this crazy journey that we call, \"LIFE.\" You\u0027ll always face something that you feel like you can\u0027t handle; but always remember, that there\u0027s somebody in the world who is going through a similar situation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou CAN face any obstacles if you have the correct mindset.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s how I came up with the quote, \"STAY BUBBLY.\"\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t always need to be happy; but you can try to have positive outlooks in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank all my Friends, Family, and definitely the YouTube Community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you for making me smile; even when you didn\u0027t know I was feeling down.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all the love and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Jenny Lee\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
