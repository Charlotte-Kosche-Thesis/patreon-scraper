    "summary": "Yo, ho, ho ladies, gentlemen and house pets of the world. My name is Jared Nelson and welcome to the Patreon of ScientificGaming! I play them crazy Co-op titles on Twitch and yell at my team for making regular mistakes like some sort of boot camp instructor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhattchu do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a full time Twitch partner and streamer. I won\u0027t lie to you fine furred folk though. It\u0027s horribly stressful to look at bill time and realize you\u0027re not so much living paycheck to paycheck, as you\u0027re walking a razors edge. But Jesus CHRIST is it a lot of fun. Spending your days meeting new people. Making new friends. Playing new games. You just get to sit back and learn all sorts of interesting and awesome new stuff and how the hell could you ask for more?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlans for the future?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMore, more, MORE! YouTube! Morning streams! Sub nights! Community game sessions! For real though. I talk a lot about my plans but I\u0027m super scatter brained and the only time I can focus is during hardcore game sessions. Which as you might assume is not super awesome for getting anything done at all. That being said we\u0027ve got a sub Minecraft server coming up. A WoW Labcats guild up and running. The inventory system still needs item name ideas but I\u0027m workin\u0027 it down. YouTube and morning streams are on rotation between one and other as I work through all my back logged games. There\u0027s lots of plans for the future! Just spreads me super thin and I\u0027m super sorry for all that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI thought for a long time about this and fought with myself endlessly. I hate asking for donations. Pledges. Hand outs. It all has a society confirmed negative feeling about it. But I know the truth is that Twitch at my level is carried entirely by the generosity of my viewers and friends. I\u0027d love to never need to lean on someone else for their kindness but when your bills stack high and you live from donations? The stability that something like Patreon affords just can\u0027t be ignored. It\u0027s so much easier to live life and push forward with Twitch and Youtube when you\u0027re not terrified of losing internet or the roof over your head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal thoughts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJokes aside. Thank you all. Pledges or not just having you there with me on this journey is so freaking unbelievable. I tell people what I do and I\u0027m slowly watching them change from that \"Oh man, look at this homeless to be loser\" and as we progress I start to get that feeling of wonderment. \"He\u0027s following his dreams. It\u0027s working? Not a chance, I don\u0027t believe it\". It pushes me onward. Those of you that have come to me and thanked me for helping you through tough time by just being me? There isn\u0027t a better feeling in the world. I\u0027m not even aware I\u0027m helping, but god damnit I\u0027m going to try as hard as my fat ass possibly can! I love you all, thank you so, so much. If Patreon isn\u0027t your jam? You can always donate a lil bit to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://deepbot.tv/donations/donate.php?s=scientificgaming\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePayPal\u003c/a\u003e \u0026lt;3"

Asking people you\u0027re still building friendships with to give you their hard earned money to continue your dream. I wanted tiers of rewards. Giveaways! Letters of thanks and game play events. But I\u0027m no good at these things. So I only ask for what you can spare. Together we can make these goals a reality and have tiers with all these cool events and unlocks! But I know I need your help to make that a reality. Thanks guys, I really mean it.",
