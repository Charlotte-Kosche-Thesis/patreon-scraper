    "summary": "Hello, my\nname is Joe Hooper and welcome to my Patreon page! I am a Native American musician, guitarist, and composer\nfrom Montana. I create original music. My music is mostly made up of guitar and\nNative American flute. I am a solo artist, but I am working on forming a group\nto perform my music. I also make and record songs which are available on\niTunes. I also upload hymns on guitar and a few random videos to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/NativeGuitarJoe\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNativeGuitarJoe\u003c/a\u003e YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I have a Patreon page is because it is the easiest way for you to support me directly. Putting music on iTunes and other digital stores, including Spotify, costs money up front. On top of that, the income from a song that I release doesn\u0027t reach my account until at least a month later. You, as one of my Patreon supporters, would enable me to release a song with those costs covered up front! Then in return, I will reward you for your support by releasing exclusive material on Patreon according to your chosen reward tier (outlined below).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is an outline of everything\nyou need to know about my Patreon page (if you still have questions, you can email\nme at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:nativeguitarjoe@gmail.com\"\u003eNativeGuitarJoe@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon\nis a place where you can support me directly and get rewarded for your support!\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can make a pledge of $1 or more for\nevery song that I create, which is usually 1 or 2 per month. (that would come to $1 or $2 per month for a $1 pledge)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlthough similar to Kickstarter and\nother sites, Patreon is different in that your pledge is a recurring amount\nthat gets charged every time I post a new song.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\ncan make a pledge of any dollar amount for each song that I create.\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can pledge at the \u003cstrong\u003eBasic\u003c/strong\u003e level for\n$1 per song, or the \u003cstrong\u003ePlus\u003c/strong\u003e level for $2 per song. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour pledge tier gives you access to\nthe corresponding perks. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe details are listed here on my\nPatreon page under \u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRewards are offered by tier which\ncorresponds to how much you pledge.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can set a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly max\u003c/strong\u003e\nwhen you sign up for a pledge tier so your budget is safe as well!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eThis\nincome, from your generous support, will help me take care of my family, buy better recording equipment, and help\nfund production costs for my music.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
