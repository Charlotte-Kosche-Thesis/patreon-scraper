    "summary": "All the thank yous for visiting my Patreon page! As some of you might now, the constantly shrinking world of sports media means many of us are locked in part-time jobs for years at a time, which is where I\u0027ve been for the past couple of years. And while I love working part-time in radio and as a freelance sportswriter, even combining the two doesn\u0027t exactly add up to a living wage. And with fewer and fewer content creators getting full-time jobs at big outlets, it doesn\u0027t look like that\u0027s going to change anytime soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing and podcasting and creating things for the media world that people can relate to and appreciate. With your help, I hope to be able to do more of it. By contributing to my patreon, you ensure I can spend more time on creating and less time hustling constantly to get paid (trust me, it takes up a LOT of time) and looking for more part-time gigs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to contribute, please know you have my eternal gratitude and my promise to do my very best to make you glad you did."
