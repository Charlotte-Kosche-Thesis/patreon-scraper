    "summary": "We all know the hobby favorites: D\u0026amp;D, Fate, Savage Worlds, Apocalypse World (and a handful of breakout derivatives) and others.\u00a0 These are the games that get played at conventions, talked about in public forms, and often inspire derivative works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I\u0027ve been taking the time to take a closer look at some overlooked and forgotten gems.\u00a0 I\u0027m going to be writing about these games in an effort to bring more attention to those games that may have fallen through the cracks.\u00a0 I hesitate to use the word \"review\" as I won\u0027t be doing a score breakdown, weighing pros and cons, or covering the whole game in detail.\u00a0 Instead, I plan to highlight the parts that make me think the game is worthy of attention and play.\u00a0 I\u0027m calling these articles, \"spotlights\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially, I\u0027m going to post these articles on steemit, a new platform that allows posters to monetize their contributions by adding currency value to the \"up votes\" they receive.\u00a0 I fully admit to being a bit skeptical of this platform but it does provide you with two ways to support this endeavor of mine.\u00a0 You can contribute directly through this patreon or you can lend up votes to the posts at steemit.\u00a0 Or both!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find the articles here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://steemit.com/@jburneko\"\u003ehttps://steemit.com/@jburneko\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThank you, in advance, for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout The Players \u0026amp; Game Masters Reward Tiers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I launched, Patreon announced its change in transaction fee structure.\u00a0 This news seemed to upset a lot of people and Patreon has since rolled back that announcement.\u00a0 However, before they chose to roll back their decision I had made a bit of a game out of certain \"break points\" in the fee math.\u00a0 That no longer matters but I\u0027ve decided to keep the game anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the first week of every month (starting in February, 2018) I will solicit photos from Players and Game Masters Patrons.\u00a0 Photos from the Players tier should be game paraphernalia a player might use during an RPG session such as character minis, character sheets, dice, cards, etc.\u00a0 Photos from the Game Masters tier should be of tools that a game master might use during an RPG session such as, monster minis, charts and graphs, maps, a page from scenario notes, etc. The idea is to be as creative and suggestive with these things in their presentation as possible.\u00a0 They can be entirely made up as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will take all the photos and put them into groups to suggest various imaginary games. I will post my arrangements during the last week of the month.\u00a0I will then hold a naming contest for all the imaginary games I\u0027ve created.\u00a0 I may or may not come up with a prize for the winners each month.\u003cbr\u003e"
