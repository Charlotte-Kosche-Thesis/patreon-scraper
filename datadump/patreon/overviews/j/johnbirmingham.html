So much fun, I\u0027d love to do it again, but with you along for the whole ride this time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.janwellmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Post-Apocalypse-London.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the wild frontiers of writing, but I want to push even further out, beyond the settled storylands of conventional publishing. And it\u0027d be cool if you could come with me. I want to write an End of the World novel as epic as Stephen King\u0027s \u003cem\u003eThe Stand\u003c/em\u003e, as vast as S.M. Stirling\u0027s saga of \u003cem\u003eThe Change\u003c/em\u003e. But not just one novel, a series of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, yes, I could just close the door to my word cave, turn on my \u0027puter and turn over a manuscript to my publishers two years from now. But with that would come certain... constraints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I hate constraints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s my plan. I\u0027m going to write this story here, line by line. But not just one book, or even the four I have planned. Here I want to create an entire story world, including short fiction, fan fiction, research notes, blog entries, character profiles, reader discussions and more. I want to expose the unseen machinery of story telling and involve you, my readers, in the creation and evolution of the narrative world itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat the hell does that even mean?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePractically this: Sign on at the basic level and you\u0027ll get to see the books as they\u0027re written. You can comment, make suggestions, see the story evolve not just as I type the words but as you respond to them. When the final ebook is released, your\u0027s is free, of course. As are any instalments along the way. The suckers on Amazon can pay full price.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the next level of involvement you get to peer deep into the machine itself. As I plot out the course of the series, write the character bios, compile research notes, block out set pieces and story beats, I\u0027ll post everything. It\u0027ll be like you\u0027re on the set of a movie as its being made. Once a month I\u0027ll host a Q\u0026amp;A sesh, where you can ask about this or any other writing issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the top tier, you get all that, PLUS you can be a character, or gift that role to somebody else. If you\u0027re brave enough, you can even write yourself into a scene. A guest starring gig on the page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what about the story? You haven\u0027t told us anything about that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGosh darn, you\u0027re right. So lets do that now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn two years, when this is done, we\u0027ll have four long novels. Sagas that tell of an ending to this world and the start of something new. With four books, a natural form of structure suggests itself. Four seasons. Or maybe the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. War, plague, famine and\u2014here\u0027s a tweak\u2014storm, instead of pestilence. Each element given their own season, and their own novel, but all pushing a greater narrative forward through the stories of a dozen or so central characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/124715/2799319-Post-Apocalypse-New-York-City-Widescreen-Wallpaper.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI said before that I like destroying the world, and this is how I\u0027ll do it, hammering on the fracture lines and points of critical failure which are already very obvious and all too real in our world. Korea. The Middle East. Climate change and the pressure it puts on food supplies. The hypercomplex and surprisingly fragile infrastructure, especially digital, of the developed world. Our vulnerability to pandemics. The return of toxic nationalism. There\u0027s quite the hell stew waiting for somebody to turn up the heat and give it a bit of a stir.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut stories are not just a bunch of things that happened. They are the adventures, the failures and triumphs of those who live through it all. I have my own ideas for an ensemble cast of characters to tell this story. Heroes and villains great and small, the cowardly and the brave, leaders, followers, champions and spear carriers (second from the left, in the back row, trying not to be noticed).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3922090b163396f9ea35aff2fb9ff530?width=1024\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut maybe you do too. If so, sign up and lets get going. I\u0027d love to hear from you. There is a world to destroy and to make anew together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
