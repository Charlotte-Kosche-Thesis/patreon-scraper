By day I am a product guide for mountainering gear, by night I am a nerd and on my day\u0027s off I am in the mountains.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eGive me money so I can buy paint and go paint mountains more/and apparently try to afford canvas prints haha. Create a blog or small description/journal entry with every hike that I do in accordance with the painting that I create?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is after Matt or someone helps me make a video about my hikes; like a good intro video for people to see. Main theme will be painting mountains and getting outside and EXPLORING MORE. Make the main theme Exploring, and getting outside to respect the natural environment/ mother nature that we live in. Most people don\u0027t ever see the beautiful world we live in, so me and other artists are trying to bring it to you, so you can go to it. (this was good)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGive them a reward for being a patron. how bout trail guides to each peak or place I go to? A detailed description of the hike. Or, for becoming a patron I will send you a small print of whatever piece you like. Or, I will take recomendations and commissions to go paint certain peaks or views that you want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end, or halfway through or whatever the fuck deffinetly thank them for supporting you and viewing your page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"As with any project, goals help not only with motivation but establishing what your end game is. And on Patreon, goals also allow your fans to help you by understanding what your needs are. Need new equipment? Say it. Looking to make this your full-time job? Be honest. Don\u0027t be afraid to post your real goals while asking for pledges.\""
