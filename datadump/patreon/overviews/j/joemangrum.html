    "summary": "The Patreon platform acts as a virtual tip-bucket. It allows fans of my work to make a monthly contribution while getting exclusive content not available on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will post a combination of images and/or video of each new sand painting I make throughout the month. If you pledge $1 or more you will be charged that amount for each painting I produce, which could be as many as 20 in any given month. You may also set a cap on your donation for any amount to make your monthly contribution fit your overall budget.\u00a0Your pledge is very important to me and will allow my work to grow in new directions and expanded mediums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date I have made over 1000 ephemeral sand paintings as public art in NYC solely supported by people like you. I feel it\u0027s important to share the experience of art  and  love what I do, making people smile in the process. People from the world over connecting around an artwork, before it is swept away at the end of each day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of their ephemeral nature, they are seen by a limited amount of people in person. On social media channels, I\u0027m connected to the world with over 50,000 followers. If you have been following my work for awhile you also see that wind can blow away the work, which in turn eliminates my ability to make a living for that particular day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have been following my work for awhile you can see that each day is different. Every sand painting is unique and I design them without a previous pattern in mind. On the spot. Sometimes the wind sweeps them away. If everyone chips in a little, it goes a long way in allowing me to expand the work beyond the street and to continue to share it with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/99769121\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have an ongoing photo archive that I post for everyone on social media for free. I use my iPhone and instagram for the typical square format pics you see. On Patreon, I will post special subscriber content, including videos, aerial pics taken with my go pro \u00a0and other sneak peeks into my process that will be exclusive to Patreon for a period of time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support for these creations will allow for an expansion in my art to take place. While I have so much fun making these ephemeral paintings, I have ways that I would like to make these designs a part of the world we live for years to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a list of goals you will be supporting:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaking canvas works in the studio.

     "about": "My paintings are a visual rebellion of the urban grid. It\u2019s my philosophy that we are all unknowingly and psychologically programed by this system, a dominating force that efficiently partitions the globe into quantifiable sections of space and time, divided by minutes and seconds. It is ultimately out of sync with the natural world, seasonal cycles and lunar tides. The result is a society divided from nature and compartmentalized into definable groups, disconnected physically, and spiritually from the whole. I work to reclaim these divisions by creating sand paintings, in organic shapes, interconnecting the fragments and acting as a catalyst for a synthesis, again. For me this is a vital process of affirming life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach painting  is spontaneously improvised, using colorful sand, poured directly from my hand. In the process of creation, I whisk a mash-up of visual cues, inspired by ancient traditions synced up with a rhythm of animation. In addition, these forms are mixed with an urban free-style and combined with bright \u201cPop Art\u201d colors, fractal variations and circuitry. My paintings are influenced by an abundant world of undersea creatures, carnivorous plants emanating electrical impulses, a living mathematical amalgam and botanical geometry stemming cross-cultural metaphors from many years of travels around the world.  Visually, I combine elements from contemporary art, culture and technology to find the common ground from which to communicate our collective interdependence, as we are moving into the 21st century. It is no accident that they mostly follow a circular form, though I do not describe them as mandalas. This would limit the multiple facets of inspiration from all over the world within the confines of an eastern terminology. My art is about interconnectivity and co-existence within the natural order of life, challenging politically, the existing order beliefs, in a run-away and materialistic global paradigm.\u003c/p\u003e",
