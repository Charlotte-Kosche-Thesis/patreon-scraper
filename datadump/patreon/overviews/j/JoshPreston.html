    "summary": "What\u0027s up everybody, if you\u0027re here, you\u0027ve probably been following me via YouTube (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLmaTnF_WIqEFwuw1INPauA)\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLmaTnF_WIqEFwuw1...\u003c/a\u003e) or Twitter (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JPrestonSports\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@JPrestonSports\u003c/a\u003e) and I just want to start by thanking everybody for the support you\u0027ve shown me to this point. From parents to coaches to strangers and especially the kids (they\u0027re the heart of this machine), I really do appreciate everybody that reaches out and lets me know the work I put into the channel doesn\u0027t go unnoticed, and I know it wouldn\u0027t be what it is without you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly love what I do and hope to do it for a long time but I also like to eat regularly (lol) so hopefully this is where you guys and Patreon come in. I know most of you are busy so I\u0027ll get to the point before giving more of my backstory for anyone that\u0027s interested. I\u0027m asking anyone with the means who supports what I\u0027m doing for our high school athletes in Louisiana to donate $1, $2, $5 or $10 a month to help me make this a viable business. As of now, I have over 700 subscribers on YouTube and over 2,800 followers on Twitter (THANK YOU) and if just a fraction are able to contribute the $1 or $2 monthly, that could really go a long way towards allowing me to keep this channel going and do even more in the future. I really wouldn\u0027t be able to thank you and I promise to make sure you keep getting your money\u0027s worth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/jprestonhs\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOne-Time Donations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for me, I started this channel in September of 2015 right after I was laid off at NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune. I started there as a part time worker in 2012 a few months after graduating from UNO (lucky me) and had been the full time reporter in the River Parishes for about a year before the layoffs throughout the company, which included essentially the entire high school staff. At that point, I had been making highlights for high school sports at NOLA for about 2 years and and YouTube gave me an avenue to keep pursuing that passion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout a month after the layoffs, a colleague and friend from NOLA, who was also laid off, caught on as the editor at the Daily Star in Hammond and hired me as the sports writer. I worked there from October 2015 to April 2017 but decided to leave so I could work towards making a path of my own. I wanted to do more videos on more kids in different areas and try to make more of an impact, but the only way I could do that was by leaving the Star, and thus, my main source of income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI knew what I was doing was risky but I\u0027m 26 and this is my chance to create something doing what I love to do that I think can really benefit the kids in our area. I was all of them at one point wondering if somebody was watching or if I was good enough to play on the next level. I got that chance at UNO when we built a team from nothing (shoutout to Andy Benoit and Carl Pilie) and those 3 years were the best time of my life. I want to give that same opportunity to kids today and let them know that somebody is watching and somebody cares. There\u0027s hundreds of thousands of schools across the country from Division I to NAIA and JUCO. I see no reason a kid with the skills, work ethic and grades shouldn\u0027t have a chance to play at the next level, and more importantly, receive a free education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you guys for all the support and I hope this gives you a better idea of who I am and what drives me to do what I do. As I said, I hope to do this for a long time but I also have to make a decent living for myself as we all do. If this fizzles out, just know I had a great time following these incredible athletes and coaches and I can assure you I won\u0027t be nearly as happy with whatever my next job is soooo *crosses fingers*\u003cbr\u003e"
