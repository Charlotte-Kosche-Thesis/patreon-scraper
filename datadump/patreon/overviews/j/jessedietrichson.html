    "summary": "Programming is what I want to do with my life. I began programming from a very young age, and once I started I couldn\u0027t stop. Most of what I know has been self taught. I\u0027ve spent countless hours over the years, reading every programming book I could get my hands on. I specialize in C#, C++ and Java, and I am always trying to learn more. I am continuing my programming career as a computer science major at Farmingdale State College.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved helping and teaching other people how to program and my goal in life is to become a professor; this is just one small step to reach my ultimate goal. I plan on releasing programming tutorials as shown on my YouTube channel. I make these videos because I enjoy teaching, and I love reading the positive feedback I have gotten so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I am just like any other college student, who is looking to make some money on the side. With my Patrons\u0027 support, making videos will be easier for me, and will continue to support my efforts. These videos do take a quite of bit of effort on my part, and I wish to make more in the future. I am constantly buying new books to further my education in programming, and many of the videos I make are based off of these books. I am supporting myself through college, and anything, even a small amount would help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e*** Note to all Patrons***\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my videos listed on Patreon are accessible for free on YouTube. By pledging you are supporting my efforts and I greatly appreciate every single one. I will post exclusive videos on here, that will not be public on YouTube. The amount of exclusive videos will be a work-in-progress; more will be available over time and based on how many patrons I have.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
