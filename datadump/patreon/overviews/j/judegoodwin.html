It\u2019s a brilliant line and it\u0027s because of lines like these that you and I need poetry, want poetry, crave poetry.

A story that fills each of us somewhere behind the ribs, or in the cave of our bellies, or the worm rings of our throats. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPoems are like that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI write poetry.\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd I can help you write poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for being my patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePOET BIO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJude Goodwin established herself as an accomplished poet during the early 2000\u2019s when the internet first began to form itself into a viable platform for emergent writers. She has won numerous nominations and placings in the popular Internet Board Poetry Competition, eventually earning 9th  position in their Poet of the Decade (2000-2010) listings. She has also been Featured Poet on Eclectica Magazine, one of the internet\u2019s most popular online journals. And recently, one of her poems was included in Eclectica\u2019s Best Poetry print anthology. Goodwin\u2019s poetry has been published in a variety of online and print magazines, and included in two other anthologies. Her entry in the CBC\u2019s Literary Awards has been shortlisted twice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past decade Goodwin founded the Squamish Writers Group and was a member of the board for many years, participating in workshops and performances during that time. She also founded and continues to co-administer The Waters Poetry Workshop, an online workshop that encourages new voices and gently nurtures their journey to proficiency. Goodwin is currently pursuing a career in Creative Writing with Douglas College, BC, Canada. She lives in the BC Lower Mainland with her wife, two stepkids, three daughters and 6 grandkids, where she is owner manager of a small publishing company, Goodwin Studios."
