The term \u201cmuckraker\u201d actually appeared later, initially\nin comments by President Teddy Roosevelt in a 1906 speech about journalism, when Roosevelt referred to a character in\nJohn Bunyan\u2019s \nPilgrim\u2019s Progress \nas \u201cthe Man with the MuckRake.\u201d Originally used as a pejorative, the public came to embrace the term, as well as the\nwork provided by these intrepid writers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nAlthough Roosevelt agreed with many of the charges made by muckrakers, he was also concerned that some of their methods\nmight be irresponsible, especially when employed to criticize some of his policies. His sentiments on their tactics\nmight be summed up best by this excerpt from that 1906 address: \u201cThere are, in the body politic, economic and social,\nmany and grave evils, and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them. There should be relentless exposure\nof an attack upon every evil man whether politician or businessman, every evil practice, whether in politics, in\nbusiness, or in social life. I hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker, every man who, on the platform, or in\nbook, magazine, or newspaper, with merciless severity makes such attack, provided always that he in his turn remembers\nthat the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.nepagazette.com/uploads/8/1/0/3/8103797/the-muckrakers-are-here-cartoon_1_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe names of the original muckrakers are iconic today in American journalism. \nLincoln Stiffens,\n\nNellie Bly,\n\nIda M. Tarbell,\n\nUpton Sinclair,\n\nJacob Riis \n. . . and the list goes on. \nRay Stannard Baker \npublished \u201cThe Right To Work\u201d in a 1903 \nMcClure\u2019s Magazine \narticle, an expos\u00e9 on the lives of non-striking mine workers, and mining conditions in general, focusing on the coal\nindustry right here in Northeastern Pennsylvania.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nBy 1910 the muckraking movement was waning in America. This can be attributed to the leveling off of competitive daily\nnewspapers between the years of 1910 and 1920, and the peaking of magazine publication in 1910. Many of the magazines\nhad also been purchased by corporate interests, including McClure\u2019s, that wished to soften the content that they were\nprinting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nMuckraker journalists also became splintered along political lines during the 1912 presidential campaign, some\nsupporting Wilson, some supporting Roosevelt, and others backing Socialist candidate Eugene V. Debs. The movement\nturned from investigating causes, social justice, corruption, and wrongdoings to political activism.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBy the time the United States entered World War I in 1917, the era of muckraking had virtually come to a close in\nprint, and the muckraking journalism and writings of Stiffens \u2014 typified by his description of Chicago and corruption\nin state politics in a 1903 article \u2014 and others had come to an end. \u201cThe police graft, the traffic of authority with\ncriminals, gamblers, prostitutes, liquor dealers, all sorts of thieves, and some sort of murderers. The evil in Chicago\nwas obvious, general, bold,\u201d wrote Stiffens in his stinging indictment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nIn the years to follow, true investigative journalism continued to decline, dropping to an all-time low in the 1950s.\nIt had become easier for the press to report on the investigative work of others instead of investigating matters\nthemselves. During the infamous \nTeapot Dome Scandal,\nit was widely reported that everyone involved was crooked, including the press. What eventually came to light was that\nthe publisher of \nThe Denver Post \nhad accepted a $1 million bribe to suppress information.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith the advent of McCarthyism and the Cold War, Edward R. Murrow began to breathe life into real muckraking,\ninvestigative journalism in the early 1960s. It did not reach its peak again until the late 1960s and early 1970s. His\ntelevision documentary \nHarvest of Shame,\nabout the tribulations of migrant farm workers, was a prime example of muckraking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nRalph Nader,\n\nSeymour Hersh,\n\nWoodward and Bernstein.\nThey all helped lead the way in the early 1970s. Time magazine was prompted to call 1974 the \u201cYear of the Muckrakers\u201d\nafter no fewer than four Pulitzer prizes were awarded that year for investigative journalism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nSo what has happened to authentic investigative journalism \u2014 muckraking \u2014 since its most recent heyday during the\n1970s? Is it merely a cycle that journalism and investigative reporting goes through? Has the influence of the\ncorporate dollar repressed how the news is reported? Is the rise of muckrakers once again imminent? We here at\nthe \nPeople\u0027s Independent Gazette \nbelieve that the time has indeed arrived, and are proud of our five-year history doing our best to report the facts as\nwe have been able to attain them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nSeymour Hersh, one of those Pulitzer Prize winners in the 1970s for his reporting on the M\u1ef9 Lai Massacre, has called\nthe current American press pathetic. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the solution, get rid of 90% of the editors that now exist and\nstart promoting editors that you can\u2019t control. . . . I saw it in the New York Times. . . . The republic\u2019s in trouble,\nwe lie about everything, lying has become the staple,\u201d said Hersh in an interview with UK media outlet\n\nThe Guardian.\nJournalist and Constitutional attorney Glenn Greenwald, outspoken critic of mainstream media, has accused his reporting\ncolleagues of failing to challenge those in political power and of discrediting anyone who dares to do so. In covering\nthe recent leaks concerning the NSA, Greenwald had this to say: \u201cWe knew in particular that one of our most formidable\nadversaries was not simply going to be the intelligence agencies on which we were reporting and who we were trying to\nexpose, but also their most loyal, devoted servants, who call themselves the United States and British\nmedia.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nRecent polls have certainly suggested (if they\u2019re to be trusted) that the public\u2019s faith in accurate news reporting is\nat an all-time low. The inability of mainstream media to gain the trust of the public is more apparent than ever.\nPerhaps the American people believe that the central role of a free and independent press \u2014 in a supposedly free\nsociety \u2014 is that of a government watchdog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.nepagazette.com/uploads/8/1/0/3/8103797/independent-gazette-5_1_orig.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe at the \nGazette \nhave taken that sentiment to heart. We have been at the forefront of investigating local corruption, nepotism, and\ncronyism. We were one of the first to report on the LAG Towing scandal. We exposed nepotism in our \u201cKings and Queens of\nWilkes-Barre\u201d article in our third issue. Covering GasGate, BaloneyGate, a local credit union debacle, and the plight\nof Christians in Syria (as conveyed by Syrian immigrants in Allentown) are other accomplishments we could champion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\nhave been a watchdog, not just of our politicians, but the media itself. We brought to light that a widely-reported\nAssociated Press poll on economic policy was nothing more than a survey of their business writers, and we are leading\nthe way on exposing the corruption taking place in our courts with exclusive coverage in our Custody for Cash\nseries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nWe will not bend to corporate advertising pressures. We do not regurgitate the news. Our stories and investigations are\noriginal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n \n\nSo that brings us to today. Just as corporate pressures brought an end to investigative journalism in the early 1900s,\nthe same insidious influence is now working to inhibit the fourth estate from being the watchdog, the protector of our\nfreedoms, the light that needs to shine on corruption, nepotism, and cronyism.\u003cbr\u003e\n \n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn my recent interview with the Bertelsmann Foundation, I pointed out that it is \u201cdamn near impossible\u201d to have a true\nand independent press. When you rely on corporate advertising, you are no longer truly independent, yet you need\nadvertising to pay the bills to stay in business. If you investigate the courts, you won\u0027t find many lawyers or judges\nsupporting your endeavors . . . look at medical malpractice and you won\u0027t see too many doctors advertising. Look at\nabuse by those in authority and you are universally hated, and, best of all, investigate corruption in politics, and\nyou never know what comes your way. This is human nature, and we are not going to change that: businesses tend to shy\naway from any controversy simply because they cannot afford to lose one customer, let alone an entire segment of their\ncustomer base.\u003cbr\u003e\n \n\n\u003cbr\u003ePresident Kennedy warned on April 27, 1961, in his address before the American Newspaper Publishers Association, that\n\"without debate, without criticism, no administration and no country can succeed \u2014 and no republic can survive. That\nour press was protected by the First Amendment ... to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers and our\nopportunities, to indicate our crises and our choices, to lead, to mold, educate, and sometimes even anger public\nopinion.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\"No republic can survive.\" Strong words by Kennedy then, and perhaps even more pertinent today in the era of fake news\nand commentary. We cannot allow the greatest nation on earth to fall prey to lies, deceit, and information based on\nagenda rather than truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n \n\nBe the difference and help us grow, marshaling investigative journalists whose only agenda will be to search out the\ntruth, and not afraid to anger, to educate, and to inform the public of our dangers and opportunities. A trusted news\nsource, no matter where the truth may lead us. That is our lofty aim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n \n\nPlease consider becoming a monthly supporter.
