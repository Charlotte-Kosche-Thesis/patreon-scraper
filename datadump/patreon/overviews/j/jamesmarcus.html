    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eStories Stories Stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI greatly enjoy writing, in many genres to include Fantasy/Sci-Fi, Erotica, Romance and Horror. Below are some excerpts of my stories. All of my current works are still in a very rough draft form and are in the process of being re-written.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIreland: (Fantasy)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBran O\u2019Brian crouched among the hedge-groves, his dagger drawn as a man approached his position. Bran could smell the stench of oil and urine before the man came into view. He crouched low holding his breath as the man drew closer. The man\u2019s armor clanked in the darkness as he went along his business. Bran\u2019s knees began to ache and his fingers grew numb from the cold, still he waited, silent and still as a stone. He knew his job and he performed it well. When the man was three paces past Bran\u2019s position he stalked forward matching the soldier\u2019s movements, hiding the sounds of his steps within the others. As soon as they came to a stop, and the man began to turn, Bran stood up from his position and with a quick stroke of his dagger ended his life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe quickly caught the body and drew it over the hedge, dumping it to the ground and adjusting the hedge to hide its passage. Saying a quick prayer over his enemy\u2019s corpse, Bran moved forward to the next sentry. With silent steps he crept up to the man\u2019s position. He was not as careful as the previous sentry, he was looking down the road, casually leaning against a tree as he cleaned a pipe with one hand and dug in his pocket with the other. A quick stab into the man\u2019s side as Bran covered his mouth was all it took. Bran lowered him to the ground, as he wondered if the man had any family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt did not take long for Bran to eliminate the other men he encountered. Once his task was completed he let out the call of a Woodlark. Slowly shadowy forms emerged from the misty woods. Men and animals, a troop of forty men passed him, the last of a group of a hundred Irish conscripts, ragged, tired and torn. They had been sent down with a much larger force of British soldiers to fight the French. The Army was routed and the English had failed to establish a foothold. Now Bran and this ragged band of survivors made their way east along the French coast hoping to find a way home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e            Thinking of home caused Bran to think of his family farm, of the wife and three small children he left behind when the British conscripted him to fight on this foreign shore. He had no idea why they were fighting, other than they were sent to attack the French. He was angry at the British for pulling him and his countrymen forcibly from their homes and families to fight and die in someone else\u2019s bloody war. Above all he just wanted to get them all home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot all of the men were Irish conscripts, some like Eric, his Captain, and Brans second Corporal Peter Bryan, were English Regulars, and then there was the Scottish highlanders, only three remained of the sixty that were brought; The MacDougall brothers: Artair the older, and Cailean the younger, and lastly Sionn a wispy fox like man who was the best scout Bran had ever met. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e      Sionn ran past Bran and with a nod of respect and took point as the band of survivors crossed the field and once again disappeared into the woodlands that dotted the countryside.  Bran shook his head as he took up the rear position, ensuring that everyone was accounted for and that there was no sign left behind of their travel. He never understood why the captain had made him Sergeant of the scouts. Or why the day scouts accepted his leadership so readily, he was not a soldier, he was simply a farmer and hunter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e      It was after the failed battle that he was elevated to his current rank. Bran and two other archers had found The Captain, along with the few surviving Sergeants, still fighting several French troops, they were struggling to hold their position and Eric was gravely wounded. Corporal Bryan wanted to move away from the struggle, using the skirmish to cover their escape. Bran did not agree, but had to follow his superior\u2019s orders. As the trio sunk past their commanding officer, the man behind Bran tripped over a corpse and fell into the skirmish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBran immediately stopped and made to help the man as Corporal Bryan continued on. As soon as the French soldiers saw the two, a few immediately broke off from the fight and headed their way. Bran unslung his bow and gave the fallen archer some cove fire, his first shot taking the French Sergeant in the eye. As his companion righted himself, the two filled the area with deadly fire. A few seconds later Corporal Bryan returned and added his arrows to the fray. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe French infantry were not ready to deal with the three archers and attempted to withdraw. The British Sergeants used the distraction to quickly finish the enemy in front of them. Later as they met up with more survivors and made the first nights camp, the corporal attempted to admonish Bran for disobeying him. It was Captain Eric that came to Brans rescue and much to everyone\u2019s surprise named Bran as the new scout Sergeant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e      The sound of the bodies of the dead sentries being carried into the woods by the MacDougall brothers brought bran back from his reflections. They were stripped of all valuables and gear and dumped, by the two scouts, a ways from the main path of travel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e      Once again Bran said a prayer over the departed men and their families, before continuing on with the group. He and Sionn continued to hop positions every time they encountered any areas that may reveal the survivors passage, the lead scout quietly eliminating any witnesses and evidence of their passage while the rear scout moved forward to take the point. He regretted every time he had to kill someone especially civilians, and at Eric\u2019s urging the group had to stop twice to allow innocent families to pass instead of quieting them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFateless: (Erotica)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMrellia took Adam\u0027s hand and led him from their table. As they headed across the room she wrapped her arms around Adam and started kissing him passionately. Molding herself to his body, the pair stumbled around the restaurant. A few patrons looked up at what appeared to be two lovers locked in a passionate embrace, some shook their heads and returned to their meals, others watched voyeuristically. The two continued to kiss and touch each other as they crossed the room. Adam lost in a sensual fog of ecstasy and desire, was completely unaware of what he was doing. By the time they approached the lady\u0027s table, he had lost complete control of his body to Mrellia. Adam had become an observer in his own body, but the feelings and hormones that coursed through his fogged mind overwhelmed any wish he may have had to stop what was happening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mother and daughter looked up in surprise as Adam came crashing down into the seat that was once occupied by the angry man. Mrellia dropped into Adam\u0027s lap and continued to passionately kiss him. Her fingers running through her hair as Adam\u0027s hands caressed her ass through the sundress she was now wearing. Slowly he began to pull the hem of her dress up, revealing the white panties she wore underneath. As his fingers began to slip under the elastic of her panties and caress the soft flesh of her ass, the mother finally broke from her shock and cleared her throat. \"Excuse me, do you two mind, my daughter and I are trying to enjoy our dinner,\" she stated angrily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMrellia broke her kiss from Adam, who continued to fondle her ass, his fingers sliding deeper into her panties looking for her treasures within. \"Oh, hello ladies, how are you this evening? Please don\u0027t mind us, it\u0027s been forever since we last saw each other and we are making up for lost time,\" Mrellia purred at them with a grin, \"Oh luv look, she has been crying, what is wrong dear?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mother looked at the pair in shock as Adam turned his head to them; his hands had not stopped their lecherous movements in Mrellia\u0027s panties, quite the opposite, his fingers had found the treasure they had sought and his middle finger was rubbing along Mrellia\u0027s slit, lubricating itself on her juices as he spoke. \"Hello, what\u0027s wrong? Why are you crying?\" He asked with mock sincerity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mother leaned close to Adam and Mrellia and whispered tensely, \"What\u0027s wrong, what\u0027s wrong, you two are what\u0027s wrong. My daughter and I are trying to enjoy our meal and the two of you are making out and all but fucking in my husband\u0027s seat,\" She growled under her breath.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMrellia laughed loudly and looked the mother in the eye. \"Was that your husband that just stormed out of here luv? I am sorry, I did not think he would need the seat any more. Besides...\" she whispered as she leaned in closer to the mother, \"You are enjoying watching us, you like watching. You desire it.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Mrellia whispered this, the mother backed off and blushed. She started to get even angrier, and tossed her napkin from her lap onto her plate. \"Well I never...\" she stammered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMrellia looked at the woman with a devilish grin and a twinkle in her eye, \"Not yet you haven\u0027t luv,\" She purred as Adam\u0027s middle finger slid from her pussy and began to slide into her ass. Slowly Adam slid his finger into Mrellia\u0027s ass down to the second knuckle. Mrellia moaned quietly into his chest as pleasure shot through her body. Adam slowly slid his finger out and then back in, gently finger fucking her ass. The mother and daughter watched with morbid fascination. As they watched, Adam took his other hand and pulled Mrellia\u0027s panties down exposing her ass and his finger sliding in and out of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mother could not help herself; she could not take her eyes off the sight of Adam\u0027s finger sliding in and out of Mrellia\u0027s ass. She hated it and loved it at the same time. Her attention was brought back to where she was by the loud gasp coming from behind her. She quickly turned around to see her daughter staring at the sight, her fingers covering her mouth, \"Oh my god honey, its ok, don\u0027t look,\" the mother stammered as she got out of her seat and went to her daughter, \"Come on honey, let\u0027s go. You do not need to see this.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe grabbed her daughter by her arm and tried to help her from her chair, but the teen did not move, she just stared at the scene in front of her. The mother looked around the room pleadingly, hoping someone would notice what was going on and help. There were no other patrons near them and the few who had a view of what was going on quickly went back to their meals as soon as she looked their way. She silently cursed her husband for asking for an isolated table. \"She likes watching too luv, it\u0027s no use denying it,\" Mrellia purred to the woman as Adam continued to finger her ass, \"Oh luv, that feels so good, harder, fuck my ass harder.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mother turned towards the couple again with the intent of yelling for them to stop. As soon as she saw them she was lost once again to the sight in front of her. Adam had slid two fingers into Mrellia\u0027s ass and was now pounding his fingers in and out of her as fast as he could. The two were once again kissing passionately as he did so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMrellia broke her kiss with Adam once again and turned her head towards the daughter, \"Why don\u0027t you come over here hun, so you can see better?\" she purred seductively in between gasps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe daughter slowly stood up from her chair and walked over to where the couple was lost in their embrace, dragging her chair along with her. Mrellia look over at the her as she sat down next to them, \"What\u0027s your name, sweetie?\" Mrellia asked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Ginger, my name is Ginger,\" The teen responded, as she continued to stare at the sight in front of her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
