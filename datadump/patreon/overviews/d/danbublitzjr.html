    "summary": "Hello, my name is Dan I\u0027m comedian, writer, actor, and podcast personality. I currently reside in South Dakota. I created and host the \"Art Of Bombing\", a weekly podcast and \"My Father\u0027s Records\", a biweekly podcast. In the \"Art of Bombing\" I talk with comedians of all levels from across the country in studio and over the phone about their worst shows and what they take from those shows to get better. \"My Father\u0027s Records\" is a music podcast about my father\u0027s record collection.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also wrote and performed a one man show called \"It Was Supposed To Be A Love Story\" which is a story about love, relationships, and growing as a person. I took my passion of storytelling, poetry, and stand-up comedy and combined it into one show. It\u0027s been filmed and currently in post production and scheduled to be released later this year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from my podcasts and my one man show I also perform all forms of live comedy from stand-up to Improv along with sketch both live \u0026amp; filmed. I help produce 3 comedy festivals in 3 different states and I produce a handful of live themed shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically I\u0027m an artist creating as much as I can to make the biggest impact I can on the world.\u003cbr\u003e"
