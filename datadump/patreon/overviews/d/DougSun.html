    "summary": "Thank you for your interest in my work! I\u0027ve been writing for roleplaying games since before the turn of the century. My first gig involved writing some supplemental material for Last Unicorn Games\u0027 legendary \u003cem\u003eDune\u003c/em\u003e roleplaying game that, sadly, never got published. Since then, I\u0027ve worked on Decipher\u0027s \"Star Trek\" and \u003cem\u003eThe Lord of the Rings\u003c/em\u003e roleplaying games, a whole lot of OGL D\u0026amp;D 3rd Edition books, and I was line developer for most of \u003cem\u003eThe Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game\u003c/em\u003e\u0027s third edition run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince late 2016, I\u0027ve been working on a series of short modules for use with Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons 5th Edition, called Places by the Way. They work as short stand-alone experiences, but each Places by the Way module is meant to be a kit for creating a memorable interlude in a larger campaign.\u00a0For info on products that we have published to date, check out the \u003ca href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/ramensandwichpress/home/ramen-sandwich-press\"\u003eRamen Sandwich website\u003c/a\u003e. Ramen Sandwich Press has a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ramensandwichpress/\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e for announcements and weird ramblings, and I sometimes post designer\u0027s notes to my personal blog, \u003ca href=\"http://www.douglassun.com/\"\u003e\"I Think We\u0027ve Been Playing It Wrong.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlaces by the Way has two inspirations. One is the line of mini-adventures that AEG published as part of the D\u0026amp;D 3rd Edition open license boom. I recall that the word count for those modules was only 5,000 words. I wrote a few of them, and they suggested to me that the short form could be made to work in adventure modules as it does in fiction. That is to say, if the typical folio-sized module is the novel, and the hardcover campaign books that WotC is publishing for 5th Edition are epics, there should be also be a place for the module equivalent of short stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other inspiration is the strangely important role that side quests play in what we now recognize as standard CRPG structure. Side quests are those little tasks that you can find throughout the game world, and while they have no direct bearing on the main story, they allow you to accumulate XP, money and items, and meet memorable NPCs. If they\u2019re done well they can add real flavor to the game experience. \u003cem\u003eFallout\u003c/em\u003e remains one of my very favorite CRPGs. One of the first things that jumps back into my mind is Tandi, the Shady Sands girl voiced so perfectly by Cree Summer. Her wistful musing about what lies beyond her little village convey the fallen melancholy of that world so beautifully that it made me forget all about finding that water filter. My goal for Places by the Way is that somewhere in the series, I will create an NPC encounter that has an effect like that. I want to help you create a moment in a campaign that\u0027s memorable out of proportion to its role as a diversion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlaces by the Way modules average about 10,000 words and 15 numbered locations. Each location offers an encounter, noteworthy items, noteworthy NPCs or an opening into which you can hook your existing campaign. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRamen Sandwich Press published Places by the Way #1: \u003cem\u003eThe Village of Darkharrow\u003c/em\u003e in March 2017. Everything that has happened since then convinces me that I can keep the series going for a while, publishing modules at a rate of four per year, maybe even five. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m giving you the chance to subscribe to Places by the Way and help me make it so. When you begin your subscription, you\u0027ll get a copy of the most recent Places by the Way module (the setting-neutral, OGL version, not the Forgotten Realms version) and as long as you keep up your monthly payments, you\u0027ll get a copy of every new OGL module as it is published. No need to keep up with announcements or continually check the Ramen Sandwich Press website or FB page, or the Hype Machine board on RPG.net; you\u0027ll automatically get a copy delivered to you. It\u0027s as easy as that. We\u0027ll do the remembering for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I\u0027ll stay on the lookout for freebies that I can toss your way to add value and exclusivity to your subscription. Maybe a free copy of something relevant that I\u0027ve written, accessories for the modules.... I can\u0027t commit to anything in particular, because I don\u0027t know what these extra bennies will be, exactly. But I\u0027ll think of something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomething else that occurs to me: Since you\u0027ll be able to comment on my posts, I can turn to you \u00a0if I need advice \u2014 let\u0027s say I have a decision to make while I\u0027m writing a module and I want to know what the audience would prefer. I\u0027ll just post here and ask you. Or, how about this: I\u0027m not that great with names, to be honest. So maybe I should ask you, my community of readers, to suggest NPC names.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I wind this up, I should make it clear: If you\u0027re already following Places by the Way, you probably know that I also hit up Kickstarter regularly to help cover art and production costs. And you know that I offer our Kickstarter backers a special \"Limited Edition\" of each module, one that contains an extra Easter Egg of content that won\u0027t be published anywhere else. This is \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e the version that you\u0027ll be getting. You\u0027ll be getting the same version that\u0027s on sale to the general public.... Yeah, I know.... It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t love you guys for supporting my work. But I made a promise to my Kickstarter backers that that extra content would be theirs and theirs alone. I need to stand by it.\u003cbr\u003e"
