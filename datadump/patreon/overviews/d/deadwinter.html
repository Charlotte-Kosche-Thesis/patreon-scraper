    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e=== UPDATE\u00a0(2017/3/24)-- We have two game demos available for all patrons, as a thank-you for your patience with us in February.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/8556641\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/8556641\u003c/a\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e=== A four-player one-level game demo with new player abilities, our musical puzzle side-game and a music soundtrack for you to enjoy. \u00a0Thanks for supporting our work!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Allison Shabet. I\u0027ve been making comics on the web since 2007: I write a comic called Dead Winter, a story about the collapse and reconstruction of civilization as we know it and the often-poetic adventures of four companions trying to tie their personal loose ends before they too are lost to the crucible of change. \u00a0You can read the entire story to date for free online at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.deadwinter.cc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.deadwinter.cc\u003c/a\u003e. I am expanding my body of work into video games as well. I\u0027m classically trained in oils and watermedia and have long incorporated animation into the sequential medium of comics, but I\u0027m always learning something new.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Dead Winter video game is planned to be a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one to four players with network play enabled- it\u0027s being designed so folks who aren\u0027t familiar with the comic can play it all the same, but those who are will find layers of extra meaning to everything they see. Made in the spirit of the old Arcade classics like the Simpsons, Ninja Turtles, X-Men and Sunsetriders, it will feature four player-characters, each with unique strengths and abilities, but what sets it apart is missions will be procedurally-generated: A mission can be one stage or many, depending on whether you want to play quick on your lunch break or wage an all-night campaign with your friends. \u00a0With various environments and a number of themed enemy factions, each mission will be randomly generated within a set of rules to create a new experience every time while adhering to the classic Arcade formula. There will be seed data so missions can be shared and ghost data so you can beat a friend\u0027s time or performance. Having randomly-generated missions will also enable an Endless Endurance mode, all of which is in both three-life and one-life Hardcore modes to suit every taste!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of programmer and musician Jason Klug we\u0027re on our way to making it a reality, but with the support of our Patrons we\u0027ll be able to devote more time and effort into our creative pursuits and bring them to fruition the sooner and the better! \u00a0We have a number of incentives planned for Patrons, including art journals detailing the thought processes behind our comics and a developer\u0027s log to flesh out and chronicle the development of the game. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re extremely capable in our combined talents and we have years dedicated to the content already, now is just the big push into the future! We\u0027d love for you to join us on an exciting new part of our creative journey."
