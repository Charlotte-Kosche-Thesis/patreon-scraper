    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI\u0027ve been a video game fanatic my whole life, starting at the age of 5 with a Nintendo Entertainment System. Growing up, I knew I wanted to have my career involve video games in some format. I started writing and reading at such a young age, and eventually I fell in love with Nintendo Power Magazine. Each month my childlike gaze remained frozen on pages of Nintendo Power. Eventually I decided I wanted to write for Nintendo Power and began pursuing a career in games journalism. $50,000 in student loans\u00a0later, I ended up with a wealth of experience and an actual Journalism degree! Sadly, moving to California or Redmond to hound various companies wasn\u0027t an option as the recession hit and I began a non-Journalism job which allowed me food and shelter (and games!) but felt emotionally unrewarding.\u003c/div\u003eIn the year 20XX, er....2012,\u00a0I attended\u00a0Magfest and listening to Derek Alexander (a.k.a. The Happy Video Game Nerd) give a workshop on content creation for aspiring video game Youtubers, I got to thinking: \"Why can\u0027t I do that? There\u0027s nothing stopping me. Let\u0027s do it!\" Thus, my video game review show, \"Dude, You Haven\u0027t Played This Game?!\" or (DYHPTG) was born!\u003cbr\u003eThe show started out rocky.\u00a0It was tough to find my own voice amongst a sea of internet\u00a0game reviewers.\u00a0But with each episode I\u00a0continue to learn\u00a0a little more about my message, my delivery, my skills and how I\u00a0craft. Along the way, I\u0027ve been seeing more and more success.\u00a0The show has been featured on RetrowareTV.com\u0027s User Submission of the Week, is a consistent featured user content video on that site as well\u00a0and has also been picked up as a main show on Gamester81.com. I\u0027m especially proud of the work I\u0027ve done and will continue to work hard to deliver content that will entertain and inform my fans. The reason why I wanted to begin a Patreon is to not only treat it as a general tip jar, but to also expand projects and pay people for the work that they\u0027ve done in helping the show become a success. There are remixers that are on most episodes that do work for free that shouldn\u0027t have to...I have a special effects person who helps me with my intros and special effects I don\u0027t know\u00a0how to do or don\u0027t have the programs to do them without spending a large amount of money. I have friends help out with acting, including my fianc\u00e9.\u00a0All of this is done FOR FREE, and WITHOUT ADS, FOR YOU. I\u0027d like to give back to them, as well as the community with some fun rewards that\u00a0will be\u00a0enjoyed by\u00a0those who donate.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eNow, here\u0027s where you, the Patron, the fan, come in. \u003cbr\u003eThe show is becoming more and more expensive to produce. Costumes, props, lighting, game footage capturing are all avenues that need revenue. I would love to have more intricate skits and gags that require more special effects than I\u0027ve been doing. I want to be able to pay my music remixers and friends/contributors for their hard work and effort on the show. I refuse to monetize the show. The only time ads appear on the channel is if I somehow get dinged for copyright on music. At this time, the money from my job has been funding my show, but it\u0027s getting too expensive and the quality is in need of improvement. With your continued support as a Patron, it would help me bring the show to the next level.\u003cbr\u003eI really appreciate each and every one of you so much for checking out my channel. I want to stress that NO EPISODES ON THE CHANNEL WILL BE CONSIDERED A FORCED PAY VIEW. Meaning, you will NEVER have to pay to watch me. Everything will continue to be free. This is more like a tip jar. If you like the work I do, and want to contribute, it is entirely optional. If you decide to donate, you\u0027ll be allowing me to take advantage of literally living my dream: contributing to the video game industry and (possibly) earning some form of a living off of it. Thank you for your cooperation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT INVOLVING PIXELTUNES RADIO IN ANY WAY. NONE OF THE MONEY FROM THIS PATREON GOES TOWARDS PTR.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
