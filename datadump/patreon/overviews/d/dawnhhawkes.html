    "summary": "So here\u0027s the thing:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer. (From Norway)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write gay, paranormal, erotic romance novels and I\u0027ve already started my journey and have a handful of ebooks available \non Amazon and Siren-Bookstrand. I\u0027ve thought about getting a Patreon \npage for a long time now, if I should or shouldn\u0027t take that step. In \nthe end though, it has boiled down to this - I love what I do and my \nbiggest dream in this life is to one day be able to write full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I love playing with stereotypes and my favorite characters are the weird ones (especially if they\u0027re the good kind of weird). I also like pairing up my weirdest ones with the more restrained characters, because I do love that mix and no matter how restrained or proper a character may appear to be, the right guy will bring out so much more. If those same guys are shapeshifters, vampires or some other supernatural being, that opens up a world of possibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can probably imagine, writing a book takes a lot of work. It takes time and effort and dedication (not just because you have to give yourself fully to the story, but because of other stories that also want to be written \u003cstrong\u003eright now\u003c/strong\u003e). Needless to say, I have ideas that will keep me busy for years and more ideas keep coming. I also want to keep growing as an author and improve my worldbuilding skills to make my stories as alive as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a writer for some years now and it\u0027s been a bumpy ride. I had a publishing company go under on me, which was a huge blow and made my motivation drop, but I was still an author and I\u0027ve worked hard to get back in the game. That also include trying to have some of the books I had with that company republished. In the end this has pushed me to try my hand at selfpublishing, a new and scary chapter in my life, but with some help and encouragement, I know I can make this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully you will want to help me out and know that just the smallest amount means the world to me and will help keep me going as I pursue my goal in life, to be the author I aim to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to check out my blog \u003ca href=\"https://dawnhhawkes.wordpress.com/\"\u003ehttps://dawnhhawkes.wordpress.com/\u003c/a\u003e for more information, I also have a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dawnhhawkes\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e page and a \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/dawnhhawkes/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e page\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
