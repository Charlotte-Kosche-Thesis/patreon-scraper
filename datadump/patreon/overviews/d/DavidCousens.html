And where do you belong?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s an exciting fantasy-based tale, filled with adventure, mystery, conflict and a sense of humour. It\u0027s a story I\u0027ve wanted to tell for years now and I\u0027m finally making it, as a free webcomic for everyone. No limited time access or hiding parts of it behind a pay-wall. I want everyone to be able to go on this journey from the start right through to it\u0027s climax!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1482267/Falling-Poster-patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately it will take time to create it and I have bills to pay. Your donations, big or small will help me be able to spend as much time as away from client work and commissions which would otherwise make it impossible for me to work\u00a0on Falling, and bringing you compelling characters and a rich new world to explore. Even if you can donate just $1 a month to this, it will bring us that little bit closer to finishing this for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal through Patreon is to receive enough funding so I can produce my web/digital comic, \"Falling\" for everyone to read online for free. One day I intend to publish the books in print, but the online version will \u003cstrong\u003eremain available for free, forever\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1482267/falling-group-sketch-patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a\u00a0Patron on Patreon you will be helping me tell this story. You\u0027ll get first look of the content, insights into why I\u0027ve made certain decisions, get to see alternate versions of characters and plot points.
