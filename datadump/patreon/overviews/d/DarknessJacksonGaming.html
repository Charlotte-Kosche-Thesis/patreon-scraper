The idea of creating a YouTube channel whose proceeds are donated to charities and families in need gives me hope and drive, as I never want another family to experience the loss I am dealing with if I can do something about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney should never be a deciding factor in treating medical conditions. By supporting me, you\u0027re supporting the creation of funny, snarky, weird videos people will actually enjoy to watch, which, in turn, will raise money that goes straight to charity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou, specifically, will have a large role in deciding what charities to support, finding families in need, and helping to decide the next best content for my YouTube channel. You also will have my eternal gratitude. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want -- and my family needs -- my brother\u0027s name to stand for something positive, as the world has lost one if its best and greatest minds and humanitarians. I am simply trying to pick up the flag and carry it on the best I can."
