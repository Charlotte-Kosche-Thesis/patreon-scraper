    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eThe following is a list of three projects\nI would like to complete in 2018:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1) \u003cstrong\u003eA new memoir, called LADYPARTS\u003c/strong\u003e, a\nfollow-up to SHUTTERBABE, about rebuilding the self after a marital rupture\nwhile one\u2019s body parts, one after the other, break down;\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2) \u003cstrong\u003eA photo essay called SMILPh\u003c/strong\u003e\n(Single Mothers I\u2019d like to Photograph), which will combine environmental portraits of and interviews with single mothers with a Dress for Success model of providing my\nsubjects, who are often financially struggling, with free headshots for dating\nprofiles; \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n3) \u003cstrong\u003eA screenplay called TWO WEEKS IN NEPAL\u003c/strong\u003e, based on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.oprah.com/inspiration/deborah-copaken-how-one-woman-found-healing-in-the-himalayas\"\u003ethis published story\u003c/a\u003e that a producer friend would like to help me turn into an\nindependent film, once we have a written script.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor over three decades, I\u2019ve spent my professional life shining a light on what it means to be a woman in the world. To be\nobjectified, assaulted, and harassed (\u003ca href=\"https://www.deborahcopaken.com/#/shootingback/\"\u003emy early photo essays\u003c/a\u003e); to endure strife,\npoverty, and wars (\u003ca href=\"https://www.deborahcopaken.com/#/photojournalism/\"\u003emy years as a war photographer\u003c/a\u003e); to exist with a\nuterus in a male world (\u003ca href=\"https://www.deborahcopaken.com/#/books/\"\u003efour of my six published books\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.deborahcopaken.com/#/essaysjournalism/\"\u003enearly all of my journalism\u003c/a\u003e). I never set out to be an activist artist, but my professional life,\nlooking back on it, has made me one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy work sometimes takes many months\nto complete and is poorly remunerated. This summer, I wrote an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/my-marriage-was-over-why-couldnt-i-get-my-old-name-back/2017/09/28/622be980-a3d5-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html?utm_term=.9f45cd1c048f\"\u003eOp-Ed for the \u003cem\u003eWashington Post\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e uncovering how family courts\nare still forcing women to get their ex-spouse\u2019s notarized permission to revert back to\ntheir birth names. It took over a month of detailed legal research and writing and paid $200. My recent viral\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@dcopaken/sunday-night-like-so-many-other-women-i-created-a-metoo-post-65574472c33e\"\u003estory in Medium\u003c/a\u003e, about being booted off of Facebook for a #MeToo post, has been\nshared and viewed over 104,000 times and paid nothing. An upcoming story in \u003cem\u003eThe\nAtlantic\u003c/em\u003e, also about the subtle effects of #MeToo, will pay $450.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor those of you thinking, \u201cJust get\na job!\u201d, I have sent out over 500 cover letters, emails, and resumes since March to no avail. I\u2019m\noverqualified, I\u2019m told, or too old (\u201cnot a good fit\u201d is the preferred\neuphemism for the latter), plus it\u2019s no secret that newspapers and magazines\nare all struggling to stay afloat. The pilot adaptation of SHUTTERBABE I co-wrote with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339211/\"\u003ea well-respected TV writer\u003c/a\u003e for NBC and Eva Longoria\u0027s company, UnbeliEVAble,\u00a0sits unproduced, as TV executives, I\u0027m told, are wary of staking their reputations and company budgets on an expensive war show with a female protagonist. I just wrote\nanother TV pilot on spec, looking back at popular sitcom through feminist\neyes, for which I have high if cautiously rational hopes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThroughout history, artists of all stripes have\ndepended on donors and patrons to do their work.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/rwvUjAv6pxg\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/a\u003e, this new platform, has become a lifeline to many creators whose work I admire, such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer\"\u003eAmanda Palmer\u003c/a\u003e. So many of you have\nwritten kind missives after reading something I\u2019ve written or seeing photographs I\u0027ve shot, saying it moved you. That, to me, is the whole point of my work: to share the universal human struggle in a way that touches others.\nThank you so much for joining my community in further pursuit of these goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
