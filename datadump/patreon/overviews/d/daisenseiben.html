    "summary": "Hello! And welcome to my page. I\u0027m a part-time game creator, and it\u0027s my dream to make adult games for you fine people of the internet to enjoy. I hope you\u0027ll come along with me on this task, and we can all have a lot of fun along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is all this for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eQuite simply, this is for making adult video games, or H-games if you prefer. Your monthly donation will go towards supporting the development of these games and eventually getting them out onto digital distribution platforms. In return, you get early-access to the games themselves, documentation on them, special goodies, and creative input in many of the games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you only have one game?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo. We have a queue of games. To put simply, the game at the top of the queue gets priority development, with the other games being worked on as time allows. The \u0027as time allows\u0027 is the important part: being able to do this full-time would drastically speed development time for all games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/ef0d5e5d4481201562eed07ff3c86b7a/tumblr_nabzo2wx8j1rfq294o1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you have in development currently?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur current priority project is a fantasy-themed adult game titled Steam Princess. You can learn more about it by visiting the Steam Princess tumblr FAQ:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://daisenseiben.tumblr.com/steam+princess+general\"\u003ehttp://daisenseiben.tumblr.com/steam+princess+gene...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a rough concept of Steam Princess put together in RPG Maker XP. You can download it here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/xhqitiy3p0ppyx5/Steam%20Princess%20feb26-17%20pre-alpha.exe?dl=0\"\u003ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xhqitiy3p0ppyx5/Steam%20...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may need to RTP for XP to run the game if you don\u0027t already have it. You can find it here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/download/additional/run-time-packages\"\u003ehttp://www.rpgmakerweb.com/download/additional/run...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhew! In addition to Steam Princess, we also have a Halloween-themed adventure game tentatively called Witchy Project. As well, we have a puzzle-based dungeon-crawler, a match-three game, and an adult digital card game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith so many project currently up, we hope we can count on your support for developing these and getting them out to you guys sometime before the heat-death of the universe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, and I look forward to hearing from you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
