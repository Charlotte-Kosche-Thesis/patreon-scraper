    "summary": "Hi! My name is DeepWinter! I like to write quests, short stories, you name it! All of my work (Currently) is on Fiction.live, however I will do commissions and such for other people outside of that site.\u00a0 I have two quests right now on Fiction.live. My first quest being Boots: A Star Wars Story and the second being Halo: Believe! I\u0027ll give a brief synopsis of the two so you can get some idea of what I write. Oh, and I also interact heavily with my viewers so message me on here or on Fiction.live, you will always get a response! They (My readers) have a large degree of control over the story and, as a whole, have taken my quests in directions I would never have thought of. Without further adieu, here is a brief summary of my quests thus far!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoots: A Star Wars Story is the tale of a young Mandalorian by the name of Connor Straystar Cadera and his beginnings as a Scout trooper and beyond! Currently they\u0027re deployed (As voted by anons) on level 1313 of Coruscant, keeping the streets free of thugs and Rebel sympathizers. (It was my first quest, started out rough but you get to see my journey of improvement as a writer) I try to keep combat and the mental stresses of war realistic, so there are dark moments, tones, and scenes in this quest as well as my Halo one. So if you\u0027re looking for gritty combat, the rise and fall of heroes and villains alike then this is the quest for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnons aspire to become the next Mandalore and lead a crusade across the stars! BUT! Some seem interested in other paths. Bounty hunter, soldier of the Empire, you name it. The choice is all yours!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink: \u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/stories/Boots-A-Star-Wars-Story/BdkTLaQZeypEzoCEg/home\"\u003ehttps://fiction.live/stories/Boots-A-Star-Wars-St...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHalo: Believe: The Journey of Ava Stukov, born on Reach, her father part of the mysterious Project Orion. It takes place in 2548, about five years before the end of the Human-Covenant war. Her first deployment is Meridian, where she showed valor and courage the likes of which earned her a Bronze Star and a bump to Private First Class. Combat is gritty, realistic, and I have gotten a lot of props for my characters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnons aspire to become an ODST and then a Spartan IV! I hope to see us succeed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink: \u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/stories/Halo-Believe-nbsp-nbsp-br-/RfwKMCiNzqzn4JD9Q/home\"\u003ehttps://fiction.live/stories/Halo-Believe-nbsp-nbs...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy reading them as I do writing them!\u003cbr\u003e"
