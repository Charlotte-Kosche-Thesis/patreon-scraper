I want to continue making videos for as long as possible because I feel as though I have only started to touch the surface of what my message is - and that is how landscape photography can be so much more than taking nice images, it\u0027s a therapy, a discipline, that allows us recover from daily life, and grow emotionally at the same time as reaping the rewards of being in the great outdoors! - And this is where you can help! I am just setting up this Patreon page so that you can support my channel and allow me to continue creating the videos on YouTube that you have been watching and to grow the channel so that many others can hear this message too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be working on adding rewards for Patreon subscribers in the near future, which will be added to this page."
