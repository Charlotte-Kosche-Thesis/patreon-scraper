    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWELCOME TO DIGITAL BOUNDARIES\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for my visiting my Patreon page. I\u0027m DBFig, host of the Digital Boundaries YouTube and Twitch channel. I have a passion for video games, anime, and movies. My main goal is to create the best content I can and build a great community around it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExpect things like rants, reactions, reviews, top 5 lists, retrospectives, and even gaming challenge videos. I also really enjoy streaming, and interacting with everyone!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e WHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI did not come to Patreon lightly. There is so much I want to do with Digital Boundaries. Yet, finances have always been a constant battle. I feel that I\u2019ve done so much with what I could put together, but some of my followers (I called them Bounders) wanted to know how they could help me achieve my goals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSimply, I tell my Bounders that watching and sharing my content is all I need. I try my very best to save for new PC equipment for editing, traveling for events (not above sleeping in my car), and saving to give back to my supporters with giveaways. Yet, I\u0027ve had Bounders ask if they can help me out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, I decided to open a Patreon to give those Bounders the opportunity to help me save. Every single dime goes towards saving for new equipment, paying editing software, traveling, and overall doing what I can to improve what I do content wise for everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI have a vision of what Digital Boundaries can become. It\u2019s a grand vision, but I have a plan and want to take my first steps toward that plan. I\u2019m truly humbled if you support what I do on this platform. I just promise to do my very best, make content that we both can enjoy, and hopefully make a positive impact. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, for being awesome!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
