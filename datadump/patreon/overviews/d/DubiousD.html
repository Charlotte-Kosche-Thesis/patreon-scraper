I used to make enough off of adsense to justify the time I put in, but with a drop in activity and increasing production necessities (game costs, tech restrictions etc) I haven\u0027t been able to realistically maintain that standard as often as me or my audience would like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to help out, I can\u0027t thank you enough. If not, I completely understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes me different than any other budding Creator?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll never hold myself above you as channel creator. Everyone in the community has a voice, and I make myself present and available to as many people as I can. If I see anyone being beaten down by others in comments, I\u0027ll jump in myself to sort the situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSince when do small channels get to make patreons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell,if you think about it,the smaller channels need this more to cover production costs and life costs. We can\u0027t rely off of the pittance shared through YouTube ads, where as bigger creators can make as much as $4k on individual videos. It\u0027s kinda like buying from an independent grocer. Sure the apples are smelly, but they\u0027re smelly in an earnest way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA dollar will get you a read shout out at the end of core produced videos (anything not an update or a let\u0027s play) and for the non-core-produced videos your name will be included an end video text crawl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the commissions, $5 will get you a custom sketch, either scanned and sent or drawn digitally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$10 will get you a custom piece of art, fully lined with either flat or gradient colours, depending on what suits best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$15 will get you a fully shaded drawing, with full linework as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll commissions are custom within reason, limited to one subject or character, and minimal to no backgrounds (wish I could draw backgrounds, I could add another tier onto this lmao)"
