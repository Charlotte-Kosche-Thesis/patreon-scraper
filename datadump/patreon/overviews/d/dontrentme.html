We have huge plans and every bit of support we receive from our community goes a long way to keeping us doing our vital work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur intention since day once has been to create a better and fairer experience for tenants from all over Australia. We started this by creating the DontRentMe.com website - which features thousands of reviews - giving tenants all over Australia a strong and loud voice, and has been featured many times in all news formats of nationalised media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve also now been busy creating investigative videos (or documentaries) which raise awareness of the plight and issues that our tenants face, as well as going a long way to educating tenants about what they can do if they are faced with similar circumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur videos have also helped the tenants involved to be able to have the issues fixed and/or be moved in to more appropriate accommodation - as the reputation damage to the agencies and government departments involved are often too much to bare!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComing soon you\u0027ll see even more fantastic work from us. Not only will we keep doing all that we do now, but we will be focused on creating services that are designed to empower tenants with new, innovative ways of ensuring their rights are observed by law - and most importantly - are accessible to all tenants of Australia.\u003cbr\u003e"
