    "summary": "I\u0027m Dale Cameron Lowry. I\u0027m a fiction writer and former journalist with several pen names. I started out publishing literary fiction and poetry before Google\u00a0was a twinkle in some developer\u0027s eye,\u00a0but today my preferred genres are romance and speculative fiction. Still, I\u0027m not too picky and hope to eventually dabble in them all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOver the decades, I\u0027ve learned a lot about the writing business. I share some of what I\u0027ve learned on my blog for writers at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dalecameronlowry.com/category/for-writers/\"\u003ewww.dalecameronlowry.com/for-writers\u003c/a\u003e. I love writing short stories and\u00a0 often search out new markets for my work; last year I decided to help others out by posting my findings on my\u00a0blog. Because\u00a0writers need money to live, I only post submission calls that pay. I also vet calls to ensure that the publications are open to diverse writers and characters, including those in the LGBTQ+ community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile I enjoy giving back to the writing community, the blog and associated newsletter do\u00a0take time away from the parts of my writing career that earn money. So I decided to use Patreon as a way to make my blogging more sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you sign up as a patron for as little as $1/month, you get the satisfaction of supporting my writers\u0027 blog and thus helping other writers out. But you also get \u003cstrong\u003ecool bonuses that can help your writing career\u003c/strong\u003e. Check them out under \"Rewards\" on this page.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll become a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://dalecameronlowry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calum-macaulay-60673.jpg\" style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\" width=\"400\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbout the $1 reward level\u003c/h2\u003eI post submission calls here as I find them. They\u0027re visible to all patrons. I tag them to make them easier to sort, and I\u0027m working on improving the tagging system to make it even easier to focus on subscription calls relevant to your interests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAbout the $5 and $10 reward levels\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ve spent the past few years compiling a huge database of more than 200 review and promo sites that are enthusiastic about LGBT fiction. I\u0027ve probably spent a hundred hours on it, maybe more.\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eIt\u0027s not just a list of sites\u2014it\u0027s got contact info, rules for submitting, notes on how active the blog is, notes about whether the ones that call themselves LGBTQ are really LGBTQ or just MM, and a lot more. It can be filtered so that if you only want to see sites that take FF paranormal romance or bisexual literary novels etc etc, you can filter it that way.\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eYou can view the data as a spreadsheet, cards, or in other formats that I find confusing but you might find helpful.\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eNope, it\u0027s not a Google sheet. Multiple people can access it at the same time and they won\u0027t mess up each other\u0027s views or searches.\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eYou can save a personal copy of your filtered search so you can add your own notes about who you\u0027ve contacted/submitted to, whose reviewed, links to reviews, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eIf you want to use the list for a specific book release and don\u0027t want to support my Patreon on an ongoing basis, you can join for the month and then drop me like a hot potato. I don\u0027t care.\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eIf you\u0027re a virtual assistant or even a blog tour business and you want to use it, I\u0027m fine with that. Obviously I wouldn\u0027t want you to replicate the whole thing and present it as your own, but if you use it the way it was intended and it helps you serve your clients better, that\u0027s kumbaya with me!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"

I\u0027m a perfectly ordinary, paradigm-toppling queer. I\u0027m a careful writer and a clumsy speaker. I\u0027m a proud manifester of my family\u0027s genetic tendency toward OCD. I have an inordinate fondness for mantras, inappropriate counting, and pathological recycling. I\u0027ve studied a dozen languages and am terrified to speak most of them. I come across as snooty at times, but that\u0027s just my utter lack of social skills shining through. Also, I am a migraineur. I wish this wasn\u0027t an important thing about me, but it really is.",
