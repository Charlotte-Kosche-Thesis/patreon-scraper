All of this stuff is awesome and fun to do but boy howdy, nothing beats comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The problem is, comics is one of the most time consuming and least paying jobs in terms of my income, so I\u0027m hoping that some of you would be willing to help fund (and help me justify) comic makery.\u003cbr\u003e You might have read some of my work before, I did those \u0027Jupiter\u0027 books about a mexican wrestler turned private detective amongst some other fun stuff, like \u00a0the shoe gazing, penis featuring diary comic \u0027Have a Go Hero\u0027 which ran online from 2010 to 2013.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, my plans are to keep publishing mini comics online as well as larger small press books and a sexy collection for Jupiter 1-3 with recoloured art for the first two issues and a load of bonus content including sketches, guest pin ups and an essay on the history of lucha libre.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e Thank you for taking the time to come look at this stuff and super extra mega thanks to anyone who can spare a few shekels to support me.\u003cbr\u003e"
