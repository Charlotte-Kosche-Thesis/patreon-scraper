Tier based.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eMy mission:\u003c/h1\u003e\n\nI am 100% dedicated\nto making art my life career. When the lot of us are old and crispy, I want you\nto be able to type my name into your computer and watch my weekly streams, see\nmy progress and my creations. I fully intend to continue with digital art until\nthe day of my death. I thrive off being able to sit down at the end of the night\nand release my inner being. It not only brings me happiness but brings me joy\nas well to see that others enjoy what I put out as well!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe all have lives, struggles, and daily dilemmas. I can only\nhope that I may share the goodness I see out of each day, and to bring the\nlight (as well as the dark in ourselves out of the shadows for everyone to\nenjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI would like to consider myself a well-rounded artist, I got\nmy start by the time I could walk. Throughout the years I have dabbled into\nmany forms of expression. Such as Fabrication, sewing, crocheting, knitting,\npainting, construction, traditional forms of art, and most recently; digital\nart. Which has become my main source of self-expression. My dream is to one day\nbe able to pay my rent with my art and worry less about if 40 hours a week will\neven pay the bills. I want to feel like I can make living enjoyable with hard\nwork and determination, while doing something I love. My focus every day when I\nsit down to do art is to get better and better. I can\u2019t help myself!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few things I enjoy\ndoing with digital art\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cbr\u003e-Creating characters. Either from your ideas or\nmy own.\u003cbr\u003e-Line art.\u003cbr\u003e-Dark themed art such as gore, intense scenes,\nfantasy, medieval characters, wildlife, creepy creatures, blood-tits-and-fire\ntype art.\u003cbr\u003e-Nsfw pieces.\u003cbr\u003e-Fan art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aesthetic:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHumor, grunge, heavy line art, geomancy, smoke,\nwaves, classy vintage, pin up, stoner, dark fantasy, medieval, knights in armor,\ntwisted roots, wicca, dirty earth creatures, psychedelic, dungeons and dragons,\nand anything else that is underground, old, vintage and grotesque! \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThough, I am always willing to\ntry new things. It always turns out to be a great chance to get to learn new\ntechniques and styles. And I like a challenge. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy personal guarantee: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI always put 100% into my art. I\ntake nothing (professionally) more serious. Every time I sit down to work I make\nsure to take my time and make it perfect. If I ever have any questions,\nconcerns, or changes, I make sure to ask. Better safe than sorry!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I would make sure to honor your\nrequests, I ask that you make sure to provide me with proper information on your\nvision. I don\u2019t mind it, but I don\u2019t enjoy going back on a finished piece to\nmake changes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy digital art\nprices: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNote: all prices are negotiable (within reason), as well as\nsubject to discount (granted by me via specific posts, holiday specials, etc.).\nI NEVER charge extra for NSFW.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach extra character costs an additional %50 of what the\nfirst character costs.

So sometimes I cannot respond daily, but I make it my\ntop priority to keep in touch with my customers whenever I can. Weekly updates\nand WIPS works best for me. Chatting in between is more than fine at any time, but\nplease do not get discouraged if I cannot respond right away.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n4.Please note that I in no way engage in accepting\ncommissions for: fecal matter art, child porn, serious hate art, or anything\nelse considered illegal.

I work by the code of honor since I know that\nthere are loop holes when it comes to the payment process.
