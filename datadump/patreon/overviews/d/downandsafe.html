Your hosts on this epic adventure through space, and yet more space, are Michael Damian Thomas (\u003cem\u003eUncanny\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eMagazine,\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eQueers Dig Time Lords\u003c/em\u003e), L.M. Myles (\u003cem\u003eVerity!\u003c/em\u003e podcast, \u003cem\u003eCompanion Piece\u003c/em\u003e), Amal El-Mohtar (\"The Truth About Owls,\"\u00a0\u003cem\u003eGoblin Fruit\u003c/em\u003e), and Scott Lynch (the \u003cem\u003eGentleman Bastard\u003c/em\u003e series).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of us are appallingly geeky and massive fans of many an SFF show. Michael, Liz, and Scott already love Blake\u0027s 7, but this is Amal\u0027s first time watching. (Spoiler: she likes it rather a lot.) We love making Down and Safe, and (as you can probably tell if you\u0027ve listened) have an awesome time recording it. We don\u0027t hold back on what we think, and we try to make a show that manages to be (occasionally) insightful, and as much fun to listen to as it is for us to make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to keep making Down and Safe on a regular biweekly schedule, and we\u0027re asking for your support to help cover our costs and the time it takes to record and edit our words into the, uh...tightly knit, totally on topic, no waffle show that you\u0027ve come to expect and tolerate. And with enough support, we\u0027ll be able to make extra episodes for even more podcasting goodness. So if you enjoy our show, please do consider supporting us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll our episodes are available for free at \u003ca href=\"http://downandsafe.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
