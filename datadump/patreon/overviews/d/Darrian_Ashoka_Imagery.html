    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey Peeps.  Thanks for making your way to my Patreon profile.\u00a0I have some big plans and I\u0027m asking you to be a part of it. Are you tired of small low quality blurry glam shots? Me too. I tried BentBox, but that was a total crap shoot of mostly\u00a0lame photos. I complained to their management about it, but there seems to be nothing they can or willing to do about this problem. It seems many \u0027professional photographers\u0027 still do not know how to use their expensive equipment and are wasting the potential of what they could have achieved to capture those priceless moments in time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve used photography to promote my custom copper work on-line for the last 2 decades, which has been very successful as a result to better than average photography to demonstrate my work to many out of State clientele. my business web sites \u003ca href=\"http://dmr-gutters.com/pro.htm\"\u003edmr-gutters.com\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"http://copper-by-design.com/pro.htm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecopper-by-design.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://copper-by-design.com/cc/cp/im/Cline130.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://copper-by-design.com/cc/cp/tn/Cline130.jpg\" style=\"width: 646px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough, it is far more interesting for me to capture sensual images of attractive women in the studio, and they eagerly seem to want to pose; to feel beautiful and sexy before it\u0027s too late. Your support would help to pursue this hobby more than I had been able, and I would love to be able to share the results with you to bring a little more joy to our otherwise bleak and depressing world. I am not looking to make $ off this, but it would be nice for this exposure to help offset the cost I spend pursuing this passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mind-temple.com/dai/17-IPS-Class220b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mind-temple.com/dai/17-IPS-Class220.jpg \" style=\"width: 648px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI capture these images with a top notch professional grade full frame extra high resolution DSLR, but more importantly is light my subjects in the field or in studio, which I see too many other \u0027Professional Photographers\u0027 are too lazy to do, which greatly sacrifices image quality. With the right lighting these images will look just as sharp and clear zoomed in at full resolution as they look reduced down to screen size. They call their blurry\u00a0and grainy images an artistic element, which is just and excuse for lack of decent quality in poor lighting. I call crap on this notion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mind-temple.com/dai/AriannaKindsfather01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShallow focal depth is another quality detail they have to sacrifice with low light, which they claim is helping to draw the eye into the main subject. Yet, the human eye does not actually perceive the limitations of focal depth within our surroundings, as with the limitations of a camera, which requires a lot of high intensity light to solve for a higher aperture. I tend to shoot a f/9 or higher, where most shooters drop it below f/5. I often hear the excuse: I do not want to get the background in focus. Yet, they are not getting the whole model in focus. I have seen way too many head-shots with less than 1/2\" focal depth when shooting wide open like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mind-temple.com/dai/2016RCCC0800.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mind-temple.com/dai/2016RCCC0800.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have thousands of shots of cosplay artists, and painted breast from the Oregon Country Fair. I tend to shoot video with my other DSLR on a tripod during photo shoots, so let me know if you\u0027d like to see those\u00a0as well, and offer feedback of what you\u0027d like to see here. I\u0027d love to hear from you even if you are not currently one of my Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mind-temple.com/dai/2015-OCF-191b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mind-temple.com/dai/2015-OCF-191.jpg\" style=\"width: 647px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

     "about": "I had modeled some in my early 30\u0027s, but it was too hard to make any sort of\u00a0living that way, so I needed to focus on building my sheet metal business instead: \u003ca href=\"http://copper-by-design.com/pro.htm\"\u003ehttp://copper-by-design.com/pro.htm\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe modeling world still intrigues me, even though I am no longer as good in front of the lens these days. I have loved photography since the early 80\u0027s; using film of course\u00a0with a Canon AE-1 and just a standard 50mm lens, which was terribly limiting. In 2000 I switched over\u00a0to digital photography and have not wanted to\u00a0return to film since, even thought the resolution was not yet comparable to film. It was barely good enough to use for the promotion of my work on my business web site back then, but quickly made leaps and bounds to a 12 meg sensor in 2005. I have an old\u00a0Nikon D1 still in working condition, which\u00a0has a low resolution of just a\u00a02.77 meg sensor. For the last few years I shoot with a Nikon D810 with it\u0027s 36 meg images, and what a difference that makes.\u00a0I have a set of portable studio lights with battery packs, so I can shoot any where I want these days to achieve top quality images that can now surpass 35mm film.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still make a good living with my sheet metal business, so I do not worry about trying to make $ with photography. I\u0027d rather keep photography a fun passion of mine. Not a high pressure job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see over 8,000 of my full resolution images I post to my DA profile: \u003ca href=\"http://darrianashoka.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttp://darrianashoka.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e",

     "description": "I have a substantial collection of still images that I\u0027ve captured with professional grade camera and lighting equipment, and I continue to schedule new shoots as time permits; between running a sheet metal shop and being a hands-on Gutter Contractor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to get into doing more video work with better lighting and more professional post editing work, which is very time consuming. A 100% of these funds will be going towards the cost of equipment and paying models with studio rental fees. I am not trying to supplement my income from this. This is just a little help to follow my passion, and share this with those who would appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e",
