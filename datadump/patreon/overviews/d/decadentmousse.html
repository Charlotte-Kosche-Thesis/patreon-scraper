I have so much fun working with yarn, and I want more than anything to share that with people! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently I\u0027ve also developed a passion for drawing and painting, and would like to pursue that further as well. \u00a0I currently have an Etsy store for my knitted and crocheted items, and a Redbubble, Society6, and Zazzle store for my art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney I receive from patrons here will go towards general life needs and, hopefully when my financial situation levels out a little, more art supplies and the like. \u00a0I\u0027m a self-employed transcriptionist and while I work hard, I don\u0027t always have a steady or consistent flow of income from that. \u00a0Any little bit would really go a long way towards helping balance that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf supporting me on Patreon isn\u0027t an option, for whatever reason (believe me, I completely understand it\u0027s not feasible for everyone), I also have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://Ko-fi.com/decadentmousse\"\u003eko-fi\u003c/a\u003e!"
