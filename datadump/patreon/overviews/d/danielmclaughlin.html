Thanks for checking out my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nI fell in love with music at an earlier age, and have been at it ever since. I played piano as a child, but moved into guitar when I was about 11. Recorded music has always been something I\u0027ve been fascinated with, I remember being amazed by the fact that in Garageband, you could drag little boxes onto the screen and make what sounds like a real song. I wanted to learn more, and I started figuring out how to set up microphones, and what signal processing does, and a whole lot else that I won\u0027t bore you with. I am currently a student at USC Thornton School of Music. I am interested in building a portfolio of recorded music regarding audio clips that people could freely use in their own personal works, such as short films or documentaries, introductory music, TV show cues, and other areas of media. I really like being let know that someone is using my work. If people really think that my songs provided a great service to them, please consider becoming a patron so that I can continue to create. Also, if you are interested in custom and original music for any kind of media, please message me and we can discuss more!\u003cbr\u003e"
