When not traveling, I teach private lessons, provide tutorial videos as well as lead live jam sessions to help YOU play music too. I love to teach music (my heart\u2019s delight) and theory in fun and colorful ways.

I need to invest in new recording equipment and intend to collaborate with other professionals to assist in creative ideas. I am currently collaborating with the Ukes for Schools nonprofit on a free online music curriculum giving teachers material to teach ukulele in the classroom anywhere in the world!

Ella Fitzgerald and Tony Bennet first carried me away, and, after exploring this complex world of music, I know that jazz is not \u201cjust\u201d for elite musicians. It\u2019s for you!

If it\u0027s got a swingin\u0027 groove, I\u0027m there! As I have traveled to festivals and music events throughout our country, I have learned that my musical tastes are far-reaching. I like to put a little mustard on it with the 1920\u2019s Cabaret/ Speakeasy tunes, croon it out with Frankie \u0026amp; Ella, and get groovy with the Boss Nova tunes of the free-lovin\u2019 60\u2019s. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor your generous contribution, you will have a backstage pass to the perks listed to the right.
