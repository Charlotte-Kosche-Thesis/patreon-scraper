    "summary": "Greetings All! Thank you for visiting my Patreon Page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince November 2015, I\u0027ve been facilitating communal\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sexologistvixenne.com/orgasmic-yoga-class-description/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOrgasmic Yoga\u003c/a\u003e circles monthly. OYoga is an embodiment practice where breath, movement, sound, touch, placement of attention, and setting of intentions is woven into self-pleasuring practices. This edgy communal erotic practice was introduced to me in my training to become a sexological bodyworker. Orgasmic Yoga is less about doing specific poses, or even having orgasms, and more about exploring, honoring your desires in the moment, taking the scenic route in discovering sensations and arousal, and adding to the erotic menu. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFolks of a range of ages (18+), abilities, expressions, orientations, genders, and backgrounds have attended my circles and many have reconnected with their bodies, been able to practice mindfulness and presence in their pleasure, witness others\u0027 processes and be seen in their own. It\u0027s not for everyone, but I truly believe that the core elements (breath, movement, sound, touch, intentions, slowing down) can be incorporated by anyone into solo and partnered interactions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started in the field of sexuality, I had no idea where it would take me. If I consider my journey to have started during my time as an undergrad with a minor in human sexuality (though I was certainly on the path in some ways prior to this), I\u0027ve been working around sexuality, sex positivity, kink, gender, and body image for over 8 years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that time, I went to grad school, got a doctorate in human sexuality (DHS) and became a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sexologicalbodyworkers.org/practitioners/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecertified sexological bodyworker\u003c/a\u003e (CSB) which has allowed me to work with clients to overcome sexual concerns and to get more into their bodies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also started blogging in 2012 with my focus being around self pleasure, body acceptance, and alternative sexuality.\u00a0My writing has since moved on to include\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sexologistvixenne.com/review-index/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eadult product reviews\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sexologistvixenne.com/tag/articles/\"\u003einformational and reflective (vulnerable) posts\u003c/a\u003e about my own journey in relation to my sexuality, gender, and my body.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of writing, I have taught in-person classes on squirting/gushing, masturbation, and since late 2015, have facilitated consistent\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sexologistvixenne.com/orgasmic-yoga-class-description/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOrgasmic Yoga circles\u003c/a\u003e in Los Angeles (one or more a month), as well as a one-off in San Francisco, and a 3-evening mini-series in June of 2016 in Sacramento.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not writing or teaching on my own, I am representing the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://positivesexuality.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCenter for Positive Sexuality\u003c/a\u003e, a non-profit that addresses social issues through sex positive research and education, where I have been a volunteer educator since Spring \u002713 and a board member since February 2016. I\u0027ve sat on countless panels talking about BDSM, nonmonogamy, and sex work, putting a real face to these identities, busting myths, and educating students and professionals on these often misconstrued areas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I had to boil all of the work I do down to the tiniest nut shell, I would have to say I strive to give folks permission to be accepting of their bodies, their sexualities, and to explore and add to their erotic menu.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am on Patreon because it would mean the world to me to have your support! If you like my work and want to help me stay caffeinated, that\u0027d be awesome! If you really love what I do, let\u0027s dive into the nitty gritty around sex, kink, gender and exploring all these things! If you\u0027d like to be a piece in the puzzle of my content creation, I would love suggestions for potential blog posts, or videos!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease note that contributions are made monthly which means if you make a contribution at the end of the month, you will be charged again on the first of the month and every month following.
