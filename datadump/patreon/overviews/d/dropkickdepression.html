A fighter and survivor of depression, Calaway opened up publicly about her fight to her friends and fans. Since that day she has made it her mission to help those in need, those who feel that they are alone. Dropkick Depression is not only an online forum where anyone can reach out for advice and help, but helps raise funds for worthy non-profit organizations bringing awareness to depression and suicide prevention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the creation, Dropkick Depression has grown from a one woman operation to a full movement in the professional wrestling community and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are here. You are not alone. You have a voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u0027t do this without you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
