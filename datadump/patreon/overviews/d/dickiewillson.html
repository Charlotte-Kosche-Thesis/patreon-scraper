    "summary": "Hi. My name is Richard Michael Willson, and I\u0027m an illustrator and cartoonist from Toronto, Ontario. I\u0027m gonna hit you with a bit of a novel, and a little bit of truth. It\u0027s a bit of a ramble, so stick with me if you can. Thanks for reading, sit back and make yourself comfy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e This is brilliantly UNCREATIVE, but I have a VERY similar story to most creative people like me; I\u0027ve been drawing cartoons as long as I can remember, from sketches of Ninja Turtles and Wolverine on stacks of recycled reports and letterhead my Dad brought home from work, to doodling in the margins of homework during and after class, to attending (and dropping out of) one of Canada\u0027s best art schools. Honestly I never had a good attention span for school, but could draw for hours and hours without a break. It\u0027s all I\u0027ve ever wanted to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Now, Spring 2017; I could write you a sob story about how when I get home from work most days, I\u0027m in a completely un-creative mood. That mentally, I struggle to draw or paint anything that feels worthwhile. That I look at other people\u0027s work and feel a crippling feeling that \u0027ll never be as good as them. In fact, I just did...but I\u0027m trying. Over the past year, I\u0027ve expanded my experience. I tabled at my first convention. And my first art market (as From Planet Weird, with my artistic and life partner, Aline). I did a group painting show, and launched an Etsy page. They were learning experiences, but not wholly successful. So that\u0027s where you come in:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more Patreon support I get, the more it will help me become more independent. Your support will help pay for things like convention and market table fees, printing costs, materials like paint, paper and computer upgrades. The more I can earn this way, the more time I can focus on my art. It will also help to cover the costs to visit our family in Brazil, which are getting very expensive. With enough support, it may contribute to me doing illustration, cartoons and comics full time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what does it mean for you? Here\u0027s what you\u0027ll get, you lucky Rascal!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll post a bunch of my sketchbook and preliminary work for paintings, monthly or maybe weekly comics and painting videos (which MAY be embarrassing for me, and comedic, insightful, or both, for you). I will also try to do monthly prints, AND... commissioned drawings and paintings for certain Patreons! If you want a monthly watercolour painting of a piece of fruit, taco, cubano sandwich, or \u00a0an anthropomorphized rock, or just a regular rock; Goku, Sailor Moon, or Samus Aran; Sasquatch, Unicorns, Aziz Ansari, or a saguaro cactus. Almost anything you want, I\u0027ll draw or paint it for you! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you made it through all that, bless you! I hope you\u0027ll contribute at least $1 a month and have some insight into my stupid, bizarro, boob-tube pop-junk addled world! And thanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
