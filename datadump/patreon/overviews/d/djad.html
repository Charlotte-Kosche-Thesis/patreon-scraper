It\u0027s been the most liberating experience of my life and I LOVE IT!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollowing a live stream a month after I started doing music full-time (with no backup plan) one of my fans STRONGLY encouraged me to set up a Patreon account so she could support me regularly. Honestly, I didn\u0027t believe I could do it but she believes in me as well as the kindness of others who will across me and that\u0027s what\u0027s giving me the strength to do this. My fans, as limited as they are, mean the WORLD to me and I love you all so much. I love making music and I love seeing you all appreciating the craft I have devoted more than half my life trying to build for you and for Hip Hop. Knowing that this is my full time job gives me so much joy, and I want to thank YOU fans for giving me the courage and support to have made this decision to chase my dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a guy born in England who had a big dream as a 10 year old kid, but your support both financially and non-financially is changing my life more than you\u0027ll ever know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere Is No D.J.A.D.
