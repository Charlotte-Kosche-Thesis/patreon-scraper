    "summary": "Have you heard? There\u0027s a new movement brewing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has the power to dramatically slash our environmental footprint. It\u0027s called zero waste living. Some people are so good at it, they only make one jar of trash per year! By learning the art of zero waste living, we can detrash the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m making a complete video tutorial guide to teach zero waste living. It will take 150 videos to cover all of the actions a person needs to take on in order to become fully zero waste. I\u0027ll be making video tutorials on bamboo toothbrushes, DIY toothpaste, vegan cheese recipes, reusable water bottles, bottling, juicing, freezing, dehydrating, ketchup making, bulk purchasing, kitchen hacks, plastic-free pets, babies, kid\u0027s parties, fruit art, DIY cosmetics, cleaning products, eco fashion, repurposing and\u00a0reusing - there are so many tips to eliminate trash and disposable plastic from your life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos are more than just the usual DIY. I thoroughly research the embodied environmental impact that is alleviated by adopting each zero waste action. \u00a0As a qualified environmental engineer, it\u0027s in my veins to\u00a0read technical reports (called Life Cycle Analysis Reports) in detail. \u00a0I visually represent the exact amounts of coal, crude oil, water, natural gas, toxins, methane and carbon dioxide that is embodied in the everyday items we take for granted and throw away. Many people are quick to give green tips, but few will do the painstaking research to quantify the real environmental gain that the green tip delivers. I love to work out these numbers and bring them to life with cute animations for this video series!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s part of a bigger five-stage project devoted to making landfill extinct.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Videos:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m making 150 tutorial \u0026amp; DIY videos on every aspect of zero waste living. \u00a0They are freely availably on youtube and to be podcasted on Itunes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Manual/E-book:\u003c/strong\u003e I have just finished writing a substantial tutorial manual (200 pages, 40,000 words) that is ready to publish to Kindle and Gumroad, priced at $6.99. It\u0027s called \"\u003cem\u003eDetrash Your Life in 90 Days - Your complete tutorial guide to the art of zero waste living\"\u003c/em\u003e. It contains 150 zero waste tips covering every aspect of home, family and work. I\u0027m also growing a Facebook support group and hope to kickstart a movement of meetups for people who want to buddy up whilst transitioning to zero waste.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Documentary:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I have nearly finished a lecture/slideshow format of documentary in the style of \u003cem\u003e\u0027The Inconvenient Truth\u0027\u003c/em\u003e, but for trash. \u00a0It\u0027s 1 hour 20 mins duration to be presented and filmed on stage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Behavior change game:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0My programmer friends and I are developing a web based behavior change game. We have finished \u0027level 1\u0027 but have 10 more levels to go! It\u0027s available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.detrashed.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.detrashed.com\u003c/a\u003e and to be released for smartphones in the itunes store.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. \u0027Internet of Things\u0027 app:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0This is my moon shot dream! We\u0027ll develop an \u0027Internet of Things\u0027 app that \u0027gamifies\u0027 garbage reduction in real life. Our app will gather the weight of household garbage from scales that are fitted to garbage trucks and garbage bins that are tagged with RFID tags. We will send reports to households with their weekly trash data illustrated in charts which compare each household to their neighbors. Behavioral science shows that people become very competitive when ranked with each other about eco friendly behaviors, so we think this system will really work to motivate people to go zero waste.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m fascinated by behavioral sciences and I study the psychology behind what it takes to make real change. For example, did you know that getting people to agree to adopt a small step before a large step has an 80 precent higher chance of getting them to agree to taking that same larger step at a later date? Or that people click on red buttons 40 percent more than green buttons? Or that people are more motivated to support digital avatars that look like them and show \u0027emotions\u0027? Or that social competition is a much stronger driver for getting people to adopt an eco-friendly behavior than the degree at which someone actually cares about the environment? \u00a0I\u0027m aspiring to bridge the link between psychology and measurability so I can create a project that doesn\u0027t just talk or educate, but really does change the world in kilograms, pounds and parts-per-million.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have learned computer programming, graphic design, and video production - and have become a self made \u0027full stack\u0027 creative force. I am delighted and joyed to use my technical and creative skills together to create projects that problem solve environmental issues from every angle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help my dream come true of making this project. I am deeply passionate and devoted to the cause. I truly love making up-beat material that encourages environmentally sustainable behaviors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last 20 months, I have created several much-loved videos, written the \u003cem\u003eDetrash Your Life in 90 Days\u003c/em\u003e manual, slaved over a slideshow documentary, and programmed a prototype web game ( . . . oh yeah . . . and I had a baby somewhere in there!) all funded by bootstrapping myself. But I need your help to complete this body of work.\u00a0We can take a huge chunk of environmental footprint out of our lives by living zero waste. I truly believe that my data-driven approach, which has been chiseled from nearly 20 years experience as an environmental professional, will really work to get the job done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearning zero waste epically fun too! Did I mention that?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
