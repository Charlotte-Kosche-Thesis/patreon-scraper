Across the Internet I go by the name, Dumdodoor. In real life, I am Mitchell Giberson (for simplicity sake, call me Mitch).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve become an artist who strive to create whatever content that comes to me or being inspired by others. The real goal I wish to achieve in life is to create videogames, but how can I express what I want if words alone cannot describe my feelings or needs to make it happen? Pictures of course! They speak more to me to a certain extent and with that, I undergo to become a designer of some sort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years I had dreams to produce great quality games and I hope to make that happen someday. To make that happen, I need to refine and improve the skills I\u0027ll need in order to succeed. I also hope to build and form a great team to make any dream happen. I know what to expect and hope for the best. My goals sounds pretty high, but I\u0027ll do whatever it takes if that\u0027s that I\u0027ll be doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy reason to have Patreon is to get any potential supporters to help (and join) me to make my life a little easier and earn the funding needed to hire potential talent and good equipment! I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting my artworks and future content. I\u0027ll do whatever it takes to return my gratitude to you."
