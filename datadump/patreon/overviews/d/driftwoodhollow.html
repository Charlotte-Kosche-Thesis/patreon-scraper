The town is known for its eerie fog banks, relentless rain, failing economy, and the twisted pieces of wood that drift further ashore with every rising tide. But in recent years, there\u0027s been something else lingering over the area; a mysterious aura that broods rumors of a supernatural presence awakening in the forested hills and dark corners of this sleepy Hollow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Written by the pair of us, Karina Weber and Lena Sorgenfrei, this passion-project has been quietly in development since 2006. So it goes without saying, that its well about time to be brought kicking and screaming into the light! This Patreon is to help us do exactly that and more. It\u0027ll give supporters access to reading content as it\u0027s made, as well as lots of other special development goodies exclusive to the Patreon -- such as extra art, short stories, character reveals, and more.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note!! \u003c/strong\u003eThe comic contains a lot of swearing, occasional violence, drug/alcohol use, actively explores sensitive subjects, and other content generally viewed as not suitable for children.
