    "summary": "Thank you so much for visiting my Patreon page, and a massive thank you to everybody who has followed and supported Dietetically Speaking in any way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Maeve, I\u0027m a registered Dietitian from Ireland. I started Dietetically Speaking as I was very frustrated with the vast amount of nutritional nonsense (a.k.a nutribollox!) found on the internet and in the media. It particularly bothered me how unhelpful and misleading these nutritional messages can be to those who are simply trying to understand what they should be doing to become the healthiest version of themselves. And from personal experience before I completed my training as a Dietitian, I understand how easy it can be to taken in by some of this nutritional woo!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use Dietetically Speaking to create content (blog posts, infographics, videos etc.) which expose\u00a0fad diets, dispute pseudoscience related to nutrition in a user-friendly way, and promote evidence based nutrition and science! My blog also explores hot topics from the world of nutrition and shares simple, practical healthy eating and lifestyle tips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to use Patreon to support my blog so that my content can be dictated by my followers rather than relying on advertisement and affiliate sponsorship. I would love for you to join me on my journey to combat nutribollox and fly the flag for evidence and nutritional science!"
