    "summary": "Hey guys! Let\u0027s start with a little bit of a story time. Before I started publicly sharing my work, I was about to quit drawing after a long hiatus. I was losing friends, my country keeps falling apart and I just felt like my artwork wasn\u0027t helping me in any way. It was just draining the time that I could be spending on helping my family, so I would feel guilty when I spent so many hours on a drawing that wouldn\u0027t be seen by anyone but me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then, on March of 2017, with the return of my favorite childhood show, Samurai Jack, I gave it one last shot. I started working on those famous Samurai Jack\u00a0x Overwatch mash-ups and posted them on my private profile. Those precious friends that didn\u0027t leave liked my work so much that they pushed me to share them, and so I, Rafael Caldera, a venezuelan young adult, became Draw-it Ralph.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never expected people to enjoy my work as much as they did. I never expected to amass such a huge amount of amazing people that stayed just to see what else I had in store. I never expected to be commissioned by so many people, and more importantly,\u00a0I never expected to bond so strongly with you guys, and I am grateful. Thanks to you I can live off of my passion, I have time to keep creating content, enjoy our interactions and also help my family on these dark times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, in return for all your support, I want to ensure that my work will keep improving. I want to make the best art I can for such incredible people. That\u0027s why I\u0027m joining Patreon. The money gathered will be used to acquire better artistic tools, keep the bills payed and bellies full. I don\u0027t expect anyone will contribute any more than simply watching and enjoying my art, which I appreciate wholeheartedly, but if you feel like giving a hand, that would really help a ton to keep me creating constant content for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fact that there\u0027s only one Patreon pledge tier might be odd, but honestly, there\u0027s more important and better things you should spend your money on. I may add more tiers and rewards in the future, but for now think of it as donations to assure that I can keep doing what I do as best as I can.\u003cbr\u003e"
