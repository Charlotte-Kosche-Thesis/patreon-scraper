Learning the personal and intimate details about historical figures gives a deeper understanding of the motivation behind their actions that helped shape society for generations, and gives humanity what can sometimes seem like unrelatable historic figures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s also entertaining as hell to imagine people typically portrayed in a stately manner doing the equivalent of drunkenly calling out all their friends on twitter\u2026.I\u2019m looking at you, John Wilmot. Learn how Warren G Harding nicknamed his genitals, or how Anthony Comstock had an enormous influence on the United States\u2019 puritanical views on sex!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week join me, Tawny Platis,\u00a0 for casual re-tellings of the sexy, scandalous, and salacious stories your history teacher likely left out while my husband, George, takes care of all the tech stuff and occasionally weighs in with the proper use of a naughty word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile our show wouldn\u0027t be described as graphic, I do drop the F Bomb and some swear words occasionally, and obviously the subject matter revolves around sex.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for helping us reach more people with these Dirty Bits of history. Our Dirty Birdies make this show possible and we appreciate each and every one of you.\u003cbr\u003e"
