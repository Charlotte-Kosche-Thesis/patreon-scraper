    "summary": "I\u0027m on Patreon because I\u0027m going after the deepest passion in my life. Music and film take me into another dimension and allow me to interact with the world from a higher perspective. \u003cstrong\u003eMusic is medicine for me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom my experience over the last 5 years building SOULS of Society to a community of over 160,000 people all over the world I learned 2 major things:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) We are all interconnected, we need each other, and we\u0027re in a play much bigger than we often realize. If we follow our deepest desires and passions, and then share that passionate energy with each other, the mystery of life unfolds in beautiful synchronistic ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Each person\u0027s personal experience is so valuable. With all the \"important\" things going on in the world now people connecting with themselves and living in their highest joy is crucial. The energy of those people remind us why we\u0027re alive in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Power of Music\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you doubt the power of music think about what happens when a Michael Jackson song comes on. It instantly elevates everyone\u0027s mood and brings people into a harmonious joyous state. It goes beyond any superficial characteristics that may divide us.\u00a0My goal is to access that energy inside myself through singing and dancing and share that energy with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s never been a better time for artistic/entrepreneurial endeavors like this. Patreon empowers creators to develop a direct relationship with their audience. Gone are the days of waiting for a label to discover you and do the work for you. \u003cem\u003eNow it\u0027s YOUtube. As in, you do the work. You empower yourself. You integrate the artistic part of your being with the part that deals in the world of money.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m Asking\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in this vision and support the music or videos I am creating, please consider donating a super small amount on this platform. It could literally be 1$/month. Or even the price of a cup of tea: 5$/month. Check out the rewards on the right side of this page to see what you will get for you patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWILL YOU HELP? Thank you so much for your time and even considering being a patron. I look forward to going on this journey together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a video of the first song I ever recorded.
