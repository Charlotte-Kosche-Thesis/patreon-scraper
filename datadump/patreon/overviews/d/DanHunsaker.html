    "summary": "I\u0027m a writer. \u00a0Part of that is the impure art of fiction. \u00a0Part is the still-impure science of software. \u00a0But it\u0027s all writing, in one form or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis campaign is meant to help me realize both of these aspects of my writing in a way that doesn\u0027t leave me feeling guilty for taking the time to do it. \u00a0By pledging your support for my various projects, you can help me reach the various \u003cstrong\u003eprogress checkpoints\u003c/strong\u003e in each, by making my time worth money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe nature of these projects makes it tricky to predict how often I\u0027ll reach each checkpoint. I\u0027ll be trying to break each project down into checkpoints that should take about a month to complete, but it may not always be exactly a month between them. In cases where I\u0027ll be wrapping up a checkpoint early, I\u0027ll probably just postpone marking it reached until the month is up. In cases where it\u0027ll be late, I\u0027ll post an update saying so, and explaining the delay. Either way, I\u0027ll be sure to keep everyone in the loop on my progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Why not just set up your campaign to be per month, then?\" Well, that\u0027s actually pretty easy to answer. If I don\u0027t do any work that month, why would you want to pay me for doing nothing? Making pledges charged per checkpoint instead puts more accountability on me to actually follow through and make progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. What projects am I working on? Well, quite a few, actually. I\u0027m going to summarize a few below, but check out the Goals section for more-up-to-date info, as well as more details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTravel Tank\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot of information to be learned from pumping fuel. \u00a0How often do you do it? \u00a0Where do you typically go? \u00a0How much does it generally cost to fill your tank? \u00a0How far do you go between refuels? \u00a0Is one station\u0027s fuel better than another\u0027s? \u00a0What\u0027s your actual fuel efficiency right now? \u00a0How much further can you expect to go, or how long can you expect to wait, before you need another refuel? \u00a0And so on. \u00a0Travel Tank collects the basic data needed to determine answers to these questions - time and location of refuel, amount of fuel purchased and at what cost, and current odometer readings - and then does all the statistics magic behind the scenes to answer questions like these. \u00a0Data can be entered manually, or pulled in via GPS and camera.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalends in C++\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is taking an existing one (in PHP) and rewriting it in a different programming language (also called \"porting\" it, to C++ in this case). \u00a0Calends is a piece of code that supports handling dates in multiple calendar systems at once, and with a single, consistent interface. \u00a0This is surprisingly missing in a lot of places that could really use it - from genealogy to astronomy to simple dates on websites. \u00a0So I want to fix that, and do it better than my first attempt, so it can be used in more places.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCrystalline Skies\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA series about a boy who gets involved in far more than anyone ever bargained for, as his world enters a new era, and he enters adult life. \u00a0The Goal for this one will list the current story\u0027s plot seed, and will be updated as each story in the series is completed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStory Lines\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project takes Calends and uses it to link various story elements (people, places, groups, events, items) to points in time, across as many calendar systems as the author likes. \u00a0This lets the author focus less on who is where at what times, and more on writing things out, because they\u0027ll have a reference for their chronology. \u00a0Of course, this functionality would also be useful for tracking other things, even things so ambitious as world history.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeploy!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s one for the Internet software developers and system administrators out there. \u00a0Similar to Pagodabox, Heroku, and a handful of others, Deploy! will be a push-to-deploy hosting system. \u00a0This one, though, will run on Proxmox (KVM and LXC), and be fully open source. \u00a0That means anyone can use it, anywhere, for any reason. \u00a0Some really advanced stuff will be available for purchase, at some point, but only stuff that enterprise-level sysadmins would need and not want to build themselves. \u00a0Bonus - Deploy! will support more servers and more interpreters than existing platforms, and even entirely custom code that handles everything itself.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemoving the Bit\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSet in a world I created for roleplaying in, this story follows the events surrounding Brash the Unbridled\u0027s rise to power as the Pirate King of Denaria. \u00a0A novel, first in a series about notable figures in Denaria.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMetachat (name subject to change)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI detail this one rather extensively\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://danhunsaker.awswan.com/2016/09/10/hybrid-chat-monstrosity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon my blog\u003c/a\u003e, but it basically brings together several different chat protocols on a single server, so users can chat using their favorite client(s) without having to sacrifice functionality or the ability to talk to others in the same community. \u00a0Not much else to say, here, than I really want to make this one happen.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/b/n5W1azh5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Patreon Projects board on Trello\u003c/a\u003e for more info about specific checkpoints in each project.\u003cbr\u003e"

If I port it to something compiled, though, I want it to be usable in as many places as possible. So the idea is to port the library to C++, distribute it as a shared library for any project that uses them (.so/.dll/etc), and build language bindings (extensions/plugins/what-have-you) for the rest. That way, the functionality is easily accessible in any place a developer might want access to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis goal is just for the library portion, not the language bindings. Those will be checkpoints of their own, and may not be part of any given project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those curious, Calends is a calendar abstraction library, which basically means programmers don\u0027t have to worry about how various calendar systems work, or how to convert dates and times between them. They simply plug a point in time into the library, tell it what calendar system to present it using, and hand the result off to be displayed. It can also do all the date math a programmer might need, freeing them from needing to know any of the relevant calculations or relationships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of this already exists, but it\u0027s generally just for the Gregorian calendar (the current \"global\" calendar), or just for converting between Gregorian dates and those in a very few others - generally just one. But if it already exists, even fragmented this way, why reinvent it? Well, this kind of functionality isn\u0027t just useful when showing dates to users who prefer other calendar systems. It also would help in cases such as fields of history (geneology, anthropology, archaeology, astronomy, etc) where dates are written in systems other than Gregorian, to help convert back and forth between systems and keep everything ordered correctly chronologically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I could go on, but I\u0027ll spare you more for now.",
