    "summary": "Hi! We are Darklight Games, the team behind the free Red Orchestra mod Darkest Hour: Europe \u002744-\u002745.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are a small team of developers who work on creating content, fixing bugs and making enhancements to Darkest Hour: Europe \u002744-\u002745 in our spare time. Our team includes both video game industry veterans and hobbyists; many of us have been modding and developing games for over a decade!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHistory\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the end of 2012, Darkest Hour was no longer in development; the original team had largely dispersed to other projects or to take some well earned time off. The game was expected to die off soon after. However, against all odds, the game\u0027s dedicated and passionate players and modders stuck with the game and kept the servers filled for nearly \u003cem\u003e3 years\u003c/em\u003e without an official update.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe think that the Darkest Hour experience can\u0027t be found anywhere else. As developers and long time players of the game, we didn\u0027t want to see the game fall into disrepair. That\u0027s why in 2014, we began\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx0-fpsS3cU\"\u003equietly working\u003c/a\u003e on an ambitious update that would seek to fix long standing issues, modernize dated systems, and add brand new vehicles and maps.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, after nearly 2 years of development (on Christmas day, no less!),\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojdq1M8WFfE\"\u003ewe released the massive update 6.0\u003c/a\u003e.
