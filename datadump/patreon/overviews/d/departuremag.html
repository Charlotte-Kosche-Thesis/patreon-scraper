    "summary": "Dear reader,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m Raphael, editor of the Storyteller section at Departuremag.com. I\u2019d like to tell you a little about Departure\u2019s story thus far.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDeparture is a digital journal that covers travel and urban subcultures. We believe that travel is a reflection of the individual\u0027s journey through life, and that there\u0027s more to life on the open road than tourist traps and indistinguishable hotel rooms.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nWe soft launched in May 2016.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince then, more than a dozen contributors have been sending us words from \u00a0around the globe: Stories from along the Mekong Delta and the valleys of Nepal; tales of transcendence and shamanistic rituals; manifestos on the solitude of winding, unfamiliar roads, and how they reflect the milieu of our lost, striving generation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s been a humbling experience, and it\u2019s hard to express how grateful we are for every one of these stories. We think of them as\u00a0gifts given to us by other writers, who believe in what we believe, who love as we love.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re proud of being independent, but the seed fund we used to start our website runs in the thousands, and not in the millions of dollars that fund larger media entities and publications.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs fellow creatives, it pains us that we don\u0027t currently have the resources to give back to our contributors. As it stands, none of us in the core team are drawing salary from this project, but we\u0027d like to give back to our contributors first.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen we first conceived Departure, we envisioned our journal as a forum that celebrates freedom of thought and expression. We wanted to create an environment that values truth over clickbait, diversity of opinion over political dogma.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf Departure were a house, trust and goodwill would be the mortar that has allowed us to continue building it, brick by brick.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWill you help us in laying its foundations? \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We\u0027re Asking For Your Pledge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n1)\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eTo pay\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0our contributors:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eDeparture is a bootstrap digital magazine, which means that none of us core team members are drawing a salary.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut before we pay ourselves, we\u0027d like to give back to both current and future contributors. We may be dreamers, but it seems like the right thing to do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n2) No to gated content:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0027\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ve run out of your 5 free monthly articles. Please subscribe so that we can spam your inbox with more emails.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSounds familiar, doesn\u0027t it?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs avid readers of other publications, we hate gated content as much as you do. But it\u0027s often a necessary evil for long-established publications, which need to offset production costs and monetise online.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nWe hope that with your support over the long run, we\u0027ll never have to resort to subscription fees to gate off our content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e3)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Media\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEthics And\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Big\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Dream:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe standard business model for traditional publications relies largely on advertising revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis has led to unethical practices like paid-for Instagram posts, advertising masked as reviews and a whole load of unethical bullshit that leave a bad taste in our collective mouths.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaybe we\u0027re naive but we believe that - given time - Patreon and other crowdsourcing platforms could be the first steps towards a more ethical form of online journalism. Journalism that advocates for its readers, and not its advertisers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u0027t know exactly where that road is going to lead, but we\u0027re hoping that you\u0027ll come along with us for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe Answer Some Burning Questions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHow much are you hoping to pay your contributors?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eTo start of, we\u0027re hoping to pay our contributors in the modest range of $50-$100 per article, depending on how successfully we can reach our Patreon goals. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I be sure that my pledge isn\u0027t going to end up paying for your editorial team\u0027s chronic gambling addiction?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to be completely transparent about exactly which stories your contributions have funded, so we\u2019ll be providing a monthly breakdown of the stories your pledge has helped to support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow else can I help you guys?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eOh...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe completely, totally, absolutely understand if you\u0027re unable to donate (yes, we\u0027re totally guilt tripping you).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJokes aside,\u00a0if you like our content, feel free to give us a like on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/departure.mag/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0or visit our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://departuremag.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esite\u003c/a\u003e and read our work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you, and we wish you safe roads ahead.\u003cbr\u003e"
