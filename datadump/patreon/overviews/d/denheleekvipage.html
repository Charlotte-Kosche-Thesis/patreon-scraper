Currently the facility houses a riding school which follows the Horse In Harmony training principles by Ute Lehmann. It is also used for horse boarding and training and is currently home to approximately 24 horses of all shapes and sizes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood horsemanship skills, training and welfare are key elements to everyday life at Den Hele Ekvipage, so naturally myself and other qualified trainers at the stable also offer services in those principles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Helle Knudsen?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHorse trainer, farmer, and animal enthusiast\u2026.Excited, straightforward and easy going\u2026. That\u2019s some of the words I am proud to call myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA heart deeply set out in the animal-world and with a drive \u201cto do better and not settle for poor excuses\u201d has taken me through a 4-year degree in farm management with Dairy cows, about 15 years working in the farming industry with pigs and dairy cows, and an ongoing education with horses. Teaching and helping people and horses have been a part of it since 2002.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my life I think I have subconsciously always been looking at things from at least 2 sides of the table \u2026. You could argue that being the animal- enthusiast and with everything I say about good horsemanship and great horse husbandry, it is a double standard to also work in the farm industry\u2026. But I use that tremendously in my everyday work, thoughts, ideas etc.  To me, that\u2019s the business side of it that is a very worthy opponent to the horse world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strongly believe in \u201cdoing my best\u201d, that \u201cHappiness is a choice\u201d, and that horses deserve better! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favourite quote at the moment:\u003cbr\u003eMake no little plans \u2013they have no magic to stir men\u0027s blood\u2026. Aim high in hope and work! ( Daniel Burnham)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Does Den Hele Ekvipage Need Your Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe firmly believe that better welfare for horses is needed. This starts at the core of having better facilities and environments for horses to live in. While we are well on our way with creating this through the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://paddockparadise.eu/en/home-2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePaddock Paradise\u2122\u003c/a\u003e project, we want to lead by example. To do that we want to expand by making improvements to the existing facilities and expand the agility course so that we can show the practical aspects of natural horse care and welfare. We want to show that you can still operate successful riding schools, and boarding/training facilities without causing excessive stress on horses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it is more than that\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInfluencing change starts with education. Therefore we want to set a large focus on creating an educational resource, starting with a video library that can be used by anyone. These videos will be centered around welfare topics, basic training and horsemanship as well as learning to have fun with your horse through agility training. There will also be more focused topics that will be targeted at riding schools and boarding facilities, however the principles are always the same, and can be applied to most situations, whether you have 1 horse or many.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron, your money will be put towards creating more videos as well as going into the project as a whole. You get to be a part of the community and contribute to change in the industry, and for that , \u003cstrong\u003ewe can not thank you enough!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant To Donate or Sponsor, but not monthly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to make a one off donation, you are more than welcome to do that instead of signing up as a patron. Just contact us using the email below and we can make the arrangments. Alternatively, you can sign up of for Patreon for one month and cancel again.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are also looking for larger sponsorship deals for our mountain agility course.
