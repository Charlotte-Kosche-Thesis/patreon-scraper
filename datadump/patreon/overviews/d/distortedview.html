Supporting the show (and me) will allow me to experiment more with video content, spend more time creating new and interesting stuff, and will let me share some more personal content with die-hard supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like Distorted View Daily or any of my other work, and would like to see more from me, please consider supporting this Patreon."
