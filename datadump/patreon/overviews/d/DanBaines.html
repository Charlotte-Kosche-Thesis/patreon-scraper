In the decade since I created the\nhoax I have given numerous lectures on the subject and at the\nconclusion of every lecture at least one person has said, \"you\nshould write a book about that\u201d.

My literary background has\nseen me draft intelligence reports, police statements and the odd\nstory to accompany an illusion I\u2019ve created but this will be my first attempt at a full blown novel.\u00a0 My writing style reflects my love of Lovecraftian verbosity melded with a\ngallows sense of humour which I inherit from my forensics and armed forces\nbackground.\u00a0 When you\u0027ve dealt with the darker things life has to offer, laughter is the best medicine. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/287j0ua.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNegative\nexperiences with a large commercial publishing house has led me down\nthe independent route.

In supporting me, you will be ensuring that my\nintriguing story finally sees the light of day.

I\nonce heard a mum at my son\u2019s 4th birthday party exclaim that\n\u2019Scooby Doo was unsuitable for children under 10\u2019!  It\u2019s\nthat attitude that is creating a generation of uninspired clones who\nhave had their sparks of imagination dampened by liberal dullards\nthat populate our modern excuse of a society.  I\u2019d like to be\na key influence in changing that at some point in my life and help\nscare children again like we used to back in the 80s! \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery backer, no matter at what level, is special to me and I thank you all for your support.\u00a0 Pack your bags, we\u0027re off on an adventure and not even I know where it will eventually lead.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
