    "summary": "Hi, my name is Noah, I am 21 years old and have cerebral palsy. I live for the excitement of discovering new technology and its amazing impact on how it always dramatically changes the quality of my life. However, these technological discoveries can often take many months of exhaustive searches, emails and correspondence and is also very much dependent on the particular physical capabilities I have given my disability. \u00a0Sometimes finding the right combination of software and hardware through trial and error can make the experience a lonely one often filled with many disappointments and failures.\u003cbr\u003eI have reasoned that if everyone with a disability is able to share with others how they access and use technology, then those with a similar disability can learn from this and overcome the trials and barriers in trying to source new technology for themselves. This is why I have created the sharing platform disabilitytek.com. I am\u00a0calling upon everyone who uses technology within the disabled community to share their knowledge and experiences to help others make great discoveries. Technology empowers people with disabilities to have a better quality of life and connect with people that are important to us. It is basic right, so lets make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e"
