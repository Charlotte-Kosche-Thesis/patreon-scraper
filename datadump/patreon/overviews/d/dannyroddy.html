Let me explain: about three years ago, I was making a good amount of money selling e-books and living in a studio in San Francisco. However, over a period of time, I became disenchanted with the business model, as selling products in the health and nutrition arena tends to lead to the ultimate sacrifice of scientific objectivity \u2014 which means a lot to me. I decided to stop selling e-books, reduced the price tag of the current book I was working on to zero, went broke, and moved into a makeshift closet in my friend\u0027s house. My orientation, however, didn\u0027t change because producing meaningful health content fulfills me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5005c4e384ae929b37211ae9/t/5a5ff4c89140b7408de1956c/1516238028625/whatdoyouget.jpg?format=2500w\" title=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help on Patreon would allow me to permanently \u003cem\u003eeliminate the paywall for all current and future content\u003c/em\u003e. Plus, there\u0027s a few perks for different donation amounts that you can check out below. The retention of objectivity should be at the forefront of any scientific investigation, and I think the trend of popular health personalities padding their income by marketing dozens of products is disturbing. By skipping the bloated-exploitative-marketing-bus, Patreon allows me to receive support from you, the individual, for the books, articles, videos, and podcasts that mean as much to you as they do to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5005c4e384ae929b37211ae9/t/5a5ff4b6e4966b287178de3a/1516238007267/whatarepeoplesaying.jpg?format=2500w\" title=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"For those considering contributing to Danny\u2019s Patreon campaign\u2026his work is the real deal. \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thedannyroddyweblog/photos/pb.160367813985550.-2207520000.1437157107./966038600085130/?type=3\u0026amp;theater\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u2019s my before and after from his coaching\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.

I no longer experience tooth pain. (5) My work (which is quite stressful) is a bit less likely to put me in a bad mood. (6) Some of my hair is regrowing. This result is rather funny because out of all your readers, I am probably among the least concerned about hair. Nonetheless, I\u2019m happy to have it back.
