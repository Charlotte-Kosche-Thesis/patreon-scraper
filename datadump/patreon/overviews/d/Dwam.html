I create visual arts of all sort, all the time. I talk, and share, \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5716/23620227452_56b6113784.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Many of you know me already from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sang-noir.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etattoo work\u003c/a\u003e, or my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dwamdwamdwam.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ephotography\u003c/a\u003e, or from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dwamdwamdwam/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/dwam\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dwam.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, where I post most of my art for free. I intend to continue to do so, but I\u2019m also eager to experiment the network of support and exchange offered by Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I\u0027ve been battling forever the idea of trying this Patreon\u2019s experiment. I almost launched a page more than a year ago, actually, and left it unfinished. I was reluctant, mainly because I have stupid, paralyzing issues with money, commitment and dependency. Also because I\u0027m stuck with the dilemma of being so multi-task ! I like to have a finger in many pies, so I may one day be focusing on comics, or illustration, and then switch to photography, or video, and I never know what unexpected new interest will arise the next day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I\u2019d do Patreon to create what I really want to create, without much \u00ab profitability concerns \u00bb, just more art-thingies\u2026 for the sake of it. It feels whatever happens, I just \u003cem\u003ecan\u0027t stop\u003c/em\u003e creating visual art. It\u0027s what I\u0027m here for, \u00a0it keeps me breathing through life. \u003cbr\u003eBut that would be both interesting to hear from pledgers, and see if I create more freely - how your feedback and support will influence or help me, and/or free me from restraint. I\u2019ve grown a bit more distant and secluded from internet-network and blogging these last years, I needed retreat. But doing so, I also stepped away from my habits of oversharing and pouring my life in my art creations, it cut me from exchanges and feedbacks, critics and advices : I feel a link both positive and negative have been broken in the process - I miss it ! Therefore I hope for that platform to be a space of renewed blogging and open discussion - both ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0So, are you on for a visual stream ? I plan of sharing travel photo diary, original sketches and illustrations, short films, one-minute-portrait videos, ramblings, lots of questionings, poetry, step-by-step creative process, tutorials maybe, un-predictable art-things ! I\u2019ll probably start a few more-focused-projects (some are already on-going) to follow through here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 **\u003cstrong\u003eAbout explicitness\u003c/strong\u003e** : I debated for a while wether or not including some more explicit content. If you\u2019re familiar with my work, you know there will be nudes, for sure (so this patreon is +18 \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e) - it has always been a huge part of my artwork. Then I figured - yes, \u003cstrong\u003eit is\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0still a huge part of my artworks ; so why shy away from the erotic, or explicit parts ? There will be some, then - but with proper warning, for those who aren\u2019t into it that much. Once again : it\u2019s open to discussion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow does it work\u003c/em\u003e : \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e-You can pick an amount you\u0027d like to send me each time I release a thing - and in return you gain access to the Patreon-exclusive and non-exclusive content (check the full list of perks below for details). You get all my thanks and gratitude as well. I\u2019m not sure what exactly will be the content I\u2019ll produce, nor the frequency, but I\u2019ll try to keep it more or less monthly.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e-Anyway, don\u2019t you worry : you can change or cancel your patronage at any time, and you\u0027ll only be charged once a month at the amount you choose to give. You can set a monthly cap, so it secures you to only pay the amount you decide, monthly, even in the case I get crazy creative and decide to release like, 12 things all of sudden :) And you are charged nothing if I do not post anything. In each case you get everything previously posted.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e-Then everything is evolutive. Maybe my system will change, maybe you\u2019ll add brilliant suggestions, maybe you\u2019ll have requests\u2026 This is experimental, and this is the place to communicate. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
