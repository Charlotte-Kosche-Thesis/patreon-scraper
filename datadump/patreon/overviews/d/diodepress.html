You\u2019re just as likely to find me at my studio\npracticing 200-year-old printmaking techniques on copper plates as you are to\nfind me using the latest 3D design software to create laser cut or 3D printed\nprojects. As you\u2019ll come to find out on my Patreon feed, often I\u2019m doing both!\nI\u2019ve always had a passion for art and creating, and I\u2019m happy to be able to\nshare that here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis Patreon page is a way to build community and share the\nprocess I go through in creating my work. This is not a one-way road, I value\ncollaboration and feedback, and I want to share and engage as projects come to\nlife. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI share behind the scenes photos and videos, sketches of\ndesigns, and even some projects that never left the ground. I also share the\nprogress of long-term projects, some of which have been brewing for years. This\npage is unrestricted access to everything I do in the studio, as well as a\nplace for you to be able to help collaborate and share in the process.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHave an idea for a project? Let me know! \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWant to see more of something I glossed over in a video? I\nhave more footage, I promise!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI support other creators on Patreon because I simply enjoy\nwhat they do, and want to help them do more of it. Pledging a few dollars a\nmonth, might not sound like it would go very far, but to a creator, it has a\nreal impact. For example, a single sheet of high quality printmaking paper can\ncost over $5, let alone studio rent, inks, filaments, recording hardware, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour pledges go directly into supporting the art and videos\nthat I create, whether that be in the form of ink and paper for a print project,\nor the monthly licensing fees for the software to edit the videos. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for helping to support what I do. Please\nlet me know if there is anything you\u2019d like to see more of on YouTube, or\nPatreon, or you\u2019re interested in a custom commission, or want something 3D\nprinted!  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yz_oMRbW2so\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
