Sometimes we dig pretty deep. Maybe too deep?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe have been incredibly fortunate to have our content posted\non Io9, Indiewire, One Perfect Shot, The Film Stage, PopOptiq, No Film School, and other wonderful sites.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Type Of Videos? \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMovies are\u00a0pretty great aren\u0027t they? \u00a0We sure think so. And just as there are countless genres and types of movies, our video essays take a broad approach to film analysis and interpretation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile our analysis will sometimes pertain to the technical aspects of movies, and touch on aesthetic observations of the filmic form, we prefer to delve into the murky and sometimes treacherous depths of deciphering subtextual or subliminal meanings from a particular film or filmmaker.  From\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEf6UQuzvPo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNetflix-Raptors\u003c/a\u003e, to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nrjHF7wPbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBeigenicio Del Toro\u003c/a\u003e, to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbbX6fWO8cQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeistic Parrots\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlVCnlOiFyM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDick Trucks\u003c/a\u003e, our ideas may not be exactly what you\u0027re used to hearing, but we hope that\u0027s what will make them different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a podcast, on which we answer questions about our videos or about films current or past, as well as talk movies, T.V, and other pop-cultural non-M. Night Shyamalan-related happenings. Any questions or suggestions we receive regarding our videos will be fielded there, so we invite you to jump right in to the big heart-shaped jacuzzi tub that is our podcast and let our voice-jets massage your aching eardrums and melt your worries away.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Often Do You Post Videos? \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe try to post one video every two\nweeks. Key word, \"try\". As much as we try to avoid it, sometimes real life happens.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does the money go towards? \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMovies, microphones , royalty-free songs, software subscriptions, maybe a little liquid creativity. Heck, if we get enough financial support we\u0027d love to be able to do this as a full time job!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, we don\u0027t like to hide content behind\nads, no one enjoys ads. Unless you are an AD-dict, haaaaaaa. That\u0027s why we\u0027re going the Patreon route. Our\nlowest tier is just two dollars a month, and if you\u0027d like to donate just a wee wittle bit more, we provide transcripts for our\nvideos. That\u0027s right, we get a teeny bit of your money, and you get a transcript of our video. Just imagine the possibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s that?\u00a0You want \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e perks? Well we\u0027ve got good news for you, you crazy perk-a-maniac. With a contribution to our third tier, you not only get a transcript of our video essay, but a digital download of it as well, so you can get your Digging Deeper on even if all the Internet routers in the world are\u00a0blown to bits following some sort of apocalyptic Internet-router uprising. And if, for some bizarre reason, you feel so inclined as to contribute to our highest tier, you\u0027ll find yourself receiving something so incredibly amazing you won\u0027t be able to believe it really is what it really is. But it is. Really.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Words: \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a bit morbid... Well anyway, here goes... \u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e so much for your support, enthusiasm, poignant critique and commentary of our work so far. We are incredibly pleased and grateful to be able to share our passion for movies with you, and we\u0027re so excited to show you what we have planned for the\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e~future~.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
