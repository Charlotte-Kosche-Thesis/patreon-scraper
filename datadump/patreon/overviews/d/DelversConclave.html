It all starts somewhere...for some of us it was when we were young, joining a game of veteran players or others during college. No matter how, when or why, this game offers a stable ground for endless amounts of creation and fun! Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons ladies and gentlemen, is one of the best tabletop games in history. No matter the edition or mechanics of the game, it\u0027s what you and your group does within and outside those guidelines that make it memorable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all the experience points earned through the years, collectively, our group is excited to let you in on our new adventures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/26171667_563649310638393_1455445469933681940_o.png?oh=17b53df3e8f3f98ff870a73e91b9206d\u0026amp;oe=5AF991A5\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRolling high into the new year, hopefully landing a critical success with our new software called \"Delvers Forge\", a tabletop toolkit for players and game masters. Following the launch of our app, we plan to release a podcast of us playing Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons. 2018 is shaping up to be an exciting and fun year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AUZ_yoBVWI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore anything else is said, we as a group want to thank you for the curiosity and interest for visiting our site.

We don\u0027t plan to stop running anything but few bucks goes a long way. As a group and a brand, we hope to provide a regular source of entertainment, a constantly monitored and supported application for end users running a game session and hopefully down the road offer tangible material to use in your own play setting as well.
