After four years it\u2019s apparent that now is the time for Joshua and I to make a change. Battling with YouTube\u2019s algorithm, trying to create content that\u2019s both inspired and relevant, and trying to be consistent while still staying afloat in the real world has turned out to be a tougher row to hoe than we hoped. There just isn\u2019t enough room left in the demographic to get a solid footing with funny-food in a way that is sustainable and artistically rewarding-- so it\u2019s time to pivot! In the next two months we\u2019re planning a serious shift in our production universe to a new format that gets takes us out of the kitchen and into the real world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThink \u2018Unwrapped\u2019 meets \u2018Dirty Jobs\u2019\u003c/h3\u003eWithout giving away too much, the current plan is to start a new web series under the Dudes N Space brand that focuses on learning new trades and skills from professionals then implementing them on our own to see how we fare. There are still a lot of details that are being worked out in regards to format, media packaging, length, style, and frequency-- but it\u2019s our intention to make a premium polished product that will be distributed digitally and designed to be much more \u2018shareable\u2019 than what we have previously created.\u003cimg height=\"208\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YuN6IcmLsRWfsF5iUmdVTxqV_5inBkXG5TcEnxxyHtxI5tfXUFrT9am1ha4XNiTzx00AbzwTe-MJ5CK9i0KaaNz-aY-zSq02oSiMwaKVAWvhyUWaM9wvMZDfDA9O_A-X7nxhbRuN\" style=\"\" width=\"312\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"208\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZTSJ0-hIcpqPIDoiSl61xWfkehvMmAiiH7n1OtQSquGL2mhr_7xkHYfDaiiRfCuQ6FHUNt4ZCRje1eaBuurbR1r2zF_hDVwI4kpvDKqd98NNHrkjJwJzIgBbALFj8xMdz65qhKrp\" style=\"\" width=\"318\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(read: a series that won\u2019t get you banned on Reddit for sharing.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eRegarding Patreon\u003c/h1\u003eOur Patreon has been one of the biggest successes this channel. If it wasn\u2019t for the friendship, encouragement, and funding from our Patreon family we never could have made it past year two. We absolutely can\u2019t thank you enough, and though I know this may be a trust exercise in Joshua and I, we hope that you\u2019ll stay tuned in for this relaunch. \u003cbr\u003eThat having been said, we will be changing our Patreon as it currently exists. We have done a bad job at meeting our promises to our Patrons, and have no problem admitting that we feel like a big stinking bag of crap for it.  To minimize the damage we\u2019ve done we feel that it\u2019s best to start fresh. In order to maintain our brand we will be reducing the subscription option to a $1 per month tier, and the reward for that tier will be inclusion in the \u2018brain trust\u2019 so to speak. We will use it as a homebase for staying updated and focused on the new project as it comes together through photos, blogs, videos, and updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/dudesnspace\"\u003ewww.patreon.com/dudesnspace\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhen, Where, What?\u003c/h1\u003eThese changes will take effect immediately after the posting of this update. The best way to communicate with us will be through Facebook or Email at \u003ca href=\"mailto:dudesnspace@gmail.com\"\u003edudesnspace@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e . The plan is to take December off from producing content in order to reignite our sparks and evolve our ideas, spend January producing a pilot, then relaunch the channel under the new format when it\u2019s all ready to roll out at once. We want to take a unique approach to funding this project, and we have a lot of decisions left to make-- so we\u2019ll keep you updated on Patreon, Facebook, and Instagram as it\u2019s applicable.\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s the future. Here\u2019s to success.\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003eTravis and Joshua"
