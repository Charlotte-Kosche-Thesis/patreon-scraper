In addition to the wonderful live fantasy environment, each motion map features well-composed \n\u003cem\u003eambient sounds\u003c/em\u003e, creating a perfect atmosphere for you to take your imagination to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m not just creating looping video files in grid and gridless versions but \n\u003cstrong\u003ehigh quality still images \u003c/strong\u003eof each map for virtual tabletop platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCheck out my\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/archive-18335546\"\u003ePATREON ARCHIVE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKgYgt96myc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YkvBrlv.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYour Support\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll continue to create and release\u00a03-4 animated map packs (including statics) monthly, a \n\u003cstrong\u003eWilderness\u003c/strong\u003e, an \u003cstrong\u003eUnderdark\u003c/strong\u003e or a \u003cstrong\u003eCave\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0encounter scene,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003edungeon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0rooms, chambers\u00a0 and corridors. With your support I\u0027ll be able to afford to spend even more time doing so - my dream is to eventually be able to afford to work on Dynamic Dungeons full time, creating even more maps.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you click \"become a patron\", you immediately get access to all previous rewards for free and be able to choose a donation tier for the future releases.\u00a0I currently have tiers ranging from \n\u003cstrong\u003e$1, $2\u003c/strong\u003e all the way up to \u003cstrong\u003e$5\u003c/strong\u003e, most of which have a rewards like HD video files and high quality still images. You can cancel or adjust your patronage at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe number of map packs I publish in the month determines how much you contribute.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example, if you pledge $3 per map pack and that month I publish 3 rewards, you\u0027ll contribute $9 for that month.\u00a0If I fail to release maps, you will not be billed.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn February I released 3 rewards. Even if the rewards contained more maps, like night versions, or alternate versions, patrons were charged only once/reward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI released the Dungeon of Skulls which contained 5 maps + 5 others with torch for chaotic good patrons but all of it was released as one reward (in several posts), only $5 was charged total for this theme not for each single map in this package. (Usually a reward comes in four posts, but it doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027d be charged more times.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen I released the village also for $5 even if it contained the night versions and the day and night version of the outer walls.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe last reward of the month was the airship (day and night versions, with ballon and magical propulsion) and the maps in this reward also cost 5$ total.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also posted free giveaways, so a chaotic good patron in February was charged only $15 for more than 16 maps. In March I released the modular dungeon packs, more than 10 maps in each pack for the price of one reward. A Chaotic Good Patron was charged in March for $15 and received more than 25 map variations. In April I improved the quality of the maps, a Chaotic Good Patreon was charged\u00a0$15 and received 15 map variations of the three rewards.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example, you can pledge $5 per release and get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $10, thus supporting 2 releases that month. Patrons without cap will get extra discounts to my products and special rewards.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fuXFHRL.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLarge part of the money donated to this Patreon goes to supporting this project. (I\u0027ll buy new 3d models and plugins and bring you new themes like the Town, Sailing ship, Forgotten swamp, the Dead forest, snowy and desert scenes, fog/mist ruins) as well as enabling me to allocate more time into doing what I love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/quick-demo-of-dd-17101063\"\u003eThe Dynamic Dungeons Modular System\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/quick-demo-of-dd-17101063\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ESvn60I.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u00a0become a Patron you help bring the Dynamic Dungeons Modular Editor and Player App to life, which is a unique modular dungeon building system.

Simply lay flat your TV. You can protect the screen with a cheap plexiglass sheet, and use dry or wet erase markers on\u00a0it, so miniatures and dice rolls won\u0027t damage the surface of the Tv. You can also project down the video onto a physical table\u00a0with a HD projector.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/dDcxZm/IMG_6427.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/gXU8Pm/IMG_6429.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
