    "summary": "As one who has spent the last 35 to 40 years championing the creativity of others, I was excited to discover Patreon. I love the concept of people helping out artists. But the addition of giving the patron customized rewards was a totally new idea for me. It builds relationship, and that is what I am all about! So for me, communities like Patreon are game changing. Let me tell you my story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI was trained from early in my youth, to be a musician. Getting my start with what is now known as The American Boychoir; I was afforded some pretty amazing opportunities. Perhaps that is the reason I have always tried to help launch and equip others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next 35+ years, I worked on musical projects for artists and companies in all kinds of capacities: arranging, producing, editing, composing, and as a session player. For a time, while filling these roles, I was also involved in the teaching and mentoring of artists and musicians. Often, I did all of this six or seven days a week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOver that 35+ year period, in every case except for one, I did the jobs on what we term \u201cwork for hire\u201d, meaning I didn\u2019t receive royalties or collect credits towards any of the artist\u2019s future releases. And equally important, in tons of cases, I gave work and time away. I helped folks out right and left. I know, I know... sigh. You can probably color me a horrible business guy, huh? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo make matters even worse, about 15 years ago, doctors told me I had either MS, lupus or diabetic nerve damage. For some reason, that announcement, even though the doctors were totally wrong, launched me in to an accelerated few years of giving away much more time, energy, and even intellectual properties and concepts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe bottom line is that for decades I was so busy pouring into the growth and creativity of others, that I didn\u0027t build a healthy nest egg for my wife Beth and me for our later years. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut there is good news! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDuring the past two decades, while I was prolifically trying to move others forward in their craft, I was composing, recording and vaulting my own works. What I am doing now, is not only writing bunches of new material, but going through the vaults and finishing works, or in many cases, re-recording or editing the pieces to bring them up to today\u2019s standards, and prepping them for both traditional release and for licensing to film. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently, we have pulled 84 pieces from the vaults, with more to follow. And last year, 2015, my output of new material was at an all-time high. As you can imagine, this costs mega time and mega money, as the gear that I use is simply the best and most powerful composing equipment in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn order to survive and create I could use your help! I am 60 years old and feel like I am just getting started! I need the help of friends and folks who are passionate about the arts, who will help inspire, push, and propel me forward as I continue to push the envelope in the writing and the development of new tools and techniques. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the specialized tiers of support we have provided here on my Patreon page. Some of my rewards are specifically designed to help you to move forward in your passions. And some tiers reward you with music and patron specific privileges. I hope you find them creative, and exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, you the patron get to decide just what level is appropriate for your situation and passion. Sort of like when we support public television. My Patreon campaign is set up for monthly help, and lasts only as long as you would like to continue! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a supporter, any help you provide, will go towards licenses, repairs and upkeep of all the gear, copyrights, mastering and product duplication fees, marketing, the production of physical albums, the making of video tutorials, and keeping the lights on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy role in life is to consistently add value to the world by creating. My request for help will hopefully enable us to work together, in humility, vulnerability and gratitude for one another.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nLastly, thank you for taking the time to read through this. Your time is valuable, and I appreciate you spending a part of your day with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- David\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
