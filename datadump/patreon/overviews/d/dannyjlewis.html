    "summary": "Hi, my name is Danny Lewis and i\u0027m a music producer with releases on labels such as \u003cstrong\u003eDefected, XL/Locked On, Strictly Rhythm\u003c/strong\u003e and many more. I\u0027ve been in the business of making music for a couple of decades and have amassed a huge amount of knowledge that i\u0027ve been lucky to pass on through my experience as a lecturer in Music Technology at world famous production school \u003cstrong\u003ePoint Blank\u003c/strong\u003e in London.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI remember what it\u0027s like to have the urge to create but that lack of understanding that creates serious barriers to progression. \u003cem\u003eLearning is an expensive business\u003c/em\u003e and I realise that not everyone can afford private schools so i\u0027ve setup my channel on youtube to pass on knowledge to those who can\u0027t afford it. I make videos for most of the popular music making applications including \u003cstrong\u003eAbleton Live, Cubase, Logic, Bitwig, Maschine\u003c/strong\u003e and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome videos take a lot of effort, particularly those with multiple cameras and often i\u0027m putting my heart and soul into the presentation. I\u0027ve made some good progress so far in upping the production quality but to seriously up my game I need some more equipment. That\u0027s my first reason for jumping into Patreon. My second reason is that I was made unemployed recently and whilst i\u0027m looking for a similar role now there\u0027s also something that is saying to me that this could be a great opportunity to try and make a living from teaching others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get regular funding I can keep making videos and start tackling some of those subjects so many of you want to learn in detail. I\u0027m always open to ideas so would be totally up for taking requests.\u003cbr\u003e"
