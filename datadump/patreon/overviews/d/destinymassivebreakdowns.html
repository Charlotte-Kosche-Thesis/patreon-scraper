    "summary": "My name is Matthew, though the majority probably know me by the moniker Mercules. I\u0027ve been around the Destiny community since the beta, and the Bungie community since long before that, but it\u0027s only been in the last six months that I\u0027ve really started attempting to make valuable contributions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a series for /r/DestinytheGame called Massive Breakdowns. I basically do recommendations, reviews, and guides that discuss all the weapons in the game, plus I dabble in some of the barely understood mechanics like aim assist and range in an attempt to decipher them. Sometimes I do lore posts, or help out with armor choices, but my bread and butter is definitely helping people to arm themselves with the very best weapons and perks available in the game. In recent months, my YouTube channel has gotten up and running again, and a few other people and I got together to start up a podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, I used to do all of this in the spare time I had at work as a computer teacher, and then working a desk job at an insurance company. Unfortunately, our company was sold, and I lost my job. Now, I\u0027m unemployed, which leaves me a ton of time to work on Destiny related activities. What it doesn\u0027t leave me with is a way to pay the bills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that I need to get another job and do some real work, but I want to try to take this opportunity and work with something I\u0027m passionate about. If it were possible, I\u0027d spend all my time making Destiny content to share with the community, and I\u0027m going to do my best to make that happen. In the meantime, any contributions from people who enjoy the work and would like to see even more are greatly appreciated!"
