This means that I get to give you ad-free content and am not pandering to sponsors. \u00a0This also means that all of the production costs come out of my own pocket. \u00a0Your patronage helps me keep doing what I\u0027m doing as well as improving the content by allowing me to continue to upgrade my recording equipment, editing software, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate your consideration! \u00a0I hope to keep entertaining and helping you out for many years to come!"
