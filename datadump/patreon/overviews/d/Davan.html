    "summary": "Hi! Welcome to my world. I\u0027m a creator - and have done a wide range of art from life sized muppets, silk painting, medieval calligraphy ... and all the way to contemporary kilts (Alt.Kilt - \u003ca href=\"http://www.altkilt.com)...\"\u003ehttp://www.altkilt.com).\u003c/a\u003e and now I\u0027m working on something very new to me. I\u0027ve been learning new skills for the last year and my art has started to come together into a whole new world. And it is thanks to my constant supporters that all this has been possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been obsessed with the stories in urban fantasy - that dual nature of mermaids, selkies, changelings, and all the others.\u00a0The idea that there is another world - right next to ours- that is ruled by magic and tradition but balanced by good and evil... or Seelie and Unseelie.\u00a0I want to tell these tales and others - \u00a0share these mysteries- through art... non-traditional art. I\u0027ve been exploring casting, metal smithing, resin work, carving, printmaking, sculpting.... anything and everything that can help me work out my vision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m using Patreon to change my job so I can again support myself with my art. I\u0027m moving from an established business to something new and exciting and I\u0027m hoping to share my process and failures, my discoveries, and my art with others as I learn. I have rent of a studio space to cover as well as living and work expenses. Since this art is new to me, materials and techniques are still evolving. I\u0027ve been taking formal classes for two semesters now and am also self taught.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy GoPro is ready to make more videos and I have already started documenting the process that I use for sandcasting, mold making, resin setting and metalworking. \u00a0I am prepping tutorials for a variety of things listed above and also other techniques such as ink work \u00a0silk painting, \u00a0pewter casting, silver casting, etching, and more! \u00a0This space will become an entire library of art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate all the feedback I have been getting on my new work and I am thankful to those of you who support this endeavor. I can\u0027t wait to show you more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReward Tiers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 a month - See behind the scenes with exclusive posts, photos and videos. You will get to vote in the poll to determine my quarterly theme plus access to my new Shopify store!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5 a month - Tutorials! Get early access to my how-to processes as I work on projects and commissions. These will include a huge range of art techniques and most write ups / videos will be exclusive to Patreon. This tier includes all the rewards for the previous tier and access to the new Shopify store!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$10 a month- Shop Around the Clock!\u00a0Like what I make? Want to get your hands on some of it? This tier not only gets access to my Patreon only website but also unlocks a monthly multipling discount credit. For each month that you pledge $10, you get a $5 credit in addition to the rewards listed above (such as behind the scenes access and progress photos).\u003cbr\u003eWait two months to shop and you\u2019ll have $10 in the bank, ready to go! Use it each month or save it up for something big. The shop will be stocked with my prototypes, one of a kind items, and regular stock that you get first dibs on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$25 a month - Swag time! Each quarter, I will be focusing on different things (usually with a theme but not always) and at the end, I will send out an swag bag of 1-4 items (est. total retail value of $100) I have made related to you! This could be jewelry, sculpture, art, or something new! (themes may repeat but the items won\u0027t!) Must be signed up for at least 2 of the 3 months to get a package.\u00a0This tier includes all the rewards for the previous tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$100 a month - Custom work! Pledge at this level and we will work together on a custom item just for you - estimated retail value of $300-$350 per quarter. Item can span any of the skills I showcase here. Design sketches will be signed off by both parties. There will exist the ability to roll over this reward for one quarter (only) to get a more complex item. Must be signed up for 3 months to get a commission. This tier includes all the rewards for the previous tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
