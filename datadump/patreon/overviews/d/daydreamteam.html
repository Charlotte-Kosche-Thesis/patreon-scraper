Mostly playing them, board games and computer games, but also developing them. We\u0027ve got lots of ideas, but our funds and numbers currently restrict us to simple mobile stuff.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDreams\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOur dreams are to create GOOD games. Of course that is subjective, but we try to take into account all the feedback you are giving us in order to improve our games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u0027re hopeless idealists: We want to make FREE games (and apps). We love wikipedia and like to think if we do a good enough job we\u0027ll be able to make a living without charging anything - but until that works out we have full time jobs and even some freelancing contracts on the side, leaving us with less time than we\u0027d like for following our passion :(\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWant to help?\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u0027ll be working on creating high-quality apps regardless, but if our hobby could also pay the bills we would be able to (and we\u0027d love to) dedicate a lot more time towards development and purchasing more quality assets. So obviously, one thing you can do to help us is donate\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShare us your thoughts! Feedback is very important to us, and several of the existing features in our app are only there because one or more users requested them. Tell us what you think, what would make the app better, and we promise your feedback won\u0027t go unnoticed!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShare the game! Not anyone can afford to support us financially, and we don\u0027t expect that. Not everyone might like the app, and it\u0027s certainly not an app for everyone, but maybe you have a friend who\u0027s into this stuff; share it with them, it means a lot to us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re a small company, with a small app, so we\u0027ll stop our rambling here.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read all this :)\u003cbr\u003eFor any questions, feedback or suggestions, don\u0027t hesitate to contact us directly, or on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/daydreamsoftware/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efacebook page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
