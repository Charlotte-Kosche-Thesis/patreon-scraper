The reason I have set up this Patreon is that I have a passion for streaming and reaction videos. However, in order to deliver the highest quality content possible, I need to upgrade most - or all - of my equipment. Patreon will allow people who really enjoy my content to have a quick and easy way to support me and, in return, receive even more content and interactivity from yours truly. Feel free to pledge any amount of money you like, even $1 a month will support my cause and get you some new benefits. Any and all money made through this Patreon page will be put towards saving up for new equipment to help better my content. Thank you very much and have a fantastic day! :)"
