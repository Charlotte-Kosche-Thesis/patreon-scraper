    "summary": "Hello, world. I guess if you\u0027re here, you dont really need my introduction, but for those fellas who do - I am mostly known by the nickname Demimond, and what I do is draw adult pictures the best I can. You can see my stuff on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://demimond23.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/Demimond23/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHentai Foundry\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/demimond23/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFur Affinity\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m terrible at marketing myself, so I\u0027ll just be straight forward about the reason I started Patreon - that is, to be able to draw as much as I can, without the need to get money out of other stuff. Truth be told, I want drawing to be my main job, both so I can get better at it, and so I can survive by doing something I love to do the most. Not to sound like a sleazy car dealer, but in short: if you like my stuff, and you have a dollar or two a month that you are willing to give to support me drawing more of it, you can do it here, and I will appreciate every single donation. And the more competitive drawing becomes in comparison to my dayjob, the more time I can dedicate to it, the more drawings I produce. Capitalism at work, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that my stuff should be free for everybody to see, so I can\u0027t really promise much in terms of exclusive drawing rewards, but I think I came up with rewards that people might find worth the money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to what you can expect to see me draw, I guess you can tell from looking at my gallery the general theme of my work, i.e. \u003cstrong\u003egame\\anime characters\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003esolo\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003efemale on male\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003efemale on futanari\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003efurry\u003c/strong\u003e(I only begin my journey there, but I wanted to do it for a while, and I like it). I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll draw any of the more extreme things like guro etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat about sums it up. Thanks for reading. I think I mentioned everything that might be important. Take a look below(on on the right, I think) for more concrete info. Have a good day :3\u003cbr\u003e"
