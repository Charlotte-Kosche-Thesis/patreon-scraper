    "summary": "Greetings! There\u0027s a chance that you\u0027ve been listening to \u003cem\u003eDebating Doctor Who \u003c/em\u003esince it began in... my goodness, 2014? That\u0027s so long ago! It\u0027s also possible you\u0027re getting into us for the first time as series 10 of \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who \u003c/em\u003eairs. Either way, welcome! We\u0027re really happy to have you here, as a pair of \u003cem\u003eA.V. Club \u003c/em\u003econtributors chat weekly on all things \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e. When the show is airing, we talk about the latest episode, and when it isn\u0027t, we pick a couple stories from the new series and compare and contrast them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eis back after one of its trademark hiatuses, and this time we\u0027re hoping to come back bigger and better than ever. That\u0027s going to be a tough task, considering our awesome original cohost Caroline Siede has decided to move on. But I am so pleased to be continuing the show with fellow \u003cem\u003eA.V. Club \u003c/em\u003econtributor Allison Shoemaker, and we want to make the show an even more special and, uh, \u003cem\u003econsistent \u003c/em\u003epart of our listeners\u0027 lives! To that end\u00a0\u2014 and building on some very generous offers from some of our listeners looking to support the podcast financially\u00a0\u2014 we\u0027re launching this Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen \u003cem\u003eDebating Doctor Who \u003c/em\u003ewas something we did for free in our spare times, it was sometimes inevitable that Caroline and I had to prioritize other things and put the podcast on the back-burner. Allison and I would like to make a commitment to regular episodes going forward, and it\u0027d be awesome if you would be willing to make a small financial commitment to help make that achievable. We\u0027ve put together some fun goodies and reward tiers for you to peruse, but even a dollar or two a month from all our listeners would make a huge difference!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuestions, comments, thoughts on other things we can be doing? Please feel free to email us at debatingdoctorwho@gmail.com, or hit us up @debatingdw. Thanks everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best,\u003cbr\u003eAlasdair"
