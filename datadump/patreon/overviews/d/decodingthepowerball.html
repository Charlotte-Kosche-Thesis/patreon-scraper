The strategy when flipping quarters was to try to predict weather the quarter would land heads or tails. For instance, If the quarter was flipped 4 times in a row on heads I would predict that the opposite more than likely would follow. The point here that I\u0027m trying to make is that this was a strategy.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have translated this simple strategy to my game \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDecoding the Powerball.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0As\u00a0I always looked at this as there are only 5 numbers that can come up as winners and 64 numbers that won\u0027t and so it would be easier to pick the numbers that will not be coming up, then the 5 that actually do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDecoding the Powerball \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003egame comes\u003cem\u003e with statistics and\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eunique color coding system \u003c/em\u003ethat will give\u003cem\u003e\u00a0y\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eou\u003c/em\u003e the ability to better predict certain groups of numbers that will or will not be coming up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s play!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
