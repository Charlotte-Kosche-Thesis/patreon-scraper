    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eLove Notes from the Universe\u003c/strong\u003e is a snail mail art project by Denmo Ibrahim on\u00a0 l i s t e n i n g\u00a0 to the natural world. An experiment in discovering the language of the cosmos, Love Notes From the Universe explores the poetry of plants, the wisdom in the body-mind, original heiroglyphics, herbal concoctions and art as intimacy with the divine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHello, my name is Denmo and welcome to my Patreon page. Love Notes From the Universe was born out of a desire to understand better what it means to be human. For me, that meant turning toward the source of much of my inspiration -- plants, nature, cooking, and self care -- as a way to hear the messages of the Universe. And to do so with a creative and intuitive embodied practice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the last\ntwelve years of my life I have:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuilt\na private practice into an award winning day spa for healing in San Francisco \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFormulated\nand handcrafted an organic skincare line inspired by Ayurveda\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWorked\none-on-one as a Holistic Coach and Bodyworker\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLed\nmany sold-out workshops on health, embodiment, and the business of healing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBeen\na guest speaker on wellness for national conventions in the industry\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWritten\nfeature articles for leading trade magazines on skincare, health, ritual, and\nhealing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\nIt has been an\nhonor to work so intimately with people on their path of health and wellbeing. Love Notes From The Universe is inspired directly from the kind of work and relationships I\u0027ve been fortunate to have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS LOVE NOTES FROM THE UNIVERSE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn a nutshell,\nit\u2019s the art that arises out of relationship with the world. Energy, symbols, dreams, animals, moon cycles, the body and plants -- these are just some of the gateways that embody wisdom to be discovered and uncovered. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove Notes From the Universe is a collection of letters, drawings, recipes, medicine cards, a monthly digest and custom-built tiny altars. It\u2019s an inspired collection of ordinary magic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope this creative process sparks yours and that together we can explore more of what it means to be alive.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY THIS NOW? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s a good question. I guess the first reason is that if everything you do in life is based on what you want, then the best you get is what you asked for. As an entrepreneur, writer, Capricorn, and coach, I\u0027ve led a very action-based career. It\u0027s been rewarding but it\u0027s always FOR something. In my heart of hearts, I am a creator (due to the glorious indoctrination of training in the performing arts as a young person -- thanks Mom!). Yet this project feels less like making something happen and more like listening to what\u0027s already happening. Love Notes From The Universe is a call to be in deeper relationship to the unknown and then to share it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove Notes From the Universe is also about prioritizing direct relationships that are personal, intimate, and in the works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI believe dialogue with the natural world is an essential part of being human.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI believe an intrinsic part of being human is being lost. If we figure it all out then we relinquish one of our most powerful gifts as humans -- curiosity of the unknown.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI believe that healing is a combination of practice, faith, and magic.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIS\nTHERE A GOAL?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, yes and no.\nThe goal is to create each month out of the question. To look and see. \nThere is no goal outside of the process. In the good words of  Mahatma \nGhandi and Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, the path is the goal. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet I do hope to that this work will eventually lead to a book \nor a movement or the resurrection of letter writing all across the \nworld. But I\u2019m also\nopen to seeing where this adventure takes us like say conducting feasts \nin the forest. Or foraging for seaweed on the coast at sunrise\nwhile wearing sequin headwraps. I have no idea. And I couldn\u2019t\nbe more thrilled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027M IN!\nHOW DO I SIGN UP?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYay! I\u2019m\nso glad you want to join me on this ride! The cool\nthing about Patreon is that you can become a patron of the arts at any level, even $1 per month supports Love Notes From The Universe and all its creative divinations. Join\u00a0 at any time, at any level and feel\nfree to change your status as you see fit.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO I GET?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition to my deep gratitude and also the feel good vibes that instantly arise from being a bonafide patron of the arts, each level invites you deeper into the experience. Feeling super cerebral? Lost your sense of play? Not sure which life direction to take? Let this snail mail art project invite you into a different perspective. In the words of Alan Watts said only something can come from nothing. This is a great big call for nothing. Choose your adventure and let\u2019s be human together before the world ends.\u003cbr\u003e"
