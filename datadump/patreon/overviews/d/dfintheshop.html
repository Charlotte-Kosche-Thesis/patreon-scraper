As the name might suggest, \u00a0I create videos that document the work that I do in my own shop. \u00a0I am mainly interested in early trades, the hand tools they used and the technology that was lost when the world invented the assembly line. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, that isn\u0027t all that I do. \u00a0Sometimes I need to use modern fabrication techniques to produce some of the tools or machines that I need. Other times I\u0027ll take a purely creative break by doing some pottery or sculpture. \u00a0You will find it all on DF - In The Shop.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe support I get through Patreon is priceless. \u00a0It allows me to experiment with different techniques and to take the time that I need to work through the problems that come with each new project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe videos featured on Patreon are designed for people who want to see the entire process and to learn as much as they can from watching me work. \u00a0They document the progress of everything \u00a0that I am working on at that time and will feature everything from the projects that will be developed into YouTube videos to the common everyday tasks that don\u0027t usually get included in any of those videos.\u003cbr\u003eSo if you decide to support me on Patreon you will receive the rare opportunity to witness the everyday life of the traditional craftsman in his natural habitat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
