    "summary": "When Drawn and Plastered was launched, I wasn\u2019t thinking about a brand or an image. I wasn\u2019t\nthinking about starting a company for profit. I was only thinking about what I wanted to do with\nit. I wanted to bring people together, and include those who had been so far left behind. I\nwanted to take what wasn\u0027t working out so well with other events and make it better, and most importantly, I wanted\nto put on a hell of a show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo what is the Drawn and Plastered purpose, and why should you want to be part of that? For\nmany artists, the biggest question is where to start. The next one is, \"Then what?\" Drawn and\nPlastered is about making it easier, giving artists the perfect venue to practice and share their\ncraft. It is also about a city\u2019s vibrant, fast-growing community in which they can make friends\nand start new business relationships, so they can continue to create and grow even when the\nnight is over. Drawn also exists to expose people to the art of others - for inspiration, education,\nand pure entertainment. Drawn and Plastered is unique because it helps artists be amazing, no\nmatter what their art is, no matter what level they\u0027re at.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDrawn\u2019s purpose was born naturally all by itself, without planning, without contemplation. Its\nimage is like Drawn itself. It\u0027s joyful, it\u0027s playful, it\u0027s incredibly imaginative, and most of all: it\u0027s\nfriendly and nurturing. Drawn is not arrogant or aloof in what it does. It doesn\u2019t have a\n\u201ccompany (us) and attendees (them)\u201d mentality. It is a community that supports others. It\nrecognizes that we all need each other to exist, and for this reason we care about each other\nand our successes. This community? It\u2019s also just a touch crazy! In that way Drawn is a real\nfamily.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWon\u0027t you join us?"
