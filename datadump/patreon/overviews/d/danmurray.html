    "summary": "Hello! My name is Dan Murray. I\u0027m a musician and writer living in Burlington, Ontario.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMusic and the written word have been passions of mine since long before I can remember.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo much so that I don\u0027t really know what else I could happily do with my life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love to write, and I love to perform, but most of all, I love to connect with other people.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd I find the best way to do this is by creating and sharing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to fill the world with music and poetry that makes you feel something, be it sadness, laughter, anger...whatever - the point is, everything I create, I create with the aim to tapping into the honest center of a person and connecting there - in that spot where we\u0027re all convinced we\u0027re really strange - where we all believe we\u0027re the only people who feel a certain way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to prove that wrong. We\u0027re all strange, and we\u0027re all hiding it. I want to try and bring people together in that place, and so I sing, and I write, and I try to be as honest about it as I can. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlong with my own singer/songwriter material, I am a Spoken Word poet, a co-organizer of The Burlington Slam Project (Burlington\u0027s only monthly poetry slam), and a member of the Celtic folk-rock band The Great Lakes Privateers. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of these things are blossoming and approaching career status, and I\u0027m so close to self-sufficient, I can taste it - but if I really want to push it to that next level, I need a lot of free time, and a lot less time spent stressing about making rent or eating - which means I need a bit of help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInterested in buying some of my work? Head on over to my bandcamp page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://danmurraymusic.bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://danmurraymusic.bandcamp.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to see a little of what I\u0027ve got, check out the following links:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOriginal Song - \"Forget Me Not\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fPfSeEkB818\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOriginal Song with The Great Lakes Privateers - \"Carry Me Home\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3gSmNOHNJGY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPerformance of Original Poem at Canadian Festival of Spoken Word 2013 - \"Food Chain\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rll_tBbKKdU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is the only life that makes sense to me - being able to create and hopefully connect with and help others, so if you like what you see, please consider helping me get a few steps closer to achieving this goal.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
