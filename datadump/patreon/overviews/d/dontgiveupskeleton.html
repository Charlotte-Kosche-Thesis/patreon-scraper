    "summary": "Don\u0027t Give Up, Skeleton is a Souls/Bloodborne podcast focusing on people\u0027s journeys through the series. Hosted by me, Jeremy Greer, with a new guest every single Wednesday. One of my favorite parts of Bonfireside Chat and Twin Humanities was guests briefly describing how they got into the series. I wanted to hear more of those stories, so I talked to my Souls friends, bought a cheap microphone, and started recording podcasts. Later, CoffeeJezus came along and helped me by saying that my original name was \"rubbish\" and that I should call the show Don\u0027t Give Up, Skeleton, instead. Thank you so much, CJ! Bullet dodged.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time I\u0027m writing this, I\u0027ve recorded over 100 episodes of DGUS, all with different guests that have wildly different backgrounds and experiences. Stay-at-home lore theorists with insane crab theories, musicians that run the spectrum from chiptune to old fashioned blues, dads that use the Souls games to connect to their children, techies that like to break the games apart and find out what makes them tick, podcasters, youtubers, rappers, and people that don\u0027t fit into any of those descriptions. People that just like Souls, and have their own stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why a Patreon now? Patreon is a good balance of letting folks that have the desire and means to support the people they like in their work, while also allowing me to continue to release the podcast for free to the people that can\u0027t or won\u0027t support the show. I don\u0027t have a complicated reward or goal structure, and while that may come in the future, for now I just want to open this avenue up and see what happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decided to support me: thanks so much!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
