    "summary": "Diecast Dynasty started when I found out my wife was pregnant with our first child. I spent countless hours thinking about what kind of Father I would become and how I could take my own childhood experiences and use them to make sure Adrian has the best childhood of his own. I have vivid memories of playing with all different kinds of Hot Wheels, and Matchbox cars. I had playsets, and a little city that had everything from a Police Department (3 completely different looking cruisers), to a National Guard force (3 purple tanks, a jeep, and an armed dune buggy). I needed to make sure no one was going to catch my city off guard!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube channel started off as an unboxing, review, and play time channel. I have nearly 30 videos now, with a new episode airing weekly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking these videos has inspired me to take this further; my creative juices have really started flowing and I now have more ideas for new types of shows than I have time to produce. Which is part of why I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a full time+ job. Being a new father, I want nothing more than to be here for my family as we grow. Who will argue with that? My whole outlook on life has changed with the arrival of Adrian. Having a job that keeps me away form my family for long hours during the week, and often on the weekends is no longer something I see myself doing forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiecast Dynasty is now quickly becoming less of a side project, and more something I want to devote a lot more time to. A LOT!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help would enable me to stay home with my family while creating lots of really cool entertaining content that is safe for all ages!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you say? Are you in?!"
