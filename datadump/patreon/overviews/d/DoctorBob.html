    "summary": "We perform a live horror host show in multiple venues! We have a monthly show at a local theater in Columbus, Ohio on the first Saturday of every month as well as a weekly live show in virtual reality on AltSpace! Our gang of characters put on a show while bringing the audience a fun film every time. Please note that a fun film is not necessarily a good film!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NF5K1PCc25s\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a reaction show on our YouTube page called Wild Eye Reactions that highlights the best and the worst films from Wild Eye Releasing. Sometimes they\u0027re great films and sometimes ... they hurt us. We never know which it will be until we watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVl2HeLY3_8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe try to bring people movies that are different from your regular public domain horror host fare. We\u0027ll show indie movies, classic movies, almost anything as long as the movies are \u003cstrong\u003eFUN! \u003c/strong\u003eWhenever we can, we add William Castle-style hi-jinks to whatever movie we\u0027re showing. We\u0027ve done things like have the monster from the movie run through the theater or thrown inflatable fish into the audience during \u003cem\u003eMega Piranha\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0or have the pie plate flying saucers from \u003cem\u003ePlan 9\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0zip over the audiences heads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can use your pledges to provide better special effects in the theater and better merchandise like T-shirts or, eventually, our show on DVD/digital distribution. As you can guess, our dry ice budget alone is pretty damn high ... especially for a free show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why don\u0027t we charge for people to come to the show? Because we don\u0027t want to. Seriously. We want our regular monthly show to remain free for anyone who wants to come see it. It\u0027s part of our philosophy. We may do paid special shows but those are outside of our monthly show."

If you get us to $200/month, we will ask our Patrons what movie they would like us to show. We\u0027ll submit the answers back as a poll and we will book, pay for and show that movie. No modifiers on this, we\u0027ll pay for this movie and we\u0027ll keep the movie free of charge for the audience. Normally, we only show movies that the studios or directors will let us show for free but, for this one time, we pay whatever we need to so we can reward our Patrons. This would be an annual Patreon-picked show at this level.",
