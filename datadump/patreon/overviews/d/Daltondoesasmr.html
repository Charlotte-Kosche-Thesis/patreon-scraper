    "summary": "Hi Everyone, my name is Dalton, and as you probably know, I do ASMR.  Really happy to have you checking things out here with me on my Patreon.  Essentially, this is the place for us to get a bit closer but it\u0027s also a chance to help support me in what I really enjoy doing. Getting started in video making is challenging, but I like challenges.  I can\u0027t pretend that all of the problems and difficulties that come with an opportunity like this will just disappear over time.  That\u0027s why I\u0027m excited to have this option available to us too, because I know that together we can make things grow and improve even more quickly than I ever could accomplish on my own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eASMR is a benefit to all of us, and whether we\u0027ve been listening to it or seeking it for a long time or even just discovered it recently it is clear that we can gain a lot from it if we use it to help relax ourselves in times of stress and frustration.  For me, there\u0027s never been something I couldn\u0027t wash away with the sound of asmr, in one of its forms or another. That\u0027s the magnificence of it too, isn\u0027t it?  There is never one form, and new ones will always be discovered. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the years that I\u0027ve known about asmr, which was essentially since I was a small child, I never imagined that I would have the potential or will to bring it to someone, anyone else in my life.  I didn\u0027t even think that anyone else could possibly feel it even.  Here I am though, with all of my good friends and people who believe in me and care about what we can do here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know aid can be a lot to ask from someone, anyone really.  You have to debate with yourself why it would ever be worth it, so of course I want it to be worthwhile to you too. Rest assured that anything coming through this page will be well sorted out into new equipement, props, triggers and anything that we can come up with to help improve the potential of each individual piece of content being produced on the channel. \u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003eThanks again for stopping by, I really appreciate it and I look forward to having you here too! \u003cbr\u003e-Dalton   \u003cbr\u003e"
