    "summary": "Hi everybody! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Daniel Levine and for as long as I can remember I\u0027ve been writing short stories and essays, producing and directing films, and just generally creating things and performing comedy or politics in the streets, the internet, coffee shops and anywhere else I seem to find myself. For most of this time I\u0027ve done this for no money or at an eventual loss, though a couple people have been very generous the times I\u0027ve needed financial help to finish projects. On this combination of elbow grease and the kindness of strangers and friends I\u0027ve managed to release a book and a comedy album, finish two feature films and several shorts, and more than 100 essays and film reviews this way.\u00a0 If I had the resources to continue doing that, I would, and I would continue to release my work to world for free or at as low a cost as I can manage. I have done everything from painting houses to writing infomercial copy to walking dogs to washing dishes to subsidize this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I can continue to do that, with your help. But this isn\u0027t just about me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not sure what would make you, the patron, feel most appreciated, but I have a massive backlog of unreleased work in various forms including an entire feature length rough cut of Plain Songs that was scrapped, several dozen short stories, a 250 page memoir I think is substantially better than the book I published, and several thousand still photographs. That\u0027s what I can remember off the top of my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I keep making more every day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I could release/serialize some or all of that exclusively to patrons if that\u0027s what would \nmake you feel like \"Hey, you know what, I should throw this guy a couple\n bucks a month.\" Even when you\u0027re making a lot of your own equipment with cardboard and duct tape, it costs money and takes time and energy to produce videos and maintain the modest set-up that allows me to make all this stuff and distribute it. The upside of that is that even a small monthly contribution makes a huge difference in how much time I can spend making things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs those of you who know me personally are aware, I love to discussing just about anything with anybody, so maybe I could schedule a chat with you on some regular basis. Maybe I can do both things if there\u0027s interest. Any feedback or suggestions are actively solicited.\u003cbr\u003e"
