Every week we will talk about important stories from the worlds of politics and pop culture, both on and off-line, in a way that will never bore you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow us to cover all of our production costs, which will continue to increase as we improve the quality of the show. Costs will also increase as we increase the number of shows we put out each week, which we hope to do as soon as we are financially able. It will also allow us to put the time and effort into the show to make it something really special. We don\u0027t want to make a boring podcast where we talk at you for an hour and afterward you go about your day as normal. We want to contribute, both within the podcast form and through other avenues, to the construction of a Left that isn\u0027t just right on the issues: we want to win on the issues. We also want to have A LOT of fun, as any sustainable movement needs to revitalize folks, not just depress them. We hope you\u0027ll join us in experimenting with new ideas and organizing structures for a Left that wins! A tiny contribution of $5 or more each month will help us achieve this goal.\u003cbr\u003e"
