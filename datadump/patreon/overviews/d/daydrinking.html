    "summary": "Scott and Colette are true television connoisseurs who are not discriminatory in their viewing habits. Their favorites run the gamut from the trashiest Bravo reality shows to award-winning foreign language documentaries. Both have been blogging their opinions for well over a decade, and are co-hosts of the Big Brother Gossip Show, a podcast that routinely hits the Top 5 of the iTunes podcast charts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDay Drinking With Scott and Colette was originally a bonus show offered to Patrons of the Big Brother Gossip Show. With that show on hiatus, they are carrying on the Day Drinking podcast. Every Wednesday, Scott and Colette will continue to pour themselves a stiff drink or two and inform you as to what is coming up on TV and streaming services over the next week. Noteworthy TCM classics are also highlighted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor us to do this show, however, we need your help. We are a strictly indie D.I.Y. production. We\u0027re not part of a podcast network that underwrites, promotes, and supplies advertising sponsors. We hate asking for cash, but both of us have some bills to pay. Patreon is great for people like us. You can pledge a buck per episode. Or you can give us two bucks, five bucks, twenty bucks, or however much you want. You will only be charged whenever a show is produced, so you don\u0027t have to worry if for some reason we have to skip a week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who support the show through Patreon, we are offering some great rewards. There are bonus shows that recap recent Bravo broadcasts. There is a weekly newsletter that works as a guide to every show we talk about on Day Drinking. There\u0027s even a level that allows you to advertise your business or product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so excited to continue on with this show, and we are so appreciative of all who support us. Please help us spread the word to anybody who enjoys TV as much as we do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again!\u003cbr\u003eScott and Colette"
