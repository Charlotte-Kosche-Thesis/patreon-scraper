    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThanks for dropping by my Patreon page!\u003c/div\u003eMy name\u0027s Eric Burns-White, and I\u0027ve been writing on the Internet for over thirty years, dating back to the days when the whole place was phosphorescent green or -- if you were really swank -- amber and entirely made out of ASCII. In my time I\u0027ve written over six million words online -- sometimes even sequentially. I\u0027m best known for \u003cstrong\u003eWebsnark\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0a critical commentary blog that got some traction in the mid-oughts with a lot of coverage of webcomics, cartoons, pop culture and \u0027stuff\u0027 that action hero Wednesday White and I wrote. I also started \u003cstrong\u003eBanter Latte\u003c/strong\u003e: a fiction and poetry site which featured serialized work. Among other things, this included \"Interviewing Leather\" -- the story of a gonzo journalist wannabe interviewing a C-List supervillain -- and \u003cem\u003eLovelace\u00bd -- \u003c/em\u003ethe story of a normal enough fourteen year old girl who stopped being quite so normal one day. I spent some time in the RPG development trenches, including being nominated for the prestigious Golden ENnie award (and being part of a win), and working for companies like Decipher and Steve Jackson Games on properties ranging from the wild west to the Angel-and-Demonpunk cool of \u003cem\u003eIn Nomine\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0straight through to licensed work for \u003cem\u003eStar Trek\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ve also spent the last few years getting increasingly comfortable with CGI and digital art -- opening up artistic avenues for me that honestly I\u0027ve never been able to pursue before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVarious issues took me out of the public arena except for the occasional essay and Twitter sniping, but I\u0027ve really wanted to come back and write. It\u0027s what keeps me sane. And obviously, I need to make some kind of money while doing it. However, I\u0027ve discovered that as much as I adore writing... I have a day job I love -- working in the technology sector for a truly amazing school -- and that means I can\u0027t drop everything and write against deadline for twenty hours a day any more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I don\u0027t have to -- we live in the future, where anyone can publish and seek the audience they can find. So that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do -- and I hope you\u0027ll want to support the effort and come along with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, I work on \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFolios\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Why Folios? Because I\u0027m pretentious and it\u0027s fun. Each Folio is going to include several pieces of fiction, with a minimum word count of 25,000 words (more if certain goals are met) produced per month. When the Folio\u0027s complete, I\u0027ll compile it into a single PDF and send it out to the people who\u0027ve pledged for it. That 25,000 words is my \u003cem\u003ecommit\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0-- that\u0027s the minimum I\u0027ll do in a given month. With various goals having been met, \u003cstrong\u003emy current commit is 40,000 words plus a Myth.\u003c/strong\u003e Because of my work schedule, there are times of the year when I may not be able to get through that commit. When that\u0027s the case, I\u0027ll suspend the Patreon so that people aren\u0027t charged on the first of the following month. I know a good number of my patrons (who are amazing people) wouldn\u0027t mind if I charged for a null month, but \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0mind. So this is how I reconcile my day job and my writing and still feel like a decent person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat kinds of things will I write? Stuff about superheroes, science fiction and fantasy, some horror, some essays and critical work, some poetry, some straight up contemporary fiction, a little experimental stuff here and there, and lots of humor. Some projects include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustice Wing \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(001JW) -- \u003c/em\u003ea somewhat familiar superheroic world, often examining how places like that work, best known for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://banter-latte.annotations.com/frequently-asked-questions/interviewing-leather/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInterviewing Leather\u003c/a\u003e and its sequel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://banter-latte.annotations.com/tag/interviewing-trey/\"\u003eInterviewing Trey\u003c/a\u003e. In ways, this is the fictional universe where I work out the logical hows and whys of superheroing as we\u0027ve always seen it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLovelace 1/2\u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e(012LL)\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0-- the story of fourteen year old Andi Gannett-Moore. Andi\u0027s a likable if sardonic athlete who makes friends easily and struggles with academics... until one day she stops getting wrong answers and starts doing math as fast as she can write, while remembering literally everything she\u0027s ever seen or heard... and learning the world\u0027s a stranger place than she ever knew.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCorbett-877\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003e(877CB) -- \u003c/em\u003eThe story of Captain Liam Corbett of the A.F.S. \u003cem\u003eVigilant --\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0who heads off on an ordinary mission, transmitting to a planet\u0027s surface... only to find himself in an afterlife populated by the souls of the unmourned... including eight hundred and seventy six \u003cem\u003eother \u003c/em\u003eLiam Corbetts...\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImperial Space \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(633IPS) --\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0A semi-hard science fiction universe of the far future, occupying the Venn diagram between \u003cem\u003eTraveller, Babylon 5, \u003c/em\u003eand contemporary politics and culture. Probably best known for \u003cem\u003eTheftworld\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMythic Heroes\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003e(023SG) -- \u003c/em\u003eFor literally decades, I\u0027ve produced stuff for a shared fictional universe called \u003cem\u003eSuperguy\u003c/em\u003e. A lot of what I wrote for it\u0027s terrible, mind, but I\u0027ve got a lot of affection for it, and after all these years I want to bring those characters out into a broader marketplace and make them earn their keep. As I don\u0027t own the \u003cem\u003erest\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of that shared universe, \u003cem\u003eMythic Heroes\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is my reworking of those stories into a \u003cdel\u003echeap knockoff\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0standalone pastiche. Sometimes very serious, sometimes entirely silly, sometimes starring fish.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd many more, all with their own silly alphanumeric codes! Thrill to 320SF! Be amazed by 954ALT! Never actually see anything in 444TH!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThese codes, for the record, are part of a multiverse project I call \u003cem\u003eNinespace\u003c/em\u003e, which means in one conceptual sense these are all taking place in a single cosm, with recurring themes and counterparts and crossovers where appropriate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the level you choose, you\u0027ll get access to short stories before and after publication, drafts of novels, advance posts destined for Banter Latte or Websnark, backstory and conceptual bits that won\u0027t appear anywhere else (unless they do. I mean, forever\u0027s a long time, right?), and even some stuff destined for \"holy crap this still exists?\" lists like \u003cem\u003eSFStory\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eSuperguy \u003c/em\u003e(with notes to make it possible to know what\u0027s going on... sort of. It\u0027s a long story. Seriously, seriously long.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested, I look forward to having you come along with me. If not -- hey, that\u0027s cool too. Free stuff will still appear on \u003cem\u003eBanter Latte\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and hopefully even \u003cem\u003eWebsnark\u003c/em\u003e, and if you follow the progress of the Folios you\u0027ll even know what to expect. And hey... if you pledge enough... you can actually help determine what \u003cem\u003eBanter Latte\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0stories get worked on next, or even commission unique bits of writing or art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t pledge or just don\u0027t want to, but have been following my other (too often) sparse work on \u003cem\u003eBanter Latte\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eWebsnark, \u003c/em\u003edon\u0027t worry. Like I said above, all posts tagged Banter Latte or Websnark \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be posted on those sites at no cost the day after they appear on Patreon, just like they always have. In particular the stories that were \u003cem\u003estarted\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on Banter Latte will be \u003cem\u003efinished\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on Banter Latte -- none of this\u003cem\u003e \u0027oh you like Andi Gannett-Moore? Then you better pay up\u0027\u003c/em\u003e junk. By the time a Folio\u0027s released, all those posts will be up on the free sites -- it\u0027s just earlier drafts will be put out on Patreon first. And if none of this is your cup of tea? No worries. There\u0027s lots of fun stuff on Patreon -- keep looking and you\u0027ll find it. Either way, thanks for stopping by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
