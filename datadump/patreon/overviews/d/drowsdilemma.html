Call me Sidhe [shee]! I am a writer who, in the past couple years, got into writing erotica in a one-on-one roleplay setting. I\u2019ve had quite a few great projects, but there is one in particular that really stands out enough that I would like to share it with the world. When it began, I was in a bad place emotionally (to put it lightly.) But this isn\u2019t about my sob story. This is about celebrating the project that brought me out of my dark place and gave me a future that I can look forward to with joy and excitement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Drow\u2019s Dilemma was a concept that changed my life; It was why my husband and I met and fell in love. The content we both worked on may not be ground-breaking or life changing, but we did (and still do) find it to be an exciting journey through the world that we are, to this day, creating and developing. Writing together so closely turned out to be excellent couple\u2019s therapy, which caused a deep bond between us. Our love sent me on a journey most of the way across the country to live in a place I\u2019d never been to, with a family that I hadn\u2019t met before. The adventures within the story led me on the biggest, best adventure of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut enough about the sappy stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Project Itself:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Drow\u2019s Dilemma, as was mentioned before, is a project that we have been working on for over two years. Because of this, there\u2019s enough content to support a weekly or even bi-weekly update of chapters for years to come (and that\u2019s not even counting the mind-boggling amount of content that we have planned but have yet to write). Seriously. There\u2019s so much great content that I can keep doing this indefinitely if enough people are interested. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now and the foreseeable future, all of the edited content will be made available for free on Literotica. I am doing this because truly I am undertaking this project because I want to share it with the world (or, at least, the part of the world that enjoys erotica.) This Patreon is for those who enjoy the story enough to encourage me to keep updating. I have started a new life in an unfamiliar area, and don\u0027t have the funds for a plane ticket to visit my family on occasion. The current goal of this patreon is to raise enough for me to visit my old home on a yearly basis. That, and to test the waters to see if it\u0027s possible for me and the hubby to make it as writers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you in advance to anyone who made it here and decided to subscribe to my content!\u003c/strong\u003e"
