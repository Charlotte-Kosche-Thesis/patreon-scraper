    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j145/cdjameson/Trip_zpsqucpbwew.png\"\u003eI started\u00a0my channel\u00a0on\u00a0Aug 3, 2013.\u00a0Really I had\u00a0no idea what I was doing to begin with. I had never recorded myself. I had never uploaded a video to any kind of social media. In fact, I loathed social media for\u00a0what I percieved as its primary\u00a0purpose of promoting false representations of ourselves. But I was willing to forgo all of that negativity if it meant I could express and share something creative which I had made. I found very quickly that socia media platforms are not in all cases abused for the purpose of self\u00a0aggradizement. There are in fact large\u00a0positive groups of interlinked\u00a0creatives out there who\u0027s only purpose is to help each other become better\u00a0at whichever craft they\u0027ve chosen. A truly remarkable act of community in the modern age. I now believe\u00a0things like\u00a0Youtube, or any other media sharing platform for that matter, can be described best as the following: \u003cstrong\u003ea mirror\u003c/strong\u003e. They reflect back at us what we project on to them. With that belief I create for my channel. It\u0027s all too tempting to create for the clicks, the money, the easy popularity, but in the end it would be hollow. Reflected back\u00a0at me would be shallowness, endless pointless videos, and nothing I could be ever be proud of beyond its purely\u00a0statistical success. And\u00a0numbers don\u0027t keep you\u00a0warm at night, making something memorable does. Another way of saying\u00a0this is that I believe in quality not quantity. And I mean that in all things. Not just in regard to the content I create but for the community of people who consume it. \u003cstrong\u003e100 people who truly care about what you create is worth\u00a0infinitely more than a massive number who only tune in to watch you\u00a0churn out garbage for mass consumption\u003c/strong\u003e. It is for that reason I have created my Patreon. Patreon creates the opportunity for smaller passionate creators to compete with larger channels through the force of their stronger community. Where I do not really know if I could ever become a full time creator on Youtube through subscribership, I am certain I can do it with enough support on Patreon. Because of you, I could eventually become a full time creator and dedicate myself entirely to improving my craft. The result of full-time creation\u00a0would be a constant stream of new and ever evolving content. I\u00a0would be proud of creating this content,\u00a0and my community could enjoy it,\u00a0knowing in large part they were directly responsible for its existence. And that, is ultimately my goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j145/cdjameson/Growth_zpslynwhwi6.png\"\u003eThe support I receive on Patreon\u00a0will be re-invested directly\u00a0back into the channel. The supporters that wish to participate more, can, through Patreon. As I reach each monetary goal a different part of the channel will improve, and there is a lot to improve. The more that I can improve the more creative I become.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://eglobaldigitalcameras.com.au/images/canonfamily.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know more specifics check out the milestones and goals I have and other rewards for donating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j145/cdjameson/Vids_zpsic5kgahq.png\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ajLnUXnvSLA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lW1y31tAt3s\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bC8CmCbB1Is\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L8AUkJJXhfs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
