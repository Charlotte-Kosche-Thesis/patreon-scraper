It incentivizes training by giving you opportunities to earn recognition for bite sized amounts of training. In the Core Skills you will learn the 11 skills you and your dog need to know to be happy, safe, and valued members of your community. These are the only skills you need to earn your ranks. There are new skills being added all the time so keep looking for more activities to do with your dog!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003eRanks\u003c/h1\u003eJust like in a karate dojo, you will progress through Ranks. Instead of colored belts, we use colored leads. There are 6 ranks. When you start you are automatically a \u201cWhite Lead\u201d, next comes Yellow, then Green, then Red, then Brown, and lastly Black. The first 3 ranks are about basic good dog ownership and safety. Red is about off leash training. Brown and Black are for the most serious dog owners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003eThe Core Skills\u003c/h1\u003eCore Skills are activities you progress in to earn your Lead ranks. For example, \"Stay\" in order to pass your White Lead Stay Skill you need to do the following task:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Dog is signaled to sit. A piece of food or a toy is then thrown by the tester a short distance away. Dog must remain in position. Skill ends when the dog is released by the handler\"\u003cbr\u003e\n            \u003cbr\u003eIf you accomplish this task you earn the White Lead Stay badge and the ability to test at the next level of this skill. This skill progresses in difficulty through the ranks up to Black Lead, which is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Put dog in a position of choice, leave dog off lead for 10 minutes while distractions are around. Minimum of 2 dogs to be tested simultaneously. Handler is given a variety of tasks to complete during the 10 minute stay which may ask the handler go out of sight of the dog\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpon completing that rank of this skill you are now a Stay Master. Complete all the 11 Core Skills up to Black Lead and your are a DogJutsu Master!\u00a0                \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are ready to take your first step into the DogJutsu, Pledge today!\u003cbr\u003e"
