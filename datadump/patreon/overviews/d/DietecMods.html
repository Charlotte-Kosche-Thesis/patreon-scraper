I am a PC modder and tech enthusiast, so you would be helping me pay for the tools, software, hardware and supplies I use to make videos on YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here because I believe this to be the most transparent and honest way to support my channel. I feel more comfortable accepting help from those with the means and the willingness to offer it rather than putting a paywall in front of anything I produce in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy particular niche is expensive, and while I am completely dedicated to my craft and willing to pay for the necessary expenses to keep my channel entertaining and informative, your support will keep me motivated and financially stable enough to produce quality videos on a regular basis. I am going to keep creating no matter what, but becoming a patron directly and immensely helps my channel and community grow!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pyWbcY9.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try my best to make as many YouTube videos I can every month. If you like what I do and want to help me grow, you can be a patron and donate a few dollars a month to help out. Simple! You could contribute as little or as much as you want, and any amount at all will get you access to a patron only news feed, and a few other little perks that bring you closer to the behind the scenes part of my channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DQ2HYQX.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have an average amount of bills and work in a construction trade, which means I am sometimes laid off and not working when there is no construction happening in my area. I still have rent to pay and food to buy, so when I\u0027m out of work my funding for YouTube is cut dramatically. Patreon is meant to be a means to supplement my costs associated with being a video creator, and so the money you contribute will go into paying for all of the hardware and software I use to keep making videos. There are always expenses, and I can guarantee all the money I receive from Patreon will go straight back into creating content for YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tHiehyZ.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should only contribute if you want to and have the means to support this channel and my work. However, I can offer you some cool little bonuses besides the satisfaction of seeing your donation at work in every video I make! Patrons will have a guaranteed line of communication with me. I do read all YouTube comments but, it is already becoming more difficult to answer them all and eventually it won\u0027t be feasible to do so. I shall make it a point to respond to every single patron message I get though. I mean, patrons do care enough to donate, it would be rude of me to not show some love right back!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be posting patron only content here on Patreon! Patron only content won\u0027t be anything life changing, as I want my videos to remain free for everyone. But if you\u0027re interested in discussing ideas for new videos, seeing some behind the scenes pictures of the process, and generally being a bit more involved with my every day life, this might be interesting to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for those who donate a little more than they really should, I can thank you by giving you a shout-out at the end of my videos, adding you to the sponsors section of my website and even modding a custom PC just for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/R6ZRCfL.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShoot, I can\u0027t afford to contribute.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry about it! My content is free, and will always remain so. If you can\u0027t afford to contribute, don\u0027t put yourself in a difficult situation! Just enjoy the show and know I appreciate you anyway. Your enjoyment and encouragement is all the support I really need to keep going :)\u003cbr\u003e"
