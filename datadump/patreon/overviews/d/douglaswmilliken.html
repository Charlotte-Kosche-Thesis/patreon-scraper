    "summary": "My name is \u003ca href=\"https://douglaswmilliken.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDouglas William Milliken\u003c/a\u003e. I write short stories and sometimes novels. As improbable as it sounds, this is my full-time job. At last count, I\u0027ve published nearly 100 pieces in journals, magazines, and the occasional podcast, seen five book projects (a novel and four chapbooks) make it into print, and been honored by a handful of really flattering awards. Most of that\u0027s happened in the past five years. A lot of years\u0027 work have been packed into those five.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s the problem. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is that writing fiction does not pay very well, or consistently, or often on time. Writers as a whole haven\u0027t gotten a pay raise in over fifty years (then and now, the going \"professional\" rate is about ten cents per word, and that\u0027s the ceiling). That said, there \u003cem\u003ehave \u003c/em\u003ebeen years when I\u0027ve been able to pay the majority of my bills with prize money and profits from stories. Other years, I\u0027ve had to rely on the savings I built up during my twenties, wrecking my body building houses and planting trees (work that I now and then still do). Because you can\u0027t always bank on that first place ribbon. And honestly, sometimes publishers flake on their debts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone familiar with the acute pinch of poverty knows the resultant burden of anxiety. And anyone who\u0027s ever suffered the shakes beneath the crushing thumb of doubt understands how stress makes you useless within any context. Add to that cocktail a matching set of diagnosed mood disorders (chronic anxiety and dysthymia), and you\u0027ve created one nasty sucking whirlpool of self-flagellation and no work getting done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fact is, if I\u0027m worrying about money, I\u0027m not writing the way I should. And in order to keep up this creative pace, I can\u0027t pursue another auxiliary job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can help calm my willy-wags by securing my basic needs (a roof, a sandwich, and two vials of medication), I can chill about money and focus my full attention on writing my next 100 stories, publishing my next five books, earning my next handful of flattering awards. Which isn\u0027t just rhetoric. I\u0027ve already finished and am seeking a publisher for a new novel, \u003cem\u003eOur Shadows\u0027 Voice\u003c/em\u003e, about the decades\u0027-long repercussions of a young boy\u0027s sudden death. There is also a second novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Ordnance of Heaven\u003c/em\u003e--about fidelity and sacrifice in the Bad Lands of South Dakota--that is nearly complete. And then there are the short stories. An interconnected sequence about a homeless man named \u003ca href=\"http://stoneslidecorrective.com/2014/09/poptimistic/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eColeman\u003c/a\u003e. An interconnected sequence about a boy named \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/YvOE5nWRUt4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRe\u003c/a\u003e.

In return, I\u0027ll give you a glimpse into a portion of my process. I\u0027ll take measures to deliver cryptic missives in your mail. I\u0027ll make a little booklet just for you.
