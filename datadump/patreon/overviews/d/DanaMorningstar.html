Some examples of a\nreward level might be participating in a patron-only chat stream, or signed\ncopies of books, making specific videos, blogs, or podcasts based on suggestions. Every\ncreator does things a little differently, and I\u0027m totally open to feedback and\nideas as to what kind of things/rewards you\u0027d like to see me to offer.  :)\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd with Patreon, you can fund me (and most\ncreators) at any dollar amount, and you can stop your funding at any time.\n It\u0027s a way to let creators know that you value the work they do, and that\nyou want to help support them so they can continue to do more work in the future.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do...but it is very time-consuming, and I\u0027d love to be able to do it full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy challenge is that I don\u0027t want to charge for what I\u0027m doing. \u00a0I\u0027d like for what I\u0027m doing to be donations-based, or paid through sponsors,\u00a0as I never want cost to prohibit someone from getting potentially life saving information or support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, what I\u0027m doing is growing faster than I can keep up with it, and\u00a0I would also like to be able to grow my team to help\u00a0spread awareness\nand hope for all those that have been through (or are going through) narcissistic abuse. \u00a0And ideally down the road if funds and a plan can come together, I can turn much of what I\u0027m doing into a non-profit.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I can raise enough\nfunds to make these things happen, then I\u2019d like to be able to do\nsomething with the funds that are over and above that amount\u2014I\u2019m thinking\nsomething along the lines of us as a community brainstorming on some different\nideas, and then voting to determine where we all would like to see those funds\ngo.  (Some ideas I\u2019ve had would be to partner\nup with other budding non-profits/activists for causes such as working to\nprovide free legal advice, more domestic violence shelters and resources (for\nboth men and women), and educational materials that can be given out to\nschools, domestic violence shelters, churches, etc. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nExamples of my work:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/164929611\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/165782630\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrequently Asked Questions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars? \u003c/strong\u003e No, you can pay in any currency. As this is US based website, everything is written in dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003eYes, please only sign up to donate what you can easily afford. Even $1 per month would make a huge difference and would be greatly appreciated. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003c/strong\u003e Yes of course! If you can\u0027t afford to donate in the future, or you need to donate less that\u0027s absolutely fine. You can just log in to change or cancel the account whenever you want.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSeriously, please don\u0027t become a patron if you cannot comfortably afford to donate - I know what that feels like - and please don\u0027t feel like you have to. I will continue making free videos, blogs, and other types of content regardless of whether or not I get any donations as I love what I do, and will continue doing it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to help, but cannot afford to donate, sharing any of my content on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, or through email really does make a HUGE difference, and is much appreciated. \u00a0...And if you aren\u2019t comfortable sharing this information either (and I totally understand that too) providing a kind and encouraging word to others in the support group, on the Facebook page, or in the comments on YouTube is invaluable, and really does go far to help get the word out about narcissistic abuse.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
