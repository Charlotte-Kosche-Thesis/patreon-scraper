    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eWhat is Patreon and why do you use it?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI love this platform to help me connect with you on a deeper level! This is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to Educate, Entertain and Encourage you and others through the story of my life on the Daddykirbs Farm.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for the valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s mostly videos about the learning and growing that takes place on my little farm. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping creators bring more value to the world by making it financially sustainable long-term. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like) per month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h4\u003e\nEvery few days I publish a new video to my YouTube channel about life and learning on my little farm. All my content is free for viewing on YouTube, but this Patreon account helps people like you support me directly. You pledge any dollar amount per month. This small pledge helps support my creative uploads and gives you and I a platform to become more familiar with each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support enables me to invest into producing free YouTube training videos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. For now I also maintain a full-time job as a Graphics Designer. I feel very blessed to have the job that I have, but someday in the future I\u0027d love to focus more on delivering content to support people as they learn Homesteading, Gardening and other Healthy Living tasks.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe equipment used to make this content has been a financial investment too. What I\u0027m using is adequate but I would love to create higher quality content in the future. I\u0027ll be saving my pennies to make this happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eI don\u0027t have money, and I thought your videos were free?\u003c/h4\u003e\nYes! My YouTube videos are free and I hope you are enjoying them. It really is no problem at all if you choose not to support me directly in this way. \n\u003cstrong\u003ePlease don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money or are struggling financially.\u003c/strong\u003e I know what that feels like and want you to take care of more important priorities first. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would love to see you\u00a0join in the conversation in the video comments on YouTube for those videos that mean the most to you. Keep in mind that one of the greatest gifts that you can give me as a creator is to share my content with your friends and family. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWho is Blake \"Daddykirbs\" Kirby?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowdy Y\u0027all! I\u0027m Blake Kirby. I live just outside San Antonio, TX to the NE. My passion and journey for learning how to grow things is recorded on my\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/daddykirbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel, Daddykirbs Farm\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy channel is not a bunch of \"How To\" videos, but rather clips that show the journey on the farm.\u00a0\u00a0Back in 2011 I moved my family out of the suburban neighborhood to a place that looks a little more country. The city isn\u0027t far away, but there is some peace and quiet down this dead end road.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince then there have been lots of mistakes made and lessons learned on the farm. Caring for gardens, orchards, chickens, ducks and goats has been a truly educational experience. I share the success and failures of the farm on YouTube and on the\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://daddykirbs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDaddykirbs\u003c/a\u003e blog.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePermaculture\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2014 I accomplished a Certification in Permaculture Design by finishing the Geoff Lawton online PDC. The direction of the farm is aimed toward harmony with nature through good design. Each project will consider the use of all available energy and resources to achieve the greatest results with the smallest inputs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rKZfB45.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCreative Adventures\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEven with this super busy life on the farm I like to try to have fun with creative posts online. This is expressed on my Instagram, Facebook and G+ profiles. I\u0027d love to see you there too!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5qJRFbi.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow You Can Help\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Support: \u003c/strong\u003eyou set an amount to tip every month to help underwrite the cost of video and blog post production. These things take time and energy. The small amount that you can give per month will help continue the demonstration and education about being good stewards of our natural resources and ecosystems. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNon-Financial Forms of Support: \u003c/h3\u003e\ncontinue to follow and SHARE my adventures and journey online. Sharing my content with your friends and family is perhaps one of the greatest gifts you can give to me. I love engaging with you through the comments on all my social media sites. You encourage me to keep doing what I\u0027m doing. This is a very valuable form of suport.
