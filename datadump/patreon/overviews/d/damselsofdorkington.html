    "summary": "We\u0027ve been making nerds laugh since 2010. Over the years, each of our three members have migrated away from the others (Missouri, Texas, and Canadia), which makes it incredibly difficult and costly to get together. To stay alive, we cut our convention appearances down, and eventually started this Patreon campaign!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have more conventions that we want to do. We have more ideas for videos. We\u0027ve even written new parody songs, and this Patreon campaign helps us to keep moving forward with those things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have come up with LOTS of goals and rewards to motivate our fans to help us out. If you\u0027ve got some extra money that you can toss our way, we are ready to put it to use. In return, we promise more content and more con appearances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t conventions pay for you to perform there?\u003cbr\u003eEach convention is different, but the short answer is \"no\". The cons do what they can to help us out, but in general, we are usually stuck with most (if not all) of our own travel costs. That\u0027s especially problematic, since we\u0027re all so far away from each other. No matter where the convention is, one of us is probably going to need to fly to get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy don\u0027t you make more parodies?\u003cbr\u003eWe want to! Unfortunately, none of us are musicians who play an actual instrument, so creating music means finding people to help us. Plus, if we\u0027re going to put something out, we want it to be good. So we also need someone who can record and mix decent audio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy don\u0027t you make more videos or a web series?\u003cbr\u003eThis goes back to wanting to put out a good product. We have an amazing friend who will produce, direct, shoot, and edit our videos for us, but it\u0027s not fair to keep asking him to do it for free. He\u0027s incredibly skilled, and he deserves compensation for the hours and hours of work he puts in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGOALS\u003cbr\u003eThese are the goals we have planned as we gain more Patrons over time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStart a podcast - ACHIEVED\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDesign new T-shirt - ACHIEVED\u003cbr\u003eAdd 2 cons to our yearly schedule - ACHIEVED\u003cbr\u003eRelease a monthly bonus episodes of the podcast - ACHIEVED\u003cbr\u003ePurchase a sound system to enhance our performances - ACHIEVED\u003cbr\u003e2 yearly video shoot for sketches\u003cbr\u003eRecord an additional episodes of the podcast each week\u003cbr\u003eAdd another con to our yearly schedule\u003cbr\u003eCreate a behind-the-scenes DVD\u003cbr\u003ePurchase audio and video equipment to shoot future performances\u003cbr\u003e"
