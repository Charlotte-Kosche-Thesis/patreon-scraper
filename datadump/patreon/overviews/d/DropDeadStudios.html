    "summary": "At Christmas, 2014, after over a year of full-time development, we released into the world Spheres of Power, a new magic system for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It was over 200 pages of new content that detailed the Spheres of Power magic system, and included 11 new base classes, new magic item creation rules, optional advanced magic, guidelines for world building and system customization, and even a list of NPCs and an ongoing story told through the prose. The book went on to be a massive success and has spread throughout the community, and the most common thing we\u0027re asked is when we\u0027ll be expanding the line.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis patreon is about expanding that line. Specifically, creating an ongoing-line of handbooks that increase and expand the Spheres of Power magic system, including new magic talents, new archetypes, new magic items, and everything else we can fit inside. With your help, we will publish a handbook a month to expand the reach of this system and give you all sorts of awesome new content for your gaming table.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat Is Spheres of Power?\u003c/h1\u003e\nSpheres of Power is a concept-based magic system, designed for Pathfinder and other D20 games. Rather than spell levels and vancian magic, Spheres of Power lets you combine magic talents to create the magic-user you desire right from the get-go, be they a mage who manipulates time, a rendition of a favorite anime character, a skillful jedi, or whatever else your world, and your imagination, could create. We kickstarted this system in 2013 to critical acclaim, and it can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129448/Spheres-of-Power\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRPG Drivethru\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy96pr?Spheres-of-Power\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePaizo.com\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/collections/drop-dead-studios/products/spheres-of-power\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eD20pfsrd.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat Will This Patreon Create?\u003c/h1\u003eThis patreon is funding a handbook a month, each one aimed at expanding Spheres of Power in a particular way. Usually, this will involve sphere handbooks; a 25-ish page book focused on a single sphere, expanding it with new talents, new archetypes, new rules, magic items, and whatever else we can think of. Once the line gets going, though, we plan to expand it, including things such as mythic guidelines, new spheres, and whatever else we can think of, and that this patreon\u0027s backers decide they want to see. Each handbook will have a custom cover, and (if we meet the goals) custom interior artwork and an ongoing story told throughout, because that\u0027s the sort of thing I love to see in a book.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
