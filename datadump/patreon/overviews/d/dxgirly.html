    "summary": "Hey guys! I\u0027m Nikki and I have 5 channels on youtube. My main channel: \"dxgirly\" is where I mostly post vlogs, and the occasional haul, subscription box opening, Q\u0026amp;A, or some other random video. On my second channel, \"dxgirly likes toys\" I will be doing Pullip doll videos on customs, reviews/hauls Etsy Pullip clothing shops, and the occasional review. On my third channel, \"dxgirly likes games\" I will be posting \"Let\u0027s Play\" videos and plan on doing the occasional review, news video, or unboxing. On my fourth channel, \"dxgirly changes\" I chronicle my weightloss journey. And finally, on my fifth channel, \"dxgirly likes BJD\u0027s\" I post Wine \u0026amp; Dollies videos and talk about my experiences with ball-jointed dolls, and other dolls, in a laid-back format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to my disability, I live on a very fixed income. With your support, I can buy new things to make videos with, like a new camera, filming equipment, dolls I can review and make videos with, new video games to play through with you, blind boxes, subscription boxes, customizing supplies, sewing supplies, crafting supplies, basically the sky is the limit. Everything is going into something I can use on youtube! Only if I am in a very tight spot will I use the money from here to pay a bill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream goal would be to travel and show it on my main channel through vlogs. I suffer from agoraphobia, and don\u0027t get out of the house much in videos.... but if I had a way to travel to exciting new places and step out of my comfort zone and take my audience with me, I\u0027d be all for it!"
