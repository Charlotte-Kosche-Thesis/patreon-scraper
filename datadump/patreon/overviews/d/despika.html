I love to create and draw\ncharacters.

I believe doing what you love allows you to be your best you \u2013\nwhere you\u2019ll be your most engaged and produce your best stuff \u2013 and my goal is\nto be able to live my life doing the things I love. I believe that\u2019s worth striving for, for everyone, and I hope to\ninspire others to do the same.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWelcome to my Patreon and thanks for stopping by!

I went to school for graphic design, but in my heart I am an illustrator. Growing up, the most frequent thing I would draw (and invariably teach myself from) were characters from Dragon Ball Z. Akira Toriyama\u0027s style greatly influenced my own, but I would also draw and be inspired by\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!,\nWarcraft, The Lord of the Rings, Naruto, and much more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eA little more about what I create...\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI create fan art as well as art of my original characters \u2013\u00a0and between a couple stories of mine, custom characters based in existing franchises, as well as characters made for roleplaying games, I feel I have quite a few awesome characters to share. Additionally, I think one of the coolest rewards I\u0027m offering is for those of you that may have original characters of your own that you\u0027d like to see brought to life. As a Hero-tier patron, you can personally look forward to special sketches of your character becoming a part of the regular content I create.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy creativity also likes to take several other forms, and I want to share that creativity with you as well. A quick list of such things include custom content for games like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons (e.g. feats, monsters, factions, campaign hooks, class/subclass design and more), custom cards and sets for popular TCGs, stories, world building, game design, and more.\u00a0I think all of that lends itself to inspiring more of my art, and it will! So if you\u0027re really only interested in the art, worry not, that will always be the focus. But if you love any of the same things I do, I think you\u0027ll really appreciate and enjoy these kinds of bonuses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDown the line,\u00a0I would also like to get more into creating comic-based art and perhaps eventually tell the stories I have in my head through that medium.\n\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eAnother quest I\u0027ve been interested in undertaking is making use of my character design work to create paper miniatures for use in tabletop games like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eA little more about my goals...\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI\u0027m in a bit of a rough spot in life, financially. While there are easier ways to go about dealing with that, I\u0027m stubbornly out to prove that I can be successful doing what I love, doing the things that make me... me. That those loves and those hobbies have value, and most importantly that the beaten path isn\u0027t the only path in life. Unfortunately, most people I know don\u0027t really understand where I\u0027m coming from on that. My immediate goal is honestly to just be able to get by on this philosophy, and to prove the path I follow is a viable one. My long term goal is to grow, to live a life worth living, and to see my stories and ideas materialize. My forever goal is\u00a0to inspire others to live for fun, especially those who feel the same as I. Your support will help me make those dreams a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd of course my goal is to improve this Patreon, the content I create, the rewards I offer, my skills, and everything else built around what you\u0027ll find here. I want to give back real value to those who support and believe in me, and I want that value to come from the core of who I am as a creator. This is just the beginning, and there\u0027s so many ways for this to grow and expand. I\u0027ll be counting on your feedback to help me do that, and to make this Patreon the best and most rewarding it can be, for both you and me.\u003cbr\u003e"
