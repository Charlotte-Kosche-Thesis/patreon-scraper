    "summary": "Thank you so much for being a part of the Meat Machine that keeps Dread Media going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you probably know, Dread Media has been published every Monday for more than TEN YEARS! And, as a listener, I\u0027m sure you also know that I\u0027ve had sponsors on and off through the years. Sponsors help big-time, but they only cover a portion of the money I\u0027ve put into this show. Whether through hardware or software or web-hosting or money for my Skype account to do interviews, Dread Media requires a financial as well as temporal sacrifice for me to run.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can provide the time, but the reality is that there are ongoing costs involved.\u00a0Rather that explicitly ask for money, and in keeping with the spirit of this community, I wanted to establish a platform wherein you, the Dreadites, can support (anonymously if you like) my ongoing work in exchange for awesome Dread Media swag. Every bit helps, and I\u0027ve set up a range of rewards for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck them out in the following sweet-ass infographics:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ton.twitter.com/i/ton/data/dm/918330599198277636/918330590885113856/SDcIVHFr.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, if you\u0027re all \"what does that mean?\" Chill out and check out the legend:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ton.twitter.com/i/ton/data/dm/918335359003500548/918335174957395970/bBNSOm76.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Thanks so much to Kyle Miller of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tgt-studios.com/\"\u003eTGT Studios\u003c/a\u003e for the infographics. See him for all your amazing woodworking needs, as well as infographics, apparently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I hope to make the Dreadites an even tighter-knit community, and keep Dread Media producing content for another Decade of Dread and beyond!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
