The achievement of that goal will allow me to increase both the quantity and quality of my music, my videos, my tabs and transcriptions as well as opening up the possibilities for things like collaborations and more. Not to mention the ability for me to finally go on tour in your area, making a special point to meet Patrons (like you) when you come to live performances. Right now my time is spread pretty thin.  In my current situation, I have to take on all the jobs within a business that markets and sells music and music related products.  And, of course, that\u0027s all in addition to being the musician and producer that\u0027s creating all of that material. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0I can\u0027t tell you how frustrating it is to have all my creative energy burned up year after year on the business side of selling my music. \u00a0I have so much more to offer as an artist and I\u0027d very much like the opportunity to finally explore that potential and share the fruits of it with you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u00a0Reaching this goal will be a giant step in that direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need funding?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not difficult to imagine how much time I need to create a song and video. \u00a0But what you might not know is that I do everything myself including every aspect of production. \u00a0This includes writing or arranging the song, writing and recording the guitar parts, keyboard parts, bass guitar parts, drum parts (played by myself and never programmed), etc. - not to mention video shoots, video editing, mixing and mastering the audio. \u00a0Even listing all of these jobs doesn\u0027t do justice to what goes into a single song and video. \u00a0Altogether, it takes me between 60 and 90+ hours to produce a single song and video. \u00a0However, right now the majority of my time and creative energy is used up by the necessity of running a business surrounding my music - and that\u0027s just to stay afloat each month. \u00a0The amount of work required in marketing, sales, bookkeeping, etc. far exceeds that of my current production time. \u00a0And even with all of that, I\u0027m barely profitable. \u00a0Suffice to say, there\u0027s a reason why musicians traditionally had businesses behind them that took care of those jobs. \u00a0It can be very difficulty to access inspiration when trying to juggle so many things all the time. \u00a0When we reach the funding goal I will be able to spend the majority of time on what I believe I do best - making music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 This is easily the best part. \u00a0The rewards are not only a way for me to thank you for ensuring the continuation of my music and helping me to grow as an artist, but they also make it possible for me to make the overall process more interactive. \u00a0This means getting to know you better and even working together on some special collaborations in the future. \u00a0The rewards are also a platform that I can constantly build on and try out new ideas. \u00a0My goal is to bring you into the process more and more as we move forward. \u00a0I can\u0027t wait!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBe sure to check out all of the rewards on the right side of the page - or scroll down to see them on mobile. \u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDon\u0027t forget to check back regularly to see what\u0027s new. \u00a0I will post updates every time I add a new reward and Patrons will be made aware of these changes automatically. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI can\u0027t tell you how much I appreciate your support, even if it\u0027s just through listening to my music, watching my videos, or sharing my content online. \u00a0If you are able to make that dollar pledge, you have my eternal gratitude. Let me add that your support is not only greatly appreciated but it also makes you a permanent part of every piece of music that I produce from here on out.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again!\u003cbr\u003eDan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif\" style=\"height: 8px; width: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
