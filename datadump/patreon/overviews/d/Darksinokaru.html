I\u2019m here to uh\u2026 awkwardly welcome you to my Patreon! I\u2019m a writer and have been obsessed with writing down words and cataloging a million ideas since I was small. I love writing, it really sets you free, either as the writer just letting your thoughts run wild with ideas and playing around with them like a cat with a ball of yarn, or jumpig into someone\u2019s words and diving head first into a world that is totally unique to that writer with perspectives and excitement abound. And I\u2019m here because I want to finally push myself to get started on what I\u2019ve wanted to do since I was small-write and publish! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u2019m in college studying to become a teacher, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019m really looking forward to. But I cannot deny the primal urge to start just start writing nonstop for hours on end! So here I am! I want to get my work properly edited and published and spread the word out there so that, and I truly hope this, others can read and have a grand time. If I can bring a smile to someone\u2019s face (I know that\u2019s gag-worthy), then I feel I did a good thing, and I want to do lots of good things for others. And this is honestly the best medium at which I can do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Why Patreon (details, details)?\u003c/strong\u003e First, I should thank anyone here looking at this page. Thank you! I hope you enjoy yourself! I\u2019m hoping that through support on Patreon I can focus on producing high-quality fiction, be it sci-fi to fantasy and everything in between. I\u2019m hoping to be able to produce quality fiction for everyone to enjoy, and when published, put a book in your hands to enjoy whenever you want (and without a screen in your face)! I work in a variety of genres with really nothing too off limits (and I like to push limits). Which I hope is something you all can enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, updates are limited to a chapter a month. And there\u2019s a reason for that. I want to make sure that I NEVER get paid without producing content. With my Patreon set for being paid per chapter, I must make sure to produce, or else! And the other reason it\u2019s limited to only one chapter per month is that I want to make sure my Patreon is affordable to everyone. I hope that eases any concerns when it comes to money and content, as I know I\u2019m someone who stresses over the cost and details. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Rewards (details, details, details, wait\u2026 free stuff? Interactive stuff?):\u003c/strong\u003e  So, like most other Patreons, I have reward tiers! They\u2019re rather simple right now, but with input from you guys, they are ripe for some major revamping! But for now, the reward tiers are as they are\u2026 which are\u2026.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1:\u003c/strong\u003e Your name will be put on a list of acknowledgments with your rank and mage type from the Samsara world! You will have my undying gratitude! It will mean so very much! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt may only be a dollar but I really do appreciate any sort of support, it means a lot. And I can\u2019t shame the $1 amount since that\u2019s all I\u2019ve been able to pledge to other talented creators on here. And hey, $1 gets you access to all the main stories!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$3:\u003c/strong\u003e In addition to the perks above, you will have access to any short stories I post, be it side stories, detailed backstories, and random shorts that are completely stand alone. You will also be able to see the other ideas I have in the pipeline and vote to choose which gets written next! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5:\u003c/strong\u003e In addition to the perks above, you will have a behind the scenes access to my writing process, what inspires me, and what gets me through tough times. Perhaps it can help you? You will also get to access to a discord server where we can all hang out, chat about writing, stories, and get exclusive information about what\u2019s happening in the work and see its progress! I may even bounce ideas off of you or ask opinions on what I\u2019m writing (I\u2019m not always all that confident\u2026 in fact, I\u2019m rather self-conscious). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10: \u003c/strong\u003eAlong with all previous perks, I will write you a short story on a theme or prompt with a word count (at my discretion of) between 1-5K words. I am also open to writing fanfiction about my own characters if you\u2019d like to see such! I also will write fanfiction of established fandoms (through the fair use right), though they must be of content I am familiar with (so mostly anime/manga). Any fiction written will be sent via a polished .pdf file via email for your personal enjoyment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$15:\u003c/strong\u003e In this tier, not only will you have officially blown my mind, but I will write something even longer, be original based on prompt or theme, or fanfiction of my own characters, or other fanfiction in general. The writings will be 5-10k words and will be sent out via a shiny .pdf file for your personal enjoyment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree stories in the works now:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Samsara\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\nIt\u2019s a world where mages and nonmags live together, however, when the economy\ntanks, agitation stirs as social and political strife surface,\nrevealing that things are not as peaceful between the two groups as once\nhad been thought.
