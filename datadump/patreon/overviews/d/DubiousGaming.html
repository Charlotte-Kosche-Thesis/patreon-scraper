My name is J Dubious and I\u0027m the creator of:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDubious Gaming\u003c/strong\u003e: A YouTube channel mostly focused on reviewing retro games, however i\u0027ll also review modern games as well as produce short gaming documentaries as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNES Chronology\u003c/strong\u003e: a series which takes \u003cstrong\u003ea chronological look at the entire Nintendo Entertainment System library\u003c/strong\u003e in a short informative review style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis game reviewing journey started back in February of 2012 when i did my first game review video of The Simpsons Arcade Game. The review has unfortunately been lost to the sands of time however from there Dubious Gaming as a channel became focused on call of duty tip videos during the \"Modern Warfare 3\" generation of the game. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever I wasn\u0027t making videos that I\u0027d actually want to watch. At the time the main YouTube reviewer i was watching was the \"Angry Video Game Nerd\" which i had started really getting into in December of 2011. I found retro game reviews to be far more compelling and having mostly played modern games for a few years up until that point i decided to review a few retro games from my childhood. This started with an LJN game I remembered being good; Maximum Carnage for the SNES and my favorite puzzle game of all time; Tetris Attack.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor months the channel slowly grew however in August of 2013 my first video to be featured anywhere was featured on retrowaretv.com\u00a0. This review of a Satellaview only game called \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5wuypJbSMQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eExcitebike: Bun Bun Mario Battle Staidum\u003c/a\u003e\" got the channel more attention that ever before and it was around this time I realized that people might actually want to hear my opinions on retro games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich leads us to today. Over \u003cstrong\u003e5 years\u003c/strong\u003e and over \u003cstrong\u003e200 videos\u003c/strong\u003e later this channel is still going strong. Over the years I\u0027ve invested thousands of dollars into gear and equipment to create the best possible videos and I can happily say with the exception of some lights and a few small items all the gear necessary to make great content has now been purchaced.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn May 31st NES Chronology launched taking over the daunting task of reviewing every officially released NES title. In order to accomplish this task in a timely manner I need to review 5 games a week and even then the project will take about 3 years to accomplish. This is a massive time commitment and with your help though Patreon i\u0027ll be able to continue releasing the series every weekday by helping me afford to live while I work on this project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
