    "summary": "I want to create the kind of art that I love.  It\u2019s the only way I know how to give back to my community, and I hope the community will want to support me while I create it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u2019t want to be hired on as a photographer taking photos of something I don\u0027t care about, and making art that I hate and sharing that frustration with everyone. I also don\u0027t want to work for a company that forces me to make art that is ultimately designed to pull dollars out of your pocket. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve been struggling to find a platform for ongoing support where I can release content (and get paid). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve gotten to know myself as a creator, a photographer, a videographer, and I thrive on instant gratification and a direct connection to my audience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI know my fanbase.  You\u2019re smart, kind, supportive, future-platform embracing people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I do flies in the face of most conventional approached to photography.  I release all of my artistic content for free.  I don\u2019t accept payment from models and I don\u2019t let people hire me.  It protects my artistic integrity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is how I like it.  Not everybody likes it or wants to pay for it. That\u2019s fine.  But if you want it, It\u2019s yours, its everybody\u2019s. You can take it, you can share it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut to DO this, I need support.  True patronage.  Those willing to be the driving engine to pay for equipment, spaces, models.  I need a salary and a budget.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI REALLY believe in the future of crowd-power and what companies like Patreon are doing.  It isn\u2019t world news, because it is what it is: a quiet, underground network of artists connecting directly with their supporters, bypassing the entire commercial system.  It is awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn these days of negativity, the bright side of the internet is how we can really save art in an art-economy that is floundering.  This means YOU need to step up and support the artists you like.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo how does this work? (Q\u0026amp;A)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to support me in the creation of new photography, tutorials, videos, collaboration, and other unpredictable art-pieces, this is the place.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: How do I help?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA:You sign up and pledge to support me \u2018per piece.\u2019 For example, Lets say you pledge $3 per piece.  If I post 2 pieces in a month: I make $6. If I post 0 pieces in a month: I make $0.  Seems fair, right?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: But what if you post 10 pieces! I\u2019ll have to pay $30! If you post 100 I\u2019ll have to pay $300!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Calm down, don\u2019t worry. You can set a monthly cap. Only want to support up to $10/month? How about even just up to $1/month?  That\u2019s fine. No matter how much you are able to pledge, I appreciate your support. You are awesome for supporting a local artist, and you will still get access to all of the pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: Why per piece?  Why not per month?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: What if I did 2 amazing projects and I want to share them with you? If I did this monthly, I would be tempted to wait until next month to share it to meet that quota.  This way I can release as soon as something comes out, and since you will set a cap, you will never donate more than you want to!  Also, what if I need a break from all of this and don\u2019t make anything for a month.  You won\u0027t be charged.  I would feel guilting for taking money if I hadn\u2019t done anything to deserve it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: Does Patreon accept paypal?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Yes.\u003cbr\u003e"
