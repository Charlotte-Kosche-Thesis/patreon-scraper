    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.non-gravity.com\"\u003eMatthew Melis\u003c/a\u003e, a member of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://straylines.org\"\u003eStray Lines comic collective\u003c/a\u003e and in collaboration with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dublincomicarts.ie/thecomicslab/\"\u003eThe Comics Lab\u003c/a\u003e, organizer of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dublincomicarts.ie\"\u003eDCAF, the Dublin Comic Arts Festival\u003c/a\u003e. DCAF is an ongoing series of small press comic book events in Dublin, created to showcase local comic creators and celebrate the spectrum of Irish sequential art. The small press comic scene has been growing in Ireland for years, but Irish comic creators often travel across the globe to find Comic Arts Festivals to exhibit their work. We felt it was time for some Comic Arts Festivals closer to home!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dublincomicarts.ie/decaf/DSC_2324.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first event was on April 23rd, 2017 and\u00a0it was a wild success! We\u0027re just over a year old now with 5 events under our belt. After bouncing around for much of 2017 we\u0027re currently settled in the Generator Hostels in Smithfield Square. As successful as DCAF has been, sometimes I still lose money organizing. More money than I can regularly afford to lose. I\u0027m trying to do everything above board, so no one works for free or worse, for exposure.\u00a0If DCAF is going to support artists, it first needs to support itself!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dublincomicarts.ie/decaf/DSC_2347.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur hope in crowdfunding DCAF, is to take the burden off of exhibitors. I chose Patreon because DCAF is not a one-off. It is recurring, it is ongoing.\u00a0Most comic events are funded by sponsors and exhibitor table fees.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://nongravity.tumblr.com/tagged/postmortem\"\u003eI know from experience\u003c/a\u003e, exhibitor table costs can make it really difficult to make any money at an event. If we can raise just $300 a month, the DCAF budget is covered, that means, creators can table at DCAF for free!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dublincomicarts.ie/decaf/DSC_2379.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce DCAF is out of the red, once it\u0027s sustainable, we can do more and more exciting things! What kind of exciting things you ask? Why, fly in guests and panelists! Create a DCAF anthology! Create a DCAF grant to help creators produce their work!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dublincomicarts.ie/decaf/DSC_2369.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get in return? Well first you get a thriving quarterly market full of creators (that\u0027s DCAF, I\u0027m talking about DCAF). Then we have our tiers of rewards. We record our Comics Lab panels and upload them to Patreon. Our talented exhibitor pool create original hand-drawn postcards that we mail to you! If you\u0027re a fan of surprise mini-comics in the mail, we will mail you some! If you\u0027re one of many Irish living abroad, you can even get an entire DCAF digest of mini-comics mailed to you on the regular! Keep your finger on the pulse of the Dublin small press comic scene! And if you want to go completely OTT, you can become DCAF\u0027s sponsor! We will put your logo on all of our posters/flyers/website/social media and give you primo location at the event to advertise or sell your wares!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting small press comics in Ireland!\u003cbr\u003e"
