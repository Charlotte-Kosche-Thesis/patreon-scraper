    "summary": "Howdy all! I\u0027m an indie dev, I make really random small to medium sized horror games and I upload them to itchio and Gamejolt for people to enjoy.  Right now, I\u0027m currently working \non a big project called Dracula\u0027s Castle. It\u0027s an action adventure horror game where you play as a vampire hunter seeking Dracula in his magnificent castle. You must traverse this castle and defeat all sorts of monsters like, spiders, skeletons, ghouls, ghosts and well, it\u0027s chock full of various enemies. The game is currently in alpha and there are two alphas already available to download on my Itchio page and I will be releasing the last alpha \nbuild as soon as it\u0027s ready. After that last alpha is released, I\u0027ll be finishing the game\u0027s last 5 floors and boss floor. Once that\u0027s done, just gotta polish the game then release it onto Itchio for maybe 5 bucks and MAYBE I\u0027ll release it on Steam. I\u0027ll try anyway... Oh and don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t charge you to \ndownload these alphas, they\u0027re all free. I won\u0027t pull a \"Hello Neighbor\" on \nyou and charge you 25 bucks just to play the alphas, that\u0027s lame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I hope you\u0027ll support me and help motivate me to continue to making awesome horror games. If you wanna check out my games and my game page, here\u0027s a link to my Itchio page. \u003ca href=\"https://dave-microwaves-games.itch.io/\"\u003ehttps://dave-microwaves-games.itch.io/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I guess I\u0027ll see you in the microwave... I\u0027m trying to come up with something, don\u0027t judge me!\u003cbr\u003e"

The \ngoal is that if I reach 150 dollars, I\u0027ll give everyone here a free copy\n of Dracula\u0027s Castle when it releases onto Itchio. (Hopefully if I \nrelease it onto Steam then I\u0027ll give you Steam keys instead)\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027ll\n Steam broadcast me playing the game from beginning to end, I dunno if I\n can Twitch stream it cause I have no clue how to even use twitch and \nstream with it, so I think Steam broadcast is the easiest way to go.\u003cbr\u003e",
