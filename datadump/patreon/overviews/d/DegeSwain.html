    "summary": "Look, guys, we need\nto talk.  No, no, it\u0027s nothing bad\u2026 it\u0027s\njust\u2026 I\u0027ve been thinking a lot lately, and I wanted to see how you felt about\nthis\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI think I\u0027m finally\nready to make a commitment with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI know, it\u0027s a big\nstep, and it\u0027s one that we\u0027ve been talking about for a while, but I really want\nyou to know how important you are to me, and how much I adore your love and\nsupport.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI know I can be a\npain sometimes, that I\u0027ve been known to slip off and dally with other arts and\u2026\nI\u0027ll be honest, I\u0027m still going to do that. \nIt\u0027s just in my blood.  I\u0027m a\npoly-artistic person, but you knew that when we first got together.  By committing to you, though, I\u0027m saying that writing will always be first.  I promise that you\u0027ll always hear from me on\nFridays, that you\u0027ll be the top of the list, and that I won\u0027t make plans with\nother arts if you and I already have a date.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePart of that big\ncommitment is also letting you in a bit more to the inner sanctum of my\nheart.  I mean, sure, you probably saw\n\"Inconsolable\" over on the Good Men Project, so you might think that\nI only write the heart-wrenching relationship stories, or maybe you bought the\nNovember 2015 copy of Vitality and read \"Milk, Bread, Eggs\" and you\nthink I\u0027m a superhero writer - and you\u0027d be totally correct.  But I also have this other space-faring\nscience fiction story going on, and there\u0027s also this fantasy story I think\nyou\u0027ll love, and then there\u0027s the novels\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOh, you\u0027re going to\nlove the novels\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, I guess what I\u0027m\nreally trying to say is, I want to take this a lot more seriously, but it\nreally sucks being the only one in a relationship.  What do you say?  Are you with me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for\nyou:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou\u0027ll get weekly\nserials, first votes on new story lines, and even some coaching on writing and\ncreativity, if that\u0027s your thing.  I\nproduce a staggering amount of content, and while a good chunk of it will be\nsubmitted for publication to a wide variety of magazines and agents and such,\nyou will get your very own well-crafted stories to yourselves (and eventual\nprinting). \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027ll get first\nnews about stories I\u0027ve sold, tours I\u0027m on (if we get that far), and special\ncoupons/pricing for books in the future. \nThis platform is as close as I come to self-publishing, as my ultimate\ngoal is to sell stories, get an agent, publish novels, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, food is always\nnice, but more importantly, I have a very expensive pet that requires\nupkeep:  my youngest son, who is severely\nepileptic and autistic.  In addition to\nhaving spendy medications, he also requires a lot of attention and availability\non my part, making it really hard to take a regular full-time job.  I do contract periodically as a social media\nmanager, but that work doesn\u0027t come nearly as frequently as my story ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, this is kind of\na win-win, if we can pull it off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
