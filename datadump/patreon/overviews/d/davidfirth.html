Back then my goal was to be on TV. I wanted to be the next South Park or something. Eventually I had meetings with TV people and found out it\u0027s all a load of bullcrap and South Park is one in a million. Everyone else on TV does as they are told and there is no place for free expression. So like most animators I make stuff exclusively online, where it\u0027s pretty much uncensored. It doesn\u0027t matter where it ends up - all that matters is that I can do it without being watered down by advertisers or people who think they know best.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,230,148);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is that it doesn\u0027t pay the bills. This stuff is all really hard work. Youtube ads are a small help, but unless you are putting multiple vids a week, they pay very little. An average project takes WEEKS to MONTHS of solid work, yet roughly makes around $1 per 1000 views in ad revenue. That isn\u0027t much, especially as Youtube doesn\u0027t tend to feature much animation since the \"viewer engagement\" doesn\u0027t typically reach their standards. To make a living from Youtube revenue I would have to really start cutting corners and making broader stuff to get more views. That is not my style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorse still, in efforts to appease more advertisers, Youtube have started removing monetization from anything that may be remotely shocking or offensive to anyone. This seems to include satire and jokes as well as cartoon violence, all of which feature prominently in my works. I would never compromise this for advertisers.\u00a0When I first started putting stuff online the sense of freedom of expression was exciting. These days it is starting to look a bit like daytime TV with some Orwell thrown in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027d just be nice to just keep putting stuff out the way I want, for the people that want to see it. I don\u0027t want to have to change the content to make it more appealing to wide audiences. That\u0027s how creativity dies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229,185,183);\"\u003eThe point\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you chaps come in.\u00a0After all this time, many of you have stuck around, and many more have climbed aboard, even though I haven\u0027t released much recently. I applaud the patience of my fans and followers. I never stopped creating, I just strive to continuously do new things, bigger and better and it takes a long time. I have so many projects running and I know they\u0027ll all get done. I just need a bit of support. If you could throw me a few Pounds, Dollars, Euros, Yen or Aussiecoins then my stuff will continue to appear before your eyes. Developing in to unknown worlds of creativity and sillyness rather than being sucked dry by the banal machine. And if I fail to deliver the goods then you can retract your happy pennies and spend them on bubblegum. Does it sound like a deal? Yes it does."
