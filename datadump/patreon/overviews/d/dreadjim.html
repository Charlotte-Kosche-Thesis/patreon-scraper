In Digital Art nowadays, it is no longer just about being able to draw, draw, and draw. It is also about understanding design language, and that\u0027s where all the tools/software and resources come in handy. My work processes+detailed walk-throughs monthly will enable you to become a stronger artist overall, this platform is the best way to share whilst not compromising my students who are coming to classes onsite, as well as supporting me to spend more time crafting out these processes to help and share and create artworks for YOU!\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n+I train fundamentals in understanding art.

Check.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn a nutshell, there\u0027s already a ton of videos out there from artists that show how they paint and draw, I am not going to be doing the same. I am going to show you the LOWDOWN on how to do what you WANT fast, almost as if I am training you to work in the game industry-mindset.
