I\u2019m a Magazine Collage Artist, which means I\u2019m ripping or cutting up magazines and using that for my artwork. I don\u2019t use paint or markers, its all paper. I started doing this after a double jaw surgery in 2013 when my mother gave me magazines to keep me busy as I recovered. Prior to being an artist, I was a corporate producer/videographer for 35 years. I\u2019m living proof that its never to late to change the path you are on in life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy Patreon?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see my Patreon page to be a pumped up version of my Facebook page and Youtube channel with more content.  That will take some work to give you quality posts and that\u2019s why I choose this membership site.  It\u2019s an opportunity for you to get detailed information on what it takes to make these collages and an inside look at the art business. Plus, its a way for creators, like me, to get paid for the time and effort it will take.  Pledges start at only $2 a month.  That\u2019s like one cup of black coffee a month. Don\u2019t worry, you can always change your level of subscription or cancel any time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I Offer\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat you\u2019ll get is access to \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d of my artwork, as well my perspective of life as an artist, sprinkled in with a bit of inspiration. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFor you artists out there, or those who just appreciate my style, I\u2019ll explain my technique\u00a0as I work on these collages through gobs of photos and a few videos per month.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMany of my videos will be unlisted on YouTube (\u003cem\u003emeans they can\u0027t be seen without knowing the link\u003c/em\u003e) that you will only get to see here.  Any \"big\" videos (\u003cem\u003esomething cool, like a time lapse or year end video\u003c/em\u003e), you\u0027ll get to preview first before it\u0027s public on YouTube.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eOccasionally, I\u0027ll give you my two cents regarding advice on selling art online, art festivals, and my perspective on the art business.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAnd for anyone who is not happy with what they are doing for a living, I hope to inspire you and maybe even motivate you to make a change like I did! \u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePlus, you will have my deepest gratitude for your pledge.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I Plan to do with your Pledge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo run a business, and selling art is a business, it takes money.\u00a0 Your membership will allow me to make more artwork for more people; provide you with a quality Patreon channel with more videos; and create opportunities for me to apply to more art festivals or events - especially those out of town that require hotel and travel expenses.  And finally, some day, some how, I would love a better studio space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sincerely appreciate your interest in my art and especially for your generous support of this endeavor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrent hometown: \u00a0Akron, Ohio, U.S.A.\u003cbr\u003e"
