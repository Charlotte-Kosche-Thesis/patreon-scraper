    "summary": "My name is Dave Zaboski and I\u0027m a professional artist, illustrator, children\u0027s book author and \u00a0former Disney Animator. I worked on films from the Second Golden Age of Animation like \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"The Lion King,\" \"Pocahontas,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" Hercules,\" \"Fantasia 2000\" and others. I\u0027ve painted for the Dalai Lama, been the expedition artist in search of a lost temple in the Andes and had a wonderfully creative career making art. I\u0027m returning to my love of animation with this project in conjunction with the Lucidity Festival\u0027s Mythos Project. The Mythos Project is simply about telling stories resonant for our time. (\u003ca href=\"http://2016.lucidityfestival.com/the-lucidity-mythos-project/).\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://2016.lucidityfestival.com/the-lucidity-myth...\u003c/a\u003e Last year I directed the short film \"Luci\" to describe our journey through the cosmos so far, and which you can see at this link:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9HNBaQQvyM\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9HNBaQQvyM\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThat short film was intended to tell the story of the Lucidity Festival\u0027s first four chapters. Using poster art from the first four years of the festival we told the story of Luci\u0027s awakening (Awake In Your Dreams), her connection to her true voice and story (The Totem\u0027s Return), her hero\u0027s journey (Universe) and her realization of her collective oneness and what\u0027s next for humanity (Kindred Quest.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis next chapter, Crossroads, is so timely it\u0027s scary. When our Kindred Quest comes to the Crossroads, we have to make a choice: Will we settle for the status quo and live in the shadow of what we already know is obsolete? Or will we trust our own truth and make a break for the light? This moment, right now, has our future riding on it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thought long about how to represent this next chapter, and rather than creating a long narrative or morality play, or even finding a way to add a chapter to the last version, we chose to tell this story in allegory. We wanted the viewer to have a personal experience with choice. With our characters choice, but also with their own choices.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe overall design will be stark. Our color scheme black, white and red. Our challenge was to tell a story with as much depth as possible in the most utterly simple way. For this to be an invitation to all people, understandable in all languages and accessible at whatever depth resonated with you. Complex stories are easy, it\u0027s the simple ones that are hard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re asking you to contribute what you can to help us tell this story to the world. We have a world class team of professional artists, many former Disney guys and we can do this at the highest level. We need your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have more powerful stories in the works so join us and come along for a ride deep into the Mythos of our time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS. Here\u0027s a link to the animatic. An animatic is the storyboards shot and timed out. Each cut will be replaced by animation eventually.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/150111117\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/150111117\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
