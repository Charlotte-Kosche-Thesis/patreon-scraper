    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m DeviantKibate\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until now I have been drawing commissions for various people, and by doing so I have somehow gained a larger fanbase for Giantess/Shrinking related comics. However due to several commissions being private or not related to the new fanbases interest, the amount of updates were quite frankly disappointing. Not only that, having one person pay a lot of money for a few comic pages never felt right to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is why you should support this Patreon!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this not only will you support me AND the giantess community, but also you will get free comics on frequent updates! And if you don\u0027t have the means to do so, doesn\u0027t matter, I will still draw them anyway! (But only Patreon supporters will get high resolution downloads ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow what WILL i actually do now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will draw comic series and artworks with the themes of Giantess(women majorly bigger than normal sized women) and Shrunken People(people who are majorly smaller than normal sized women) ranging from SFW to NSFW. The comics will have a page number ranging from roughly 5 to 20 each. What you certainly will get are complete comics, no project will ever be left on hiatus. The content will be usually completely original, in other words no Fan Art of already existing franchises.\u003cbr\u003eOccasionally there will be contests done with the help of some of the supporters to decide the next comic contents.\u003cbr\u003eAnd depending on the interest there will also be livestreams to see how i draw, talk with other fans and/or with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow frequently will i update?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters once per week. If i reach a certain amount i will increase it to two or three pages per week. Please refer to the milestone part of this website on the left to see details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you gain from supporting me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst you should know, you should see it as a donation, not as payment. Donators will receive some benefits, however they are just a bonus if you will.
