    "summary": "Thanks for visiting my Patreon page!\u00a0 The journey I am on is one of exploration and creativity, especially creativity I didn\u0027t even know I had.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been writing all kinds of stuff, including poetry, short stories, a children\u0027s book and even a somewhat psychological book, which may or may not actually be on the back burner for now, along with a documentary of a musical nature which is definitely on the back burner right now.\u00a0 I have one book of poetry published,\u003cem\u003e Rebel\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eHeart, \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eand another in the works.\u00a0 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I write about?\u00a0 My life, some of the people in it, some of the people I\u0027ve met, people I\u0027m glad I never met, true stories, stories that may have parted ways with the truth, whatever pops into my brain in any given moment, I guess.\u00a0 Life presents me with so much new stuff every day and it is putting some of this into words that validates my existence.\u00a0 Head on over to deborahmcgaffey.weebly.com and check out some samples of my writing.\u00a0 Have some ideas?\u00a0 Feel free to share them with me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve done all kinds of jobs in my life, mostly designed to keep the bills paid and having nothing much to do with who I am.\u00a0 I\u0027ve worked in security, retail, education, food, made clackers for film production, typed and typed and typed, done a ton of research -- you name it, I\u0027ve probably done it.\u00a0 Now I\u0027m doing what I love, what I came here to do, and am only searching for the next block of time, the next idea, the next laugh, the next descriptive word...well, you know how it is. \u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron, you will get access to my Patrons-only feed.\u00a0 You will also get to review drafts and material before publication.\u00a0 You don\u0027t need to be shy about giving your invaluable feedback which will always be considered.\u00a0 Yes!\u00a0 Somebody actually does want to hear what you have to say!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you can share my journey with me, financially or otherwise. \u00a0 I value your participation and your feedback, even if you don\u0027t make a monetary contribution.\u00a0 Possibly down the road, you will.\u00a0 If you can\u0027t, believe me, I completely understand.\u00a0 But check it out - you can become a patron for as little as $1 a month (seriously), more if you like.\u00a0 Of course, your contributions enable me to have time and resources to put into creating new works.\u00a0 Ink cartridges, paper, pens, pencils, clips, sticky notes all get used in abundant amounts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ll be posting new material here and plan on having a lot of fun with this page.\u00a0 Thanks so much for joining me.\u00a0 I\u0027m excited that you are here.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
