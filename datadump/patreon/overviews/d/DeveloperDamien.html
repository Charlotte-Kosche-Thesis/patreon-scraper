    "summary": "Hello! My name is Damien, and I\u0027ve been working on video games for about 5 years. I typically work on RPGs, but everything I make is kind of weird in some beautiful way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat am I doing here?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy main project is \u0027I Have Low Stats But My Class Is \"Leader\", So I Recruited Everyone I Know To Fight The Dark Lord\u0027, or \u0027IHLSBMCILSIREIKTFTDL\u0027 for short. It\u0027s a comedy game where you play as a party of 99 characters at once. My side projects involve making small games with this cast of characters; partly to help me flesh out the different personalities and histories of so many characters, and partly because I don\u0027t see why I can\u0027t reuse assets on this big game for some weird smaller games. However, making games like this means I don\u0027t have other sources of income. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current project for April is \u0027Guildy Pleasure\u0027, a pen-and-paper game where everyone is a member of a guild, and you have to fill out forms in order to do anything. It\u0027s a laid-back setup where people never even have to meet in real life and can conduct it all through email, and you just have to make sure your forms are turned in once a week.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get for helping me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eGames, mostly (which you can find at \u003ca href=\"https://cannibalinteractive.itch.io/)\"\u003ehttps://cannibalinteractive.itch.io/)\u003c/a\u003e. A fair amount of really bad puns as well. Really though, you get access to whatever games I make, as well as some backer-only games. As financial goals get met, the amount of content for different tiers increases, so please consider contributing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e"
