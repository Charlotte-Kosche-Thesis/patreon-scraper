The posts I make here are essentially notifications to let you guys know that the monthly folder I linked you all too has been updated. Links are sent out via DM here on Patreon on the 5th. If you pledged after the 5th you need to DM me to let me know you\u0027ve pledged and I\u0027ll send you access! \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eTo access content on this Patreon you will have to wait until your card has been billed at least once. Content will now be hosted off site with a new link for that month\u0027s content sent at the start of each month via Patreon\u0027s DM system for paying Patrons [5/6th of each month]. This has the added benefit of easy hosting for PSD files for you guys to get the most from my posts. If your pledge isn\u0027t renewed you will lose access to the content. You gain access only to the artwork created in the month your card has been billed to reward those that pledge for more than one month.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI block declined pledges so be sure to check your payment settings and account before the end of each month! If you want to re-pledge send me a note on FA and we can sort it out. Keep in mind you will lose access for that month though.
