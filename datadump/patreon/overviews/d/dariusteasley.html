    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Darius Teasley and I\u0027m a writer, musician, artist and father who hails from Hampton Roads, Virginia \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI chose to build this Patreon page to learn if people are willing to offer additional support and encouragement for my artistic endeavors. I\u0027m currently working on a fictional novel about an insane cabal of vigilantes called, \u003cem\u003eThe Dead.\u003c/em\u003e The premise of the novel revolves around a team in which each member has been so psychologically marred by crime that they\u0027ve decided to forgo their normal lives and join the team\u003cem\u003e. The Dead\u003c/em\u003e handle the hard cases, the ones where victims have nowhere else to go and no one else to call. The team is comprised of a wide array of personalties; the maniacally focused Anthony Luck, the frenetic Ricky and Robby Skitzeki ( or the Skitzo brothers to their enemies), the preternaturally disturbed Sickboy (who is pretty sure he\u0027s a character in a book and reacts as if he knows the authors next move), the Ex MMA champion \"Wild Irish\" Rose O\u0027 Connor, the terminally sarcastic hacker Nicholas \" Icky\" Thumpe and several others. They no longer care about their lives or safety, in fact each member is ready, willing, and (in some cases) desperately wanting to die pushing back the wave of lawlessness and chaos which descends on their country. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as style of the book, imagine if the A-Team was inspired by a Quentin Tarantino movie. It\u0027s written in two parts; Each member of the team has a  prelude chapter that will go into their history, motivation, and unique circumstances for joining the \u003cem\u003eThe Dead\u003c/em\u003e. These prelude chapters will immediately precede each chapter of the main story, which is their current mission and backbone of the novel. This duality will allow the readers to not only see who the characters were and are, but also who they are becoming.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as the style of the author, I can only tell you about the things that are important to me as a writer and draw me as a reader. I like to write multi-dimensional, multi-cultural characters who jump from the page. It\u0027s important to me to have female characters that are more than just mannequins posing around their male counterparts. I love lively and natural dialog that breathes and flows -- that has a rhythm of its own. I try to create vivid action sequences and scenes where you can not only imagine the movement but feel it too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what I envision will happen on this Patreon. As I\u0027ve said, this novel is written in two parts: the prelude chapters and the main body of the story. I\u0027ve completed many (but not all) of the preludes and I intend to release them here, for free, once every few weeks for my patrons. \u00a0To begin, I have released two of my preludes absolutely free for everyone. As I accrue patronage, I will use those funds to complete the main body of the novel. When we\u0027ve hit our goal, we will market and publish this thing and celebrations will be had by all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a dad and a writer, I can\u0027t how express how difficult it is to complete my work without neglecting my responsibilities to my family.\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage would allow me to create the kinds of works that you want to see and without it, this project will not happen. It allows me to justify the hours that are required to make something worth reading. My family, friends, and I appreciate you reading even this far and I personally want to thank you for your time and consideration! Together, we can make this piece of fiction a reality. \u003cbr\u003e"
