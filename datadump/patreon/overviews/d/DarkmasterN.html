Most of you out there probably know me as DarkmasterN from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://darkmastern.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantart\u003c/a\u003e and most likely know me for my love of chubby catgirls as well as gigantic breasts. Though there are those who may know me from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://slightlyaboveaverage.smackjeeves.com/comics/1441481/slightly-above-average-cover/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSmackJeeves\u003c/a\u003e or even\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://slightlyaboveaverage.thecomicseries.com/comics/first\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eComicFury\u003c/a\u003e due to my webcomic sLightly abOVe avErage. I\u0027ve been drawing for my entire life, on Deviantart for 9 years and doing web-comics for about 3, but I want to continue doing them for as long as I possibly can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the hell should I give you my hard earned cash?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eImmediately addressing the Shoggoth in the room. I want money, to do things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, Less vague. I\u0027m trying to raise money to aid on getting my webcomic made into an actual self published and self printed comic book. In addition I\u0027m simply trying to raise extra funds and money to help with day to day fees. In doing this I may be able to also eventually live as an artist, which is a ways off I\u0027m sure but it\u0027s the dream ya know....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals and Aspirations\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI aspire to continue working on my art and improving, not only for me, but for you people as well. I hope that in getting paid here I can create products to share with the rest of you and work on projects that you all want funded as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you need to participate~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t have a lot of stuff planned for the future, as I\u0027m kind of testing the waters here to see what\u0027s up. I only recently started selling my own works on E-Junkie as a Pay what you want model, and have earned a tad bit of success. However expanding here may be just what I need. All I\u0027m asking for in the main tier, is $1. A single, measly ass dollar. And with that dollar will come great rewards and gifts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course things may change in the coming days/months/years/millennia but for now this is all you\u0027ll need to reap full benefits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you\u0027re Building\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to my artwork these days, there are two subjects that I usually post things for....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKatrina Stuffing Comics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor my Earliest watchers, they have known that I mainly draw a very busty cat girl named Katrina, and she is whom I gained my first followers from. in the years since i first joined Deviantart she has changed in both design and personality, however her fanbase has grown and inflated just like her waistline. Not long ago I began giving the people what they wanted, and made short comics about her overeating on holidays or her birthday, and just generally getting rounder from her experiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlightly Above Average\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne of my more recent projects, Slightly Above Average is a Lovecraftian Comedy/Horror webcomic about a girl who ends up living with an alien. There is a lot of character development, comedy, sexiness, and just weirdness all around. It\u0027s one of my proudest achievements as I\u0027ve never worked on a single comic project for this long and I post regularly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s about it~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ve got the gist of what I\u0027m about here, and though I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more, I\u0027ll keep you all updated when things come to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso remember that not everything I post is safe for work, so just assume a lot of NSFW material to pop up.\u003cbr\u003e"
