    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eAbove all, I\u2019m a human. I believe this will tell much to the reader because there\u2019s something missing in the idea of humanity today. I strongly want to take care of my human values and do not fall under external pressure that one is supposed to think this or that way. Oldschooly, I believe in following your heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWoman in Black\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jr3hMdAHk2A\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that if we dug deeper I would consider myself as an artist. I would call myself a musician in the past, and even earlier, I wouldn\u2019t dare to use this title \u2013 I didn\u2019t feel attached to that. Today, I believe that I\u2019m an artist and I try to take steps to become better and better. I don\u2019t believe in that common picture of an artist as a creator, genius, add any adjective you like. I consider myself as a receiver with his task to pick the purest fidelity throughout his life. I don\u2019t see myself as the author of things I have published.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy don\u2019t I call myself a musician? Actually, I do because I consider music as my main profession but, personally, I prefer the word \u201cartist\u201d explaining my activity more generally. I used to refuse the idea I could do something except music but, as I have experienced a long period of musical emaciating, I noticed I am also inspired in different areas of my life. I allowed them to come and exist in our world. That is why I believe in me as an artist, more generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that the reader should be explained how my artistic name appeared in my life. As you have had opportunity to read that Dominik is my real name given by my mum. Brendan, in one of Celtic dialects, means raven.

     "description": "Decameron is a book written by Giovanni Boccaccio which I highly recommend to read. It tells a story of ten people telling stories about love. They cannot escape their place. And it\u0027s a great study of how people perceive love when they are exposed to such conditions. It\u0027s a deep and meaningful analysis of our own values. Deca means ten in latin and this title was the first that came to my mind so I had to make up a story connected with it. But this tier will make my and your life more meaningful.
