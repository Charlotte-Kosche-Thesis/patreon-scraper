    "summary": "I love video games--particularly NES games. The only thing I love more is music (and my mom\u0027s cooking but we\u0027re not talking about that). From an early age, NES soundtracks have collectively been one of the biggest influences on me as a musician. As a child, I would hold my tape recorder up to the TV and record music from all of my favorite games so I could pipe it back through my headphones and play my drums along to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward more years than I care to think about and I\u0027ve finally found my own way of expressing what this music has meant to me: I do metal covers of entire NES soundtracks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal that I\u0027ve set for myself is to do as precise of a translation of the music from 8-bit sounds to real guitars, bass and drums as I can (well I do take some liberties with the drums but we\u0027ll get to that). I also like for things to be complete so instead of just picking my favorite songs from each game, I do every piece of music--even the short little jingles that play when you die or beat a level, etc.--and I do them all at exactly the same tempos as the original versions, down to the thousandth of a BPM (beat per minute).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNES music is typically comprised of two square channels, one triangle channel and a noise channel (also a sample channel but that\u0027s not always used). I translate each of the square channels to lead guitars and the triangle channel to bass and I write all of the drum parts myself, although I do take notes from the noise channel parts where I can. All of the parts are edited to make them precisely line up with each other just as they originally did. That\u0027s the process in a nutshell. It can be very fun sometimes and extremely frustrating at other times but it truly is a labor of love. A very time-consuming labor of love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I have come to Patreon seeking support is the same reason everyone else does--for the ability to have more time to produce what\u0027s very near and dear to my heart. In 2015 my computer that I used for all of my songwriting and production went out in a blaze of glory and I turned to Kickstarter for help to replace it. The support was overwhelming and as a result of the campaign I accumulated quite a list of games that I will be covering for the next several months. I still have to do \u003cdel\u003eZelda II: The Adventure of Link\u003c/del\u003e, Silver Surfer, Mega Man 3 (my personal favorite), Final Fantasy, Journey to Silius, Blaster Master, Ghosts \u0027n Goblins, Super Mario Bros. 3, The Guardian Legend, Dragon Fighter, Gremlins 2: The New Batch, Rygar and Life Force (Salamander). As it stands, working a full-time job, I can get at least one done a month but I have to forego all of my own music that I write. Having more time to work on music means getting NES cover albums done MUCH quicker (there are still so many games left to cover!) and the freedom to create all of other the music that I enjoy creating. Thank you so much for all of your help!\u003cbr\u003e"
