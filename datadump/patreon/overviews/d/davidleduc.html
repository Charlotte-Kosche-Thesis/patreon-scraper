    "summary": "Hey friends. DLD here. Thanks for finding your way to my Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Why Patreon? \u003cbr\u003eThis is a way for friends and fans to keep tabs on my weekly creations, and directly support my career as a musician. Plus as a patron, you can get some personal and exclusive rewards like music downloads, guitar lessons, and postcards from the road!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-So what\u2019s the endgame?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to be able to support myself and my family exclusively through my music, videos, and other online content. Achieving this goal will allow me to have a sustainable artistic and creative career, while also helping to ensure a happy home life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Who do/did you perform live with?\u003cbr\u003e\nYou might already know that I played bass for Minneapolis indie outfit, Enemy Planes since it\u2019s inception in 2012. We won 2015\u2019s \u003ca href=\"http://www.hardrock.com/news/congrats-to-enemy-planes-hard-rock-rising-battle-of-the-bands-winners/\"\u003eHard Rock Rising\u003c/a\u003e international competition, earning a festival slot with Avicii,\u00a0Kings of Leon \u0026amp; Lenny Kravitz in Barcelona, Spain. We also toured as direct support to the Meat Puppets in 2013 and 2014.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI founded The MTVs in 2011, and have self-booked, and performed over 900 shows to date. \u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2012, I completed the 100 videos in 100 days challenge on YouTube gaining 3k subscribers, and over 350,000 views. \u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2017, I joined Pop Rocks and got to perform for our US Air Force troops overseas in Kuwait. \u003cbr\u003e\nOther acts I\u2019ve been in: Toast, Johnnyrook, Holiday, Pictures of Then, Half Act, The Less Complex, The Farewell Circuit, Wrecked Wheelhouse, 80HD and most recently, Phantom Heart. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u2019s the current buzz?\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThe lead single from his upcoming EP \u003cem\u003eLucid\u003c/em\u003e is \u201cHitman,\u201d which has a sexier pulse and more fun-loving feel than LeDuc\u2019s previous work with Enemy Planes. Director Jack Davis of LoonarCity took notes from the video for Olivia Newton-John\u2019s \u201cPhysical\u201d for this clip, adding a darker, more sardonic feel.\u201d -Jerard Fagerberg,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.citypages.com/music/jazzercise-stylish-gang-wars-and-lesbian-country-songs-in-this-weeks-top-5-mn-music-videos/477989663\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCity Pages\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cLeDuc has provided the low-end throttle for a number of prominent midwest independent rock acts over the past decade. His true spirit emerges as a shimmering hybrid of pop, folk, electronica and alt rock gems on two new solo EPs coming spring of 2018.\u201d -Scott Herold, CEO Rock the Cause Records\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-When did I start playing bass?\u003cbr\u003e\nI really can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been 20 years since a high school friend taught me the bass line to RATM\u2019s Guerilla Radio, and invited me to practice with his band for the first time. It was the greatest feeling I\u2019d ever felt. There are still pieces of my brain on the ceiling of that room. \ud83e\udd2f\u003cbr\u003e\nThat intoxicating performance rush has never gone away. There is nothing better than crushing a set, locking in with bandmates, and absolutely wowing an audience into a celebration of music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Where am I playing live next?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.themtvs.com/artists/\"\u003eUpcoming Pop Rocks, The MTVs \u0026amp; Phantom Heart shows\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI honestly can\u2019t thank you enough for letting my music into your life! \ud83c\udf7b\u270c\ufe0f\u003cbr\u003e-DLD\u003cbr\u003e"
