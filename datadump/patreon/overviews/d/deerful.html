    "summary": "I make music and YouTube videos and sometimes other stuff too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople keep asking me if downloads of the covers and originals I put on YouTube exist, and the answer up until now has been \u0027no but I\u0027ll get to it\u0027. It seems to make sense to make it a thing here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube revenue for the year has been about \u00a320 so I\u0027m clearly not in this to get rich. Don\u0027t feel obliged. We all know I can\u0027t stop you from just ripping the audio from the videos, I\u0027m sure loads of people already have and I wish them happy listening.\u00a0HOWEVER, if you would *like* to support me financially, please consider this Patreon a tip jar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am \u003cem\u003enot at all\u003c/em\u003e expecting big extravagant patronages - a dollar per creation (capped monthly if you like!) totally seems about the right ballpark. If you do pledge I am beyond grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere possible I am including both WAV + MP3 versions of songs, and stem tracks in case you want to remix or sample them (since a few people have asked). The exception is a) if I\u0027ve lost the files (Riches and Wonders :( ) or b) if the track is an original one I plan to later release (for now that\u0027s just Break) - I will, however, supply stems as and when it is officially released. I hope that\u0027s okay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAudio and stems for any new content will be uploaded to Patreon at the same time as the video in question is uploaded to YouTube. Pledges are charged for new content - any stuff I posted before you signed up is also available to you indefinitely for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also definitely put the odd little silly tiny project up here which won\u0027t be charged, and will be available to you exclusively for free, so watch out for those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalk to me and let me know if there\u0027s anything else you\u0027d like to see here!\u003cbr\u003e"
