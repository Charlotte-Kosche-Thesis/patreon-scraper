Also, we find that vegan recipes digest better, especially deserts that can be very heavy on the stomach when filled with dairy \u0026amp; eggs. That positive relationship with food \u0026amp; ethical concern is what motivates us to promote this lifestyle as an easy option, where creativity overtakes the general idea of restriction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we would be able to create \u0026amp; share more recipes that are adaptable to many dietary restrictions, and that are as clean \u0026amp; respectful as possible on an environmental, ethical \u0026amp; health level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you \u0026lt;3\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Marjorie Wehrlen -\u003cbr\u003eGraphic \u0026amp; motion designer, I\u0027m responsible for the brand identity \u0026amp; flamingo glasses. I\u0027m also the English voice in the videos.\u00a0When it comes to food, I\u0027ve been experimenting with vegan recipes for over a year now. I\u0027m sharing with you my drinks, meals \u0026amp; desserts recipes, leaving the french pastry game to Matt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Matthieu Blanco -\u003cbr\u003eSocial media guy, filmmaker, cashew freak, I assist in the making of the videos. I\u2019m also the French voice. I fell in love with the vegan attitude a few months ago and now feel the need to spread the word with Delicaroom. It\u2019s a big and exciting challenge for me to adapt a lot of french pastry recipes and find ways to make them even more tasty."
