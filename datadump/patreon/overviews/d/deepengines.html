The violence of the event gashed the surface of the continent, wreaking devastation to the independent cities on the surface, diverting rivers, uprooting entire societies. The land was broken and fundamentally changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver time, the disparate races of the region began to build sprawling, multicultural cities on the ruins of the old, high on the cliffs that span the vast deep river that formed. The sophisticated Kef, the displaced Engine Children, the reclusive Coustlet, river dwelling Baseians, the misunderstood  Upsheer, and noble Eidlemark have learned to coexist in an uneasy peace with one another. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom Benga Loa to Sekmets Climb, the Hanging City to Gosslet Ahn and beyond, powerful crime families, ruthless Steelmasters, and ancient political parties vie for wealth and influence. Meanwhile, in the ruins of the Low Kingdoms a secret is being slowly excavated... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO WE ARE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeep Engines is made up of three creators, Leia Weathington (that\u0027s me!), Jack Cole, and Conley Presler.  All three of us have backgrounds in comics, illustration, writing, and video games. This project is our chance to bring our love of sprawling epic fantasy to life. Following multiple story lines in a fantastical world using our shared input, we are building a playground for ourselves as well as a host of other creative talent to tell fresh, unique stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing comics, illustrated codices, and other media you can follow the exploits of a disgraced food and culture writer, a pair of ambitious orphans, the scions of a criminal dynasty, an organization of miner clerics, and the explicit day to day life of a decadent brothel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s just the start. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges to our Patreon will enable us to keep our website running and updated regularly, pay contributors, and allow us to craft a fantasy world for readers to immerse themselves in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goals for the Deep Engines website is to host our comics and storytelling at no cost to readers, with the exception of, Raw House, a subscription portion of the site hosting fine pornographic comics featuring familiar faces in the Deep Engines cast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe amount of concept work that\u0027s gone into Deep Engines is considerable. Jack and Conley have piles of sketches, environment studies and other ephemera. On the writing side I have piles of notes, script pages and other concept work to share for those of you pledging at a $5.00 tier. For $10.00 you can receive all of that in addition to a monthly update video where we discuss what we\u0027ve worked on and answer questions about Deep Engines. You\u0027ll have access to wallpapers, early looks at comic pages, and process information. I will also be keeping a weekly blog for backers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means the world to us and goes a long way in helping us continue to entertain you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJack, Conley and I thank you for taking the time to check out Deep Engines Patreon and thank you even more if you decide to pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSincerely, Team Deep Engines\u003cbr\u003e(Leia, Jack, and Conley)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
