Since then he has attained multiple weapons of questionable lethality, minions whom loyally follow his orders to their best efforts, exo-suits of mechanical and megalomaniacal feats, a broadcast on the internet in both comic as well as vlog format and lastly... rivals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut this journey has not been all unfolding plots of sinister natures. After getting started by notifying the city of his presence onstage he began to tell his story proper in the form of a web comic \"The Misadventures of Dr. Holocaust\" later adding a web show \"The War Front\" to keep people informed. But many ask why. Why go through it all to rule this world? Ostensibly his is a journey to better humanity. For, as he believes, it is only through his vision that we are able to live in peace and comfort. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThough that should not stop you from trembling in fear, no SIR, for in the coming years none will be spared his scrutinizing gaze and thirst for destruction... \u003cbr\u003e",
