I hope you enjoy my stories about a city \ngone mad and people just trying to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I need\n help.  I first started Domina as a side project, little more to clear \nmy head (I\u0027ve gotten enough complaints about the early chapters to know \nit shows).  But as I wrote more and more, it became more complex and \nbegan to take up more of my life.  Which isn\u0027t bad.  I love writing, and\n I love writing Domina City.  But it has reached the point where I have \ndifficulty justifying the amount of time I put in it.  It\u0027s eating into \nmy work life, which means I either need to dial back on writing or dial \nback on work.  I know which I would prefer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can afford to \nchip in a little bit each month, then I can afford to keep dedicating \ntime to this series, and eventually start adding more.  Side stories \nfrom other perspectives, commissioned art, an upgraded site, and all \nsorts of things.  You, as a backer, will also get rewards, from custom \nart to even cameos in the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for \nsupporting me, in more ways than one.  I wouldn\u0027t have found the \nstrength to continue for this long if not for the constant interest you \nhave all shown."
