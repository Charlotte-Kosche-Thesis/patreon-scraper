    "summary": "Since honesty is the best policy, I\u0027d do my best to be as honest as I can. You can call me Derrick, basically an average guy doing average stuff. I like many things, but if there is one thing I love, it\u0027s writing. The love for writing stories started when I was 12, started from a Pokemon dream if I could recall correctly. I\u0027ve been writing since then, and as far as I\u0027m concerned, my writing skills are self-taught. I started out writing fan fiction and to this day, I still do. However, I want to also move to writing my own fiction, which is why I am here, and what I\u0027m about to offer Patrons here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027m starting this Patreon page out of necessity. My current job does not pay me well enough, and while I\u0027m looking for better job opportunities, I still have a heavy financial burden to shoulder. A house to pay for, daily meals, car fuel, and my parents are due to retire in a few years. I want to eventually be able to pay for everything myself, but the situation in Malaysia is that the pay is lagging and does not keep up with the price inflation of goods. Yeah, that\u0027s the predicament I\u0027m facing. Staying with my parents helped a lot, but it still does not excuse me from a lot of responsibilities. Hence, I\u0027m turning to a side income source to supplement my current pay. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I want to not only sell my writing skills, but also enjoy doing it. I\u0027m no perfect writer and I believe in continuous improvement, so please do criticise my works but keep it constructive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve many story ideas floating in my head, but for now, I decided to stick with one fantasy story I named The Freeborn. My hope is that I will get it in paperback form one day, and nothing makes me happier than to see people invested in a story. For now, I\u0027m keeping this as simple as possible. Along the line, I will perhaps make a proper video introduction and a banner. To all those who support me, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Stay safe, stay happy, and happy reading, folks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.: My profile pic is done by a dear friend of mine, Michelle Ong."
