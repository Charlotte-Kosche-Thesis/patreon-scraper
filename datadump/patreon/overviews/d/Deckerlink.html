    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eHello everyone! My name is Deckerlink, the Trained Unprofessional, and now I\u0027m on Patreon! I put out videos every single day, and that kinda stuff ain\u0027t easy! I\u0027m also a person who lives with mental illness and without any help to deal with it. I have been unable to afford any kind of treatment for my mental illness after I moved in August, and trying to make ends meet is always easier when you have your head on straight! Whether you\u0027re here to help with that regard or because you enjoy my daily content, I\u0027m just glad you are still reading! So, why don\u0027t I tell you a bit about what I do? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my main YouTube Channel, I make Let\u0027s Play videos of games I love and games my fans and friends recommend! Some games I\u0027ve played include Undertale, Repeat, Extracurricular Activities, BioShock, Dead Island, and Dream Daddy! Clearly, game popularity isn\u0027t consistent here, so there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ll see something new right next to something you\u0027ve loved forever next to something you\u0027ve heard about but haven\u0027t Czeched out quite yet! All of this sits alongside vlogs and various different kinds of videos coming from my point of view or are just about my life! I do a lot of tags too, take that how you will. :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re looking for a more personal look into my life, my second channel DeckerJack houses my video diary, the closest thing I have to therapy. It\u0027s where I put my unfiltered thoughts and give (semi)monthly updates about how my life is going. If you\u0027re here to help with my mental health treatment, this might be where you hear the most about that part of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube community is a safe space of sorts. Despite the mental challenges I face, many different communities have found a place safe from ridicule in my company, and that\u0027s the way I want to keep it. Anyone from furries to weebs have come and found that I\u0027m willing to listen and help them with whatever is going on in their lives. I\u0027ve often felt alone and had to deal with many people telling me that who I was, as loosely and falsely defined by one single aspect of my personality, was wrong, and I don\u0027t want anyone to feel like they\u0027re without a shoulder to lean on. Regardless of the ability to contribute financially, anyone is welcome to be a part of this inclusive, safe, and fun community. :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also utilize the talents of up and coming talents like Ivy McCurdy and CV4, the channel\u0027s official artist and musician respectively. Helping me is helping people like Ivy and Jane achieve their dream too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this Patreon, as well as my Zazzle store http://www.zazzle.com/deckerlink is to raise money to help with my mental health treatment. Health care isn\u0027t being treated with the respect it deserves, and mental health even less. All the money that I raise from my YouTube adsense, donations, Patreon, Zazzle,Ko-Fi, any of it all goes to just trying to live a normal healthy life, and any amount of help means the absolute world to me! Just for reading this, and even if you can\u0027t give but maybe you can share this page with your friends, you have my eternal gratitude! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, feel free to Czech out my Patreon perks as well as my YouTube channel and see if there\u0027s anything there you like! If so, consider helping us keep it going! I\u0027ll love you forever! :)\u003c/div\u003e"
