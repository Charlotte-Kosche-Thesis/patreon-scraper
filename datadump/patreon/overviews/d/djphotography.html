I guess that\u0027s just passion and stubbornness though ^_^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I thought to myself, why not try Patreon where I can get a bunch of people to support me and give them heaps of rewards and nice stuff as thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month your pledge goes through and I send the rewards out.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve signed up for the $2 pledge then every month you get digital images delivered to you for personal use. That\u0027s only $24 a year, and you\u0027ll be getting \u003cem\u003esoo \u003c/em\u003emany images to use for your background images ... just imagine rotating through all of that :)\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll store the photos on Google Drive for you to access through a link (emailed to you every month), just download the folder and have fun :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the $5 rewards that gets a calendar, make sure you include your delivery address and I\u0027ll show off the final desgin before ordering and sending it to you. -- Expect a big calendar, because they\u0027re soo much better then the tiny ones :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2018 Calendars are already done for the year.\u003cbr\u003ePrices are in US dollars, so it might be a little bit more or less once converted to your currency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
