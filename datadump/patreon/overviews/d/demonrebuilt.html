I was just a 20-year-old university student with a boring\npart-time job and a need for a creative outlet. YouTube was that outlet for me\nfor a long time. I fell in love with creating videos and all of a sudden I was\nspending more time making videos than I was actually playing video games. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBetween YouTube and now Twitch as well, I spend a\nsubstantial amount of time on my channel and I\u2019m constantly trying to do more. Unfortunately,\njust because I spend a lot of time making videos doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m exempt\nfrom responsibilities in life. I still have to work to pay for things, I still\nhave to sleep and eat and make time to lead a healthy life and I also need time\nsometimes to just turn everything off and relax. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where you\ncan help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy supporting me here on Patreon, you can help me focus\nless on external responsibilities like my part-time work and put more time into\nmaking videos on YouTube and streaming on Twitch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis will also help me get better recording equipment,\nsoftware, PC parts and even just more games for me to cover in my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt would be an absolute dream to be able to this as a job\nand even the smallest of donations would go a long way into helping me realise\nthis dream. \u003cbr\u003e"
