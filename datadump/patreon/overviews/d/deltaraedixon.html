I am originally from Chattanooga, Tennessee and moved to Salt Lake City, Utah in 2016 with the hopes of working with local troupes and organizations to spread the gospel of body positivity, tolerance, and confidence!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also work closely with the LGBTQ+\u00a0community to raise awareness of the struggle that is fought daily by Utah\u2019s gay youth and adults. In 2017, I was crowned Ms Gay Utah Reign XXXV and Lady-In-Waiting to the current reigning court and am incredibly honored to work closely with the Royal Court of the Golden Spike Empire (RCGSE) and their future community outreach, projects, and fundraisers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am part of a weekly burlesque show at a local speakeasy-style restaurant \"Burlesque \u0026amp; the Beats\", teach weekly beginner burlesque classes, organizing shows or performing in the wildly popular Beauties on Broadway Drag Brunch shows, holding makeup \u0026amp; hair workshops, and much more! When, I\u0027m not doing burlesque (which is very little), I spend time with my significant other, my four animals, gardening, thrift store shopping, and backpacking/camping out in the gorgeous Utah wilderness.",
