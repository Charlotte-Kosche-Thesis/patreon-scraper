    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Hey guys! My name\u0027s Mat Kim, but you\u0027d probably know me as Datis Ausum on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeLisFZKRzfaMtluCURK9wg\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://datisausum.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m currently running a YouTube channel for fan videos that cover western cartoons such as Steven Universe and Avatar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Even since I launched my YouTube channel I\u2019ve always been trying to improve on my projects. And a lot has changed over time. I\u2019m always working hard to learn new editing techniques and styles to make content that my subscribers can continually enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 But, as a consequence, the production time between projects has increased a lot. For example, my most recent video, Dynamo, took 2 months for a full 2:30 minute project since it required a lot of masking work and image reprocessing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 The problem is, even though I put so much time and efforts into my videos, and also a considerable amount of money every month, \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t get paid a single penny from my creations.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eAll of the advertisement revenues from my videos is taken by the original contents creators, Cartoon Network (Time Warner) and music composers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 Which is fine, because I\u0027m making these videos based on copyrighted cartoons and musics, and they definitely deserve to be paid a lot and credited in the video. But I\u0027m also a college student with limited time and resources. Each month I need to maintain my subscription fees for editing software and I\u2019m currently struggling to make those payments.\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 So- if you enjoyed my videos, please consider supporting me on Patreon, so that I can go on and keep making these kinds of videos. If you don\u0027t have money to spare, that\u0027s totally fine. The videos will be there for free as always. But every little bit helps!\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 My goal here is simple-\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eTo raise the fund \u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eenough to pay the monthly subscription fees\u003c/strong\u003e for the software.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eMy minimum goal is to reach \u003cstrong\u003e$50.00\u003c/strong\u003e per month\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 If I reach 100$, I\u0027ll be able to save the extra, and to buy expensive plugins like Red Giant Trapcode.

I will try to leave commentaries as much as possible, so that if you\u0027re interested in editing, it could be helpful for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eIn order to properly open up the project files, you might need the current build of Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere, and 14.0 or higher version of Sony Vegas Pro. Red Giant Universe video fx plugins, and Boris FX Continuum 9 will be needed too. Also Adobe Photoshop CC will be required to open up PSD files included in the folder.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 You might be able to open up the project files without required plugins and with different version of the programs, but there\u0027s a high chance that you will end up getting nothing useful from them if that\u0027s the case. And for the last- a lot of disk spaces will be required!\n\u003c/div\u003e"
