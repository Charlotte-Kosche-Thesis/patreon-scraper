But after awhile minecraft wasn\u0027t enough and I am now moving onto different games. I started streaming a few months ago and fell even more in love with it and now i want to make that the main focus of what i do. After loosing my job due to medical reasons I have turned my attention of growing and making a great community around my streaming. The money you will be donating will be going for upgrades as they are needed, New games to play on the stream, and to allow me to return to the community by doing giveaways.\u00a0"
