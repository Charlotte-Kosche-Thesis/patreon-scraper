    "summary": "The capoeira community has been\u00a0such a supportive platform to all of my creative projects; from our videos (Capoeira Crush, Voices for Ogum, and more)\u00a0and my two capoeira CDs,\u00a0all the way to my band Two Strangers on a Stage, my various collaborations with Kahlil Cummings in CapoFresh music and my drumming and orix\u00e1 music journey. I have been so lucky to have great teachers, musicians, drummers, and artists all around me that keep pushing me to do better. I am constantly in amazement by how much wealth of beauty and creativity I get to experience within my circle. I am so thankful for all of you that have been a part of this world I have around me. This is a crucial element to my growth as an artist but it is also a huge reason why I am still in LA, a city that allows me\u00a0to continue collaborating and creating more meaningful work.\u003cbr\u003eToday I am at a place where I am a mom, leading a capoeira school, drumming, and still creating music, learning, and refining my skills while holding my household. With all the support I have gotten from you- students, colleagues, friends, and family- I know you recognize the importance of women voice and leadership in our community in our current times. With everything that has been coming to the surface; I have always believed in being the alternative. I have been\u00a0advocating for a different kind of femininity as it gave me a way to express myself and gain confidence. I think it is crucial to have the youth see women successful while being strong in other ways other then sensual and\u00a0seductive. I believe the beauty n sensuality the female body has us very powerful, but it is not the only\u00a0power a woman has.\u00a0I have\u00a0taken all of these value in the pursuit of being that example in my community. \u003cbr\u003eMany of you ask me about another capoeira CD, more shows, more music from Two Strangers on a Stage. I get invitations for events, requests for workshops, and demonstrations and where before I was able to say yes with no hesitation, today I need your help. With the cost of leading a group, raising a family, and getting studio time to get together with other artists\u00a0and create, producing work has become more financially challenging. I am so grateful for all the attention my first and second Capoeira CDs has gotten me all around the world but I need to harness your motivation and help if I am to produce another album. Many of the young women, parents, and friends come to me at events, performances, or reach out online, telling me how meaningful it is for them to see a woman drumming and\u00a0leading, talking about candomble and Ifa.\u00a0They love the music and they are touched by the music- well, today is your opportunity to keep that alive.\u00a0Your funds will allow me to concentrate on my craft, take classes, spend time with my teachers, continue my research- this will give me more to give back to you. Your funds will be used for me to keep my elders\u0027 information alive. Invest in the product you want me to become so I can be a better teacher, performer, and leader to you. Let\u0027s develop our relationship further so we can both grow. Music is what changes our head space yet it has become a matter-of-fact in today world; one click and you can download or stream stuff for free. This\u00a0is an opportunity to\u00a0give back to something you have already enjoyed so it can keep giving. \u003cbr\u003ePlease look at my different\u00a0rewards\u00a0and see what best fits you. I am so excited to launch this and to hear from you as to what you want to get back from me. \u003cbr\u003eAll the best and thank you regardless. Dana \"Minha Velha\" Maman."
