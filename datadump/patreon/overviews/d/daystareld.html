Where am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is basically an ongoing\u00a0Kickstarter. You choose how much money you want to pledge every month, and that gets charged to your account. You can cancel whenever you want, and set maximums on your account in case you want to make sure you don\u0027t go over a certain amount with multiple pledges.\u00a0Check out \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/faq\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis FAQ\u003c/a\u003e if you want to know more about Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what would my patronage do for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work full time to pay the bills, and have little leftover to follow my passions, like writing and game design. \u00a0While we can\u0027t buy more time directly, having more disposable income often allows us to save time (for example, by buying an economic, delicious, and nutritious Publix sub rather than cooking), which can then be used for more productive things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeems legit. So what exactly are you working on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now my major passion projects are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePokemon: The Origin of Species\u003c/a\u003e, which publishes monthly, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRationally Writing\u003c/a\u003e, a podcast I co-host with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://alexanderwales.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAlexander Wales\u003c/a\u003e. My other major projects include my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://daystareld.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enew website\u003c/a\u003e, which I started thanks to Patron donations to consolidate my projects and start blogging on, and a board game I designed called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tavernwars/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTavern Wars\u003c/a\u003e that\u0027s currently in the prototype testing phase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a lot of other things too: original fiction, like my modern-horror/supernatural novel \u003cem\u003eThe Calling \u00a0\u003c/em\u003e(or, \"How to Make People Take Vampires Seriously Again\") and a fantasy novel that I\u0027m co-writing, both for hopeful eventual publication. I may end up posting the first online, if it feels like a better fit creatively and economically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also gotten paid for and continue to write articles on game design, novel and show critiques, egalitarian relationship dynamics, and rationality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMakes sense. Now what?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, if any of that sounds like the kind of stuff you\u0027d like to see more of in the world, then just pick an amount of money you\u0027d feel comfortable contributing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount is\u00a0appreciated, as both encouragement to keep doing what makes people happy, and as some minor assistance to free up time and resources to devote to such projects. Whether you decide to contribute $5 once, $2 monthly, or none at all, thanks for enjoying my work enough to get here, and I hope I can continue to honor your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e"
