I\u0027d been a fan of webnovels, Wuxia, and light novels for a few years prior to starting, and I never really thought I\u0027d get as far as I am now. I was iffy about starting a Patreon, as I feel that my work didn\u0027t deserve it, but my readers\u0027 genuine desires to support me and my writing have been one of the best things I\u0027ve ever experienced. Thank you all for the love and help so far. From here on out, I\u0027m only striving to improve my work, so I sincerely hope you\u0027ll all stick around. It really does motivate me to keep going. Once again, thanks to all the readers that helped me get here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e[ Patron Perks ]\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the reward\u00a0tiers will include access to the re-write of Book 1; a version that I will not be publishing on RoyalRoadl. It\u0027ll include fixes and changes that incorporate all of the criticism I received at the start, and will feature better writing in general.These also include benefits like reading up to 3 chapters ahead, and new bonus chapters that are available exclusively to patrons. I hope these extras are worth the pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e[ My Fiction ]\u003c/h3\u003e[\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://royalroadl.com/fiction/13437/necromancer-and-co\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNecromancer and Co.\u003c/a\u003e ]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a time before the existence of the present, the gods decided to create a plane of existence where all their creations could exist in the same place. In it, all would be fair, and all gaps between races and technological advancements could be crossed with a single system that the gods had created. Every year, the gods would choose a new race to put in their land, and in this new group of beautifully unlucky people, Alen, his friends, and a few people from Earth have finally met their turn to be tossed into the playground of the gods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately though, Alen was thrust into a forest of corpse-eating bears and horribly smelly undead on his first day, one of the many danger-zones of the continent the gods had chosen to throw them in. It would be easy to say that he simply died within the first day, or that he\u0027d starved to death or whatever, but let\u0027s be honest...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat story would be no fun to tell, yes?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
