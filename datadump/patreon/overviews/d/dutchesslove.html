(yes! the one that many of you have been asking me for these past few years!) containing shoots that push the envelope WAY farther than I have thus far, thematically paired with writings about diverse topics that range from womanhood, sex, queerness, birth, death, pleasure, and pain, to privilege, equity, and colonization...as well as glamorous beautifully-styled body-positive and gender-bizarre fashion images that take an elegant dump on cultural norms, help to shift the lens of what is considered beautiful, and redefine femininity and masculinity on our own terms. My goal is to not only consistently publish these works on my own my blog, but also to submit them to publications, and feature guest contributors and writers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEROTIC FILMS! YESSSSS, PEOPLE...SEX FILMS...adult entertainment...porn. YES! It is one of my greatest dreams and highest callings to produce beautiful feminist erotic art films, in service to the healing of the collective wound in human sexuality. These works will provide an artistic platform for discussion and education about female pleasure, consent, communication, and safe sex. Creating this work with the help of a patron-based platform means I can create in a way is completely aligned with my own ethics, and not governed by current porn industry norms. (**More about this coming soon to my patron-only feed**).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDJING! Honing my selectress skills to bring that incomparable Dutchess vibe to a sound system near you, and offer a counterbalance to the bro-ey abrasive music and vibes that have left the Bay Area scene in a Grown\u0027n\u0027Sexy deficit in recent years.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePARTIES! Unifying all of these offerings through freaky multi-media nightlife events (brought to you by an all-female production team) that focus largely on creating safe, sexy, activated dance spaces for women and LGBTQ+ folks, highlighting the talents of female/POC/queer DJs and producers, igniting cultural deprogramming and reeducation around female sexuality, educating all people about consent, blurring the lines performer and audience, and having ALL THE FUN.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://s1079.photobucket.com/user/Dutchess_Love/media/MORGENLOVE18_zpsg5xd9fb1.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1079.photobucket.com/albums/w503/Dutchess_Love/MORGENLOVE18_zpsg5xd9fb1.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMY PATRONAGE GOALS + HOW YOUR SUPPORT WILL HELP ::\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy starting budget goal is $1000/month, and this is highly achievable! It can be easily met if every one of you contributed $1/month. If you\u0027re feeling even more generous, a $5/month pledge breaks down to just $0.16 /day! Individually it\u0027s not a lot, but it makes a significant difference in the budget I have to create these projects and THAT\u0027S AWESOME. Meeting these goals will provide a solid steady budget to help achieve the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMORE! (as per discussed above).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHIGHER PRODUCTION VALUE! With a budget, I can go bigger and produce better than ever before, and avoid cutting corners. I produce a lot of collaborative work, and with the funds that I raise here, I can pay other badass creatives TO DO WHAT THEY LOVE! To be able to compensate myself for my work feels wonderful. To be able to creatively oversee projects that will pay OTHERS for their work is a dream come true!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGREATER FREEDOM! Right now I work an average of 9 hours a day everyday on my own business (although this is hard to truly gauge because being an entrepreneur is SO much more than a full time job). Along with running all aspects of this creative enterprise, I dedicate an upwards of 30 HOURS A WEEK to other non-art related part-time jobs to subsidize my projects. Patron contributions will go directly toward covering project costs and necessary life expenses so that I have way more time and energy to focus on the creation of ART, and the freedom to choose projects that are truly reflective of my zones of genius.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEQUIPMENT + STUDIO UPGRADES! A Sony a7SII camera (approx $5000 investment for the camera + all key acoutrements) and Traktor S2 controller ($399.99) are both on my current equipment wish list. These tools will up my art game MASSIVELY.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO HERE WE ARE. THANK YOU! For taking the time to read my words...for supporting me...for being my co-conspirators...for participating in ART! LET\u2019S DO THE DAMN THING!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would prefer to make a one-time contribution or use a platform other than Patreon, I\u0027ve also got a \u003ca href=\"http://www.venmo.com/Morgen-Love\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVenmo\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.
