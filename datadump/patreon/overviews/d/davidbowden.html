Whether you are new to our poetry videos or you have been a fan for years, you mean everything to what we are doing. With your help, we will be able to reach more people with the message of Jesus through creative poetry videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are we? We are a registered 501(c)3 non-profit called The Poetic Inc. We have two main outreach ministries: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/wkimvt.png\" style=\"width: 138px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpoken Gospel and Kleer Series. Spoken Gospel creates Gospel-based poetry videos and shares them online to help people engage with the Bible and the Gospel. Through Spoken Gospel, we are hoping to create poetry videos for every single part of Scripture, showing how it points to Jesus.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/vo32x3.png\" style=\"width: 249px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKleer Series is a video based resource that helps disciple makers around the world start spiritual conversations with skeptical young people in their area. It is already being used by thousands in the UK and Europe, but we want to make follow up series about Jesus, the Bible, and the Church. We also want to translate the existing English videos into other languages to get a wider reacher. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting us here on Patreon you are helping both of these ministries and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/4qikb7.png\" style=\"width: 190px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/v7594h.png\" style=\"width: 190px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/imkqvn.png\" style=\"width: 189px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/1776af.png\" style=\"width: 190px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur poetry videos are being viewed by millions all around the world. But we believe more regular posting, deeper engagement, and directed marketing can help turn more views into more stories of life transformation.
