I invite you to participate in the creation of a feature film, whether financially or creatively. I believe in Angels and I believe in you! Together we can soar above the muck and the mire and see the world from a whole new perspective. Through the eyes of the Divine and with love and compassion.\u00a0This film will be loosely based on my first book, The Magic Doorway into the Divine and the script will be a cross between Eat, Pray, Love and\u00a0The Matrix!\u00a0There are so many extremely talented individuals and artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their crafts and as a result, have accomplished so much in the world. I too have dedicated my life to the inspiration and upliftment of mankind and wish to take it to the next level, beyond words...to the big screen. Won\u0027t you be my Angel?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life began as a dancer, model and aerobics pioneer, but my spirit and Soul had other ideas.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/jkHvoa/MODELING.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the age of 29, I had an enlightenment experience, which was soon followed by a miraculous healing. These two events put me on a completely different course that led me to devoting my life, energy and resources to deepening and integrating these and numerous other such experiences and ultimately to leading my life as one of service to anyone who is disillusioned, fed up, feeling lost and living their lives aimlessly pursuing temporary satisfaction from material or worldly things. So many people feel they are unaware of their true purpose, have no idea who they really are, (beyond concepts and personalities) nor do they know what life really is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/c5bAMv/GLOBE_MAIL.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u2019ve dedicated my life, the past thirty-five years studying with many true Gurus, Mystics and masters both ancient and current. While I encourage people to study with such saint-like individuals, not everyone is open to these types of Masters. In realizing this, I have shared all that I have directly experienced and all that I have learned from these great and timeless beings, freely and openly, hoping to be able to touch those who perhaps prefer, or are more open to, a more contemporary individual who hails from the West. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/d0DCZF/CURRENT.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince my work is freely given, regardless of whether or not someone can pay or donate for the exchange, and in order for me to continue to mentor/coach, I am reaching out to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI wish to create products and services that are designed specifically to act as a \u201clife buoy\u201d or as an inspiration or to be an ongoing educational support,\u003cbr\u003e\nfor any and all who seek to open to and experience true love, purpose and who long to gain a true understanding of this crazy world and challenging times that we are living in and for those who seek to attain a profoundly deep peace that isn\u2019t dependent on anything from the world but, can in turn, truly be a benefit to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/eaokoa/DREAMVISIONS7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been the host for my radio show,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dreamvisions7radio.com/living-in-quantum-love/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiving in Quantum Love\u003c/a\u003e on Dream Visions 7 Radio Network\u00a0out of Boston, Ma, where I interview enlightened guests who share their immense wisdom and even techniques that listeners can easily understand, digest and integrate into their everyday existence.

Devrah\u2019s work is focused on helping individuals to return to the truth of who they really are.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDevrah\u2019s great compassion and vulnerability are mixed with tremendous inner strength and deep conviction in the truth of who she is, and this sets her apart from those using simplistic positive sayings and innumerable concepts that everyone has heard but ultimately only serves to confuse and limit rather than free up and bring clarity. When she looks at another, she looks beyond the outer story, beyond the drama and beyond the outer persona\u2019s and sees the essence, the truth of who we all are and relates with the individual on that level. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDevrah\u2019s profound and transformative work is suitable for the absolute beginner, who is seeking purpose, truth or self-realization, as well as seasoned seekers and teachers of teachers. Her work is non-denominational so there is never any concern about conflict with one\u2019s current religion or path.
