Together with schools and synagogues we have sold thousands of books for kids and adults alike to get to see these stories in a new and exciting light. I want to bring that experience to you every week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support for this project, I want to be able to bring a weekly discussion to life. Education through the arts allows us to feel a sense of empowerment over our values. You will get to view and help create comics each week that you can then use to learn and teach these values anew. Plus, I am making sure each one looks pretty cool :).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis project, much\nlike this page, is a work in progress. I will be sharing initial comic ideas and\nwant to help spread the awareness that this is out there for people looking for\na new way to connect with these stories. Thanks in advance, I hope you enjoy\nthe comics!\u003cbr\u003e"
