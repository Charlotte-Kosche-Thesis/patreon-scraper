    "summary": "Hello everyone, many of you might already know me already as Db0 or DbZer0 on the internetubes, and I\u0027ve been coding game definitions of CCG and LCGs to play on for OCTGN for the past 5 years or so. \u003ca href=\"http://www.octgn.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOCTGN\u003c/a\u003e is an agnostic game engine for tabletop games which supports a significant amount of scripting, something which I use to make the games I develop as streamlined to play and intuitive to use as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work allows many people to experience the games of times past, as well as discover new gems they never had an opportunity to do so before. They also provide an outlet for people to enjoy their favourite games, regardless of how unknown they might be in their local scene. You can see all the games I\u0027m currently maintaining \u003ca href=\"http://dbzer0.com/projects/octgn-game-definitions/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eon my site.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to be doing this for the foreseeable future for free, but many people have come forward with the occasional tip or gift as well as other offers of support since I am not related to the official OCTGN subscription system. Once I learned about patreon, I thought it would be an interesting experiment to see if people would be willing to support my continuous efforts to update, improve and create new and more game definitions to play online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis support is completely optional. I fully plan to continue \nmaintaining and improving all the games I am currently as well as release all \nthe others I\u0027m designing. Nonetheless, if anything ever changes and I stop development (or simply stop delivering to your expectations), you can simply stop your support immediately with no questions asked. The support you\u0027ll be giving me will be on a monthly basis, which is conveniently usually the timeline in which I deliver new updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny funds I receive I am going to treat as motivations to continue producing the best kind of experience that I can, as well as to fund any of my technical expenses, few as those may be. Finally, depending on my patreon\u0027s wishes, there\u0027s even possibilities to expand to new games, help improve existing ones or even create entirely new ones out of scratch if people so wish!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
