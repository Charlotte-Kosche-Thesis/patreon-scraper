All the maps are scaled to 1-inch square grid (5 feet increments) sized to be printed in A1 paper or (breaking it into 4x A3, 2x A2 etc.). There will be where appropriate \u003cstrong\u003etwo versions of each map\u003c/strong\u003e, a player and a DM version. The Player version will not show hidden rooms, passages, traps and any other DM-related notes. The DM version will feature a list of \u003cstrong\u003ekey-elements\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eadventure ideas\u003c/strong\u003e for the dungeon map in a game system-agnostic format. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe result would look like the following picture:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dungeonexpedition.com/images/GameLow_nhe38dh.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eHow to provide your support\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nTo provide your support you have to become my patron. As a patron you can decide how much to pledge for each map and you may also select the maximum number of paid posts to support each month. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example, if you decide to pledge the minimum pledge level ($1) then you will get charged for $1 per paid-map (about $4-5 per month). However you may choose to pledge $1 per map with a maximum of 3 maps per month. You will only get charged if new maps are posted.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be trying to post 4 - 5 maps or handouts per month and usually one of them will be posted for free. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eA few words about me\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nI have been playing role playing games and more specifically Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons for over 20 years. As a DM, for the better part of these 20-odd years, I\u0027ve created numerous campaigns, stories and maps for my players. To this day, I\u0027m trying to develop my map-making and cartography skills to provide a better experience to my players. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am looking forward to teaching my one-year-old son how to play and share these adventures and worlds with him... however until that happens I would like to share my creations with the RPG community all over the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy maps are created entirely on Photoshop, and my approach (unless the map is too big) is to create battle maps with 1-inch square grids that can be printed and be used immediately for an exciting campaign. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope you will enjoy my maps/adventures as much as I did creating them and will help me grow as a DM and artist. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eCopyright Notice\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nAll the maps are registered under the Creative Commons License Attribution-NonCommercial CC BY-NC.
