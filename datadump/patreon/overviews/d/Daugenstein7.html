I wish to share my journey with you and capture your interest with many photos and blogs. Through this, I wish to inspire and motivate other Aspies and folks on the autism spectrum. I wish to let them know. I\u0027ve already defeated the stereotype about people on the spectrum being unable to manage and cope on their own like NT\u0027s. I want the rest of you to know you can do the same. It\u0027s okay to have ASD, and you can do anything you put your mind to. \u00a0Enjoy!",
