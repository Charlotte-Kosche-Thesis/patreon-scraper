I\u0027m a free agent change agent focused on helping individuals, collectives, businesses, ANYONE really, get from where they are to where they\u0027re going. I call it Insight Consulting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my day-to-day I encounter people of all walks of life and when it\u0027s welcome I offer guidance, clarity, next steps, networking, and continual encouragement towards personal, professional, and collective development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal right now is to decouple this labor of love from direct financial compensation so I can truly focus on the work, not the business.\u00a0So here\u0027s the deal: I\u0027m looking for 3000 people to chip in $1 a month to get the mon(k)ey off my back so I can focus exclusively on world changing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I\u0027ve collected a handful of projects that matter quite a bit to me, and may matter to you, such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m helping a wonderful community organizer and small business owner, Ian Schlakman, run as a Green for Baltimore City Council District 12, and he can totally win! \u003ca href=\"http://www.ian12.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.ian12.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m helping another friend with a documentary chronicling the journeys of sexual assault survivors. It\u0027s going to be grounded, artful, and deeply healing. Working title is Voices Carry.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelping an activist/journalist grow his independent publishing company - Brain Paper - and help all manner of unconventional media find its audience.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYet another friend is launching a supplements company but the details gotta stay secret for now. I can say they\u0027ll be natural, necessary, and actually work for their intended purpose!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are at least a dozen more projects and countless individuals that I\u0027m helping on a rolling basis with visioneering, strategy, networking, and implementation. Some of them will eventually be able (and happy to) pay for my services, but for now they are labors of love, as is my work in general. In some of these cases I wish I could be giving THEM money!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me keep it pure. Kick it something tiny and share this page with anyone else who might do the same.\u003cbr\u003e"
