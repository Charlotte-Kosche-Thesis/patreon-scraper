I\u2019ve been working for Marvel and other companies for more than a decade, but\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eTurbo Defiant\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eis my first creator owned comic, a three-book series graphic novel which I started publishing online for free at \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.turbodefiant.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.turbodefiant.com\u003c/a\u003e in January 2010.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe comic featured my very own crafted \u003cem\u003eTurbo Mode\u003c/em\u003e, a sort of interactive take on sequential art that provided a very unique reading experience impossible to achieve on print. It was quite a challenge but a lot of fun as well, here\u0027s a bit of it:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctCdENaKh4E?t=33s\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMarvel did a very similar platform for his digital comics line, and I was happy to see that, but sadly I was forced to stop my own production because my whole thing was grounded on Flash programming, which prevented readers with mobile devices discover the comic. Flash, I know...but Flash made a lot of sense in 2009 \u0026gt;_\u0026lt;\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://turbodefiant.com/images/Turbo_Defiant_book1.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nNevertheless, I finished the first book and then earned a grant that allowed me to finish the second book. I later went nuts and sold my apartment (oh yes, I did that) and funded my publishing company and printed the first book. Book two is ready to go to print and I\u2019m currently working and squeezing the hours to finish the series with something special, an art book would be cool I think. From there, I have a couple of ideas that I\u2019m interested to develop, but first things first! :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve launched a new and responsive website for the comic that can be read on any platform (Yaaay!) and that you can start reading \u003ca href=\"http://www.turbodefiant.com/book-1/book-1-prologue/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e HERE\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve also launched this Patreon page with a good set of rewards for all of you\u00a0who want to support it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiers are pretty simple for the most part, but let me know whatever questions you have. What I really like is the \u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e feature. I honestly think that if you enjoy of Turbo Defiant as much as I do, I\u0027m sure that we could to a lot of things; print the following books, the artbook and even maybe bring back the Turbo version of the comic, this time for everybody to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere I am, dreaming awake again... but heck, if there\u0027s something I wanted to tell with this story is that no matter how many tons of molten metal this life drops over your head, you get up, you breach and follow your dream no matter what.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurbo ON!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
