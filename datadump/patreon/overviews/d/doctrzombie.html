I never thought it would bring me any income and so I\u0027ve continued it for years, enjoying it for what it was: a fun way to share my experience and my thoughts with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of that time and most of my views have been from 2b2t, the world\u0027s worst server. An anarchy server without rules, formed and inhabited by the darkest corners of the internet. Through it all, I\u0027ve kept true to myself and my viewers, and had a steady following for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have often been offered gifts or money for my hobby, but I\u0027ve turned them down because I wanted to be free to stop at any time. In spite of this, I\u0027ve actually become more involved and more excited about my channel and the direction it\u0027s heading. I\u0027ve started new series and my following has tripled in the last year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, my family has suffered a series of heartbreaks and disasters in the last few months, and I\u0027ve become desperate for help. I don\u0027t like doing this because it breaks the special relationship we have---but I\u0027d be deeply grateful if you could find it in your hearts to sponsor my channel. Even a small donation will help us continue on in spite of the difficulties we\u0027ve faced. At three hundred per month (an extremely steep goal, I know) I can afford to keep up the pace of youtube videos on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t or won\u0027t donate, you still have my deepest thanks for being a fan. Thanks for watching!\u003cbr\u003e"
