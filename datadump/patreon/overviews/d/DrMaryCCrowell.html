    "summary": "Hi Folks! I am Mary Crowell, a geeky musician from north\nAlabama who is very active in the filk community. When I am not teaching piano\nI love to write songs about mythology, gaming, beagles, pomegranates, and\nlately\u2014running. I also enjoy making short quirky midi compositions and\narranging piano music, violin and piano duets, and marimba duets, and more! These past years I\u0027ve gotten to make fun music videos with my son Simon Crowell, my husband Wesley Crowell, and a HOST OF INCREDIBLY CREATIVE PEOPLE--some that live local to me and many that live all over the world. You ROCK!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have three solo albums: \u003cem\u003eCourting My Muse\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eAcolytes of the Machine \u0026amp; Other Gaming Stories \u003c/em\u003eand now\u003cem\u003e Scattering Seeds on the Pomegranate Tour\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eavailable through CDBaby and bandcamp.com. Also, I\u0027ve made \u003cem\u003ePlay It With Moxie Live!\u003c/em\u003e with my fellow band mates in Play It With Moxie and \u003cem\u003eThird Thyme\u0027s the Charm\u003c/em\u003e with my fellow band mates in Three Weird Sisters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eScattering Seeds on the Pomegranate Tour\u003c/em\u003e funded due to a successful Kickstarter that many of you here helped me with in a myriad of ways. Thank you! This album is available\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://marycrowell.bandcamp.com/album/scattering-seeds-on-the-pomegranate-tour\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere at Bandcamp\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.cdbaby.com/cd/marycrowell4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere at CDBaby\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy offer a monthly subscription service?\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s\nfun to share the music Right After I Make It. I am very excited about my\nnewest album, \u003cem\u003eScattering Seeds on the\nPomegranate Tour\u003c/em\u003e. But, let\u2019s face it: I\u0027ve been writing a bunch of songs that I would love to have heard. Not only can they not all fit on a\n10-14 song album, but sometimes I often have multiple arrangements of certain\nsongs I want to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been making\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1zVq1m7nAPVZDpV-I5BolZAh8vGU-lVA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esome silly music videos\u003c/a\u003e here over the last two years. My first one, \"I Put My Low Stat\" was filmed locally, but since then my patrons and friends here and elsewhere have been contributing their video footage from England, Canada, Germany, as well as the United States to several of the Patreon videos. That has been awesome, inspiring, and SO MUCH FUN!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
