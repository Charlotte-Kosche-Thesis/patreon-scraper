Eventually my love of comics and animation, as well as my technical and design licks, need me to a job in the early Computer Games world. I was the third artist hired by the LUCASFILM GAMES division and I drew vast martian landscapes with a joystick and PIXELS AS BIG AS YOUR HEAD!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOver the years I got to work on a ton of exciting projects Like the MYSTERY OF MONKEY ISLAND series, a couple of INDIANA JONES titles and an entire string of flight simulator games that started with BATTLEHAWKS 1942 and culminated in the original X-WING series (X-WING, TIE FIGHTER and X-WING VS TIE FIGHTER). Yes, I actually got paid to design Space Ships like the TIE DEFENDER.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\tTAKE THAT Mrs. Blankenship who said my doodling in the margins of my history notes would never lead anywhere!\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI Also designed educational applications for Doctors, worked on my first MMO when we still popped out collars and listened to Oingo Boingo and learned what total moron PACMAN was IN 3D!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tLike so many of my artist pals in those days though, I started out just wanting to be a comic artist and an occasional animator. Put simply I wanted to make stories of one type or another that made people laugh and maybe wonder a bit.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tTo that end I began to turn all the knowledge I have garnered by growing up with the digital art world and bend it back to where I started my career.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhy Steampunk\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSteampunk was once described as \u201cNostalgia for a time that never was\u201d, It is a genre that started at the end of the last century and has succeeded in captivating the imaginations of millions of readers and viewers while still remaining delightfully nebulous. In a world where so much is rigidly defined Steampunk is only limited by the dreams and fantasies of the artisans and fans of the genre.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSo that\u2019s my pitch contributing to my PATREON Coffers will enable me to produce more Art, more animation and more STUFF in general. Additionally we will have some fun along the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003eLINE UP, SIGN UP AND RE-ENLIST TODAY!\n\u003c/h3\u003e"

I was a child with a stack of bond, a Ticonderoga #2 and a dream. \u00a0Soon I moved to clay, then action figures in the seemingly endless \"circle of Animation\".\u003cbr\u003eMy first professional gig was animating stacks of 16 colors of Electronic Lego Bricks for George Lucas. After that I turned electric spaghetti into X-Wings and TIE Fighters before moving on to watching in terror as PACMAN grew arms and legs like some radioactive Mutant.\u003cbr\u003eAfter that I sat on an street corner on the Internet with a sign that said \"will zBrush for BitCoins\" until turning back to where I started.\u003cbr\u003eSo now I am back at the drawing board, only the oxberry disc is now a Cintiq, the palette is 32 bits deep and the bond gets backed up to the servers at night.",
