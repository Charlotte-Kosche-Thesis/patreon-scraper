I\u0027m\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dithoricki\"\u003edithoricki\u003c/a\u003e, an freelance illustrator. Art has always been very special to me but it has never been something that I was told could be my job. It was always a hobby that pleased my mother, as she could show her friends and our relatives what I could do. In my adult years I\u0027ve decided that my passion for art is nothing I want to have as just a hobby. There must be more than just that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Fxvwkbm.png\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSome of you might know me already from my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dithoricki\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e channel where I\u0027ve been making videos for over 6 years. Just as with my art I try any way I can to make people smile and maybe forget the hard day they\u0027ve had. With my videos, I seem to be able to do just that, and I would like to continue with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreating my illustrations takes time, and the little time I have now is mainly focused on my art. And just like everyone else, I need money to pay bills and rent and to buy food. To be able to spend more time creating art and learn and grow as an illustrator, I need your help. With your help I might be able to make art my full time job and actually do what it is I love doing. I can grow as an artist together with my art and keep giving you more of this wonderful world I have in my mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with you help I would also be able to make videos at a steady pace. And not only have fun, but put a smile on other peoples faces as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePlans\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nExcept making standalone illustrations, I\u0027m currently working on my comic, \"dithoricki\", that has been in my mind since my teenage years. I\u0027m also working on a children\u0027s book that I still don\u0027t have the title for.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
