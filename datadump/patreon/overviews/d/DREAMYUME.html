    "summary": "Hello Dreamers, I want to use this section to thank you all for being so loving and continuing to support me. I want to offer you all these options as a little something extra. The money that is given to us through this Patreon will be used to get us better equipment; such as lighting, camera etc. As well as to help us get a better video editing software. Our current software is not very user-friendly and does not give us many options when it comes to making our videos more fun ( more texts, filters, Special effects etc.) Not only that but we are starting to run out of space for our videos. We have already gone through THREE 2TB Hard drives and are now having to delete some of our older videos \ud83d\ude2d T T. \u003cbr\u003eEventually I would love for this to become a full time job for me, I honestly already feel like the amount of hours I put into making these videos feels like a full time job anyways hahaha I also think that these exclusive offerings are going to be a lot of fun!!! The things we are offering on our Patreon actually wouldn\u0027t\u00a0be allowed on YouTube, So I am glad that we have found a way to do these new shows through Patreon \ud83d\ude01 YAY! I am super excited for the LIVE KPOP PARTY\u00a0\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udc9c That is going to be so much fun. If you can\u0027t become a Patreon it is ok!!! I love you all no matter what!!! Dreamers Keep on Dreaming, See you in the next video!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Joey"
