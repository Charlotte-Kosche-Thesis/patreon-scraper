I set this goal in 2012 I think, and started Chemical Technologies in 2013, which would have led to me getting a Chemical Engineering Doctorate, which would have allowed me my dream of creating chemical and biological weapons for the Pentagon. In Fall 2014 I realized this was wrong, and after getting my degree in Chemical Technologies Spring 2015, I went back to Cincinnati State for Graphic Design in Fall 2015. Now I can use my skills to help people, serve God, bring happiness, and raise awareness for issues that plague this world.",
