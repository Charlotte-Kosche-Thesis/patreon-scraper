    "summary": "Dublin Digital Radio is an online digital radio station dedicated to providing a quality platform for the various communities striving to create a socially and culturally progressive city in a landscape netted with political stasis and bureaucratic tepidity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFounded in October 2016, DDR has quickly expanded from solely broadcasting live every weekend to having over sixty shows with new shows being added each week. For us this highlights the demand that such a platform has, that there is a need for such a platform to exist to link the various communities operating both in Dublin and Ireland to each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDDR is a home in Ireland for all those with a passion for music, politics, people, community, stories and debate. We are a community run station, the webs of our relationships to the wider social sphere ebbing through us through the people that volunteer both behind the station and the shows that air.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to continue to grow, to embed ourselves as an essential part of Dublin life, as the go to media platform for Ireland\u0027s disenfranchised youth. For that we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want you to become part of Dublin Digital Radio and subscribe to our vision of what our online radio station can be. We want more music, more voices, and more events in the future and for that we need your support. Whether it\u0027s a monthly subscription to help us cover our costs such as rent and bills to aiding us improve our studio with new gear or even volunteering at our studio, your help is vital in DDR unleashing its full potential.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the first six months are anything to go by, we\u0027ll all have fun getting there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
