I\u0027m hoping to use this Patreon to turn my hobby into something more than just that, perhaps into a career!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake note that regardless whether you support me or not, my Fanfiction stories will keep going on and I will not stop those who can\u0027t or are unwilling to support me here from reading my stories. They will remain as free as they are now! I\u0027m not selling Fanfiction here in any way or form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Fanfiction will remain absolutely free and available to everyone. In the end, you are supporting me to allow me to write more, Fanfiction or original work. Note that only my original works will be released on this site. Fanfiction will remain available elsewhere, where it always has been available.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, supporting me here will allow me to write more, both fanfiction and original works, by spending less hours on work and more hours on writing. It will also undoubtedly improve the quality of my works by letting me write more. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect, which is very true in the case of writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my work, if it makes you smile, if it somehow improved your day... would you want to see more of it? If yes, then please consider supporting me with whatever you can! Depending on how things will go from here, more goals will be added or existing ones be changed, for the better too! Keep that in mind!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor any who decide to pledge, I thank you from the bottom of my heart."
