    "summary": "Hello!! It\u0027s so exciting to say my first hello!!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Dana and I make ASMR videos on Youtube :)\u003cbr\u003eThe channel name is obviously [DanaASMR] teehee\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know what ASMR is here is a short description that may help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*ASMR?*\u003cbr\u003eASMR(Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) is a sensible experience like psychological relaxation or pleasant feeling as a reaction of visual, touching, hearing, smell or recognition stimuli. For example,\u00a0when your mom comb your hair as a kid or when\u00a0you get a haircut, you might have felt sleepy or relaxed throughout the whole process. Or when you go to the mountains or sea, you might have felt relaxed and calm\u00a0while listening to the sound of the nature. This\u00a0feeling is called ASMR.\u00a0It\u0027s\u00a0a certain feeling\u00a0that\u00a0makes you feel comfortable and relaxed under certain circumstances. If it gets intense, you might feel \"tingle\" which is a unique feeling that you get when you here specific sounds. Many people feel \"tingle\" through their head down to their spine, but I saw many people get tingles and relaxing feelings on many parts of their body.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Who \u0026amp; Why listen ASMR?*\u003cbr\u003eMostly, people who have insomnia, sleeping disorder and who want to focus on something, like studying, listen to ASMR. Of course, there are some people who want to be relaxed or who like to listen to certain kinds of sounds also listen to ASMR. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a ASMR listener myself for almost 4-5 years and ever since I watched first ASMR video on Youtube, it has been part of my everyday life until now. I got so many tingles when I watched my first video even before I knew what tingles and ASMR is and I\u00a0instantly knew that I\u0027m going to get addicted to these videos\u00a0haha.\u00a0\u00a0And after listening to them for more than a year, I decided to start my own channel. I wanted to make my own ASMR videos and introduce them to people who don\u0027t know this. I\u0027m so happy that I decided to do that :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing ASMR videos as a hobby for last 3 years and just started to become a full-time youtuber recently. But even though, it always have been more than\u00a0a hobby to me. Of course, it wasn\u0027t always easy scheduling between my university life and youtube life, but I absolutely enjoyed the moment of making ASMR videos and sharing with my subscribers. The most exciting part of all of this is when my subscribers watch my videos and tell me that\u00a0they get tingles and relaxed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main goals as\u00a0a full-time youtuber is making contents in different languages. I\u0027m guilty for making Korean videos mostly until now, but I always wanted to interact with people from around the world and share my videos with them if they\u0027d like to. I\u0027m planning on making many English videos from now on, and I also have so many ideas and plans for roleplay ASMR and different categories. So to continue on making videos with various and new contents, I decided to open this patreon after listening about its existence from one of my subscriber. I really felt bad at first for taking any kind of money from my subscribers to be complete honest, but the reality is I have so many mics, audio relate items (audio mixer and so on), background items, and many videos effects (that need outer help - it would take me hundreds of years to learn them myself) that I want to complete my ideas into actual videos. So after thinking about it, I decided to just open this and see how it goes :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s why I\u0027m starting all this. Thank you so much for dropping by and I would be very very thankful if you decide to become my patrons. I\u0027m really new to all this so I don\u0027t know what I can do for you specially but I will study and see what I can do for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again so much for dropping by and I hope you enjoy my ASMR videos.\u003cbr\u003eGood Night Everyone :]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
