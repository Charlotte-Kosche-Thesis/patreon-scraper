    "summary": "Hello fellow English majors and friends! It\u0027s Alyssa here, the founder and managing editor of DearEnglishMajor.com. Dear English Major is a website dedicated to showing English majors all that is possible with an English degree. Since I launched the site in March 2014, Dear English Major has grown into a vibrant, enthusiastic community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is Dear English Major so awesome?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eSo many English majors find themselves in the same position: They LOVE reading and writing and want nothing more than to spend four wonderful years of college working towards receiving an English degree. But all too often, English majors are told the same negative things again and again: \u201cYou won\u2019t make any money with an English degree.\u201d \u201cNo one wants to hire English majors.\u201d \u201cAll you can do is teach.\u201d The list of negativity we endure goes on and on! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBased on my own job searches and career experience, I\u2019ve learned that there are so many real, fantastic opportunities out there for English majors. When I was first creating Dear English Major, I wanted to show other English majors that many of the negative ideas surrounding the English major just aren\u0027t true. \u003cstrong\u003eI wanted to empower English majors to see value in their own unique talents and skills. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDearEnglishMajor.com is the only website dedicated to giving current or recently graduated English students a sense of direction regarding their careers. \u003cstrong\u003eThe site features more than 100 (and counting) stories from people pursuing careers as a result of their English degrees.\u003c/strong\u003e We also publish dozens of articles and offer field-specific resource pages designed to give readers practical, actionable advice about the unique challenges they\u2019re facing. I am constantly working to share new content with readers, and I post several times each month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond the website itself, the Dear English Major community includes 16k+ Facebook followers, 5k+ Instagram followers and 3k+ Twitter followers. \u003cstrong\u003e20+ universities have added DearEnglishMajor.com to their websites as a resource for students, too! How cool is that?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDear English Major is empowering English majors (and soon-to-be English majors) with information. YES, you can get a job with an English degree. NO, you don\u0027t have to live in a cardboard box after graduation. We show you how to make the most of your college education and thrive in the job market.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why should you pledge your hard-earned money to Dear English Major?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI have invested countless hours of time and thousands of dollars into creating and managing the website, and ensuring that thousands of English majors find and benefit from its resources. Now that Dear English Major is up and running (and thriving), I need to find a more sustainable way to keep DearEnglishMajor.com in full operation so it can keep benefiting each new class of English majors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the interest of readers, I\u0027ve said \"no\" to Google ads to help offset my costs. But that means I am going to need the support of folks who love Dear English Major to keep things afloat! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledged $1 each month, that would be $12 each year. \u003cstrong\u003e$12 is one ticket to the movies. $12 is one paperback book. $12 is one bag of coffee. \u003c/strong\u003eAnd $12 can help Dear English Major continue to inspire smart, ambitious, and motivated English majors to share their creativity with the world\u2014and make money doing it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
