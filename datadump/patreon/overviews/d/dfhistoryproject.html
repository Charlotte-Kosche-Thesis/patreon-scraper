    "summary": "When you marry into a family as large as the Deacons in Rockbridge County, you a playbook\u00a0 to keep all the names and connections straight.\u00a0 The Deacon Family History Project is my way of creating such a family reference book.\u00a0 Now somewhere in its eight generation, my husband and I joke that this is truly a never-ending story that may keep me busy for many years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe family is descended from one man (Wiliam Deacon) who settled in a part of Virginia that was then known as the frontier (late 1700s). In 1955, William\u0027s descendants formed the Deacon Family Association that, to this day, support education opportunities for its children, hold a large reunion near the original homestead and help with community projects.\u00a0 As part of this work, a genealogy record was published in 1963 with a supplement to the original document being published sometime around 1980. The DFHP is an attempt to pick up where the previous record left off and not only create a family tree but also find out who these people were and what they accomplished. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, this project will be able to proceed without the limitation of our family budget.\u00a0 Support in any amount is appreciated and earns patrons a peek at the working notes of the research.\u00a0 More generous donors get discounted access to whatever is published from this research.\u00a0 Thank you for helping move this \u0027Never-Ending Story\u0027 forward.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***When time permits we will create and upload a video glimpse of the Deacon family.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
