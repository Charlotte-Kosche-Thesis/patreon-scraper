    "summary": "Hi friends, Tyler Kimble from Duelcastermage.com here. If you managed to find this page, chances are you are a fan of, or at least interested in, an incredibly niche sub-format (Duel Commander) of a popular format (Commander) within a reasonably popular game (Magic: the Gathering). I played regular multiplayer Commander for a number of years, and found it enjoyable, but there were several things about it that I didn\u0027t care for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eToo much time is wasted waiting for other players to take their turns/make decisions (selfish, I know!).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe (too) high starting life totals basically require decks to incorporate infinite combos to be able to finish games in a reasonable amount of time. Even \"Stax\" builds need to have infinite combos to end the game, as dealing 120 damage to the table is unrealistic.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m not a huge fan of table talk \u0026amp; politics. I like to let my actions in the game speak for themselves.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne-for-one interaction is actively bad. If I spend a card dealing with one of my opponents\u0027 cards, the ones who really benefit are my other opponents.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRed is highly non-competitive as a color, and aggro is non-competitive as a archetype.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBUT,\u003c/strong\u003e there are some amazing aspects to Commander that captured my imagination from the very beginning, namely:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Commander him/herself. Nothing gets the creative juices of deck building flowing like looking at \u003ca href=\"https://scryfall.com/card/csp/27\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArcum Dagsson\u003c/a\u003e and going, \"WOW, how can I abuse this?!?\" \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe 100-card singleton deck building \"restriction\" allows obscure cards to shine that don\u0027t see play in Vintage or Legacy because of better alternatives being available or the redundancy of being able to jam 4 copies in a 60-card deck. Deck building for Commander is an immensely enjoyable experience in and of itself, largely because of this structure (and yet those last few cuts are still soooo painful!).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first heard about Duel Commander, I was immediately hooked, because, for me, it combined the best aspects of Commander with the best aspects of Legacy or other constructed formats. I don\u0027t mean to knock anyone who\u0027s a fan of regular Commander - like I said, I still enjoy it - but for me nothing captures my imagination like 1v1 Commander. I lay awake in bed at night thinking of new decks to build or the nuances of different card choices for existing decks. This habit can really mess with your sleep! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time of writing, I have 36 unique Duel Commander decks built on XMage, with many more in the works. I\u0027ve been playing on that platform for over a year and have played against everything from casual\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://scryfall.com/card/rav/236\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTolsimir Wolfblood\u003c/a\u003e to hyper-competitive\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://scryfall.com/card/cn2/78\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQueen Marchesa\u003c/a\u003e, and find it all fun and challenging and I\u0027m still itching to play, even with nothing on the line but pride. My point is, I know this format inside and out at this point, and I can help you take your game to the next level too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, yeah, I get your thoughts on Commander, but who ARE you? \u003c/strong\u003eGood question! I\u0027m a\u00a030-something part-time engineer currently living a nomadic life traveling the world with my lovely girlfriend Linda. In 2015, I transitioned my full-time office job to a part-time, remote gig, donated or sold nearly all my possessions, and bought a one-way ticket to Belize to start a crazy adventure with no real plan or itinerary. Two years later, my girlfriend and I are still traveling the world, learning new languages, savoring tasty local cuisine, seeing some incredible sights, and making the oddest of friends in the oddest of places. Oh, and taking the odd 3 AM work call from back in the States (always a treat). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both love to play Magic in our spare time and want to share some of that joy with the wider world. I\u0027ve been playing this wonderful game since 1999, and Duel Commander since 2014. Given our current nomadic situation, we play on digital platforms 100% of the time now. One benefit of that for you is that there really is no limit to the types of decks we can build - everything is on the table!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat content do you produce, and where can I find it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I primarily create high-quality videos of recorded 1v1 Commander matches, detailed deck techs, single card strategy, and reviews of new cards for 1v1 Commander. You can find my content, which is and will always be free to the general public, on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbiTplcorDoyuWx3T9r8A-Q\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.duelcastermage.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDuelcastermage.com\u003c/a\u003e. On my website, I have a full video archive, as well as additional articles that touch on some more meta topics that work better in a text format rather than a video format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your short and long-term goals? \u003c/strong\u003eShort term,\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d like to do is test the waters of the relatively new 1v1 Commander format on MTGO. I think that Wizards finally beginning to officially support this type of format is a step in the right direction, and I\u0027m excited to get in on the ground floor and play a role, offer feedback, etc., as it\u0027s really kind of the \"Wild West\" right now from what I hear. Another short term goal of mine is to start streaming on Twitch or YouTube and build a community of followers to drum up excitement of the format as an e-sport.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I get a bit more established, I\u0027d love to start a podcast or video series with another host to bounce strategy and ideas off of. We can also have \"grudge matches\" for specific commander matchups the community is interested in seeing play out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong term, I want to take 1v1 Commander \"to the next level\", which for me means coming out the other side of the fracturing that has taken place recently after the Duel Commander Committee dropped the starting life total to 20, Leviathan emerged as a (somewhat) competing format, and Wizards created their own 1v1 format with 30 life. Not to mention the fact that all of these formats have different banlists. A lot of players don\u0027t even know what you\u0027re talking about exactly right now when you say you play 1v1 Commander. A lot of the dedicated forums (MTG Salvation, r/duelcommander) are on life support, but I know there is a lot of pent-up interest for 1v1 Commander that is going unmet in large part due to this fracturing. I believe I can be a strong voice for unification if I build a community of passionate players that have the long-term health of the format in mind. That will require time and dedication and collaboration, but I\u0027m more than up to the task! I intend Duelcaster Mage to have the best 1v1 content anywhere on the internet in order to meet these goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would financial support on Patreon mean for you? \u003c/strong\u003eIt would\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003emean a great deal! As I mentioned earlier, I have a part-time job right now and have time to dedicate to building this community, but at the same time, it is difficult to make ends meet. Without any financial support, I will most likely have to go back to working a full-time job in a few months\u0027 time, which would mean less time to dedicate to producing quality 1v1 Commander content (and therefore less content overall). Furthermore, it would mean a lot to me personally to know that people care about what I am doing and that I am not just ranting into the void! No one is getting rich from 1v1 Commander tournaments; we are playing this quasi-official, mostly unsupported format because we love it and want to see it survive and thrive for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I just want to say a \u003cstrong\u003eHUGE THANK YOU \u003c/strong\u003eto all my Patrons. You inspire me, hold me to my goals, and keep the fire going to create the BEST 1v1 Commander content, anywhere, period. I couldn\u0027t do it without you!"
