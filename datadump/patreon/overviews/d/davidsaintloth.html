The Action Oriented Workflow (AOW) paradigm and the autonomous work routing algorithms (ADA).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) My continued research on the importance of salience based guidance for developing true dynamic cognition (AI) via my theory of dynamic cognition and consciousness. (DCC).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) My continued description of the necessary steps toward building a global Self Healing Infrastructure( SHI) this will allow humans to pinch off the labor force.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) My continued research on methods and technologies leveraged to finally cure humanity of the disease of aging and enable us to move beyond \u00a0terrestrial isolation on this planet and out into the stars. Once we are free from work because we live in an autonomous work routing fabric where physical labor is done by robots and energy comes from the sun, living arbitrarily long healthy lives is the next biggest problem to conquer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) My continued production of creative works in the realms of illustration, graphic design, my production of shirt products via Geek Varietees.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6) My continued commentary on all things Science, Politics, History or other wise related via my sounding board at sent2null space my blog , my medium profile and my public Facebook posts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you find my research and content of interest and want to see me continue to produce them please consider a recurring donation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "One of the ironies of having invented the concept of workforce emancipation is that I am still very much in the process of emancipating myself from the hegemony of time and in particular the daily grind that is required for me to survive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurvival requirements of working for pay used to purchase food and comfort and housing is the single greatest impediment to human creativity. In the past the significant costs of such survival requirements ensured that the average life span for human beings up to just about a century ago barely got over the 40\u0027s. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn many parts of the world these age limitations are still very much in force as human potential is wasted on survival considerations and creativity that otherwise would happen can not because people are too busy simply surviving.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current living situation has me fortunate to be in NYC but still able to survive (barely) with a relatively modest cost for housing and food. If \u00a0I can earn this pledge on a monthly basis I would be liberated to fully engage my creativity (and in particular move forward building workforce emancipation for all) in the following ways:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) I will be able to pay full rent for my living expenses, purchase food and supplies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) I will be able to set aside critical funds for attending startup meetup events, investor meetups and other critical networking events that can enable my connection to larger funding sources in the form of angel investors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) I will be able to devote without stress, full focus on building the minimal viable product (MVP) for the WorkNetz service that I have been trying to get out the door. WorkNetz is the web site that will introduce a suite of services that enable human beings to emancipate themselves in interesting ways. The first service will ironically be focused on solving the problem of recruiting that pesters the industry ....companies have difficulty finding the right candidates for their organizations...the first service will be able to provide companies a solution that efficiently solves this problem better than any existing solution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) Looking forward, I will be able to engage research on extending the framework beyond intelligent work routing and fully into dynamic cognition (artificial intelligence) by mounting efforts to implement the salience theory of dynamic cognition on a smart phone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I receive this goal consistently for about 6 months (the target milestone) I estimate I can complete the MVP and then use it to graduate the service to active use by clients. From there I can gain the critical traction \u003cstrong\u003ethat investors I\u0027ve already spoken to say they need to see in order for them to consider investment in my venture!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e150 contributors at $20 per contributor will allow me to satisfy my monthly goals, that\u0027s\u00a0 less than 4 starbucks coffees in a week!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help make this happen by contributing some portion of this amount every month for at least the next 5 months. The right volume of recurring contributors could allow me to gain these listed freedoms and critically bring workforce emancipation closer to us all.\u003cbr\u003e",
