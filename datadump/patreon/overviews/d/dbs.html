    "summary": "Hey! I\u2019m David Bordeaux, host of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://davidbordeaux.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe David Bordeaux Show\u003c/a\u003e.\nThe show is a podcast all about discovering the underlying fundamentals of\nsuccess through the lenses of health, fitness, martial arts, and education so\nthat you can take your life to the next level. As it turns out, our listeners really\nlike this. Listeners have suggested that I join Patreon so that they have a direct\nway of supporting the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat\u2019s Patreon? If you\u2019re new here, I\u2019ll share a little bit\nas to what it is and how you can use it to help show support for The David\nBordeaux Show. Patreon is a place where people, just like you, can provide\nfinancial support to artists, writers, podcasters, and many more. This is not a\nnew idea, as patronage \u2013 that is, the financial support an individual bestows\nupon another to support their creative endeavors \u2013 has been around for\nhundreds, if not thousands, of years. Many artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci,\nenjoyed the financial support of noble and ecclesiastical patrons. Patreon is a\nmodern way for people to support creative people through the power of\ncroudfunding. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do enjoy making the podcast, there are costs\nassociated with it \u2013 all of which I pay out of my own pocket. I do this because\nI really enjoy creating the episodes, talking with some of the best minds\naround, and receiving letters of appreciation from listeners. The idea behind\nsupporting the show here on Patreon is that you trust me to use the ongoing\nmonthly budget as I see fit. The more support I have, the more I can put into\nthe show to make it as great as it can be for you, the listener. The money will\ngo towards updating the recording equipment, having the show professionally\nproduced, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe key thing with this is: I am rolling the dice with this,\nas this is a huge experiment. With that said, those that know me know that I\nlisten, and with your support we will make this work, and we will succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery patron who is supporting this show is important. Any\namount used to support this show \u2013 \u003cem\u003eeven one dollar\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 is important and really\nhelps. Whether you support the show for a dollar or five dollars,\u003cstrong\u003e thank you\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e"
