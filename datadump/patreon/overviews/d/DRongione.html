I am married to my best friend and serve as \"mommy\" to my rotten dog, Mitch. \u00a0My days are typically filled with writing, editing, website maintenance, housework, and the occasional consumption of chocolate. \u00a0(Okay, who am I kidding? \u00a0There\u0027s a lot of chocolate consumed in this house!) \u00a0I love herbal tea and long hikes with my husband and dog. \u00a0But above all, I love sharing the gospel of Christ and feel blessed beyond all measure that the Lord has called me to such a noble occupation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026lt;center\u0026gt;\u003cimg src=\"http://www.danarongione.com/uploads/2/2/5/8/2258612/question2_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u0026lt;/center\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\nI write all types of Christian books, ranging from fiction for young children to devotional and Christian Living books for adults. \u00a0My devotional series, Giggles and Grace: \u00a0Daily Devotionals for Women, is highly popular as is my middle-grade mystery series, The Delaware Detectives. \u00a0As of yet, I do not have anything for young adults, but I am currently working on a series to fill that void, and I am very excited about it as it allows me to combine two of my passions: \u00a0the Bible and medieval Camelot. \u00a0You can find an entire listing of the books I offer along with information about each at my website,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://danarongione.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDanaRongione.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026lt;center\u0026gt;\u003cimg src=\"http://www.danarongione.info/uploads/3/1/6/3/3163756/bookbundlepic_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 479px;\"\u003e\u0026lt;/center\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026lt;center\u0026gt;\u003cimg src=\"http://www.danarongione.com/uploads/2/2/5/8/2258612/question3_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u0026lt;/center\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\nI firmly believe in adage, \u0026#8220;Ministry is\nnot about the income; it\u0027s about the outcome.\u0026#8221; While I\nam not in this ministry to make money, it does take\u00a0money to maintain it,\nand that\u0027s where you come in. Here are just a few things your\npartnership will enable me to do:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1.) Produce more\ncontent.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately,\nfull-time writing doesn\u0027t mean writing full-time. Much of my time is\nspent on tedious and time-consuming tasks like website maintenance,\nblog design, editing, podcast formatting and much more. With enough\nmoney, I could hire out these tasks andfocus on churning out more\nbooks. After all, the list of book ideas that the Lord has given me\nis enormous and constantly growing. Outsourcing these other necessary\ntasks would free up more time for me to just write.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e2.) Spend more\none-on-one time with you.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the years, many\npeople have reached out to me for help, encouragement and biblical\ntraining. I\u0027ve done my best to help each one as much as possible, but\nas you can imagine, it can become time-consuming. On top of that,\nwhat I\u0027ve discovered is that I\u0027m often giving the same answers or\nadvice because people are dealing with similar issues. Becoming a\npartner gives you a chance to become part of a community where we can\nchat and share our burdens. You\u0027ll have direct access to me as well\nas to others who may be facing the same struggles you\u0027re facing.\nTogether, we can lift each other up and share the love of Christ.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e3.) Give more to\nthose who need extra love and care.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nChristian authors\nare often called upon to donate books to worthy causes, but what many people often fail to realize is that the authors must cover all the\nexpenses, including purchasing the books and paying for postage. Over\nthe years, I have donated books to missionaries, prison ministries,\norphanages and even police departments, but I would love to do more.\nWhat if these words of encouragement could reach nursing homes,\ncrisis centers, homeless shelters and much more throughout the world?\nWith your help, we could accomplish that goal.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e4.) Upgrade the\nministry.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFortunately for the\n\u0026#8220;starving artists\u0026#8221; like me, the technological world offers a lot\nof free options for blog posting, podcast recording and even\npublishing. Unfortunately, the old adage \u0026#8220;you get what you pay for\u0026#8221;\ncomes into play. While these free options are enough to get an author\nstarted, they do have their limitations. For example, I recently had\nto reduce my weekday devotions to four days a week as I couldn\u0027t\nafford the upgrade that was required by my email provider. I have run\ninto similar issues with my blog and website. There are things I\nwould love to do to make my sites and products more attractive and\nuser-friendly, but such changes cost money. Your monthly support\nwould open new doors of possibility for my ministry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u0026lt;center\u0026gt;\u003cimg src=\"http://www.danarongione.com/uploads/2/2/5/8/2258612/question4_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u0026lt;/center\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tThe beauty of Patreon is that I am able to offer various levels of rewards to my supporters. \u00a0Everyone who joins my ministry community will obviously have my heartfelt thanks, but you\u0027ll also have access to posts and updates that no one else will be able to view. \u00a0In addition, each level of patronage comes with its own rewards and perks, so be sure to check out the \"Rewards\" section on the right to see what I\u0027m offering. \u00a0Lastly, I believe that God blesses those who bless others. \u00a0Not everyone can afford to give, and I understand that. \u00a0But for those of you who can, I truly believe that God will reward you above and beyond what you contribute. \u00a0That\u0027s just how loving and gracious He is!\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProverbs 25:11 says, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eA word fitly spoken is like apples of gold\nin pictures of silver. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI long to speak those words.
