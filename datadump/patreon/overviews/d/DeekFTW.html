In case you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll introduce myself. I\u0027m Deek and I create creative gaming\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/deekftwin\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evideos on the YouTube\u003c/a\u003e. What is \u003cem\u003ecreative gaming\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0you might ask? Well the answer is simple. I have always loved to play games that give me the power to create things. This is why I\u0027ve played many, many hours in games such as Rollercoaster Tycoon, The Sims, Cities: Skylines, and of course, Minecraft.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI decided back in June of 2015 to start to share my gaming experiences with you on YouTube. My channel is slightly different from the run of the mill gaming channel in that I like to try to \u003cem\u003eshowcase\u003c/em\u003e what I do in games. Because I tend to play games that let me create things, I try to focus my videos on the final results rather than the boring bits of me thinking about what I\u0027m doing. I also love to read your comments so I try to incorporate as many of your suggestions into my videos as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8PuEgJ9rQbVF1xabJqSysmHEdLdX9gtJ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://deekftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cedar-Flags-Patreon-Img.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve enjoyed what I\u0027ve done over on my channel and wish to support me, this is the place to do so! At the moment, I work full time on top of other life things that prevent me from putting out as much content as I would like to. With your help, I will be able to put more time and effort into doing what I love: creating. Not only will I be able to build bigger and better things in games but also create quality content for you to view on YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour donations will go toward things that will directly impact the channel such as equipment expenses, computer upgrades, and software expenditures. With a more powerful computer I will be able to keep the series that you love going longer. Those shiny new parts will be able to keep up with us whereas a weaker computer wouldn\u0027t be able to handle the size of a creation anymore. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou will also be helping the channel in less direct ways by helping me afford those pesky life expenses like food, rent, and student loan payments (those are a big one). Each donation that you give will allow me to focus less and less on the worries of finances and more on the things that matter: interacting with you\u00a0creating and content that you enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0The future is bright for the channel and with your help I will be able to take it to the next level that much faster!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8PuEgJ9rQbVA70lnYihLBCXkw2Vj25Yq\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://deekftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/OWB-Patreon-img.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027ve come to the right place! Supporting my channel is easy with Patreon. Simply click the big \"Become a Patron\" button at the top of this page. Decide how big of a monthly donation you would like to give and Patreon will guide you through the rest of the process! You have the option to sign up for a reward tier or to just donate without claiming a reward package. What you chose is up to you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you cannot support me on Patreon then no worries! Patreon supporters will not be given preferential treatment on the channel or in the comment sections. They will have access to certain perks from the reward section but they will never dictate \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e viewing experience on the channel. If you cannot afford to support me with direct donations then the best way to show your support is to continue to watch my videos and keep commenting and helping me out in whatever series we\u0027re playing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8PuEgJ9rQbWd26P08bhhcQ97NNNVyhrp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://deekftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Scrap-Mechanic-Patreon-img.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan I contact you if I have any questions?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely!
