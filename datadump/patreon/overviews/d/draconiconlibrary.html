And there are ever so many...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously, I\u0027m a guy writing furry porn and doing pretty darn good at it. I\u0027ve been doing it seriously for about four years now, and have a gallery of over 1,900 stories on Furaffinity, and if you\u0027re interested, you can find my gallery here:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/draconicon/\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/draconicon/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been called a writing machine, and I take pride in being able to deliver good stories quickly. Over the years I\u0027ve honed that craft, and regularly write over 15k words per day, sometimes as much as 24k words.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I want to take that to the next step.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here because I want to write new ideas. I want to write long stories, from novella to novel length, which can involve as much plot as porn. Don\u0027t get me wrong, there\u0027s going to be porn - and a LOT of it - but it will follow the ideas that pop into my head, follow a coherent plot, and, of course, involve a lot of input from you guys. I will need characters, after all, and I wouldn\u0027t ask you guys to join in and support something that you don\u0027t get anything out of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously, my main reason for being here is so that I can write something for myself. I write commissions all the time. This is my way of treating myself, and hopefully, treating those of you that want to see me doing what I do best. Writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat am I doing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSeries, for the most part. I\u0027m writing long-running series of stories. So far, it\u0027s been a chapter book of perversion (The Porn Note, Island of Wet Dreams, Beta Testers), but there\u0027s also the possibility of a short-story anthology of pure kink if you guys vote that way. It\u0027s honestly down to you patrons and what you tell me to write.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I write?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePorn. Next question?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeh, kidding. I write porn, mostly of the mind control, transformation, foot fetish, corruption, and master/slave variety. There\u0027s often other types of kinks in different chapters, but those are the ones that tend to pop up most often.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does that work? How do supporters get to be involved?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty simple, really. Provided that you\u0027re at a level where you can start voting for things (starting at $5/month), this is how it goes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-I post a poll about what series/anthology I want to do next. This poll remains open for one week, during which all patrons vote their preference.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-At the end of the week, I close the poll, announce the winner, and - for the higher level patrons - share a plot map of the story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-I stream one chapter every Tuesday until the story is completed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Cycle repeats.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you, as a supporter, get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your level of patronage, you get:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Early access to patreon stories.\u003cbr\u003e-PDF versions of all stream files.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Voting privileges on what\u0027s being written.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Character cameos (increasing by what tier you donate at)\u003cbr\u003e-Free stories"
