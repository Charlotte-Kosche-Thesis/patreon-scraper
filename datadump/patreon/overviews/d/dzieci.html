    "summary": "Founded in 1997, Dzieci (djyeh-chee) is an international experimental ensemble dedicated to a search for the \u201csacred\u201d through the medium of theatre. Integrating techniques garnered from such theatre masters as Jerzy Grotowski, Eugenio Barba, and Peter Brook, and ritual forms derived from Native American and Eastern spiritual disciplines, Dzieci aims to create a theatre that is as equally engaged with personal transformation as it is with public presentation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a critical time for the arts, and groups like Dzieci are struggling for survival. Dzieci\u0027s creations, bred over the course of years of ceaseless investigation and inquiry, are challenging enough without financial constraint. We rely solely on contributions from our audiences and workshop participants for sustenance, and have graciously been gifted rehearsal space at Ripley-Grier Studios and Second Presbyterian Church, but this barely meets our bottom line. Current means do not offer our company any compensation for the hours of rehearsal and performance, or to plan future productions, retreats, or tours.  Patreon provides a simple way for supporters of Dzieci to make a monthly donation to help us reach our future goals as a company, and continue bringing our unique, transformative practice to the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2018, Dzieci continues to celebrate its 20th Anniversary year with the upcoming spring production of \u003cem\u003eA Passion\u003c/em\u003e, the Biblical tale as set in the shadow of the Warsaw ghetto.  As our first Patreons, your contributions will directly impact our Spring Season.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike Kickstarter, in which you make a one-time donation to one project, Patreon is ongoing.
