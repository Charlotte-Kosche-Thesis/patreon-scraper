    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Eric, but most people online know me as \u003cstrong\u003edantarion\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past decade, I have been studying, reverse engineering, and modding commercial games, with a focus on competitive fighting games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a crucial member of the team that created Project M, organizing the collection of smash engine research into a wiki called OpenSA that contains information on how the internals of Smash games work, from the original N64 release, through the current WiiU version. Reverse engineering commercial games is an acquired taste, and I love being able to examine how these AAA-quality games were put together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond Smash, I have worked on creating web apps that provide internal data on how several more traditional fighting games work, with a goal of helping players improve their gameplay by learning a bit about how things work under the hood. This includes: Street Fighter 4, Street Fighter X Tekken, Street Fighter 5, Under Night in Birth, Blazblue, Persona, Guilty Gear Xrd, with other games like Nitroplus, Arcana Heart, Dengeki Fighting Climax in the queue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd now I have a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe one side effect of creating so many resources for so many games is that as games get older, and I lose interest in playing them, some of the resources become stale as new patches are released. Often, people find bugs or incorrect data years after I have moved on from a resource.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this Patreon, you not only help cover the server resources used to keep these resources up, you also help support the maintenance and upkeep, including adding new features and fixing bugs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatrons with get access to a special Patron-only discord and voting system where I will take feedback on what resources should be a priority, and what features should be implemented next, as well as questions about my previous work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0While what I work on will still be subject to my own interests and I will still take feedback from the public, when it comes to a lot of the older projects, Patrons will have a greater influence in deciding what gets done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What if no one supports this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEverything that is currently online will remain online! I don\u0027t want anyone to feel like I am holding my content for ransom\u003c/strong\u003e. Even if I don\u0027t get a single Patron, I am still going to keep creating things and publishing them. However, if you are waiting on the finishing of say, the Street Fighter X Tekken moveset editor project I started a long time ago, I most likely won\u0027t revisit projects like that without people showing interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can I bitch at you if you don\u0027t fulfill\u00a0your goals?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABSOLUTELY.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The last thing I want to do is end up in a situation where I am accepting money from someone that is unhappy with how I am progressing. If something changes and I find myself not being able to finish projects, whether that is making Youtube content, blog content, etc, \u003cstrong\u003eplease call me out on it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0If I fall behind, I will most likely completely cancel receiving payments until I can make good on my promises to the community."
