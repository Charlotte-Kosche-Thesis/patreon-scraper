I try to keep it light and fun. There\u0027s nothing quite as good as laughing at a bad film with friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to support me on YouTube, simply watching my videos is more than enough (And if you think I\u0027m extra special, you could even Like and Share the video too). I think it\u0027s great you find my creations entertaining and I greatly appreciate it. If, however, you wish to support me in a less sentimental way, feel free to throw some of that hard cash my way. Please note you in no way have to donate. Yes, my content is completely free for you to enjoy at your leisure! No, I don\u0027t run annoying ads throughout the videos! But there is no obligation for you to start throwing money at me. Nor is it expected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest and best reward of all is the satisfaction you get from supporting me. In a more specific, practical sense, there are no rewards. I want my content to be available to everyone and I don\u0027t think gating off a portion of that behind a pay wall is a good way to proceed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I have long term viewers who have kindly supported me through watching my videos I don\u0027t want to punish them by withholding material. They (or you) have helped to build up the channel. Suddenly saying they can no longer view some videos because they don\u0027t want to give me money isn\u0027t a fair way to reward their loyalty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eView your Patreon support as a friendly donation or tip. If you enjoy the content and would like to see me continue to make more of it in the future, that\u0027s great. Anything you choose to give is greatly appreciated and will go a long way to keeping the lights on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently there are no goals set and here is my reasoning for that decision. My plan is to always improve my videos, which is an ever changing process that can\u0027t really be pinned to a set monetary value. Sure, buying a new microphone can be given a price, but I\u0027m not going to pretend that a single microphone upgrade is going to take my videos to the next level. I see the process of improvement as many small steps rather than a couple of giant leaps. Simply getting more time to write, record and edit goes a long way. On top of that, being able to cover the costs of purchasing the dvds for my larger analysis videos would be great. I\u0027d also like to do more work with masks and props and things of that nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Plan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently the plan is to get a video out every week, or failing that, at least every two weeks. I would like to up the frequency of my larger, more in depth videos but as you can imagine that takes more work, which means more time. With your support this can become a possibility. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes my videos are very short and other times very long. If I chose to get paid per video, it would mean my shorter videos would hold the same monetary value as my larger ones, and as such it would create an incentive for me to produce lots of quick videos (which naturally require less effort) rather than make content with a length appropriate to the subject matter. I\u0027m not saying I would go down that road, but I imagine that could be a worry for anyone who choose to support the channel.\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I chose to set the payment method on a per monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you decide to do, thank you for stopping by and reading all the way to the end. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
