I\u0027m the mom of a couple of awesome kids...one who happens to be transgender. Because of my determination to advocate on her behalf, I\u0027ve become a nationally-known transgender rights advocate/activist, with a special focus on helping families with transgender and gender non-conforming children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run a website called Trans-Parenting.com as a resource for other families, It features a lot of great educational info and links, plus the Trans-Parenting podcast. And when I can talk myself into sitting in front of a camera, I make videos about current events in the trans community or tips for other parents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love being an advocate and resource for our community, but...it costs a lot of money. Having a toll-free number for parents to reach me, multiple domain registrations, and\u00a0website and podcast hosting fees all add up really fast. I\u0027ve been doing all of this work in my \"free time\" by digging up spare change and looking for dropped pennies on the ground for a couple of years now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m turning to you. With patronage, I can always produce the podcasts and videos and keep adding good content to the website, regardless of my personal income stream (or lack thereof!). With \u003cem\u003eenough\u00a0\u003c/em\u003epatronage, I can devote more time and resources to my work: increase the audio quality, create more content, update the website, book guests, run some contests... you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge of a monthly fee from $1 to $1000 (hey...I don\u0027t want you to feel limited!) will help support my efforts to support other trans families."
