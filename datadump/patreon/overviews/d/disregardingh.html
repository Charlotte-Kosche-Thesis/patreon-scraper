Since I was about fourteen years old, I\u0027ve spent most of my time watching and studying films, learning about directors, reading about the evolution of cinema, with the dream of someday becoming a director myself. Living in a small town in Oregon has made that dream rather difficult to achieve, so, in 2014, I started creating YouTube videos as an outlet for this obsession.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAt first, it wasn\u0027t much more than a platform for me to rant aimlessly about movies I\u0027d been watching recently (and it still is) but it\u0027s grown and evolved considerably since then. Today, on my channel, you can find several review series examining the full spectrum of art house, genre, and mainstream movies.\u003cbr\u003eMy most popular video series is called Unmade Masterpieces, where I look at famous movies that were\u00a0never made, or alternate versions of famous movies that were almost made.\u003cbr\u003eSince I started this Patreon page, I\u0027ve also begun live streaming every week. Video Drone, a weekly Q\u0026amp;A show that I started doing a while ago, which used to be prerecorded, is now a chance for me to interact directly with my audience of fellow film fans, talk about good movies I\u0027ve seen recently, and answer any questions you all might have for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWHY GIVE ME MONEY?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027ve still got a long list of future videos I want to produce but it\u0027s getting more difficult to do it. At the time I started the YouTube channel, I was living at home with my parents and unemployed, so, as a result, I had a lot of free time to devote to research, writing, voice over, and editing. Today, I\u0027m working at a grocery store, paying rent and bills, and saving up to move to Portland to pursue the filmmaking career. In other words, I have to support myself, and that means the channel can only be a hobby I maintain on the side. \u003cbr\u003eIf I were earning a livable income off the videos, I would be able to focus on it full time, but unfortunately it turns out that earning a living off YouTube is not so easy. I don\u0027t monetize most of my videos, in order to avoid dealing with legal issues from film companies, and because they are so time consuming to produce, I can\u0027t make very many in any given month, even if I was focusing on it full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon could be extremely helpful. If the channel continues to grow, and more people decide to contribute to this page, I could request fewer hours at my job to spend more time working on videos.\u003cbr\u003eLong term, I hope to be able to purchase better equipment (bigger hard drives, a faster computer, a better camera, lights), more research material (books, DVDs/Blu-rays), and maybe, somewhere down the line, even hire another editor to help me produce even more videos. I\u0027m not expecting luxuries like this any time soon however!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eIN CONCLUSION\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI would be deeply grateful for your support and I will try to keep delivering content that attempts to enhance people\u0027s understanding of and appreciation for the art of film. Any contribution you decide to make will help me achieve that goal. Either way, thanks for your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my channel, if you haven\u0027t already:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhXFfYk5zaq0gd6LCVoOhw\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhXFfYk5zaq0gd6L...\u003c/a\u003e"
