    "summary": "DosAguilas, two eagles, came about from the national birds of my two countries, Mexico and the United States, and being both Mexican and American. My writing reflects this duality and seeks to occupy a space somewhere between Sandra Cisneros and Raymond Carver; or maybe between Neil Gaiman and Dagoberto Gilb. I embrace my identity as a Latino, as a Mexican, as an American, as a Texan, as a Chicano and as a transplant of the Rio Grande Valley.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a lot of other things but the one that stands out is my passion for writing. When I introduce myself to people, I hardly ever tell them what I do for a living and instead I tell them I am a writer. I didn\u0027t become a writer when I graduated with my MFA in Creative Writing. I became a writer when I was a young kid and all I could think about was being a storyteller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is my profession, that is what I do, that is what I want to do, and this is what I\u0027m going to keep on doing. I\u0027m currently working on my debut novel, which will be published in February 2018 through La Casita Grande Editores but I\u0027m finding myself with a little bit of free time that I could use to help others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY YOU SHOULD DONATE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s a tough market and everyone wants to make a buck. I\u0027m not the exception. I don\u0027t believe that writers, or really, any sort of artists, should starve themselves in order to create good art. I think that\u0027s an interesting idea, but it\u0027s not for me and I refuse to romanticize it. I\u0027m on #TeamDontWorkForFree and #TeamExposureDoesntPayTheBills. If that makes me selfish, that\u0027s fine, but what I\u0027m advertising here is not just in my writing, but also helping \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0with yours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee, your Tip Jar money will go to the upkeep of my site:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://DosAguilas\"\u003ewww.dosaguilas.org\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I will blog weekly on a particular writing or writing-related subjects.

I also have plans for eventually expanding the site to include guest blogs, more interactivity, maybe even a forum.

     "about": "DosAguilas was born and raised in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico and spent the latter part of his childhood in Brownsville, Texas. He considers himself a son of Mexico and the Rio Grande Valley. He resides in Houston with his girlfriend and two neurotic furchildren and has spent the last two years working as an interpreter for a contact center. Before that, he was a bit of a jack of all trades: working as a freelance journalist; preparing high school students for college admissions; poring over spreadsheets as an analyst in the energy industry; and even a brief stint in law school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe received his MFA in Creative Writing from the University of Texas at El Paso and holds bachelor\u0027s of arts degrees in Communication and History through the University of Texas at Brownsville (now the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn his free time, he enjoys reading and writing short stories, poetry, and speculative fiction. He also enjoys playing videogames, relieving stress through kickboxing, as well as watching and playing soccer and basketball. He is a sports fan de hueso colorado, supporting the national soccer teams of both Mexico and the US; las Aguilas del America; the Dallas Cowboys; the UTRGV Vaqueros and the UTEP Miners; the Houston Dynamo; and the Team of Destiny: the San Antonio Spurs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT DOSAGUILAS\u0027 WORK\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cWith idea, sound, gesture, the duende delights in\nstruggling freely with the creator on the edge of the pit. Angel and Muse flee,\nwith violin and compasses, and the duende wounds, and in trying to heal that\nwound that never heals, lies the strangeness, the inventiveness of a man\u2019s\nwork\u201d --Federico Garcia Lorca, \"Theory and Play of the Duende\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLorca\u0027s\nduende is what Edward Hirsch describes as something with visible anguish,\nirrational desire, and demonic enthusiasm. This is also what Benjamin\nAlire Saenz describes as chasing the dragon, and what DosAguilas uses to fuel his work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe duende\nis present in the South Texas borderlands, where he draws the bulk of\nhis inspiration from. Poetry, music, sports, duality, everything seeps\ninto his work. From the corridos his grandfather composed, to the metal\nmusic that provided the soundtrack for his high school career. From long lines\ncrossing the bridge to the idea of a promised land just a few dozen miles\nnorthbound on U.S. 77/83, DosAguilas tackles fiction and poetry with the eye of\na journalist and the flair of the dramatic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDosAguilas started writing fiction in 1999 by means of fanfiction, which served as a\ngateway drug to every other type of writing. He heavily focused on genre\nfiction at first before the influence of the MFA program at UTEP and his\ngirlfriend (an English major with a strong background in the classics) helped\nsteer him towards discovering other literary interests that led him to now\npredominantly write short stories and poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHe holds a\nnumber of authors, lyricists, and poets as influences as well. A redacted list\nwould include: (in poetry) Mario Benedetti, Jaime Sabines, Mark Strand, Joaquin\nSabina, Immortal Technique, Jose Alfredo Jimenez, Fher Olvera, Federico Garcia\nLorca, Gustavo Adolfo Becquer; Residente, Ruben Blades, Conor Oberst, Tony\nKakko, and Jesse Lacey (in fiction) Sandra Cisneros, Benjamin Alire Saenz,\nOscar Casares, Dagoberto Gilb, Dan Abnett, Harry Turtledove; Bernard Cornwell;\nNaomi Novik; Jim Butcher, and JK Rowling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt UTEP,\nDosAguilas learned under the wing of poets, authors, and playwrights like Sasha\nPimentel, Tim Z. Hernandez, Daniel Chacon, Jeff Sirkin, Lex Williford, Jose de\nPierola and Dennis Bush.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
