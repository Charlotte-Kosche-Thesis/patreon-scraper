I\u0027ll try to make it as uniquely my own as possible while keeping it funny and cool. I already have most of the characters designed and a huge sections of the story written out along with more ideas that keep popping in my head.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also like to post some animated projects on here, but in order to do that I\u0027ll need to reach my higher goal of $1,200 to $2,400 so I can afford the programs needed to help me make high-quality products and spend more time making them. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eImportant Note for my $10 to $100 tier patrons\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e: to avoid backlog, please let me know what your idea is as soon as your pledge goes through. I will allow only two months of backlogged art. After the third month, no further art will be worked on past that point, even after the pledge has gone through. \u00a0For example, if you pledge in September, October and November, and it\u0027s now December, I will only work on art for October and November. Until then, I will make every attempt to get a hold of you before those first two months are up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s a sample page from my comic:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mistythemouse.com/comics/20130619.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
