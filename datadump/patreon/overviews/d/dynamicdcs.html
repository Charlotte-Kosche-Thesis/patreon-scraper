    "summary": "My name is Andrew Finegan and I am a software developer by trade. Every day since I purchase my first DCS module, A-10C, I have been hooked playing and developing for DCS. Overtime, I eventually bought every module, this game is REALLY fun!!, \u00a0I started making a full featured Dynamic Caucasus map for a better persistent place to play with my friends. The more I worked on it, the better it became. Many of my squadmates tell me I have the best A2G game of all the multiplayer servers due to the dynamic nature of them, you cant tell where and what enemies exist at the next base. Then, about 2 months ago, I got this crazy idea of building an external engine to run the map to overcome DCS\u0027s limitations. I bought the domain name \u0027dynamicdcs.com\u0027 and built a powerful server to host it, while also acquiring gigabit fiber internet and the rest is history. DynamicDCS.com was born.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, I have built the backend engine, units now show up on the map software, and I just finished the storage engine for the stat system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI gladly take any suggestions from anyone because I want to make the best, most fun group of DCS maps ever made. I also have a 2.1 Nevada map that will soon get the same treatment and run on the DynamicDCS engine. There is also talk in the future about a true conventional war map (vietnam era warfare, less computers, more rockets, bombs, etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patreon donations will be put toward equipment and purchasing new maps to host with (servers need their own copies of each map), On my newly built server, even with 32 gigs of ram can only safely host 2 maps on it at the same time, so if I want to expand this, extra funding will help. These servers are always on and up 24/7\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me on my Discord channel by joining through this invite link: voice.dynamicdcs.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make this patreon the most transparent as possible, show EXACTLY where the money is going and how its going to benefit you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for you input and support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndrew Finegan\u003cbr\u003eCallsign: Drex\u003cbr\u003e"
