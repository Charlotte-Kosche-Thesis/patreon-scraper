Vanguard! Rather than a scientific breakdown of the meta game and sick competitive strats, we just have fun talking about the cards and what we think about them. \u00a0We don\u0027t take ourselves too seriously! \u00a0Hopefully you have fun and a lot of laughs as we follow down the paths that Bushiroad is leading us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContributing to our Patreon will help defray some of the costs of creating the podcast - SoundCloud subscription, Squarespace web hosting, Google domain registration, etc. \u00a0If we exceed our baseline goals we\u0027ll be able to invest in improved recording equipment and potentially video equipment for streaming matches or having an occasional Twitch stream. \u00a0If we\u0027re funded beyond our wildest dreams we\u0027ll be able to put that towards traveling to events where we can meet with you - our listeners!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again - any contribution helps us continue making content for you to enjoy."
