I believe you could create the next great tabletop game and I\u0027m going to help you!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m creating articles about game design from all angles. It\u0027s not a set of steps, a plan, or a process, but rather advice to keep in mind as you set off on your game design journey. Learn from not only my experience but from designers and publishers who will periodically be interviewed for the site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I will be putting out biweekly design podcasts with my co-host Nate Murray from IDW Games. Together we\u0027ll cover topics from prototyping to publishing with our own personal spin and insight. We\u0027ll also be competing in design games and featuring special guests from the board game industry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing to my project you will ensure I have the means to keep creating quality content. I\u0027ll be able to spend more time researching game design, track down people to interview, and, of course, create the content. The blog and podcast will always be completely free but, if you like what we\u0027re doing, set up a pledge here to keep us in business.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current schedule is a weekly article on Tuesday with extra articles coming out as necessary. Podcasts will be biweekly\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
