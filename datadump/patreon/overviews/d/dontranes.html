My eagerness to keep the ball rolling and become better artist lead me to asking you for a small support.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou see, I\u0027m currently going through rough times in my life, and i kinda got to this stereotypical kind of starving artist. All of the money that i will get here will go towards me leaving the place i currently live in.\u003cbr\u003e\nTo give you a clearer perspective on this place, here\u0027s some photos of it\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://puu.sh/l1gGM.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 591px;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tYou know, we artists are kind people with simple needs, being able to communicate with cool people, being able to sustain ourselves and not be afraid of getting fired. We looove, to share our thoughts with more advanced artists, be in somekind of natural symbiosis with our communities. It\u0027s just makes us alive. Even simple 5 minute walk can spark some cool ideas in our heads. And the way we present our thoughts, in form of our artwork is what we are.\u003cbr\u003eMy current place has awesome nature, that you can paint for days.\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, i want\u00a0to move on with my life, towards my dreams, towards something greater.\u003cbr\u003eBut,\u00a0unfortunately this place doesn\u0027t have any sort of art communities to recieve live critiques, not that many tech-stuff going on, lack of communication in overall, also it\u0027s hard to find a job here even as an traditional artist, due to lack in IT/Design agencies here, or at least advertisment companies. All it offers is farming experience. #goatsimulatorreference\u003cbr\u003eNot the best place for the CG-Artist? Heh :D\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u0027t matter how much i love this city (i find word \"village\" more appropriate tough) -\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd here\u0027s the place where i want to end up in, it\u0027s my hometown, with work opportunities, overally better quality of life, a lot of local art communities that will help me grow as a professional (also best internet i\u0027ve seen so far in Russia)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://puu.sh/l1iI2.jpg\" style=\"width: 598px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCity that goes by the name of Kemerovo.\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s a lot to see and a lot of opportunities for me to make my dreams come true.\u003cbr\u003e\n(Not to mention ability to provide you with all of the tasty sweet things i can offer :3)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
