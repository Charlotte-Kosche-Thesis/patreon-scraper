Which makes sense, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a recent college graduate who dabbles in a lot of things, one of which is artwork. So here\u0027s the deal. If you can support my painting and drawing, then I will devote more time toward it. Simple! I love creating beautiful things, and you don\u0027t dislike looking at them, right? It\u0027s a good common ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs one of (what sometimes seems) (but is fortunately not true) the few people in the world who genuinely loves watercolor, I want to improve. I want to create photo-realistic art that goes above and beyond the average assumption for watercolor. I want to be perfect! Ha. No, I just want to paint more realistically. But I also want to have fun, and I want to stay inspired.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by, and thank you for reading. I hope I\u0027ll see you around!\u003cbr\u003e"
