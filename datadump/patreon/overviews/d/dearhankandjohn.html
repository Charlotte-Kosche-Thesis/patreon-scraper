    "summary": "Dear Hank and John is a comedy podcast about death in which questions are answered, dubious advice is dispensed, and listeners are subjected to the news from Mars and AFC Wimbledon. Through this Patreon, you can show us via your monthly dollar whether you prefer Mars, AFC Wimbledon, or neither. And if you choose to support us at $5 a month, you\u0027ll get access to our new short, Patreon-only podcast This Week in Ryans, or possibly The Weekly Ryan. We haven\u0027t totally settled on a name yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/N4g73xs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA portion of the money raised goes to support the pod, but given that it isn\u0027t very resource-intensive and we\u0027ve got tons of sponsorship money rolling in from our fake sponsors, most of your Patreon support goes to help fund our educational productions at SciShow, Crash Course, and elsewhere. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe basic question is: If we made you, would you pay for Dear Hank and John? If so, just give us a percentage of whatever you want to pay as a way of thanking us for \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e making you pay. Or not... That is also cool. We understand that not everybody has money to spend, and we would much rather you make sound financial decisions than support our podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, and DFTBA!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/a0a21f1bf1cedac803045afc5e554bff/tumblr_nufucytJY51rnkff7o1_500.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
