I love stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the stories that make you feel, ya\u0027 know? The stories that... really stick with you. Long after you\u0027ve left the theater. Or put the book down. Turn off the game. Exit out the window. Wake up. Stories that change you. You see the world around you a little different once the tale comes to a close. Maybe it\u0027s a littler brighter. Perhaps a bit darker. But it\u0027s not the same. You aren\u0027t the same. But that\u0027s a good thing. You\u0027ve learned something new and can\u0027t be expected to be the same. You\u0027ve grown. And you want the world to grow with you. And to think. It\u0027s all because of that one. Good. Story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s me in a nutshell. And that\u0027s why I write. Just wanna make one or two or seven of those good stories for ya\u0027. And I\u0027d really appreciate it if you were to give that chance. Even if you don\u0027t donate your hard earned bills, I only ask you donate your valuable time. Just a little. That\u0027s all I\u0027m gonna need. Watch me use it to blow your mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright. Now that we got that outta the way.

And, basically, what that entails is things like exclusive art you\u2019ll only find here, early access to art that will be released public later down the line and some exclusive looks at things I\u2019m working on. Plus, if you like what I do and would like to see more from me, supporting me will help me create more art and MANY more stories. While it only takes one dollar to get all of my content, anymore than that will be GREATLY appreciated! Every little cent counts so please consider helping a brotha out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022 Is Donating Permanent? \u2022\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot at all. You can cancel anytime you please. You don\u2019t even have to set up regular donations, you can simply do it one time and be done forever if you really wanna. So don\u2019t feel pressured or daunted by the process, I promise, as someone who supports artists on here, it is really easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
