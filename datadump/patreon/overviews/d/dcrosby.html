Like when you go downtown and see a guy playing sax on the corner. You like the music, you listen for while, and you pitch what you can afford into his hat.  Now imagine you make a promise to throw X amount of dollars into the hat every time you see him playing. It\u0027s an incentive for the musician to show up with his sax regularly and you get to enjoy the music as well as supporting a deserving sax man. If enough people make the same promise the sax man will show up every day, hone his skills and add something beautiful to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u0027s the idea behind Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://createdbycrosby.com/wp-content/uploads/Patreon/AishaBanner.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m Doing\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019ve been working on a series of images and short stories depicting folklore, and legendary figures from African American culture.
