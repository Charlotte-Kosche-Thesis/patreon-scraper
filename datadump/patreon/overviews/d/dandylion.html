    "summary": "Hello, and thank you for visiting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent years thinking about RPG design and playing with using RPG systems in interactive fiction, but it wasn\u0027t until 2016 that I finally worked up the courage to post a demo publicly online. That demo is called\u00a0\u003cem\u003eGirlfriend, \u003c/em\u003eand you can see it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tfgamessite.com/index.php?module=viewgame\u0026amp;id=1070\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. The community\u0027s response was very enthusiastic, and I was really pleased and touched by how much people seem to like my writing and the game system I designed. My next step is to see if I can actually finish a game. I\u0027ve been disappointed many times by fantastic, well-conceived games being abandoned half-finished, so I\u0027ve set up this page to keep myself accountable for working on the game and give me some motivation to work on it in addition to all the other things I have going on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is how I\u0027m setting this up: I\u0027ve plotted out the story somewhat in advance, and divided it up into chunks of roughly equal size, and I hope I can complete one of these chunks each month. I\u0027ll only charge you when I successfully finish and release one. Unless I\u0027m dramatically wrong about how much I can do in a month, I expect the whole game to take me somewhere between 8 and 15 of these releases. After that, well, we\u0027ll see how it goes. I have some more potential games in mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering supporting me! I hope you enjoy playing."
