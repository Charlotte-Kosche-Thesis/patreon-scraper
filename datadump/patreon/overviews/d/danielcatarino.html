     "about": "Hi! My name is Daniel Catarino, and I\u0027m a songwriter from Portugal. I play in a lot of different projects and bands, and I write music and lyrics all the time.\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in a small town in Alentejo, a very arid region in the south of Portugal, and I started playing guitar in 1994, when I was 11 years old. Honestly, I wanted to be a writer and I became a musician by accident, but soon I realized I could do something really amazing - write and make my writing go along with music!\u003cbr\u003eI released my first album for free back in 2006, and since then I have released over 20 records (EP\u0027s, LP\u0027s, as a member of bands, etc.).\u003cbr\u003eI really am a compulsive songwriter. If something good happens to me, I\u0027ll write a song about it. If something bad happens to me, I\u0027ll write a song about it. If nothing happens to me, I\u0027ll still write a song about it. Music is my life, I threw away a steady life and a good job because of it, and I never regretted it, even when occasionally I get really poor and have to crash in a friend\u0027s couch.\u003cbr\u003eHere is a list of my current projects: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/catarinodaniel\"\u003eDaniel Catarino\u003c/a\u003e (my singer-songwriter material in Portuguese and English), \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/longdesertcowboy\"\u003eLong Desert Cowboy\u003c/a\u003e (instrumental), \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/uaninauei\"\u003eUaninauei\u003c/a\u003e (hard rock band), \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/bichomato\"\u003eBicho do Mato\u003c/a\u003e (folk rock band), \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ocajado\"\u003eCajado\u003c/a\u003e (experimental band), \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/alentexas\"\u003eAlentexas\u003c/a\u003e (jam band).\u003cbr\u003eHope you like my music, and if you can afford it, please support my music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eYour new friend\u003cbr\u003eDaniel\u003cbr\u003e",

One of my songs, \"Poetry For The Moon\", is a number 1 there in some independent radios, and I decided it was time to pack my case and take the long road! Unfortunately, since I do booking myself with help from friends, I need money upfront in order to pay for the trips and the food (I can always crash on someone\u0027s couch). I would love to take my music to other countries, starting with Europe: Portugal - Spain - France - Italy - Germany - Poland - Czech Republic - UK - Ireland is something I have planned for a long time but cannot afford yet.
