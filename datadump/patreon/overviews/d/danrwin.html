    "summary": "I love creating art. I\u0027ve spent a good portion of my life trying to figure out how to create as much of it as I can. My two preferred platforms for creation are as a photographer and a theatre artist. Although I love creating work, I also realize I don\u0027t always create art that is for everyone, and framed art and metal prints are expensive, not everyone can afford them, but as a fine art photographer prints are the primary source of income. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support of my work will allow me to keep creating the kind of art that excites me, lower the cost of my prints to customers, and make fine art about the people in the city that I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt shouldn\u0027t be a status symbol, it should be a unique reflection of recognizable life. A comment on injustice, a tool for exploring large or difficult ideas and a catalyst for change. This is the kind of work that excites me to see and excites me to make. Abstractions of nature and city\u0027s, explorations of people\u0027s struggles and journey\u0027s to self acceptance, close ups and studies of un-retouched bodies, challenges of gender and social acceptance. Everyday life re-examined. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough this kind of work excites many people, it rarely sells very well. So, I\u0027m asking for you to believe in my work enough to give me what amounts to less than a cup of coffee a month so I can keep creating and growing as an artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll get access to a steady stream of work that appears nowhere but this website. Plus you\u0027ll updates on new projects, process shots, before and after comparisons and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see more of my work and get print prices check out my website, www.danrwin.com. You can also take a look at my flickr stream,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/danrw/.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.flickr.com/photos/danrw/.\u003c/a\u003e My 500px stream,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://500px.com/danielwinters.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://500px.com/danielwinters.\u003c/a\u003e And my Instagram handles, danrwin and danrwintersphotography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support."
