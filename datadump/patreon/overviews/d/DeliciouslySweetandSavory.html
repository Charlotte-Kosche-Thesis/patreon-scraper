    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome, Everyone! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m\nMargaret Sabia, the creator, and host of the Dailymotion Channel Deliciously Sweet\nand Savory (http://www.dailymotion.com/deliciouslysweetandsavory)! My channel provides recipes and cooking demonstrations for culinary\ndelights from a cultural and personal perspective. The recipes of my channel\ninclude cooking and baking ideas spanning from breakfast to dinner as well as\nside dishes, snacks, special occasions, and healthier options.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nI created Deliciously Sweet and Savory and what the channel is about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a self-taught baker and cook who loves how\ndiverse food is around the world. As someone who earned many degrees that\nfocused on people and culture, I love the anthropological component of food. In\nother words, I enjoy the cultural component of food. It isn\u2019t just about\nconsumption or nutritional value. Food provides enjoyment and comfort. It\nconnects people together not just family and friends but also people of\ndifferent cultures, as well as viewers and potential patrons like you! Food\nprovides an opportunity to learn about other cultures and it brings us all a\nlittle closer together through increased understanding. For me, cooking and\nbaking have served as an outlet to break-up the stress in my life. It also\nallowed me to explore the wonderful food other cultures have to offer and bring\nthat experience to my family whom due to financial hardship and ongoing health\nissues are unable to go out to restaurants or travel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI started Deliciously Sweet and Savory to share my\nlove of food and recipes with others and potential patrons because food is best\nenjoyed in the company of others! The goal of my channel is to take my viewers\n(or what I like to call my extended family) on a culinary journey together\nacross food from various cultures with the first recipe series being dedicated\nto Cuban Food. As the daughter of a Cuban immigrant, I want to highlight some\namazing recipes I\u2019ve learned over the years from my mother and Abuela as well\nas baking recipes I\u2019ve recreated based on food memories from my childhood. From\nthere I will be branching out and creating more video series for other types of\ncuisine (e.g., Italian, American, Chinese, Japanese, etc.). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nI created a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI created this Patreon page to help me expand my\ncontent, which would allow me to share more recipes and cooking demonstrations\nwith you! In addition, purchasing ingredients, as well as maintenance and\nreplacement of technology and cookware is costly. By becoming a patron, you\nwould be helping me with the costs associated with creating, improving, and\nexpanding my content. It also means we get to have even more fun cooking and\ndiscussing food, as I would be able to increase the amount of content I release\nevery week! As a bonus, becoming a Patron by pledging from $1 and up per month\nwill get you access to exclusive comments and content that non-patrons will not\nbe able to access. The pledge amount can be canceled or adjusted at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am grateful to anyone willing to contribute funds by\nbecoming a patron. I also appreciate all of you viewers and those who took the\ntime to visit this page. Thank you all for your time and support!"
