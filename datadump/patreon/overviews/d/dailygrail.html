    "summary": "Hello fellow weirdling, and welcome to the Patreon page for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dailygrail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Daily Grail\u003c/a\u003e. Here\u0027s the quick and easy low-down on who we are, and why we\u0027re asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.dailygrail.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Daily Grail\u003c/a\u003e is a website that began way back in 1998, which is devoted to intelligent discussion of topics at \u0027the edges\u0027 of science and history. From new technology, discoveries and ideas, to all that weirder stuff that responsible, rational people are too scared to talk about, lest they be branded a \u0027woo-woo\u0027 (parapsychology, UFOs, etc.). We advocate exploration of these fascinating topics with an open, but critical mind, and checking your beliefs and ego at the door.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Your Help\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGetting up every morning and struggling to find the time and money to justify keeping a website running for 18 years may be a hell of a way to prove your integrity, but it\u0027s not always a barrel of fun. Collecting all the links we post in our daily news, and writing articles on fascinating topics, takes some serious hours (not even counting the behind the scenes work on website administration).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, there\u0027s plenty of ways to earn some money. Other websites sell their members email addresses, hide commercial links in \u0027sponsored posts\u0027, and find other ways. We won\u0027t do that, because...well, because we\u0027re not a-holes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we got to thinking. We have almost 10,000 daily readers. Maybe people appreciate what we do enough to drop just $1 a month on us (or a little more, if they feel it\u0027s justified), to not only help keep the site running, but allow it to improve! A new, mobile device-friendly design. A newsletter curating the best links of the week. More fascinating articles from great writers. Perhaps even a podcast if there\u0027s enough support out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd maybe, we could even bring further rewards (than just the website being awesome) for those that back us. For just $12 a year - surely that would sound like a good deal? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think so, and hope you\u0027ll take the time to back us. Because everybody wins from this deal!"
