I created the comic series\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://davidandbe.deviantart.com/gallery/49051323/Devious-David-Comics\"\u003eDevious David\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://davidandbe.deviantart.com/gallery/51063775/Darling-David\"\u003eDarling David\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://davidandbe.deviantart.com/gallery/49051349/Adventure-Sisters-Comics\"\u003eThe Adventure Sisters\u003c/a\u003e, along with other extra comics here and there. I specialize in traditional art but I am currently trying out Clip Studio Paint for digital stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not gonna lie to you guys. I am a budding artist. I am not as good as other artists out there but I have confidence that I will become as good as them. I promise you that. Which is also why I wanna try out Patreon. Not only do I get to create art for you guys but I also get paid for it :D\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow i\u00a0 am not expecting to earn like 1000$ a month or stuff like that. I would just be happy with enough support to buy a soda every week. I will also update my rewards and Goals the more I grow as an artist and the more I get paid, so don\u0027t worry if I somehow end up earning more than expected.\u00a0 \u00a0ALSO I am Paid Per Creation BUT I won\u0027t be that guy and spam lazy artwork to earn more $. I will AT MOST upload paid artwork maybe 3-5 times a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eANYWAYS! Thanks for reading and I hope you\u0027ll support me but if you don\u0027t have any dough, well don\u0027t worry. Most of my stuff is free...most :P\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to see some art I don\u0027t often post on my deviantart, friend me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001991756804\"\u003eFACEBOOK\u003c/a\u003e"
