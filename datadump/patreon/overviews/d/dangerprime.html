Cyanotype is a process developed in 1842 by John Herschel and used for decades thereafter.  In fact, blueprints are blue because they were originally done as cyanotype prints! The chemicals involved are much safer and require less special handling than other printmaking techniques, so this is a perfect process to do while I\u0027m working from home.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0  The process creates a beautiful, stunning Prussian blue, but can also be toned in a variety of techniques to create luscious browns, purples, and blacks. My favorite thing to do is make prints of pressed flowers, but I\u0027ve also accumulated a collection of objects with gorgeous silhouettes, and I have the ability to print photographs as negatives and make photographic reproductions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 There is no limit to the creativity of cyanotype!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://dangerpri.me/january.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dangerpri.me/patreon/postcardsample.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAn example from January\u0027s post cards ($5 a month pledge level)\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your pledge gets you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0  \n\u003cem\u003eYour monthly pledge will get you 1 brand-new original print per month.\u003c/em\u003e  Think of them like little treats you will receive every month as a thank you for your interest in my work.  \u003cdel\u003eHow much you pledge determines the size of print you will receive.
