    "summary": "I painted shoes a few years ago as a small hobby, and started making baby and puppy clothes as well as custom band and music-related art again last year. I sold everything I made very quickly, so I created a Patreon to give myself some time off of work at my 9-to-5. I want to spend a couple days a week creating new stock and orders, as well as start an Etsy page or website.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re looking for adorable (and rad) hand-painted kid\u0027s clothes, pet clothes, shoes, patches or jackets with featuring your favorite pop culture icons/artists, let me know what your specifications are and I can custom make you something unique and awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write scripts and am using this and my Etsy platform (soon) to acquire funding for two low-budget films (all of my sales go toward my movies). My ideal life would involve producing and selling enough art to self-fund a few film projects, and have the capital up front to start creating these films as quickly as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take some time to thank my first patrons as well, the first few steps are always the most important to moving onto bigger things. So even if it\u0027s just a dollar, it makes a world of difference and I appreciate it so much!\u003cbr\u003e"
