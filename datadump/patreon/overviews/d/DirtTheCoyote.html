    "summary": "Hey Everyone! Welcome to My Patreon. For those of you who do not know me, I am Dirt the Coyote. I make a variety of Adult Fursuit Entertainment. When I say adult, I do mean X-rated material for a portion of my content, but I also make silly fursuit gifs and pictures. I produce material all week long, but my biggest days are on Tuesday nights and sometimes Saturdays. This Patreon is set for payment per session, but I will only upload content once per week so I\u0027m not bleeding everyone dry making one or two gifs a night. Despite all of my weird \u0027rewards\u0027, any amount helps a lot. Everything I do right now is for free, but I need a little support from my fan base. I want to expand some of my stuff, but I do not have the funds to really push it in the direction that I want to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Makes Dirt Unique?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"390\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/0HKspQL5-nQ\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDirt is one of the few fursuiters that have adjustable parts on the head, that gives him a variety of expressions that surpass a lot of the static expressions on other fursuits. As well, Dirt has a strong personality that does not deviate when interacting with his followers. Dirt has a personality of his own, giving him consistent responses to the asks he receives. Dirt makes both clean and adult content, and that\u0027s part of his personality. He has his own choices and is not made to fit other people\u0027s interpretation of anthropomorphic animals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of the material is either made with my Logitech webcam or my Galaxy S4 camera. I edit everything using a website and Windows Movie Maker. My lighting is literally just a floor lamp with the top removed. Right now, the vast majority of my stuff is GIF files because I don\u0027t think I have the quality to produce video. It\u0027s about time to step this up again.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not just equipment that I\u0027m suffering on either. Truthfully, I would really like to be able to travel a bit more on my time and do things with other suiters or maybe take some videos at events. It\u0027s kind of hard for me to do that because I do not really have the money to go to all the events I want to go to since i live quite a distance away from most places. My goal is to be able to sustain adding trips and doing more outdoorsy shots at furry events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, now that I\u0027m done spouting my crap, please, sign up for my Patreon and help me reach some of my goals. It would be really nice to have continued support for my work. Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this."
