Then take it on tour! Every night will be completely different. Every night will be in front of a live theatre audience. Anything could [and probably will] happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, we know it\u0027s a HUGE undertaking. However, we need to show that things like this CAN be done - just other shows / networks are too lazy, boring or\u00a0scared to do it!\u003cbr\u003e",
