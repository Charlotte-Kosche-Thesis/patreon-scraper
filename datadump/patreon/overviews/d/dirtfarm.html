The newspaper industry has been in rapid decline over the last decade, so I\u0027ve recently decided to try to find a new home for it here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking this out and reading this!\u00a0I hope I can make this page worthwhile of your subscription. Please get in touch with any requests. I\u0027m up for anything... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHISTORY:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDIRTFARM got its start when a cartoonist named P.J. O\u0027Ross handed down a space in the Washington City Paper where his comic STINKFISH had run for 5 years previously. STINKFISH (previously titled DIRT WOLF), was originally placed in the paper as a paid advertisement. It ran for three months at $300 a week before the editors of the City Paper ultimately decided to just give O\u0027Ross the space. DIRTFARM retains the same size \u0026amp; shape of a STINKFISH comic \u0026amp; has also preserved several other design elements. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDIRTFARM has a few recurring characters, but it doesn\u0027t rely on them heavily from week to week. Each comic is written more like an illustrated standup comedy bit. Individual comics depict a wide range of themes including social critique, comics about relationships, work stresses, riffs on holidays, personal stories, the mocking of trends \u0026amp; current events, and every now and then has gotten political (but rarely). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic has a unique format which allows it to be split into a variety of panel configurations (unlike most other syndicated print comics). Individual comics are more often than not split into 4, 6, or 9 panels depending on how much space a theme demands. Over the years it has run with as few as 1-3 panels and as many as 20-30 tiny panels. Each comic contains a header, a main body, and a footer which all float on top of scraps of ripped paper on top of a black background. The header usually contains a title (which outlines the main theme), some type of logo (usually introducing a main character), and some type of meta joke inside of a \"Fold this\" bubble in the top right hand side. The body contains the main comic which sometimes contains a serialized story and sometimes is just a series of non sequitur vignettes riffing on the main theme. The footer contains a bottom comic which works as an afterthought or extended punchline to the main comic, or sometimes stands alone and is unrelated to the main comic. This format is very flexible, and in the past has included things like internet contests, clip \u0026amp; save coupons, challenges and games, and once even an illustrated response letter to a prison inmate who wrote in asking for love advice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDIRTFARM is drawn by hand using a brush and a variety of pens, and is then scanned and formatted with Adobe InDesign. Text is sometimes hand drawn, and other times is set with a typeface (depending on time constraints). Most of the comics run in black \u0026amp; white, but a few have been in color. The drawing style is very simple with most characters displaying a lot of extreme facial expressions and gestures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDIRTFARM currently runs in the following papers:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Baltimore CityPaper\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Antigravity Magazine\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026amp; has previously run in:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Washington CityPaper\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Chicago Reader\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Chattanooga Pulse\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Knoxville\u0027s Metro Pulse\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 St. Johns Sun Times (Virgin Islands)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Baltimore Magazine\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Hum Magazine\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Dagens Nyheter (Sweden)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Magic Bullet (comic newspaper)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026amp; on the websites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 killoggs.com\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 bendependent.com\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Mutant Funnies (Atomic Books)\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAWARDS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 2007 - Alternative Association of Newsweeklies Award (3rd place)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 2006 - Bmore CityPaper Comic Contest (1st Place)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 2005 - Bmore CityPaper Comic Contest (2nd Place)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLaunched in October of 2004. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdates every week!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
