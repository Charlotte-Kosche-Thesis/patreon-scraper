    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eHello to my lovely Readers (and the ghosts reading this over their shoulders)!\u003c/h3\u003eAs most of you reading this are aware, I\u0027m a writer- or at the very least I try to be. I write short stories, prose and articles about monsters, lady issues and tacos. Writing is a wonderful thing to me and to be able to create things that have reached so many people, touched them or made them laugh is true joy I don\u0027t take for granted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do it more. Do it bigger. Do it all the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to write more stories, make more zines, publish more books. I want to find new ways to interact with you guys and make things that make you giggle-snort at work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u0027s the thing- I need your help to do this. We don\u0027t have to get crazy here and I know it\u0027s a dumb cliche line, but honestly, \u003cem\u003eevery little bit helps\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0Every dollar you pledge is less time I have to spend on non-creative work (ex: Kicking wifi moochers out of cafes) and more time writing or collaging or making you a friendship bracelet. Honestly, if Patreon would let people pledge smothered burritos I would 500% accept that too. They don\u0027t, but can you imagine if they did? I want to live in that world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo what does my pledge do? Where does my money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWriting is a job- like driving a school bus or putting dead spiders in glass to sell at Swap Meets. Just like any other job, the money from that goes to \"keeping me alive\" and \"things I need to stay living\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Gas\u003cbr\u003eI live in LA. Gas is like oxygen if oxygen were expensive and always located on the opposite side of the street than the side I\u0027m currently driving on and no one will let me make a left turn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Food\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of feelings about food and they are all positive. I would definitely eat food again and recommend food to my friends. 10/10\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Dog Food\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically, food for this dog:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10426534_10207435785111896_3840688972032289278_n.jpg?oh=d0f8cc670e836294419094fbaf8bfd02\u0026amp;oe=566C87B3\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer name is Lucy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Rent and Other Living Expenses\u003cbr\u003eIt turns out it costs money to just be alive in certain cities. I didn\u0027t know. I also learned \"Squatter\u0027s Rights\" only works for 3 months before the Sheriff kicks you out. I also learned Sheriffs are still a thing. The more you know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Creative Expenses, Supplies, Etc.\u003cbr\u003eDiet Coke, so much Diet Coke. But also, self-publishing costs money- As do collage supplies, pens, paper, laptop repairs and my time in general. Also editors cost money that I will gladly throw at them because editing is the worst.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging you\u0027re helping to diffuse these costs and allowing me to spend an hour writing instead of an hour at work. But if you want to help me recreate the magic of my barista days as I write, you\u0027re more than welcome to come to my home, break my toilet and spill sugar in puddles of Half-n-Half on my floor and then ask me for the wifi password.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd what do we get for pledging?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e1. More\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@DevasaurusRex\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMedium articles\u003c/a\u003e per month.\u003cbr\u003eYou can have as many articles about feminism and food trucks as your little heart desires.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. A book.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right! I\u0027m writing a new book. And I\u0027m super excited for it and I want to finish and then compulsively refresh my Amazon listing to check the reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Zines/Novelettes\u003cbr\u003eSo many. So many of these. I have two\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@DevasaurusRex/dear-marguerite-c034fb166c82\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003enearly finished\u003c/a\u003e and my goal is to make about 6-10 a year to send to my patrons and readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4.

I\u0027m thinking also we should all have leather jackets with cool nicknames on the back. It\u0027s just an idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. My everlasting love and gratitude\u003cbr\u003eSeriously you can come over at any time and I will make you sausage rolls. I don\u0027t cook a lot but I can make the hell out of a sausage roll.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my love and Diet Coke,\u003cbr\u003eDevon\u003cbr\u003e"
