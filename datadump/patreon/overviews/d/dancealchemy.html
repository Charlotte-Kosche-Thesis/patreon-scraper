Rather than being bound to any one doctrine or creed, we believe we are all spiritually connected and that everyone, and every path, is sacred. Our goal is to spread peace through understanding, and the way we do that is by learning and integrating dances of other cultures into our own choreography, while also teaching ours.

These can be done wherever you are - at home, in your office, outdoors - and certain of these can be adapted for those with limited mobility.
