    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp find, restore, and preserve rare lost cartoons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an artist, filmmaker and author. Having worked in-house at The Walt Disney Company for 32-year, I am now an \u003cem\u003eindependent\u003c/em\u003e producer,\ncreative director, and writer. My mission is working on sustaining animation history through\nresearch, preservation \u0026amp; restoration of films that are on the cusp of being lost, and documentation of them in books and essay. Over the last several years, I have had five books published including my latest, \u003cem\u003eOswald the Lucky Rabbit: The Search for the Lost Disney Cartoons.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have worked on finding and restoring six previously lost \u003cem\u003eOswald the Lucky Rabbit\u003c/em\u003e cartoons as well as some \u003cem\u003eAlice Comedy \u003c/em\u003eshorts and\ncontinue researching black \u0026amp; white cartoons from the silent era. This is an \u003cstrong\u003eindependent\u003c/strong\u003e effort since \u003cem\u003emany of these films are in the public domain or will be soon.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eSeveral more lost Alice and Oswald cartoons have recently been identified.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eBut, there are still sixteen missing Alice Comedies and seven lost Oswald cartoons\u003c/em\u003e. The process of researching, locating, retrieving digital copies, preserving on film, restoring, adding music, and documenting this material is costly and requires many people. I\u0027d like to build a community with individuals like you and together we can become a force in saving these films for future generations to enjoy. Would you consider being part of this effort? \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach film found can cost upwards of thousands of dollars to restore, preserve, and add music. But if we all join forces, each contributing what we might spend on one cup of coffee or tea a month we can easily achieve this level. Just imagine If you can pledge, $1, $5, $10, or more a month, you can be part of a community, a team, working towards the preservation and restoration of animation\nhistory. For as little as $12 a year your contribution,\u00a0combined with many others, could be helping to save these early animated films. \u003cstrong\u003e100% of the funds raised will be used for the purpose of finding, restoring, and adding music to these films.\u003c/strong\u003e This is critical to our understanding of animation history, Walt Disney\u0027s early career as a whole, and the preservation of these important silent films for posterity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you imagine if thousands of individuals like us pledged $1, $5, or more a month how much we could accomplish together. By being part of this community you will get access to exclusive updates and sneak peeks at newly discovered material. Check out all the perks that listed for each sponsor levels, \u003cstrong\u003eincluding seeing rare finds for the first time here, on this page.\u003c/strong\u003e Thanks, in advance for considering joining us on this adventure in saving these precious films. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Become Part Of The Team?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is a completely \u003cstrong\u003eindependent effort \u003c/strong\u003eand I am doing everything possible to keep costs low, but I need\nhelp funding research, restoration, composers, musicians, and editors. Let\u0027s build a community of great people, like you, who care about rescuing\nblack \u0026amp; white cartoons, restoring these films, documenting them in writing, and adding original music\nsoundtracks to them so they can be shared with fans like us. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThese films will then be donated to the\nappropriate film repository for posterity.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf we don\u2019t do it, likely no one will. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003ePlus, you\nget access to some cool stuff for participating and being part of the team!"
