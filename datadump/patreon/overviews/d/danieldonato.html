My ethos of existence, at 22 years old, is music. I\u0027ve been a professional musician since I was 14. I started busking on the streets of Nashville, with a sign taped to a shoebox, \"saving up for a Telecaster.\" I then graduated up to the late night Honky Tonks, playing classic country and outlaw country music. 4 hours a night, 5-6 days a week, for about 4 years straight. Thousands of shows, with thousands of hours to boot with one of Nashville\u0027s most coveted local bands that have alumni of Vince Gill and Brad Paisley. I\u0027ve toured with major label bands, not so major label bands in vans, and in the past year, started writing and singing. The whole spectrum of my musical identity, I aim to cover here, for you, the listener. I work music, I play music, and in a sincerely core way, \u003cem\u003eI live music\u003c/em\u003e. I am most alive with a guitar around my neck with a song that needs playing. I feel nothing but the utmost gratitude to have discovered this as early on in life as I have, and to have made and met friends and fans in the process...or journey...with music, both are the same, it seems. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope, sincerely, that this page brings to you entertainment (first and foremost), and inspiration.\u00a0"
