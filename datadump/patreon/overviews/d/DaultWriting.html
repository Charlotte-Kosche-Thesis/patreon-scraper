    "summary": "When my mother passed away in 2009, my grieving took a weird turn. I gradually lost the ability to write - and I mean completely. More than a simple writers block, the loss eventually robbed me of my ability to type altogether, and even (at its worst) my handwriting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not the first person to suffer from such a condition (theologian Wendy Farley, I am told, has a similar story).\u00a0I was an academic at the time, with book contracts and articles to finish, and it completely upended my career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFriends who know me well have heard parts of this story. They know that this is the reason I got into making radio and why I am involved in a lot of non-writing pursuits. I am very thankful that these avenues were open to me, and I have loved the time I spend making audio and video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat folks may not know is how hard I have worked over the years to get the writing back. I experienced it like the way one experiences the loss of a limb: Life goes on, but the memory of a former wholeness causes a deep toothache in the soul. I wanted that wholeness back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter more than five years of trying everything I could find, I had a breakthrough in late 2017. Whether it was one thing, or a combination of all the things over time, I do not know. What I do know is that the fuse - long dead - got replaced. The spark re-ignited. The lights came on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince September 2017, I have written over one hundred thousand words.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write every day, at least 750 words a day (that\u0027s about three solid pages). Lately, it\u0027s been more than that. Among other projects, I have completed a 20 page short story, and 250 pages of a novel. I am starting to think about getting back to those book contracts, abandoned years back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have read this far, you will understand that having my writing return to me is not just a nice end to the story. On the contrary - it is the beginning of something huge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am able to write again, and with a focus and momentum and a consistency that I did not have before I lost my way. I feel an obligation to stick with this, and to honor the gift I have been given (and it is a gift).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am reorganizing my life, and making writing a central part of who I am and what I do - from here on out, however long it lasts, come what may.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means my family and I are rearranging our ideas about what jobs I am going to be doing, and the income I am going to make. They are placing a huge amount of trust in me, and in this passion of writing I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am reaching out to you. I want to make my living in such a way that writing is central. That means I need to find ways to create income from the writing I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you will partner with me in this passion, I can offer you good words - and a lot of them. As I publish, you will have signed copies and thank you letters. As things grow and blossom, you will be acknowledged. I don\u0027t know that I can offer anything more tangible than that, at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you care about words - and if you have read this far, it is clear that you do - you understand. The rewards might be greater than any of us can imagine right now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, that\u0027s a chance worth taking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what I\u0027m working on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The authorized biography of Old Testament theologian Walter Brueggemann - Fans of Walter\u0027s work know that he is one of the most important voices in contemporary religious studies. I\u0027ve been working with him for the past several years to shape and tell his story; not only who he is, but who and where he comes from. It\u0027s a journey that takes us through the heart of America\u0027s immigrant heritage, and the heart of the social Gospel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0 A sci-fi/conspiracy novel, working title, \"The God Particle\" - I\u0027ve got around 250 pages written, and it will be around 400 when I\u0027m done. The story follows two groups - one dedicated to order, the other to chaos - who are locked in a battle for the fate of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The Accessorized Bible - This is an exploration of niche Bibles in the 21st century. From The Fireman\u0027s Bible to the Women\u0027s Bible to that pink New Testament you bought to match your Easter dress, this book will address the explosion of specialty Bible publishing over the past twenty years, and what it means for American religious identity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The Covert Magisterium - A revision of my doctoral dissertation, which looks at how publishers and editors became an unseen force in Bible interpretation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Regular blog posts on faith and politics for Medium, Chicago Now, and other venues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Articles for magazines like Sojourners, Commonweal, The Christian Century, and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
