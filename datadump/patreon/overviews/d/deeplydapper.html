    "summary": "Hello, Pod People!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kristopher McClanahan and I am an artist, author, podcaster, soapboiler and con man living in the Northwest. Every week I get together with my buddies to create podcasts and art and we would love to make you a part of the process. Deeply Dapper Dispatches releases two shows: \u003cstrong\u003eThe 3D Podcasket\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- A Weekly Horror and Geek show featuring myself and my buddy Devon. Join us there as we review Horror movies, toys, weird news, video games, and dissect obscure video oddities, independent films and more! Then, over on our monthly show, \u003cstrong\u003eRobot Kraken\u003c/strong\u003e, Thom Chiaramonte and I dive headlong into geek topics, art techniques, comic creation and nerdy film and TV properties! In addition to the shows, I also attend comic, gaming and horror conventions across the country, often appearing with Thom and Devon, where we promote the shows, sell artwork, handmade decor, enamel pins and geeky soap! You can read the blog, check out the shop and stream or download episodes of both shows at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.deeplydapper.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.deeplydapper.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a ton of fun, but it\u0027s also a LOT of work. Finding time to record, edit and post 10-20 hours of content as well as watch the subjects of the episodes every month can be difficult and we have had listeners ask us about ways they can help. So here it is - Our Patreon! Naturally, our final edits of\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eEpisodes of The 3D Podcasket and Robot Kraken will always be FREE! \u003c/strong\u003eHowever, there\u0027s usually tons of extra content that doesn\u0027t make it on the show - Thom making dying robot sounds, my dogs attacking me, Devon ranting about something really esoteric and some of the content like Robot Kraken\u0027s reviews take weeks before appearing on the show. Having patrons would allow us to post that bonus content here, in it\u0027s entirety as soon as it\u0027s recorded, or possibly even LIVE! We have plans for puppet reviews and video segments of the show as well! \u00a0I\u0027m a full time author and artist and I travel a lot, so every dollar you can support us with goes towards more content, on the road surprises, interviews and making sure I can afford to pay my power and internet bills! (I am an independent artist, after all.) We could also stream some special events like us on the convention floors, interacting with celebs and stuff like game night!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will also be doing regular polls here on the Patreon page for patrons to choose our next reviews, topics, dream casts, show subjects and more! Make us watch a terrible video nasty from the 70\u0027s or your favorite under-appreciated scifi flick! We want this to be a hub for interactions! We will also give every patron a secret phrase that will get you a \u003cstrong\u003efree gift at our convention appearances!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to being podcasters, we are all artistic creators and would love a chance to interact with you and create for you! Every month we will do a drawing where a Patron will get a sweet prize, likely involving handmade decor or art. We also feature a monthly enamel pin kickstarter and more! Maybe you\u0027ll win a chance to be killed in one of my novels!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting us, we hope you enjoy the shows!\u00a0"
