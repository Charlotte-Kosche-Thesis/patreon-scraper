I have been telling visual stories using data and personal narratives for most of my creative career. As a Design Justice advocate, I feel it\u0027s my duty to create works that inspire reconciliation\u00a0and healing. DFTM is a series that does that by facilitating an energetic and education experience that breaks\u00a0down issues that exist at the intersection of design and people of color. To see more of my work please visit my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jessicabellamy.design\"\u003eartist site\u003c/a\u003e or my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gridsconnect.me\"\u003e agency\u0027s site\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0Also feel free to follow me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jessicabellamy.design/?hl=en\"\u003e Instagram\u003c/a\u003e @jessicabellamy.design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://coyote.imgix.net/251-jessica-bellamy/jessica-bellamy-angelina-castillo-supp-10.jpg?w=900\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe History and Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDesigning from the Margins is a personal social journalism project that started out as an \u003ca\u003eaudio blog\u003c/a\u003e in 2016. In January of 2018, it evolved into an Instagram series and then later I shared that content on Youtube. Using my information design skills I created a platform to analyze design culture, spotlighted designers of colors, and discuss\u00a0power dynamics in design. It is this designer\u0027s opinion that design is a powerful tool that we should use consciously and responsibly. It is important for all creatives to be aware of the fact that design shapes perceptions, creates or defines narratives, and designates credibility and authority. That is why I am driven to keep this project alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon Now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the overwhelmingly positive response from my followers on Instagram, I have decided to seek funding opportunities so that I can continue this work. I am interested in taking on new stories and diving deeper into the Black Aesthetic. There may even be a documentary in the future. I\u0027m dreaming big!
