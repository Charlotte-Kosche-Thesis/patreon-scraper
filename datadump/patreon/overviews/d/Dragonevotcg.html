    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Simen and i\u0027m one of the lead developers of DragonEvo the card game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mainly focus on game rules of DragonEvo and the balancing, along with everything that has to do with social media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is DragonEvo?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDragon Evo: The Card Game lets you play through the eyes of 3 nations: The powerful, bloodthirsty Rutai, the scorned, resourceful Highwind, or the peaceful, welcoming Hologev. \u003cbr\u003eThe game will in it\u0027s finished version include a SinglePlayer where you can \"march\" across Tyrenir in the name of the Dragon Emperor and conquer your enemies. Regroup, rebuild, and retaliate against your oppressors to save your nation and safeguard your borders. Form alliances with other races and creatures to restore the balance of nature to ensure the Nations of Man once again can find peace and welcome the Dragons back to Erendor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith many features found in traditional MMO\u2019s, Dragon Evo: The Card Game lets you build powerful decks by recruiting members from an array of resources. Level up your cards, abilities, and attack options. Augment your deck with resources and special minerals to become a formidable adversary capable of crushing your opponent with each turn.\u003cbr\u003eThis is not a game where luck and the roll of the dice will determine who wins and loses. Polish your tactics and skill and time your attacks wisely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all we would be grateful as it allows us to pay the server costs and the occasional coffee. There is also a ever growing need for artwork, and our artist doesn\u0027t only like white paper, but the green one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patrons pledging $1 or more get the ability to see behind the scenes stuff before we post this on our devlog and some things we will never share other places via our special patreons discord channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have many other rewards as well as you can read in the reward section.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning the site as of now is not that expensive, but the increase in players is taking it\u0027s toll on the current server and we would like to increase the resources to give players a more stable experience on the busy days. \u003cbr\u003ePatreon lets folks who find our little game fun, or interesting the ability to fund it directly to make sure we can keep the game running free forever and scale the server according to the current income, as well as pay the artist to make more artwork, and our dev some caffeine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more pledges we have the more time we will have to invest in the game and add more and more features, along with adding playability on several devices. Perhaps we can even hire more developers?!"
