    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re setting up a way to save the 3rd season of Drifter\u0027s Sympathy and create the feasibility of doing a 4th season. The community that\u0027s risen up to support Drifter\u0027s has been super encouraging and we\u0027re looking for a way to keep the train rolling in the wake of the Feral Audio Network closing their doors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two bonus episodes, a special\u00a0shirt design made for us by Beholder Badges, some brand new Holy Sons hoodies, a few of the original Hardy Boys books we used for the cast imagery and a few of the records I\u0027ve played on the podcast to give out to supporters.  In addition to all this, Patreon subscribers will receive the new podcasts a week before everyone else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon season will run for a 3 month period to complete the last 6 episodes and then the membership will pause (and charge nothing to be a member) to take time off to record the fourth season.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is just a way for people who\u0027ve wanted to contribute to the livelihood of the podcast to do so, but with some added tiers for anyone who wants to own something from what went into the podcast.\u00a0So multiply the monthly fees by 3 and that\u0027s what you will pay for what you want to receive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first batch of the Hoodies have already been printed up so I\u0027ll start shipping those alongside the books first. The new Drifter\u0027s T-shirt design is going to be printed like a pre-order to suit the exact demand, so it will start shipping out on March 1st. The first episode will also roll out on March 1st along with the first bonus episode and I\u0027ll save the second bonus episode for the finale. If anyone has ANY questions or suggestions I\u0027ll be online at the Drifter\u0027s page or contactable here and willing to tweak any little aspect of the roll-out \u0026gt;\u0026gt; THANK YOU!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
