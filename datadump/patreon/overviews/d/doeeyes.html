    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHow this all started.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn January 1, 2015 I set up my phone to video record a resolution or rather an ambition to vlog everyday for one year. I knew what it took to write content and host videos from working on Sexplanations but I was very unfamiliar with the videography and editing processes. I wanted to learn. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearning for me is an act of compassion. It\u0027s a way for me to experience humility and grace as I fumble through new knowledge. I love it. Since I started vlogging I\u0027ve learned so much about when to make cuts, how to use rudimentary iMovie, lighting, sound, posting, and upload times. I was having a blast making videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happened?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I was tired, my family missed me, and trolls invaded. (Trolls, aka internet bullies). One of the videos, \"Dear Boy Who Likes My Daughter\" went viral and with the acclaim came online abuse. For teaching anti-harassment practices, I was harassed. I was threatened, my daughter was threatened, and the safe personal vlogging channel, DoeEyes, became a really scary space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually the trolls wandered off and I set up the camera again, not to vlog everyday per se but to continue learning. That\u0027s where I am now. It is self care to be gentle and flexible with my goals, it\u0027s also self care to be curious about and participate in things that I enjoy. I want this channel to exist and I would love your support in the process because it makes me a better Lindsey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about the channel name?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoeEyes refers to my wide, deer like gaze but it is also the eyes I have, Lindsey Doe\u0027s eyes. This channel is my perspective. It\u0027s what I record and the story I tell through editing about my life education. I want watching it to be like hanging out together in my living or going to class and getting a break for recess. DoeEyes is my playground.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need the help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always need help. Didn\u0027t you watch/read Into the Wild? The help, the community, the sense of purpose to be with others is living. Sure, I can make this channel as a hobby and pay into by myself but for me projects are way more fun and healthy when I include others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many videos are you going to\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0make?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many as I can. I think that one or two a week is a reasonable goal. What do you think?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
