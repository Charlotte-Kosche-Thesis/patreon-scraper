We\u0027re writers, creators and Dungeon Masters. We\u0027re a couple of story tellers and dreamers that just want to bring some of our ideas, the ones we find nifty or exciting, out into the world in general for your enjoyment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have 8 Kickstarters under our belts and all of the black eyes and bruises that come with them! We\u0027ve been successful and we\u0027ve almost failed successfully by throwing all of our ideas at different walls like wet spaghetti, wracking our minds trying to interpret the mess that comes out. We\u0027ve got a laser table, a CNC machine, a wood working shop, crazy cool computers made to multi task like fools and we prefer to spend our time thinking up cool things for our parties to encounter instead of going to parties and wasting time and money on having a life! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect this Patreon to make a ton of money and to pay all of our bills but we do think that there are enough people out there like us, ones that want to do what they love for a living and create things that they think other people might enjoy. Ones that might not know how to get into creating things on a professional level, people that might want to take their ideas from their head and just don\u0027t really know what the first step is. Well that\u0027s what we\u0027re here on Patreon offering to you right now, a chance to learn from our experience and join us on this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll keep making stuff and sharing with you every step of the process from beginning to end. We\u0027ll throw our ideas at a wall and let YOU help us decide what to make and what to skip, we\u0027ll introduce you to our artists, our designers, ourselves and we\u0027ll do our best to answer every question you have in as much detail as it takes. We\u0027ll provide write ups, break downs and all the nitty gritty that goes on when we\u0027re trying to take something from our notebooks and put it into the hands of hundreds of people all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to watch us, come in.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to help us, come in.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re just here waiting for the blimp to burst into flames, come in.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s gonna be one heck of a show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for reading this far and considering being one of our Patron\u0027s, you keep being awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHobie \u0026amp; Levi"
