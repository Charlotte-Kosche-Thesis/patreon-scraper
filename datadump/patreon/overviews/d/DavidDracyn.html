    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome!\u003c/strong\u003e I am David Dracyn and I\u0027d like to tell you a story or rather, many, many stories. From urban fantasy tales where dragons live hidden among us to traditional fantasy adventures starring wizards and dwarves and out into the dark shadows around us and the strange things that may exist in them waiting to strike at you when you least expect it, there are plenty of worlds I plan on introducing you to. Thus I am inviting you to come along for the ride, enjoy the journey, and help bring these realms of adventure, horror, and mystery to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pyKWUWx.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an unashamed geek, an avid reader, and a writer. While my love of reading and writing is vast and spans multiple genres I find it is within Urban Fantasy and more traditional sword and sorcery based Fantasy that I truly feel at home. I write the kinds of stories I\u0027ve always enjoyed reading. Good vs Evil, monsters and magic, and just the slightest touch of horror to keep things interesting. Whether it is set in the here and now or in some long forgotten past, I love crafting stories and sharing them with others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmittedly, many of these stories are written to the sounds of classic rock while my dog Justice watches me work. Between you and me I think he believes he\u0027s my co-author, but that\u0027ll be our little secret.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7qgHIHg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment my primary focus is on Hot Merchandise and Burnout the first two books in the Aden Drake series. The series stars Aden Drake, a down on his luck bounty hunting dragon who along with a dwarven bartender, a werewolf bouncer, and other fantastical friends hunts down the things that go bump in the night...for a price of course. That is if his fellow dragons and a legion of dragon slayers don\u0027t skin his hide first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said I always have other ideas in the works including the continuing adventures of Aden Drake, some forays into horror, and other urban fantasy worlds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Vl0dure.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage helps in several ways. First, I can deliver short stories and novellas that better flesh out the worlds and offer more insight into characters and locations than can actually fit in the books themselves while still keeping pacing and story structure intact. Second, just getting people to know a book exists is like a second job all unto itself and with your assistance I can better market my work so that more readers can enjoy it. Next, your aid helps make sure that I can eventually afford to hire an editor, professional cover artist, and more. Finally, you help see to it that I can devote more time and attention to crafting more works of fiction for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xDiciQH.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a backer you can receive short stories that help expand the worlds of the actual books, sneak peaks at rough drafts of chapters, character profiles, behind the scenes looks at my process, novella chapters as they are finished, and other neat little odds and ends that will not only give you insight into the books, but also allows you be a part of the process. \u003cbr\u003e"
