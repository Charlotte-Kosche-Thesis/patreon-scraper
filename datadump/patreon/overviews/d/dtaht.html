    "summary": "I have worked to improve the internet for my entire life. I\u0027ve also made a lot of music, and done my best to further the alt.space program. For the last five years I\u0027ve worked myself to the bone, mostly unpaid, to solve the \"bufferbloat\" problem - first by organizing and leading the team that solved it, and giving away, for free, the ideas and code for anyone to use! And I\u0027ve spent tons of time later convincing standards organizations like the IETF to make the ideas standard in new equipment - and also open source makers like openwrt to retrofit the fq_codel and cake fixes into millions of older yet upgradable home routers, and helping ISPs, vendors and chipmakers understand the both the need for the fq_codel fixes, and how to implement them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext up - if we can muster the resources, and win a battle against the FCC - is applying the same ideas to dramatically improve how wifi works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have supported myself with irrelevant contract after contract over this time, and lived really, really cheap, and while I don\u0027t intend to stop doing the latter, balancing the demands of the former was getting to be a PITA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy sort of long term outlook for technology development is not something most companies are willing to fund - stuff that pays off hugely in 3 years is too far out for most, and yet, me staying focused on these problems will lead to nearly incalculable benefits for everyone now on - or due to get on - the Internet. Or so I think. What do you think?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFixing wifi is going to be harder and more tedious than fixing bufferbloat was in the first place, and it will require many releases of code (built around the openwrt codebase)\u00a0and much testing before the fixes can be used by everybody for even the 2 chipsets we have targeted in the make-wifi-fast project already. And it would be nice if those that like and use wifi - could chip in to help make it happen."
