    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eHello! I am Anatoly Shashkin also known as\nDOSNostalgic\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027m known as DOS\nNostalgic because\u2026 well, it\u0027s all in the name. I\u0027m really\nnostalgic about DOS! I love video games and computers and I grew up\nplaying a lot of PC games, and so this passion carried over into my\nadult life. To this day I enjoy nothing else more than talking about\nMS-DOS games with fellow computer game enthusiasts, which is why in\n2009 I started DOS Nostalgia, which began as a YouTube video series,\nbut then expanded into many other things including a podcast, and my\nconstant Twitter presence, where I get to share my daily DOS\nescapades with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\nDespite having\n\u201cnostalgia\u201d in the name, it\u0027s not just about nostalgia, but also\nin a way about preservation of video game history. I love the fact\nthat people get to rediscover forgotten games from their childhoods,\nor find new interesting games of the past to enjoy for the first\ntime. The world of MS-DOS games and software is incredible, and I\nlove going through it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere\u0027s one of my less informative, but definitely more nostalgic compilation videos that everyone seems to enjoy:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/73-S9qCBH4Q?rel=0\" width=\"480\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is a way to\nprovide support to the creators of content you enjoy. I use this\nsystem myself and I find it fair and convenient. You just designate\nthe amount of money to pledge monthly, and the system takes care of\nthe rest. You\u0027ll get statements, so you\u0027re able to keep track of\neverything. You can start pledging, change the amount, or cancel\neverything altogether at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m not about to\nstart making exclusive content and, in a way, make people pay for my\nvideos; that\u0027s not what I\u0027m about. All my content will always be\npublicly available no matter what. So why pledge? Well, keep reading\n- I also got a bunch of rewards for people to show my appreciation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere\u0027s one of the rewards. Not this exact thing, just something to give you an idea:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dosnostalgia.com/files/baggie_idea.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eam I \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edoing\nthis?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI\nwould love to dedicate as much time as possible to producing\nDOS-related\ncontent, but\ncurrently don\u0027t have any kind of financial freedom to do so. I started\nthis project as a hobby, but I eventually realized that I couldn\u0027t\ndeliver the kind of quality YouTube material I liked on a regular\nbasis if I couldn\u0027t justify it financially. The world of MS-DOS is\nincredibly vast, and there\u0027s so much amazing stuff other there,\nand I\u0027d love to dedicate myself to it.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother\ngoal is to be able to afford an upgrade. Currently I\u0027m using a\ncomputer that\u0027s a\ndecade old,\nand I have to jump through hoops even\njust to\ncreate high definition video. Capturing\nfootage from more demanding games from the later days of DOS (like\n3D games\nfrom 96 \u2013 97) using\nemulation is also impossible.\nNeedless to\nsay any kind of streaming is completely out of question as well.\nIt would be amazing to\nfix this situation and be able to produce videos faster.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSo what\u0027s going to happen?\u003c/h3\u003e\nIf all goals are\nmet, you\u0027ll get a weekly video that will either be a review of a DOS\ngame/games, or some kind of a comprehensive video on a DOS-related subject.\nThere will be smaller weekly videos that don\u0027t take as much time to make in\naddition to those as well, like let\u0027s plays, or a short look at a\ngames by a specific developer, and other less scripted stuff. And of\ncourse I\u0027ll keep throwing in other things, like podcasts,\nsoundtracks, animated logos, and other stuff like you would normally\nsee pop up on the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I\u0027m able to\nupgrade my computer, it will will open up a possibility of live\nstreaming, which is something I\u0027d love to do for my Patrons. And if this Patreon is super successful, I\u0027ll start talking about Windows 1-3.x games as well!\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd of course I\u0027d\nlove to explore areas of MS-DOS that I haven\u0027t really touched in the\npast, such as games from non-English markets, office (and other)\nsoftware, and even some of the tools for creating DOS games with a\npossibility of tutorial videos, so you could also create a bunch of\nnew DOS games! There are plenty of\npossibilities here, and I\u0027m ready to tackle them all.\u003cbr\u003e"
