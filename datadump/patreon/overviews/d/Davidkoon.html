    "summary": "Welcome! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years (many many years), I\u0027ve performed trombone solos in churches and other places. I\u0027ve played in \u00a0jazz bands, orchestras, and church praise teams. Playing music for a living has been a lifelong dream. I was in radio for thirty something years and I loved it too but nothing compared to my love for music. In my college years, I was lucky to be a part of a group called \"Living Soul\" (6 vocals, 3 horns and a rhythm section). We played Christian Music from Andrea Crouch, Truth, the Imperials and more. We did one Nationwide tour of 4 cities and had to shut down. The money just wasn\u0027t there to support it. This was an exciting time, some of my best memories are from this time period. \u00a0...and it was the start of the dream but it was cut short way too early. Fast forward to today. I\u0027m still playing, still enjoy making music but I\u0027m still earning a living doing something else. The dream of doing music ministry playing trombone has always been just out of reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of My vision is to create a new Christian Band similar to groups like Sweet Comfort, DeGarmo \u0026amp; Key, Petra but with a sizzling horn section. I would also like to create a new Smooth Jazz Worship style. ... Originals and jazz covers of current worship music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003ePatreon is designed to help Artists earn an income for creating art (in my case music). In Beethoven\u0027s time, wealthy patrons paid Beethoven to create music. Michaelangelo was paid to create art. Patreon combines this idea with today\u0027s crowd funding concept to give artists an income. Patreon Artists are paid to create. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I become a patron for David Koon?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eEach sponsored video creation makes it possible for me to reach out to others for Christ. It\u0027s more than music. It\u0027s a mission to share the gospel for all who have ears to hear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of videos do you create? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eMost in the beginning will be trombone covers from the Christian music world; however, I will also include some great music from Jazz, Rock, Movies, TV, Classical, even Country. Some videos will feature Charities and Mission Projects.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I become a Patron? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eSimply click on the \"BECOME A PATRON\" button on this page and follow the easy instructions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will the money be used? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eMy goal is to do this full time, so yes, in addition to the money used to create videos, some money will be used for living expenses making it possible for me do the ministry that the Lord has called me to do. At some poin\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003et as funds grow proceeds from one video per month will go to special projects. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the Patron levels? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eMost patrons will pledge $5, $10, or $15 per video and will limit exposure to no more than 5 sponsored videos each month. Plans are also available as low as $1 per video and up to $500 per video. You can even customize. No matter what level you choose, your contribution will be appreciated and will make this mission possible.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
