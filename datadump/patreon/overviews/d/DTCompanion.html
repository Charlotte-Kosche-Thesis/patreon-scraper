    "summary": "Hello, everybody! David Tennant\u0027s Companion here, and I need you help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I love Doctor Who. I love watching with you all, too. Every comment I read (apart from the occasional troll, as comes with the territory) makes me smile and instantly makes all the hours put into each episode worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, there lies the problem. The hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a college student, debt comes with the territory, and I am currently spending nearly every hour either at school, working, or unconscious in my bed. Apart from bimonthly day trips to keep spirits high, this is my life. And I want Who to be a permanent part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, the only way I can have the time to post consistently and with quality, I need to have days off from work. Now, you might be thinking \"Wait a minute, Zoe! What about the weekend?\" Well, I have a different sort of job, working in an old folks\u0027 home kitchen, and so I work typically 6 days a week. The seventh? Every other week, a trip to the Doc. If you (and I) did our math right, that leaves half a day (remember school!) to get all this done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is very near impossible. Totally impossible considering\u00a0the 4 different\u00a0Doctor Who related shows immediately connecting to the main show (2 of which ARE the main show!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I could just go in and say \"I can\u0027t work 2 days a week\" and that\u0027s fine! But something has to pay the ever-growing mountain of bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s why I need you help. With more time, I can give you more. A LOT MORE! I just need some funding to, not only cover the off time, but also allow more opportunities for this small little community of ours to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAllons-y!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Friend in Time,\u003cbr\u003e~Zoe\u003cbr\u003e"
