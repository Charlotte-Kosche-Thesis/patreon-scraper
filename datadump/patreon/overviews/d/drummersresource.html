    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eThree years ago I conceived the idea of creating a place where drummers could gather and learn from some of the greatest drummers in the world. Then my dream became reality when I started the Drummer\u2019s Resource Podcast. Since 2013 I\u0027ve done 200+ interviews and the podcast has been downloaded close to 1,000,000 times. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThere has been a lot that\u2019s gone on behind the scenes to make this happen, including thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars to grow Drummer\u2019s Resource to where it is are today. While it\u2019s been ad supported to date, it cannot continue to grow without \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e, the listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve grappled with the idea of charging for the podcast, but I still stand firm against it. These interviews are invaluable and I want them to remain accessible to everyone who seeks advice, motivation and inspiration, drumming-related and beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u2019s my solution:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you have written to me and asked me what you can do for the podcast and how you can support it. In addition to getting the word out and sharing your favorite sessions (thank you for that) I\u2019m sharing something new:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI\u2019ve launched a Patreon account which is a way for you to help support the podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou choose a monthly pledge amount, which goes directly to the podcast, for as long as you\u2019d like.\u00a0Support levels start at only $1/month. Trust me, every little bit helps and can make a huge difference. But I ask you to consider the value the podcast has provided to you and pledge according to that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTo be clear, the podcast will continue to be free for everyone. But those who pledge get something extra. Aside from knowing that YOU are contributing to the ongoing learning and education of drummers around the world, you\u2019ll also receive cool gifts and exclusive rewards as a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will I use the money for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e1  Hosting: Hosting costs are expensive and to keep the site fast, I need to upgrade as we grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e2  Mailing list: Same here. Bigger list means the need to upgrade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e3  Web Development: To make sure you\u2019re getting the best experience and the content is easily accessible, I need to make frequent site updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e4  More gear: Video equipment for interviews, documentary-style films and entertaining shorts to give you even more access to the greatest drummers in the world\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e5  Content expansion: You\u2019ve asked for more written and video content. I\u2019ll hire a few staff writers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e6  Staff: I have someone (Justin) who edits the podcast but I\u2019d like to offer him more hours and take on another staff member to assist with the day-to-day operations to bring you more content, more podcasts and more videos even faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou\u2019ll see that there are a few different tiers of support, and while every little bit helps, I ask that you consider how much value you\u2019ve received from this podcast. Your support means so much to me and the future listeners of this podcast. Help me to help us grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the \u003cstrong\u003eBEST\u003c/strong\u003e listeners and I can\u2019t wait to see what we can do together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Nick\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
