Here you will find several levels of patronage that can allow you access to submit to the Dungeons and Devtrast subreddit, build items that appear in the campaign, and even construct dungeons for the party to encounter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho is your Devtrast, and what does he do?\u003c/h3\u003eDevtrast is the game master of a home brew campaign he created for a group of six players that sit around a table on Sunday nights to play Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 edition. He hopes his players will forgive his inconsistent voices for NPC\u0027s by offering them payment through this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow do I watch?\u003c/h3\u003eYou can check out our stream at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/devtrast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etwitch.tv/devtrast\u003c/a\u003e every Sunday @ 7pm Pacific Standard Time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are these people, and why should I care about them?\u003c/h3\u003eThe Dungeons and Devtrast team are a group of the following close friends:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.\u00a0The Control Room Guy - Played by Clint Martin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eClint graduated Boise State University with a degree in supply chain management, and is greatly overqualified to run the mechanics of the stream. He is also Devtrast\u0027s roommate, and has to put up with his real life difficulty checks 24/7.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClint has been playing D\u0026amp;D since early 2016, and in his first combat encounter, was knocked unconscious in a surprise round. That character was later killed for simply putting on a signet ring fashioned with the crest of Corellon Lorethian.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn his most previous campaign Clint played Crank Fastle, a half orc rogue, and managed to be the party badass and nail all his role play DC\u0027s, then fail them miserably during combat. For whatever reason, dice are not a fan of Clint when it comes to turn-based action.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will find Clint operating the cameras, updating the subreddit, and managing chat during this campaign. Without him, Devtrast and the rest of the party would most likely perform all actions out of focus or completely out of frame.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Lord Benedict Gregory Bartholomew III - Played by Dan Libby\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDan is Devtrast\u0027s boss at their real life job, which allows Dan\u0027s character to basically be invincible. Ok this is a completely false statement as Dan\u0027s character was the first to die in their most recent campaign. But that was not Devtrast\u0027s fault. Or so we assume.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDan is the veteran of the group when it comes to dungeons and dragons as he has been playing since the 80\u0027s. No one else in the group was even alive during this time, so Dan pretty much has free reign to make up whatever he wants about how great \u00a0and complicated the game used to be. We choose to believe him regarding anything rules related.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn his most previous campaign Dan played a gnome sorcerer named Hedel who enjoyed using prestidigitation to turn party members pink. Unfortunately this led to no one in the party batting an eye when he died, because you know, being turned a feminine color is apparently a reason not to mourn them. He was simply trying to make the world more aware of breastplate cancer.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will find Dan suffering in this current campaign as his human character Lord Benedict Gregory Bartholomew III of Tel\u0027Liam seeks to adjust to a third-world lifestyle within Arrowhead Mire.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Ullster Croleigh - Played by Keanan Cassidy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eKeanan graduated Boise State University with a degree in chemistry and is still undecided if he wants to become a terminally ill high school teacher to sell drugs as many of his peers have done. BSU is also where Keanan took Devtrast under his wing as his big brother in the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eKeanan is well versed in tabletop gaming, diving into sessions of Warhammer 40k, Pathfinder, D\u0026amp;D, and pretty much any board game under the sun or hiding in your parent\u0027s closet. There you might find some of Keanan\u0027s skeletons as well. Because he\u0027s a summoner. Not because he has something to hide.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn his most previous campaign Keanan assumed the role of Bedroth, a dwarf cleric of Fharlanghn, while helping Devtrast DM. He eventually transitioned to full time player, and Bedroth died when the party split and tried to handle a boss which in all fairness Devtrast warned was a boss meant for a full party. He then created Moloch, a character that was secretly working under Vecna, and ended up sacrificing himself to try to kill the entire party. Unfortunately one remained, but they eventually died too.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will find Keanan soaking up the bodies of the dead in this current campaign as his human character Ullster Croleigh looks to raise the dead in the honor of the slain Wee Jas.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Silas Octavo - Played by Jared Fairbanks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJared is a childhood friend of Adrian\u0027s and former co-worker of Dan and Devtrast\u0027s. He is currently in school studying to be a bard. Or maybe he\u0027s a bard in this campaign. It\u0027s one of the two.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJared\u0027s first experience with D\u0026amp;D was sometime in mid 2015. He began by playing D\u0026amp;D 1st edition, which is the rarest of the D\u0026amp;D\u0027s. Jared\u0027s a pretty rare person, so roleplaying in this universe came easy to him.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn his most previous campaign Jared was a dwarf warrior who was afraid of the sky. He also made a cameo as a bard in Devtrast\u0027s first campaign for one night, leaving everyone with roleplay blue-balls thanks to his charismatic nature.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will find Jared singing to the birds with his rapier this campaign as his tengu character Silas Octavo aspires to be the greatest swordsman poet in all the land, with their band, of merry brothers. And sister. I mean they\u0027re not related, it\u0027s just a poem thing. Well it\u0027s not really that either.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Tharsirion \u0027Siri\u0027 Bleakbriar - Played by Anna Harvey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eAnna is Adrian\u0027s sister-in-law and neighbor. She is a naturally gifted artist and is working on building a banner for the twitch channel.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnna has plenty of experience with D\u0026amp;D and became known as one of the most ruthless DM\u0027s on the planet in high school. Rumor has it she paralyzed one of her players after murdering their character so hard they became comatose and died in real life, like a fantasy version of the Matrix.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn her most previous campaign Anna played a reformed gnoll monk who spoke very little and ruled under the guise of \u0027lawful\u0027 quite loosely. She once caused a fight to break out between her and the party\u0027s plastered rogue resulting in an innocent woman ending up with a large laceration across her stomach. She also made an escape out of town thanks to a fly spell from the party cleric causing the humorous image of a dumbfounded gnoll sailing across the sky like a sub-par E.T. remake.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will find Anna thirsting for the last of the remaining knowledge within Kaberon as her elf character Siri Bleakbriar devours books to escape the bleak reality that is the material plane.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6. Cerioc Brassa - Played by Adrian Syes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAdrian is Anna\u0027s brother-in-law as well as Dan and Devtrast\u0027s co-worker, leading to one too many hyphens needed to create this sentence. He is also looking to attend college in the near future\u00a0to study chemical hazards.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdrian began playing D\u0026amp;D alongside Devtrast in January 2016 where he played a half-elf rogue who wanted to learn how to shield bash, and his preferred ranged weapon was rusty knives. He also stole a knight\u0027s bed sheets, who ended up later killing his character after Adrian magically woke up in his bed. He was most likely too cold to feel any pain, because, you know there were no bedsheets.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn his most previous campaign Adrian was a mongrel man fighter, who had the right arm and shell of a crab, tusks protruding from his mouth, elf legs, and a normal human left arm. He had his crab arm ripped off in a fight with the champion of a fighting arena, and his human arm ripped off by a beggar he decided to give gold to. Pelor later put him through the trials of the Golden Protector, and blessed him with six arms; three normal human left arms, and three crab arms.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will find Adrian blowing up this campaign with his bombs as his human alchemist Cerioc Brassa crafts volatile concoctions to combat his old age like an explosive form of Cialis.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7. Odo Greenbottle - Played by Colton Jaroma\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eColton is Devtrast\u0027s former co-worker as well as his first DM. Colton is the reason Devtrast began playing D\u0026amp;D, making him the catalyst for this stream. He is currently an Uber driver and talented musician.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eColton began playing D\u0026amp;D back in 2007 in Rhode Island and is well versed in 3.5e. His first character was a gloaming bard in a group of eight players with two DM\u0027s who did a one shot in Tomb of Horrors, and Colton\u0027s bard was the only one to survive after transferring through a portal naked and bailing on the group. He became rich at the expense of his fellow players\u0027 lives and sang songs about his traumatic experience generating coin everywhere he went like a true capitalist.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn his most previous campaign, Colton DM\u0027d his first adventure and had the unfortunate task of teaching seven new players D\u0026amp;D. While struggling not to kill their characters for meta-gaming, coming unprepared, or doing generally noobish things, he created extremely memorable characters such as: The Thistle Gang, who were a mob of Kobolds that could be persuaded out of combat by talking about trade routes. Madame Shanice, who ran a brothel in the local inn to capture and kill many of the prostitutes, only to transform into a hag and almost wipe the party. And finally Kiero, who didn\u0027t appear until he had stolen several hundred silver from the party while being invisible, and helped us ally a Kobold settlement for the party\u0027s own agenda.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn this campaign you will find Colton\u0027s jungle halfling Odo Greenbottle atop his majestic scorpion companion, Ethel, as he rides for vengeance against the orcs that destroyed his homeland and his family.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"
