Nearly a year ago, I became affiliated with the multi-channel network known as TGN, and started making money from the work I uploaded, which opened my eyes to an interesting possibility. The possibility that that this could legitimately become a full-time job for me. The demand for the content was there, and so was the drive in me to create it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHowever, as time has gone on, I\u0027ve realized that the cuts taken from generated ad-revenue (60-40 split) , on top of Youtube\u0027s draconian copyright policies limit the content I can create, and that is viewed by you. Limited as well is obviously the amount of money that I can make doing this. Money that is \u003cstrong\u003ealways\u003c/strong\u003e fueled back into video creation in the form of purchasing things to play or review. Which is why I\u0027m here. Because I have seriously been contacted three or four times now to put \u003cem\u003eMinecraft\u003c/em\u003e ads in my videos. I do not want to be that guy that takes a sponsorship that he doesn\u0027t believe in and tries to push it onto his audience despite that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo instead of being funded by Youtube and being at their whim, I\u0027m giving the power to you. The power to contribute to and directly affect the quantity and quality of the content I release. Although, I would like to make something very clear. Content will be created, and uploaded regardless of whether or not you decide to fund me. Everyone will receive said content at the exact same time. I will not, nor will I ever create a pay wall, or exclusive content that you need to pay in order to watch. What you would be funding would affect the amount of, the quality of, and the speed at which the content I\u0027m creating is released.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, what are you creating\u003c/span\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGAMES I F*CKING HATE\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\tA video game review series where I talk about bad video games.

A lot of us talk via Steam, or the Youtube comments, and I can genuinely say that you guys make me who I am. I consider you way more than just \"fans.\" There is no DXFan619 without you. This move to Patreon was made because I was comfortable putting this all out in the open and that confidence was instilled in me because of you and all the feedback you give me on a daily basis through various outlets.
