    "summary": "Mr. Fitz is humor therapy for teachers, students, parents ,and anyone who cares about teaching and learning. It keeps teachers going, speaks out against the absurdity of the education reform movement, and examines the weird ups and downs of the teaching life. Mr. Fitz is in ONE newspaper (the Daytona-Beach News-Journal). This newspaper pays me just $5 per strip. Out of that whopping paycheck each month, I buy copies of my copies of my cartoon frames, pencils, erasers, cartooning pens, and other supplies to keep the strip up and running. I also end up using what little is left over to buy things for my classroom. Drawing a comic strip six times a week is almost a second full time job. I love creating it, but additional support would really help me buy my supplies and actually feel like I\u0027m maybe getting some support back for the support I give teachers. You can view the comics at www.mrfitz.com!\u003cbr\u003e"

For 18 years it was in the Daytona Beach News-Journal on weekdays, but in 2018 the strip went to a three-times-a-week format for the web and moved to the DeLand Beacon newspaper. He written two books for teachers through Scholastic Professional Books: \"Writing Extraordinary Essays\" and \"Teaching Students to Make Writing Visual and Vivid,\" both of which include around 100 Mr. Fitz comics. He is also the author of the novels \"Making My Escape,\" and, with his son Christopher, \"Portals\" and \"Portents.\" He is enthusiastic and never bored.",
