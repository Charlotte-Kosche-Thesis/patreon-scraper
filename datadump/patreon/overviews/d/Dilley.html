    "summary": "First off, I want to contribute to other creators on Patreon so I will put at least 5% towards other Patreon creators for starters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you know me because of my affiliation with a particular band or artist I work with let me know which artist and I will put 10% of your donations directly in said artists band account. Hope to raise the tide for all ships.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a life long explorer of music and song craft. I have spent over 25 years working on guitar and that has branched out to an interest in bass, piano, drums, and singing. I have been working as a side person for many Boston based bands for over a decade and feel strongly that I\u0027m overdue to create and share more music on my own terms!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of music that I\u0027ve been sitting on for a while and lots of new music swirling around in my head and heart. I need to record what I\u0027ve got to make room for the new to come into focus. My mental health depends on it. By contributing to me here on Patreon, you are going to help remove the financial roadblocks that have made it quite difficult to produce at a high level of quality, i.e., studio expenses. My song \"Guess I\u0027m Just Born This Way\" (I\u0027ll send you the link to download if you pledge $5 or more) was the result of just one day in the studio which cost me $750 (with a $500 discount). That was only possible thanks to the generosity of a family member who, as much as they would love to, can\u0027t help me like that continuously. I want to imagine being able to spend 10 days in a studio concentrating fully. The place I have in mind to record at will cost me $500 per day, which with some help from all of you should be easy to book!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first project is going to be a singer songwriter thing in which I write and perform. I already have a couple tunes in the can and several demos waiting to get the studio treatment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExample:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/paulzazdilley/rock-it-slow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRock it Slow\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince my musical tastes are varied I will need to work on my jazz guitar record that I have put aside for some time. Samples of that to come soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing children\u0027s tunes and have a dream of sharing them at some point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am brainstorming on idea\u0027s for interactive multimedia instrument and music lessons on a wide array of topics. Contributors will have more say as to what these topics will include =) One topic I\u0027m interested in- Early 20th century guitar!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOjSQ_QIfZo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEarly guitar study by Paul\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp this little dreamer become a BIG TIME DREAMER.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
