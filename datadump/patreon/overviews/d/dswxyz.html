Many of my walkthroughs include both maps and comments. Some walkthroughs go even further, including appendices such as non-player character summaries, object summaries, magic spells summaries, and so on. As I continue making walkthroughs, I discover new content and features to include, such as game summaries, game quotes, and making maps clickable. I want my walkthroughs to be as complete and attractive as I can make them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis content takes time to assemble and format, of course, and unfortunately, I\u0027ve been unemployed for quite some time. It\u0027s difficult to justify so much time on a \"hobby\" that has no demonstrable value to my income support caseworker. I\u0027d like some indication that there really is support for my work and that it does have value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently ask for your patronage on completed walkthroughs for games and stories with as least 15 locations in them; I will not charge for games with smaller geographies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this Patreon is successful, I will offer IF-based content other than walkthroughs as well. And, of course, this will give me greater incentive to continue my other IF-related work supporting ClubFloyd, IFWiki, IFDB, and the XYZZY Awards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, please feel free to browse my publicly-viewable \u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/b/g1xcI0Im\"\u003ewalkthroughs board on Trello\u003c/a\u003e, to see which walkthroughs are currently under production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
