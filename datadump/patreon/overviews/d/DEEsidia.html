This is the first step to expand the content you see now. More parodies, more live action skits, more original animations. And you guys can join DEEsidia on this journey with his friends and loved ones to even greater places!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this and why have you made it? Why hasn\u0027t my dad come back from the store yet?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor so long, people have been asking for ways they can support my creations and show gratitude for the laughs I have given them. Thus comes the birth of my Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may ask, \"Why make a Patreon? Get a job!\" Well, I do have a job thank you (Trainee solicitor/ attourney if you live in the US). And despite the fact that my pure passion for creating drives me, it is a very time consuming, tiring, and very labor-intensive process. Some parodies can be finished within a few days, whilst others can take up to three months to give you the highest quality content. Everything that goes to production (Equipment, actors, software, extra editors, etc.) have been paid out of pocket, and still will. But this Patreon will be an extra helping hand for the people who are kind enough to show their support. With this, it\u0027s possible to expand content from parodies, live action skits, and possibly fund my own orginal short animated series. \u003cbr\u003eThis can also help support me, well... LIVING! I need to eat and drink, so this helps in that department too. And your dad went to the store twelve years ago dude...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I donate? What if I don\u0027t want to? Are you my new dad?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo I\u0027m not your new dad. Ahem! Anyway, as you can tell, I put in 100% effort into my videos. Even the shitposts to keep you guys entertained, the effort is still there (I put way too much effort into The Traps Anthem). There is no way that I can give you a video every week, I wish I could. But a video every month is what I can definitely do. It may be a week late, or maybe two. But I assure you, you will NEVER go over three months without an upload. If you do, expect that I\u0027ve died or something (I\u0027M KIDDING!). On top of myself, I can hire other editors to help out with my projects. So imagine all the content I could give to you in that time. And if you don\u0027t want to donate, that is absolutely fine. You will not be missing out on content, and I would never put anything behind a paywall that deserves to be free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get in return? Can you kiss my mom?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of higher quality videos that I will try my upmost hardest to churn out at a faster rate, you will have the reward tiers on top of that. These are only to start off with. I will try and think of other ways I can show you guys my gratitude. But for now, I hope my 200% effort is enough.\u00a0 Even the minimum donation of $1 is enough to show that you care. See the tiers for more details. Also Patron only streams will be frequent along with my new Podcast The Drunken Dorks. And I\u0027ll assure you that \u003cstrong\u003eeach seasonal anime lineup you will get one parody of an anime from there\u003c/strong\u003e, popular or not. And too late, I\u0027ve already kissed your mom before you saw this post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, I\u0027ve donated, you\u0027ve kissed my mom, and my mom told me to call you dad now. What next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay this is all going way too fast son! O-or daughter. But you are now apart of our journey into greatness! Every last person will be updated frequently on my content and progress of things along with being rewarded their respective tier lists. Everyone is always invited to the Patron streams, but only people who donated to the specific tier will be able to join the call for a few minutes to ask questions personally. Remember, inform yourselves by looking at the tier lists and select the ones you\u0027re interested in. But besides that, thank you for your patronage. Even if you haven\u0027t become a patron, I still thank you for your support that has gotten me to this stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood job son/ daughter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
