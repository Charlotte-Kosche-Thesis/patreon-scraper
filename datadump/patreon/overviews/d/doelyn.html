He passed when I was young.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince her mother worked full-time for a magazine, \u201cI rather freely lived and developed among the expressive bohemian society of New York\u2019s Greenwich Village and all its color.\u201d Here, she cultivated many masteries for the visual arts along with appreciation for \u201ctheater, music, classic and glamorous movies and musicals, both underground and popular, along with humanistic diversity.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI am a gentle, sensual, ethereal spirit, with a subtle assertive edge and a 3-D screen in my head. I have an eclectic passion for designs - textures, colors, fashion, architecture, the elements, beautiful people, positive sensibilities, uplifting morale - the heart and psychology of it all.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoe-Lyn spends as much of her spare time out about making friends and sharing with the artists, avant garde and \"beautiful people\" in and around Hollywood and Los Angeles, CA.  \"I am open to indulge as much of the diversity, cultures, configurations and beauty, as I grew up with, would like to experience and consistently share here and now, and hold in inspired anticipation of what\u0027s next.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the art, her goal is to create an ever evolving variety of pieces that \u201callow for release, reason, retrospect, reminiscent, revitalization, renewal - of/for the Human spirit.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is \u201c...not about what the world tells us we have to see, who we have to be or how we express ourselves, but for each to his own most unique perceptions, perspectives and persuasions.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIn life, I hope to bring my artistic qualities forth, create a secure place for others to feel open, come thru their anguishes, gain insight and realize freedoms in their being.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"As an artist, it runs deep the desire for one\u2019s generosity to be recognized: Taking from life\u2019s lessons, bringing forth the fervor and knowledge to share and uplift all open to being their greater selves. In this quest, I am reaffirmed that this is being accomplished in my realm, and as well for countless others.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoe-Lyn is currently focused on commissions for personal portraits, concept translations, installations and fulfilling exhibits.
