My goal with Patreon is to upload our monthly strategy video calls here, along with how to videos on lobbying your state and local legislators. \u003cbr\u003eThe plan is to crowdsource content also, meaning we\u0027ll try to do interviews here with people who want to structurally change some aspect of the economy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/h3\u003eI feel this is a great way for us to get our message out, and simultaneously a way to fundraise to keep us afloat.  \u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in this project, and want to contribute to essentially being a part of a \"liberation\" movement thru legislation- at least economically, please become a patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWHAT WILL SUPPORT GO TOWARDS?\u003c/h3\u003eEssentially support will go to compensating our time for finding like minded leaders to interview, production, lobbying and organizing efforts. \u003cbr\u003eI will only be monetizing videos that I deem to be of high quality, this will not include short projects, updates, or very basic response videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks In advance for your support. \u00a0 Yes, we need patrons in the form of donations... but what\u0027s most important is you downloading these bills, writing these letters, and making this dream a reality in your state. \u00a0Because, after all, we are here to conquer the world. \u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
