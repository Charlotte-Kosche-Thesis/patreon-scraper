It\u2019s a book of proverbs and lessons written with introspection, as it touches on growth within, the plight of self and self-loathing heartbreak and healing after. This book is very dear to me and I designed the cover, edited the book, and published it myself. It was made after the collapse of my former publisher, as I needed to find a way to get my book finished and without many resources, the challenge would be an uphill climb to achieve my goal of becoming a published author. But I kept on and was finally able to release the book on my own December of 2016. The book was well received by my peers and followers and it was an honor to see so many people show their support for my work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAfter\u003c/strong\u003e the release, I\u0027ve craved to express myself through other mediums of art and found myself falling back in love with creating illustrative works.

My focus is on \u003cstrong\u003eportraiture art\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0so much of my work studies the energy I read from the faces, the works are a blend of realism, caricature and even carries some remnants of anime.
