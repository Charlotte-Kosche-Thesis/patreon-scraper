The group has successfully grown to over 400 registered members and hosts dozens of meetings and events per year including postmortems, workshops, game jams, indie game tournaments, play testing sessions, video game expo booths, and social events. Regular meetings and membership have always been 100% free, and will always stay that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1652/23680353643_54f428a6af_o.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Society of Play would like to expand our activities and are asking you for more resources to help us do just that. All money collected through Patreon (aside from Patreon\u0027s fees) will go entirely into the group by allowing bigger and better events, lowering the cost of event tickets, and helping to pay for website costs and various registration fees and promotional material. We\u0027ve had a fantastic couple of years, and can do even more with your help. \u00a0Even a few dollars a month could go a long way to make the group bigger and better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appreciate your support. Together we can grow the Dallas Society of Play even more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1451/24225233961_4df2657b50_b.jpg\"\u003e"
