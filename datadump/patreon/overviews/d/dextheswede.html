Well, to make it short, Making these videos takes up a lot of my time. Making these videos has already become my full time job but my economy is still in the shitter, and I could use all the help I could get in order to survive in life, as well as improving the quality of my videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of people have been asking me if they can donate to me in some way.\u003cbr\u003eWhy you silly goofs want to donate to me in the first place I don\u0027t know. But I really appreciate the thought!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do I do? Well.

I talk about old games, new games, good games and the horrible spawns of evil themselves.\u003cbr\u003eI analyze the games, I make fun of the games and I make fun of myself.\u003cbr\u003eBasically I tell you the experience I\u0027ve had with a certain game and express it in a comedic and down right stupid way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/a8snh2m1j/Regular.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos are normally around 10 - 16 minutes long and takes up\u003cbr\u003equite a lot of time to make.\u003cbr\u003eI do all the camera work, game recording, scripting and editing, but I make sure that the videos are in top quality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/rm2xvwmhj/Ruff_Banner.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Ruff Retros series is just like the regular episodes.\u003cbr\u003eExcept that they\u0027re shorter and only about NES games!\u003cbr\u003eThese videos are mainly very fast paced where I take a quick look at some of the many classics the NES had to offer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/5a552jaiv/Ruff.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos are normally around 4 - 5 minutes long and kind of serves as extra videos in-between the real stuff.\u003cbr\u003eBut that doesn\u0027t mean that these aren\u0027t as good!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/xa98msbef/CD_Banner.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom time to time I tend to make a few Countdown videos. These are usually TOP 10s regarding a subject, that I\u0027d like to think are countdowns no one else has done before. It can be about something completely ridiculous or perhaps even on a touchy subject matter. But in the end, it\u0027s all good fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/l8dusnx13/Top.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA TOP 10 video is about 10 - 12 minutes long and the making process can also be pretty time consuming if not more.\u003cbr\u003eBut what the heck!
