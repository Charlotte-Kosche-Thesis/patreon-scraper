    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tIf you are reading this, chances are you already know who I am and what I make. But in case you don\u0027t, or just have a lot of time on your hands, allow me to introduce myself! I go by the moniker DarkSorm, primarily on Inkbunny.com. I\u0027m best known for the NSFW 3D work I do in Source Filmmaker using the Sonic the Hedgehog models made by KabalMystic. I\u0027ve been working at it for over a year by now, and its been a wild ride! So, in hopes of evolving this whole thing further, I\u0027ve come here. To Patreon. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhy did I come on to here, you may be asking? Well, I feel this is a good way to push myself to move further, to try harder, and provide better content overall, rather than leaving my motivation to my crippling apathy. This also gives a avenue for people to support me if they so desire! This raises another issue for me, that I\u0027m known for not doing commissions or even requests. I am sticking by this stance for the most part, so no, pledging does not mean I will do a request for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do my patrons receive? Well, donating $1 will earn you my undying gratitude! Well, That and access to the previously unused Hi-Res 720 render files in mp4 format, which will be uploaded after any clip in a separate post! You\u0027ll also get access to any polls I hold on this site! Donating $5 or more gets you access to my new and shiny Discord server! As well as a future suggestion box I will be implementing (once I figure that sh*t out, if you have suggestions for the suggestion box, HALP)! Plus any other rewards I come up with! Got a suggestion for one? PM me and let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is still very much in the \u0027Beta\u0027 phase of things, but for now, let me say THANK YOU to anyone who has seen/favorited/saved my work, messaged me, or just been lurking in the background! You all mean a lot to me, and starting this has changed my life! I\u0027m hoping this will all come together soon, bigger, brighter, and sleeker than ever before! Carry on, you magnificent bastards!\u003c/div\u003e"
