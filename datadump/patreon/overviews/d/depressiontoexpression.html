I am crazy, mentally ill, weird, and a lover of life\u0027s challenges.\u00a0One of my favourite things to do in this world is to create YouTube videos and motivate those suffering from a mental illness. But c\u0027mon, just because life is hard as hell, doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t have some fun together!\u003cbr\u003eI provide tips, tricks, perspectives and strategies all with a hint of humour to get your mind in great shape. Oh, I also wrote an e-book that I give away for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am a firm believer that anyone who suffers from a mental illness holds the strength to manage it successfully and handle any challenge life throws at them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s have some fun!",
