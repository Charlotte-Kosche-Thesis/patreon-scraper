     "about": "Originally a native of New York, my artwork has a fantasy feel to it.  The majority of my creations are RPG related, most specifically D\u0026amp;D.  Of all that I create, cartography is my favorite and I hope my richly detailed maps are evident of it.  Most props found here originated from my own personal creations and are found throughout my home.  All art projects are created in limited runs to keep things from getting stale and to allow more unique one-of-a-kind items. Below is a representation of my work though definitely not all of it.  It is updated regularly but if you are looking for something you don\u2019t see here or in the shop, feel free to \u003ca href=\"http://www.rueink.com/contact/\"\u003emessage me\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e",
