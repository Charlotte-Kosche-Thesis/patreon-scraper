I am not afraid to be myself, and I love what I do and I want to share that way of thinking with the world.  I am a music lover to my very core, and my goal is make as many people smile as I possibly can. This channel is more than music, it\u0027s a way of life! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am boisterous, crazy, goofy and extremely passionate about music....and I need your help! I would love to be able to work on my music full time, and to eventually be able to establish a career in the future as a touring musician, but that\u0027s proven difficult with a tumultuous work schedule and life throwing penalty flags every now and then! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does It Mean To Be a \"Patron\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a Patron of Derrick Jinx, you are supporting individualism, betting on your difference and  being crazy enough to not only chase your dreams, but achieve them. Often the world stereotypes us, generalizes and marginalizes our successes to going to college, having a traditional desk job and working out life away in a systemic fashion......and I\u0027m not with that way of thinking!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do YOU Get For Becoming A Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAside from my undying love and affection, for $1/month you get a MP3 download of every video I\u0027ve posted to Youtube in the past and in the future! I\u0027m super thankful for you even stopping by this channel, and while some other people charge more for the same things I want to keep things as genuine as possible so your contribution means the difference. With more funds I would be able to create more of the videos that you all love, and the ultimate goal is to work on music full time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does Your Money Go And How Much of It Comes to Derrick Jinx?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support goes directly to the creation of more and higher quality music videos, new instruments, recording software and quality recording equipment. I truly cannot continue this work without you! Your support will allow me to keep creating powerful videos as well as begin to expand into other areas of Youtube like vlogging and philosophy. With your support, I can continue to share my passion and the ideas of truly being yourself with the world."
