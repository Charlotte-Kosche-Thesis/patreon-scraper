    "summary": "Hello. I\u0027m Dan. I\u0027m an artist and games developer from Manchester, UK. My work lives\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://danhett.com\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started this Patreon to see if I can part-fund an \u003cstrong\u003eongoing series of experimental videogame/interactive works\u003c/strong\u003e. The works will be intensely personal/autobiographical: documenting and addressing my experiences relating to the Manchester Arena terrorist attack, in which my younger brother Martyn was among the 22 lives lost. There is more context\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/31/manchester-attack-victim-martyn-hett-brother-dan-stop-using-politicise-immigration\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as this ongoing experience of grief and loss, the events exposed me unexpectedly to subsequent wider issues around extremism, radicalisation, the media, and press intrusion. My trajectory as both person and creative, like so many of those involved, has utterly changed - this is what these works are going to deal with and explore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI firmly, firmly believe that this medium holds enormous power to explore difficult, challenging subject matter in a way that other creative forms can not.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreativity is an important outlet me, and that\u0027s partly what this is. Hopefully there is value in this undertaking for others too. The format of this undertaking is hopefully quite simple. \u003cstrong\u003eI will be creating an ongoing series of small, exploratory, unflinchingly honest and challenging games works\u003c/strong\u003e - each no more than a few weeks of design and development in total. This allows me to work quickly, iteratively, and experimentally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/61H5qVO.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe works will be released for free\u003c/strong\u003e, on as many appropriate platforms as possible (web, desktop, mobile), as soon as they\u0027re complete, regardless of whether you\u0027re a supporter or not. Creating these works is for me, and interacting with them is for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor supporters of any level whatsoever, there is a single core benefit: \u003cstrong\u003esupporters get everything\u003c/strong\u003e. During the development of each work, supporters will have access to my \u003cstrong\u003enotes, thoughts, sketches, prototypes, concepts, assets, and code\u003c/strong\u003e. The journey is as valuable as the endpoint for this sort of project, and I believe in working transparently if there\u0027s a wider benefit - whether you\u0027re interested in how my experiences can map onto this medium, or if you just want to see how games are rapidly put together and you want to peek at the code.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/iiUhwcu.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, as this is a highly personal series of works, and I can say with absolute certainty that they will be happening regardless (...somehow). I\u0027m asking for support to make this a little easier if I can, and in return I\u0027m offering complete insight into how this unfolds: creatively, emotionally, and technically if you\u0027re that way inclined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s also worth being clear - if it\u0027s not already obvious from the above, this project hasn\u0027t been initiated for profit. I don\u0027t anticipate or intend for Patreon to become a significant income source. At best, what this might actually buy me is \u003cstrong\u003etime\u003c/strong\u003e: the ability to spend a little less time on client work now and again, focusing on this properly rather than squeezing this in between other projects.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no idea how this will pan out. If you\u0027re with me on this journey:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ethankyou. \u003c/strong\u003eOver and out - for now.\u003cbr\u003e"
