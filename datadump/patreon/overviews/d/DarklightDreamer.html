    "summary": "\"May your Dreams Light your Darkest Hour\" -- these are the words with which I end every single one of the videos that I create. It is this guiding principle that leads me to do what I do every single day, as following this dream has brought so much light and happiness to my life. My name is Raz Khushrenada, also known as Darklight Dreamer, and I\u0027m a 30-year-old Let\u0027s Player on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Let\u0027s Play commentator, it is my dream and desire to entertain, and I strive to make each and every video bring a smile to peoples\u0027 faces. To brighten up their day and make them laugh, as well as take them on a journey through whatever game I\u0027m playing at the time. On top of that, I strive to truly connect with my audience in a way that they feel that watching my videos is akin to spending time with a friend. I want to be a positive force in peoples\u0027 lives, and send them positive messages that help them through their days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why have I turned to Patreon? On the smaller scope of things, while I love making Let\u0027s Play videos, things like camera equipment, new games, computer hardware, etc. cost money, much of which comes directly out of my pocket. Simply put, I believe that Patreon will help alleviate some of the costs of my channel, which helps ease some of the burden when new equipment becomes necessary to continue producing videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the larger scope of things,\u00a0like most entertainers, I currently struggle to find a balance between reaching for my dream, and working a normal job to pay the bills. On top of that, I\u0027d really like to be able to go to College soon, which leaves even less time to do the things that I love. I have a dream that one day, I\u0027ll be able to make a living doing the things that I love, while being able to live a healthier lifestyle. I\u0027ll be able to put everything I have towards entertaining my fans, and give them the quality and quantity of content that they deserve.\u00a0"
