    "summary": "First, THANK YOU. Just for even taking a few minutes out of your life to check out my Patreon page, I can\u0027t begin to tell you how grateful I am. Even if you don\u0027t send a single dollar my way, that\u0027s okay. I am happy to just have you here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh what\u0027s that? You DO want to help me? Right on! Then I probably should tell you about myself a little, and maybe give you an idea of what I\u0027m trying to do here, huh?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere goes nothing:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Derek Vasconi. I\u0027m the former guitar player for the metal band, From a Second Story Window, and currently I\u0027m an entrepreneur, horror author, movie script writer, and lover of Japanese underground idols. I\u0027m also the author of the multiple award winning, best selling Japanese horror novel, KAI, which was released in 2016 to many accolades. For as long as I can remember, I\u0027ve been on a mad rush every single day to produce and create. It\u0027s like I am buying into Terror Management Theory or something. I feel like every second on this earth I need to make count. And you know, I\u0027ve never in my entire life asked anyone for money like this. I didn\u0027t even realize I could. I mean, I\u0027ve always been super independent, save for maybe one very dark period in my life a long time ago, but other than that moment, I\u0027ve been supporting myself with the work I do every single day. Whether it\u0027s working crappy real life jobs, or teaching people what I know about the things I know, or being creative, I have found a way to work on making my dreams come true without depending on somebody to help make those dreams come true.\u003cbr\u003eUntil now.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m at the point where real life has seriously encroached on me and my creative endeavors. And it\u0027s not like I\u0027m poor and hungry and destitute. I\u0027m not any of those things--- Yet! I don\u0027t plan to be in the future either, but basically, I\u0027m hoping to free up time to devote more of my life to being JUST creative, and not so much a person who has to constantly find the next job to pay the bills. I hate living like that, even though there is a certain kind of freedom that goes along with working for yourself. But it\u0027s also like working 80 hours a week for myself to avoid working 40 hours for somebody else. It\u0027s just getting to be too much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I don\u0027t feel entitled, exactly, to being allowed the chance for creative freedom every day. I want to earn it, and have no problem working my oshiri off to really make sure you understand that every penny you throw at me (well, please don\u0027t actually throw any money at me... that sounds like it might hurt!), I\u0027m going to put to good use in the sense that it frees up time for me to do all of the following:\u003cbr\u003e1. Write! This is what takes up the most time for me, creatively speaking. I have seven books I\u0027m currently working on, including a trilogy that might end up being probably six or seven books when all is said and done. It\u0027s about a love story set to the end of the world, and while I know that sounds ultra cliche, I promise you MY take on this idea is anything BUT cliche. Ever hear of Pan Gu and the mythos surrounding it? How about Cryptozoology? Want a main character who had a girlfriend when he was just a little boy who turned out to be imaginary... or was she? Yeah, that\u0027s the primary concept behind this epic tale, which I\u0027m going on several years now of writing and am up to a whopping 2000 pages... and I\u0027m only on book one! There\u0027s over 100 characters in my story, and if I can be so bold as to equate my books to a series that is so amazing, it\u0027s like the modern day Game of Thrones. Think HBO\u0027s next big series in about three more years, assuming I get time to write and finish my story in this life and not the next!\u003cbr\u003e2. Write some MORE! In addition to the aforementioned epic story I\u0027m working on, I have about FOUR other books I want to write, all laid out, researched, and ready to go. Just need the time to focus on them. And since time equals money, well... do the math.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3. Movies! Yours truly is a movie script writer. I have three moviescripts currently finished and one I\u0027m working on, which happens to be an adaptation of KAI. And one of my scripts has actual name talent attached to it as well as a director and movie crew. I just need the money to make it happen. This is a huge investment though, so maybe not something for Patreon? However, maybe at the same time you would be interested in funding a movie? Let\u0027s talk about that one if you do have some kind of desire to see your name as an executive producer on a Hollywood film. I can make that happen!\u003cbr\u003e4. Documentary! I\u0027m in a very rare and special position to shoot a documentary on the underground Tokyo Idol scene. Now, if you don\u0027t know what that is, this is precisely why you should help me make this documentary! I can introduce you to this world that is really one of the happiest and best musical scenes I\u0027ve ever been a part of. And I think I\u0027m now more than just a part, as I\u0027m a person who works directly with idols on a regular basis. I\u0027ve helped Japanese underground idols come to the USA to perform, and I also help out at shows in Tokyo and attend as many idol shows as possible. And because so many Japanese idols now know me, there is a trust there between me and them that would allow me to take a camera into their lives and showcase what the Tokyo idol scene is really all about. There have been so many incorrect documentaries made about idols, as well as blogs and news reports, that all portray the idol universe as something it\u0027s not and something very negative. But my experience has been supremely positive, and I hope to make a documentary to set the story straight, as well as be objective in how I do this. I just need $50,000 to make this happen and I can literally start filming tomorrow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have more dreams, more ideas to pursue, but this is enough for now. I don\u0027t want to get too ambitious. As somebody who has never asked for this kind of help before, I don\u0027t know exactly what I\u0027m supposed to ask from you, other than your patience in reading all of this! However, I do know that I have a lot of creative opportunities to share DIRECTLY with you if you support my vision and what I\u0027m doing as a creative individual. Check out everything I\u0027m offering okay? And if you see something that makes sense to you, then I sincerely hope to show you what I\u0027m doing in exchange for your contribution. And again, THANK YOU. It means so much to me you even care.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
