My name is Dazeant. I\u0027m the studio manager of Kofi Daze Studio, but this is one of my personal projects. I\u0027m twenty one years old and have a passion for making visual novels. My current project, \u003cem\u003eDesservir, \u003c/em\u003eis the first visual novel that I will be attempting to create. You can find more details about it in the \u0027Story time!\u0027 section :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here\u0027s the deal. I work two jobs, so none of this money is going towards my living expenses. Everything is going towards the game! I never really considered doing a Patreon until recently. Last year I was hospitalized, I never really got back on my feet money wise after that bill. All the money I had saved for making this dream come true had to be spent keeping a roof over my head. Now I want to rebuild the game fund! Don\u0027t get me wrong, a good portion of my paychecks also go into buying assets for the game. But if I could get some help it\u0027d mean the world to me! This image below is a concept sketch for one of our royal knights, S\u0027morella Mashiello. The money is going towards these beautiful creations. I can\u0027t draw, so I\u0027m extremely grateful to be working with very amazing artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u507/Chakolati/11preview%20wip_zpstzkgu4yf.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u0027s Story Time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNow I\u0027ll get into the really exciting part. Let me start by saying this, who doesn\u0027t love desserts, and who doesn\u0027t love kingdom girls? A very small few people whose opinions I still respect lol. The MC of this game is transported to a world of candy and desserts, where all of the inhabitants are some type of delicious treat. In this medieval setting, you can expect knights, witches, monsters, royals, the works! Without spoiling too much of the story, the MC is tasked with an important task to rid the world of a plague-like sickness that has all of them withering away!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be faced with tough options during this game, and not every ending is going to be a happy one. Travelling through several different landscapes and interacting with dessert girls of all kinds, I promise to make this a memorable experience for all players.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s a peek at some of our background progression! These are just some of the updates you\u0027d be getting as a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom First Sketches!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u507/Chakolati/LEMMAAA_zpshthae3dy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo Colored Creations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u507/Chakolati/Chocolate_zps9mrlhdxp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for checking out my Patreon :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
