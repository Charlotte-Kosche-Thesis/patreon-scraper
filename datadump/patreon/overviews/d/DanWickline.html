I\u0027ve worked mainly in comics, but have three novels in print and wrote an episode of Metal Hurlant Chronicles. I have so many more ideas that I want to bring to life and want to use Patreon to help reach out to my readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want to do with this page is allow subscribers to follow along as I create new stories. For $1 a month, I will post at a minimum of one new chapter (at least 2,000) words every week that no one else will see until the book is completed. But there will be bonuses as well including some unpublished stories, looks at comic scripts and screenplays. There may even be some special, Lucius Fogg short stories for fans of my current on-going series.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote a big chunk of my first novel live on Twitter so people could see it as it happened. Now, you can follow chapter by chapter... all for just $1 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page will go live officially on February 1st where the title, synopsis and first chapter of the first novel will be released."
