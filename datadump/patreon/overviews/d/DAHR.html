    "summary": "Hello. My name\u2019s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dahr.ru/barbar/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniil Kuzmichev.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e I draw stuff. \u003cbr\u003eDrawing is my profession, and I consider it to be the best one in the world!\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u2019ve been drawing everything. Comics. Cartoons. Illustrations for books and magazines. Worked on animated films from model sheets to frame animation. On videogames. Ventured into the movie business and theatre.\u003cbr\u003eIf someone asks me what didn\u2019t I draw, I\u2019d probably have a hard time answering that.\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dahr.ru/barbar/albums/userpics/10001/patr01_p.png\" style=\"width: 666px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if someone asks me just what exactly do I like to draw, then the list would be a mighty long one indeed!\u003cbr\u003eI like to draw frightening monsters and gorgeous babes, fantastic worlds and just the simplest things around us. I enjoy drawing scary things and fun things (but not so much the sad things). Things that make people think and that help them relax. I also enjoy drawing stuff for kids as well as adult content. I like working on my own projects as well as helping my friends with theirs however I can. \u003cbr\u003eI like to draw pictures with a story behind them. I like drawing something new. And I love sharing what I drew with those around me. \u003cbr\u003eWith such a passion for my work, it seems that I should be living a dream, right? \u003cbr\u003eWell, here\u2019s the thing\u2026 \u003cbr\u003eDespite numerous interesting topics for me to draw, most of the stuff that I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e draw for a living is unbearably boring!\u003cbr\u003eIt goes something like this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dahr.ru/barbar/albums/userpics/10001/patr02_p.png\" style=\"width: 510px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA man with money walks over to me and says \u201cHey, I heard you\u2019re a great artist. I\u2019ll give you some of this cash and you\u2019ll draw me some nice graphs and illustrations for my soul-crushingly dull presentation (or something like that).\u201d\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u2019ll go, like, \u201cHm\u2026 Okay.\u201d\u003cbr\u003eSo I draw them and I draw them good. I fork over the result. I get paid. I spend the money. I throw away all that I\u2019ve just drawn. Because it\u2019s just a beautiful pile of garbage that is of no interest to anyone whatsoever. And somewhere, the very moment that tedious presentation is done, my customer will also be throwing my drawings into the trash, because they are now of no use whatsoever to him as well. \u003cbr\u003eAnd then everything repeats itself.\u003cbr\u003eSo what seems to be the problem, one might ask. Go get your money and forget all about the crap you\u2019ve done for a paycheck. And that\u2019s just what I do. But with every passing day I realize that I\u2019m not just wasting my time on dull commissions like those - I am literally wasting it on drawing nothing! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dahr.ru/barbar/albums/userpics/10001/patr03_p.png\" style=\"width: 668px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s not just that I\u2019m drawing boring useless crap. I am, in fact, NOT drawing anything of interest or any use to me and my viewers. And thoughts like these do nothing to improve my mood, damn it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u2019s the reason why I am here.\u003cbr\u003eIf this system works, maybe it\u2019ll help somewhat raise my chances of telling another boring client something among the lines of \u201cSorry, dude, I\u2019ve got no time to illustrate your report or whatever you\u2019ve got there. I\u2019m freaking busy drawing a naked queen of interstellar pirates, who is riding through space on a steel jet-propelled rhino (or something like that).\u201d\u003cbr\u003eAnd he\u2019ll go, like, \u201cHm\u2026 Okay.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dahr.ru/barbar/albums/userpics/10001/patr04_p.png\" style=\"width: 634px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u2019ll be drawing whatever I want.\u003cbr\u003eAnd, of course, I\u2019ll share it online for all of you to see.\u003cbr\u003eBecause drawings should be created for other people to look at."
