I\u0027m Merritt, and I believe every woman has a dream and that she was uniquely created by our Creator God and given good gifts to use for His glory and her good. But as I looked at my own life and the struggles of the women I knew, I was seeing way more fear, insecurity and comparison than I was seeing a sincere belief in \u003cstrong\u003eWHO \u003c/strong\u003ewe are and \u003cstrong\u003eWHOSE\u003c/strong\u003e we are. That\u0027s why I started \u003cem\u003eThe Devoted Dreamers Podcast\u003c/em\u003e--for Christian women, you and for me--to give us hope, encouragement and a path to follow in order to live out our assignment from Jesus in this life.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThrough interviews on the podcast I share\u00a0powerful stories of women\u00a0stepping into their fears, fighting back insecurity and saying no to comparison so that they can live out their God-given purpose.\u00a0And there\u0027s room for you in this, too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, if you\u0027re a listener--\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e Thank You!!

Thank you for commenting, reviewing, texting, DMing and emailing me to share how you\u0027ve been blessed by hearing from my guests, and thank you for sharing recommendations of the women you most want to hear from.

Thank you!\u003c/strong\u003e We all need cheerleaders, people who remind us that the work we\u0027re doing is important, valuable, needed in the world. This podcast, these conversations, and the hope that women have told me they glean from the guests on the show, \u003cstrong\u003eTHIS is MY God-shaped dream.\u003c/strong\u003e First, that women would know their worth and value in Christ and second that they would, as a result, live out their days making Him more famous.

I\u0027d like to do more face-to-face events, coaching, mastermind groups, etc. but there are only so many hours in the day so, for now, your support will help me continue to spend my time producing the podcast and, hopefully, one day do even more!
