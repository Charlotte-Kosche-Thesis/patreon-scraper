    "summary": "Thank you for supporting creation through my VOICE! \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been wondering, \"How can I keep creating and be SUPPORTED in my service to the world?\"\u003cbr\u003eIs it possible to create purely for the JOY of creation? and allow that \u003cem\u003epurity\u003c/em\u003e to be \u003cstrong\u003einfused\u003c/strong\u003e in the music that I create? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYes.\u003c/strong\u003e Within this format, yes. Absolutely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for saying yes to pure creation\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping my system to RELAX, because in that RELAXATION, relaxing vibrations move through me, and music comes through that holds the vibration that \"All is WELL.\" And this is the music that uplifts humanity one heart at a time. \u003cbr\u003eI bless YOUR GIFT, that it multiples IN YOUR LIFE, that your offerings continue to be uplifted!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much. May you also be supported in sharing your Divine gifts, and may you, too, know that all is well.... (even when it really doesn\u0027t seem to be).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, I completed a successful Kickstarter fundraiser for my first album, \"Home in the Light\", It is beautiful and was a complete success! \u003cbr\u003eJust so you know, I sent out 45 packages to patrons of the album (those who supported the album received a gift, like this model). \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://destinylovemusic.bandcamp.com/album/home-in-the-light\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eListen to Home in the Light here.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn November of 2016, I completed my second album, which was recorded in my home studio, with vocal loops, and beautiful beats, woven together with my medicine songs. It\u0027s called Earth Embodied.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://destinylovemusic.bandcamp.com/album/earth-embodied\"\u003eListen to Earth Embodied here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on three new projects. One is a children\u0027s chapter book, about a girl who hears songs from the wind, and these songs turn her paddle boat into a sail boat that takes her on wonderful, illuminating journeys. I am recording the songs and the book, and it will be a physical book with beautiful artwork, with an accompanying CD of songs and the audiobook of the stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe second project is recording the compilation medicine songs I wrote during a three month travel this winter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd the third project is almost complete! It\u0027s my second online course through Udemy-- The Healing Power of Free-Flow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.udemy.com/embodiedvoice/?couponCode=ITSTIMETOSHINE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u0027s my first Udemy Course: Embody Your Voice.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you SO MUCH for your support! \u003cbr\u003e"
