This is why we need your support. We operate 24 hours a day, 7\ndays a week and it is not uncommon to use a full tank of diesel to attend to a\nrescue, drive to the vets and back to the facility and them back it all up with\nour real jobs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nAre you licensed to care for wildlife ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nYes, here in NSW you need a license to operate as a\nrescue and rehabilitation volunteer. We are licensed, trained and certified\nunder Wildlife Rescue South Coast (\u003ca href=\"http://www.wildlife-rescue.org.au\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.wildlife-rescue.org.au\u003c/a\u003e), one of the volunteer organisation that operates in\nNSW caring for our orphaned and injured native wildlife.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nDon\u0027t you get government funding?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nThat is a very good question, did you know that the\nState and Federal governments in Australia do not provide direct financial\nsupport for the rescue organisations that rescue, rehabilitate and release our\ninjured or orphaned native wildlife. All the costs of Dimmocks Retreat are born\nby Greg and Justine and through donations and gifts from our supporters.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWho are you guys?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nDimmocks Retreat is really two people, Greg and\nJustine. We are both trained in animal rescue and we certified to rehabilitate\nMacropods (Kangaroos and Wallabies) and Possums. We have a good support network of other carers in the are who are always willing and ready to help out when\u00a0required.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nDo you guys have other jobs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nYes, we both have other jobs that pay some of our bills, Justine works full time in a corporate role as\nwell as a landscape and nature photographer here in the Southern\nHighlands (\u003ca href=\"http://www.justinekingphotography.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.justinekingphotography.com\u003c/a\u003e). Greg works as an adventure guide (\u003ca href=\"http://www.myweekendadventures.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.myweekendadventures.com\u003c/a\u003e) and Mountain Bike Mechanic (\u003ca href=\"http://www.bundanoonbikeshop.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.bundanoonbikeshop.com\u003c/a\u003e) as well as running a trail building volunteer\norganisation (\u003ca href=\"http://www.highlandstrails.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.highlandstrails.com.au\u003c/a\u003e) that constructs and maintains a local trail\nnetwork. We work all this into our lives.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat do you do at Dimmocks Retreat?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nWe rescue, rehabilitate and release native animals\nthat are injured, orphaned or require care. Some of our animals only require an\novernight stay, others will stay with us for up to 2 years before we are able\nto release them into their native environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nAre you guys like a zoo or petting display?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nNo, actually we are far from being a zoo or petting\ndisplay. Our focus is on getting the animals healthy and ensuring that they\ndevelop their natural, native instincts. This includes the normal fear of man\nand our domesticated animals like dogs. We don\u0027t allow visitors to our\nfacility, we don\u0027t have our animals on display for pictures and playtime. Other\nthan feeding and caring for the animals we limit our interactions with them as\nthey will be returning to the wild and need to learn how to function as a wild\nanimal.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
