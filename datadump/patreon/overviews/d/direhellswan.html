    "summary": "Hiya! My name\u0027s Elizabeth and I\u0027m a writer. Here you\u0027ll find stories about women (who are often gay and trans) dealing with the strange places they live in (like a nameless city full of witches and vampires) while also kissing their girlfriends during quiet moments. Some of the fiction I write is connected (things like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@elrmills/dead-letter-deirdre-1-80a89870d901\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeirdre\u003c/a\u003e, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@elrmills/gatekeeper-1-8072462fb9b0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egatekeeper\u003c/a\u003e, and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://direhellswanfiction.tumblr.com/post/147241900388/third-shift-15\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003enighthawks\u003c/a\u003e), with a few standalone pieces sprinkled in for flavor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here on Patreon because a) I want earn walking around money by being insufferably gay and b) it\u0027s hard to sell stories about trans lesbians who don\u0027t suffer so some cis dweeb can learn a life lesson. If those are goals you sympathize with, well, I\u0027m here for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for how the Patreon process goes: you set an amount you\u0027d like to give whenever I publish a piece and can set a total limit so I don\u0027t break your bank during a productive month (say you give $10 per chapter and set your limit to $20 - if I end up publishing three pieces that month, you only pay me for the first two.) And again, for the purposes of this project, a \"piece\" consists of a 2000 to 3000 word entry in one of my ongoing stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging, you get access to the stories a few days before everyone else in the form of PDF files that you can download and read at your leisure. Also, if you pledge two bucks or more, you get to read my at-least-once-a-month blog posts about the writing process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far, and stay safe, y\u0027all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Attractions, April 2018\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@elrmills/gatekeeper-1-8072462fb9b0\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGatekeeper\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn a city where magic is real and a witch probably lives next door to you, an apocalypse was stopped. But it left scars behind, tears in reality that threatened to restart the Armageddon that was halted. These rifts were found, sealed, and then guarded by ordinary people who use the borrowed magic of witches to make sure none of the rifts ever open again. They came to be known as gatekeepers, and their long watch ensures that the city still stands\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Sophia, a disabled trans woman whose life was changed by the collateral damage of a witch hunting down a runner from one of the gates. Recruited as a gatekeeper, she\u0027s spent six years on the watch, aided by her dog Lethe, a gigantic white mutt who thinks she\u0027s a lapdog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past four years, Sophia has been in a relationship with a witch named Abigail, who\u0027s responsible for marshaling the gatekeepers and assigning them their duties. Friction between Abigail and other witches has put a strain on them both, and now someone or something has decided that they\u0027re going to separate or die.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of Morgan, a woman who commands a flock of ravens and acts as eyes and ears for the gatekeepers, and the witch responsible for the almost apocalypse, Sophia is going to feed whoever\u0027s interfering with her love life to Lethe.\u003c/div\u003e"
