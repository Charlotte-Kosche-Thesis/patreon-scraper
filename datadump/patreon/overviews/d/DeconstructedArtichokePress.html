She fled Southern California for UC Berkeley, where she earned a degree in architecture and remained in the Bay Area to earn her MFA in creative writing and book arts from California College of the Arts in 2002. In addition to almost winning prizes for her poetry (a runner-up for the Earl Weaver Baseball Writing Prize and a nominee for a Pushcart Prize), her art explores architecture, feminism, and the politics of work through the mixed media of bookmaking, printmaking, and photography. She currently resides in Sacramento, California, with her husband and daughter.",
