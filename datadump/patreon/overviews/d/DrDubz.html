I\u0027ve been applauded numerous times for my entertaining stream demeanor, hyperactive art style and generally being a cool dude (allegedly). I am at the moment pouring effort into my martial arts action comic called \u0027Feral\u0027, of which I am currently working on,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rocketpunchmilitia.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eas well as getting my RPM brand off the ground\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point of this Patreon account is to garner interest and be a bit more varied in my approach to entertaining fans. With guaranteed support, I can start working on scheduling specialised streams for freebies, comic side projects that are dumb AND fun, continueing on serious projects and personal art (that I\u0027ve lacked recently) and even tutorials for people looking to get into dynamic action art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://d.facdn.net/art/drdubz/1482257418/1482257418.drdubz_diskofinal.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t rely on ad revenue and I don\u0027t go through publishers. I am self sufficient, apart from the reliance on you awesome, lovely people. A couple of dollars a month means that I can relax my workload on other projects and concentrate on doing things that are entertaining for all, as well as relieve the stress of bills and all that. Food is nice. I like to not starve and all that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut yeah, thanks in advance if you set aside some hard earned bux to keep me chugging along. Hope you continue to enjoy my art for a long time."

What he DOES supply though is kickass artistic anthro-win and comics, which is aesthetically pleasing and dumb in that 90s action film kind of way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe has degrees in Digital animation and Broadcast media, which he implements into his style that oozes ferocity and eye popping explodey goodness. His current creative endeavor is a surprisingly down to earth martial arts comic called Feral. In his spare time he plays crap games, does capoeira badly, dances like a white guy and practices Jamaican dialect. He also plays harmonica...
