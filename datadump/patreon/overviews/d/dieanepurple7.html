    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHi, I\u0027m Diana - an aspiring artist ready to turn my passion into a profession. Since an early age, I\u0027ve always spent a large amount of my free time either drawing or painting. At the age of 13, I took this a step further and purchased my first drawing tablet and began creating art digitally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I am taking my passion more seriously. After 5 years of running several mildly successful blogs on Tumblr posting personal work, I finally felt comfortable in my skills enough to take commissions for my work. The timing was perfect - I had just moved out to live on my own with my fianc\u00e9 and we needed all the money we could get.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith some assistance from my fianc\u00e9 and about half a year\u2019s work of commissions, I was finally able to upgrade my drawing equipment. I replaced my second drawing tablet, a Wacom Intuous, and my aging PC with a modern Wacom Mobile Studio Pro 13. Ever since upgrading, I\u2019ve been able to create artwork much more efficiently, but there was one downfall\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I had already paid off my very expensive new tablet/PC hybrid and was contributing significantly more to our cost of living than before, I no longer had the time to create drawings for fun. I underpriced myself in order to make commissions as appealing as possible and never closed them, and as a result found myself swamped with work. I always enjoy drawing, but I rarely have the time to draw personal stuff. (And no time for breaks!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I hope to not only earn a few dollars (Even just one dollar really helps, they\u2019re worth a lot here!) but start offering unique bonuses as rewards that I haven\u2019t offered before. The small communities that I\u2019ve found myself in have always been very generous, and I\u2019d like to give back. When I was still practicing on my first tablet, there were experienced artists giving me advice and encouraging me to improve my work. When I began offering commissions, people surprised me by actually paying for my work which not only boosted my pride in my art but helped me upgrade my equipment and pay for much-needed things like food and electricity or the internet bill. With a little extra support, I will finally be able to create process videos/speedpaints and tutorials like I\u2019ve always wanted to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all my patrons, I aim to have a minimum of one reward per week if not more and access to an entire back catalogue of work posted. And for those of you who stumbled across this page who don\u2019t know me: \u003cbr\u003eHello and thanks for reading to get to know a little bit about me!\u003c/div\u003e"
