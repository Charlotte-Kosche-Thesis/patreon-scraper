I make fine art with the goal of bringing a contemporary spin and fresh perspective to historical practices. Then I post videos of the process on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMuch the same way I try to update the past in my work, Patreon updates the concept of artist patronage\u003c/strong\u003e. Back in the (Renaissance) day, wealthy people and organizations would pay for the cost of living and supplies or artists whose work they loved. This enabled the artists to make art without worrying about pesky things like shelter, food, and debt. In return for this, artists would make special work for their patrons in addition to whatever else they were working on. With Patreon, anyone can be a patron by pledging a monthly amount as small as $1 to creators they like. The creators get financial stability and the freedom to make all their projects comfortably. \u003cstrong\u003ePatrons get the glory of contributing to the advancement of the arts, plus cool rewards\u003c/strong\u003e unique to each creator. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m present on Patreon to take advantage of this awesome system. I\u2019ve been obsessed with art and art history for as long as I can remember, and by the time I was a teenager there was really only one thing I cared to pursue as a career. Recent events have given me the time and space to make this dream come true. But unfortunately not the funds. \u003cstrong\u003ePatronage from this website works for me the same way patronage from bankers and the church worked for every Italian artist you\u2019ve ever heard of.\u003c/strong\u003e I worry less about money and more about making the best art I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m so grateful to everyone who has pledged to me. Every penny I get is an incredible help. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you for reading this and pledging!\u003c/strong\u003e"
