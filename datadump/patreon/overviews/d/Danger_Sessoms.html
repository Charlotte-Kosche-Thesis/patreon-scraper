    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Patrick Sessoms and I\u0027m a Giant Geeky Ginger. More importantly, I\u0027m a passionate writer with what could be considered a little too much ambition. Still, they say \"if you love what you do, you\u0027ll never work a day in your life.\" Which is probably why I\u0027ve set up this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my current projects involve a couple of websites that I write blogs/ articles for. Including a movie review site called Stars \u0026amp; Popcorn (www.starsandpopcorn.com) that offers a unique two-tiered grading scale. I actually went to UCF for film, so it makes sense that I would have a geeky movie site. My other current site relates to my love for comic conventions and is called Con-Fu: Social Media (www.confusocialmedia.com). There I put together articles that offer tips, lists, tools, and more for artists, cosplayers, small businesses, and other creatives. It has a strong focus on using social media to their advantage to help grow their businesses, but I branch out from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a comic writer on the side and my current webcomic that you can look at is \u0027Alive Again\u0027 (https://tapas.io/series/Alive-Again). It\u0027s the story of a teenager brought back to life as a zombie and sent to a school for other supernatural monsters to learn how to live with humans. It\u0027s been going strong for over 6 months and there are no plans anytime soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with my webcomic, I have several other projects in various stages of production with artists. Including a second webcomic and a few short comic series. It\u0027s really exciting watching them come along and I can\u0027t wait to share them with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why should you support me on Patreon? Well, ambition isn\u0027t cheap and while I\u0027m managing to keep up with my current workload, I\u0027d love to be able to invest more into my sites, comics, and other projects. If you\u0027ve taken the time to look over my projects and want to see more in the future, then I would love your support. Heck, even a few dollars helps keep my coffee mug full when late night inspiration strikes. Plus, I\u0027d love to reward the people who do support me, so be sure to check out the list of what I offer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by my page and offering your support. I greatly appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
