My name is Russell Tomas and i lead the team at Dreamlords Digital. We are\u00a0an indie development studio primarily focused initially on video game creation. Beyond that though, we\u0027ve always considered ourselves as a creative studio because there are other things that we are creating besides Video Games. These things are concepts, illustrations, digital art, 3D assets and more. \u00a0Normally all of these things are just part of the process of building video games but to us, they more than just that. Each piece is art in itself and we wanted to continue focusing on creating these pieces whether we use them or not for the video game. We love creating art and we wanted to share them to you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dreamlordsdigital.com/patreon/patreon2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes us different from the other artist here on Patreon is that with\u00a0Dreamlords, what you will be following and supporting will be an entire team of artists with various styles and skills. Many of our artists are actually skilled in both 2D art and 3D art and sometimes they just don\u0027t get a chance to showcase their work that isn\u0027t connected to their role. There are almost a dozen of us and between us we will be sharing a wide range of pieces to all of you. The roster of course will continue to evolve and change, meaning specific artist might be here now and may not be there the next month. There will always be a core group that will remain but there will also be those who will bring in new work as well. Whatever the case may be though, what we guarantee you will get is quality artworks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT TO EXPECT FROM OUR PATREON\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we guarantee is to showcase at a minimum of 4 art pieces every month. We do plan however to reach an average of around 8-12 pieces per month when we get the hang of handling the work load. The more we raise from Patreon, the more we can add more pieces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn our Patreon, we will be sharing the following types of content:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dreamlordsdigital.com/patreon/expec.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eFor our Patrons who are following the games we are producing specifically like Graywalkers Purgatory and our future games, we will also be updating here regularly with content.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE WE HERE ON PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWe\u0027re here on Patreon so that we can raise some funds to allow us to put more time on these artistic endeavors. We have several creative projects that are currently in the works that we want them to see the light of day. Also, the guys on the 2D team aren\u0027t as busy on the video game at this point in time so we all want to be more productive with our time doing what we love to do.\u00a0 Lastly, majority of our funds are focused on the game we\u0027re developing so not much is left for other things. By doing this, not only will we be able to put more work on this, we can actually get our artistic projects out there. Some of these projects include a Graywalkers Artbook, a Graywalkers comic book mini-series, and a few other creative ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eREWARDS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dreamlordsdigital.com/patreon/weapons.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your Patron tier, there will be available rewards. You will have your reward become available upon approved billing has been paid an completed. If you get the higher tiers, you will automatically get the rewards at the lower tiers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome clarifications regarding the reward descriptions. When we say you get all the rewards from the above tiers, those with similar rewards but only a difference in number or volume is more like an upgrade rather than added. For example, at Tier 1 you get one (1) free artwork, at Tier 2, you get two (2) instead of 3.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who don\u0027t want to increase in tiers but would simply like to focus on specific reward upgrades, you can contact us directly and request for it and we will accommodate them as best we can. For example, you are at Tier 1 but would like to get ten (10) artworks from the archive, we can do that as a special arrangement or package.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(128, 100, 162); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003ePLEDGE TO OUR PATREON NOW!!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eSo we hope you guys would join us in our journey towards completing our creative passions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dreamlordsdigital.com/patreon/patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to shoot us an email or a message anytime if you have any questions regarding our Patreon or the projects we are working on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
