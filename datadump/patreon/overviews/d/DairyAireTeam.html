The main goal of the game is to run a dairy farm, but not with normal cows. In the\noriginal concept, there are 5 races one can use on the farm: Human,\nElf, Minotaur, Kitsune, and Succubus. Many of these races will need to be\ncaptured from the wild in order to use them. One can milk, breed, train, and\nperform other actions with these races. It is a give and take relationship where each side is providing services for the other. There are more\nfeatures and races to come. This game will be an ongoing project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is currently in pre-alpha. Many things will change\nduring the course of development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be a public free version of the game that will be\na couple of updates behind the version you get for backing our project. \u003ca href=\"https://crappymeatshield.itch.io/dairy-aire\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://crappymeatshield.itch.io/dairy-aire\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeam:\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCrappymeatshield: Original creator of the game, Lead\ndesigner, Lead programmer, and very tired. After graduating college in 2012\nwith a degree in Computer Game development he has been trying to find a way\ninto the gaming field to pursue his passion of making games for a living. After\nsome other projects fell by the wayside, and he could not find a game that fit\nexactly what he wanted to play, he decided to find an artist and make his own.\n(hookers and blackjack coming soon...maybe)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJinxii: Lead Character artist/designer. She is a self taught illustrator.

So the game\nis being developed, but slowly. This is where you come in. Every game has a\ncost of development, whether it is a monetary cost or a cost of time. Right now\nI am using both my own time and money while working a full time job to try to\nmake this game for you. You can help make this game bigger and better. With\nenough of your support we can make this a full time project that you help\ndesign and create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIdeas I have that will only be able to be added to the game\nwith your support:\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSex animations\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBattle animations\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMilking animations\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMore races\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMore fetishes\u003cbr\u003e\n\nProstitution\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd more\u2026"
