In my case, you would be supporting the creation of \u003cstrong\u003emy educational breakdance videos that include tips, drills, combinations and easy to follow step by step movement tutorials.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe this model is a wonderful way to make content creation a long term endeavor that creators can utilize to create valuable content and make a huge impact on the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOK, BUT HOW DOES IT WORK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I try to put out 9-12 tutorials a month for people to learn from on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/darrenrwong\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e. Each video I produce on Youtube is shared here on Patreon and marked as a creation for patrons to support. The number of videos I produce each month determines the amount you will be contributing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**\u003cem\u003eFor Example: When you support at the $1 or more per video level and I publish 8 videos on Youtube for the month of January, You will contribute $8\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"But what if you produce more videos in a month then I can afford to support?\"\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo worries! You can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you enter your payment info. That way you won\u0027t receive a financial surprise at the end of the month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**\u003cem\u003eFor Example: When you support at the $5 or more per video level, you can set your monthly contribution limit to $10, thus supporting only 2 videos for that month even if I produce 8 videos that month. (You will still receive the rewards for the $5 or more per video level)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI SEE NOW! BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH MY MONEY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution, no matter how small or large, allows me to continue to produce my educational breakdance videos for FREE on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/darrenrwong\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube Channel\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating these videos require equipment and resources that unfortunately need money to fund them. Your contribution allows me to focus more on creating and sharing amazing content for you, rather than having to stress about the financial stability of producing these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution will also free up time for me to not only keep creating high-quality videos but also create training courses and take on more students who need more personal attention via private lessons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOUNDS AMAZING! BUT I AM LOW ON FUNDS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo worries! Any amount of support, even $1 per video, goes a long way and makes a huge difference.

SO WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst off, thank you for your interest in supporting me! If I could I would \u0027High 5\u0027 you right now and give you a giant hug.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me and the videos I am creating, be sure to check out the different \u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS\u003c/strong\u003e levels and then click the \"\u003cstrong\u003eBECOME A PATRON\u003c/strong\u003e\" button and well...

He has also been a part of world renowned Hip Hop organizations such as Culture Shock LA and Kaba Modern and spent 4 years on the faculty of the Claire Trevor School School of the Arts at the University of California, Irvine as an adjunct lecturer of Breakin\u0027. He has been sharing his experience and knowledge by teaching and training dancers of all skill levels, from college performing arts programs, dance studios and online students from around the world, how to break with the knowledge that he has been fortunate enough to gain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDarren\u0027s goal is to share what dance has given him in his life by providing in person or online dance courses for up and coming dancers who may be intimidated or self conscious to start dancing or do not have access to experienced teachers or a dance studio with classes that interest them around them. His courses allow both new and experienced dancers from all over the world to have access to an experienced teacher who understands the ins and outs of how to breakdown movements to its simplest form, so a student can confidently learn a movement with correct technique, execute them to music and piece them together to create their own combinations whenever and wherever without having to step foot into a studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe aspires not only to help those in his local dance community, but also dance communities worldwide who may not have direct access to the techniques and knowledge that was shared with him.",
