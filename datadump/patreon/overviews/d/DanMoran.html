    "summary": "Hi everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Dan and I\u0027m making video tutorials! In my videos, we\u0027ll explore techniques to make your Unity games more visually impressive! These aren\u0027t art tutorials though, at least not in the traditional sense. My videos focus more on the technical side of artistry. This means making the most of Shaders, Particles, Animations, and other GPU tricks to beautify your game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike traditional video tutorials that are hour long screen recordings of someone coding, Makin\u0027 Stuff Look Good episodes are information dense, tightly edited, and filled with hundreds of diagrams, animations, and a cast of impromptu characters to add some life to each video. Each episode also provides links to various code and assets used in the video for you to experiment with, learn from, remix, and use in your own games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel is still pretty new and I\u0027m only just learning the ins and outs of YouTube, Patreon, and the world of content creators. Nevertheless, the response so far has been incredibly positive and encouraged me to continue making videos! If you wish to support me in my quest to make videos that are as educational as they are fun, then there\u0027s no better way than to contribute here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is currently to produce a new 10 minute video every once a week, released on Wednesdays. I\u0027ll come up with reward tiers or whatever it is you do on Patreon eventually, but the main reason to become a patron will always be that you want to support the creation of high quality, educational and lighthearted Unity tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my Patreon page! Stay tuned for updates on the future of Patron rewards, a welcome video, and some other fun stuff I\u0027ll put on here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eDan\u003cbr\u003e"
