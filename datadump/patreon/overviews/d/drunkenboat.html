Over the past 15 years we have created 23 issues of \u003cem\u003ecompletely free\u003c/em\u003e, online, brilliant, challenging, innovative art and literature from all around the world. \u003cem\u003eDrunken Boat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is committed to creating a space for language artists and visual artists to experiment, explore, take risks, and create conversation with one another. We are committed to radical aesthetic difference, which especially aims to center the work of marginalized artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to our regularly published sections (poetry, fiction, nonfiction, translation, and comics) we curate special sections focusing on under-represented artists in English; in recent issues these have included Greek poets, Sardinian artists, Romani literature, writing by homeless people, and an ongoing section of translator-focused translations into English.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDrunken Boat\u003c/em\u003e has been awarded a SXSW award, and according to \u003cem\u003eThe Review Review\u003c/em\u003e:  \u201cDrunken Boat is, or should be, central to any discussion of literature online or online literature ... \u003cem\u003eDrunken Boat\u003c/em\u003e is a ... beautifully presented, carefully maintained space.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe at \u003cem\u003eDrunken Boat\u003c/em\u003e believe that marginalized voices deserve to be showcased just as much as privileged ones. However, operational costs for an online publication are a reality, and our biggest expense is currently the software it takes to run the journal and the website.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDrunken Boat\u003c/em\u003e believes firmly in the importance of compensating artists for their work, and we hope that with the support of our patrons we can move toward financial sustainability, which will allow us to compensate our contributors and our editorial staff for their work.\u003cbr\u003e"
