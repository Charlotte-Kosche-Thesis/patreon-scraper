There are not too many latin artists who embrace music the way Diego Jinkus does. Multiinstrumentist, singer, composer, producer, poet, filmmaker and Grammy voting member, Diego Jinkus has mixed Urban Soul Music with rock, funk, pop and brazilian rhythms. He can take you on a journey mixing english, spanish and portuguese.\u003cbr\u003eDiego\u2019s music has taken him to stages from all around the world to places such as New York, Puerto Rico, S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, Bangalore, New Delhi, Mumbai, Dubai and Buenos Aires.\u003cbr\u003eHis new album, \u201cAmor Odio Risa Llanto\u201d has received 3 nominations for the 57th American Grammys, including \u201cBest New Artist\u201d, \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d and \u201cBest Latin Pop/ Alternative Album\u201d and 5 nominations for the 14th Latin Grammy, including \u201cBest New Artist\u201d, \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d, \u201cBest Pop Album\u201d (although Diego insists that his music is more R\u0026amp;B, than Pop), \u201cBest Production\u201d and \u201cBest Engineering\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Diego Jinkus plays upbeat, there is no way for the crow to stand still. When he slows down into a ballad, there\u2019s no way the crowd won\u2019t be touched, moved and inspired.\u003cbr\u003e"
