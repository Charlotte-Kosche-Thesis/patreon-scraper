When the quartet, also members of popular local band Butane Jane, aren\u2019t rehearsing and prepping for a weekend gig or two, Krys can be found playing video games or out and about downtown, usually in search of a new place to eat, given her questionable skills in the kitchen. Second oldest of four sisters, she is fiercely committed to living life on no one\u2019s terms but her own, and Krys guards her independence like a dragon guards its hoard, unwilling to be beholden to anyone for anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSenator Maximilian Kallan\u003c/strong\u003e (\u201cOh, no, please just call me Max,\u201d he chuckles) is second in line to inherit his family business, Kallan\u2019s, the hugely popular, wildly successful chain of department stores - now superstores - founded by his grandfather in 1952. Despite his famous last name and well-known family, he\u2019s made a point of pursuing a life of his own, content to leave the business dealings to his mother and older sister. After eight years serving as a commissioned officer in the Marine Corps, he launched a successful foray into politics in 2010, taking office in January 2011. Keenly aware of his duties to constituents and country, he\u2019s most often found working, running, and studiously avoiding the gossip sites hellbent on breathlessly covering \u201cthe city\u2019s most eligible Senator\u201d and his every move.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur two charming main characters are joined by a colorful supporting cast, and find themselves in a variety of situations and growing closer, despite the difficulties in trying to coordinate two very separate lives. \u00a0Over the course of development of the book, you\u0027ll be privy to Patreon-exclusive ficlets, backstories, Q\u0026amp;As with characters, following the story as it travels from idea to an actual in-your-hands novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your support,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I won\u0027t have to spend all my free time transcribing, leaving me more time to write and to create additional content for you lovely patrons! \u00a0If you find my stories worthy of your support, I\u0027d love to share this slightly nerve-wracking adventure with you. \u00a0\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
