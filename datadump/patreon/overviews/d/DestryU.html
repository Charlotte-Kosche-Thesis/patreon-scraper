That\u0027s how I\u0027ve always introduced myself, because I feel that\u0027s super important about me. I want to make games because they\u0027ve fascinated me since I was little. I thought back then, and still think today, that creating a fictional world is amazing, but creating a world that you can invite others into so they can explore and learn and play is truly worthy of awe. To this day, I still feel games are awesome. As I\u0027ve gotten older and tried to make games, however, the process of game development has been both more rewarding and more difficult than I ever imagined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 My specific interest in game development is the field of design. As a designer, it\u0027s my job to understand, more clearly and vividly than anyone, what the final game must feel and sound and look like. More than that, I also need to have the tools and skills required to make sure that final vision gets realized technically, artistically, and so on. However, I don\u0027t usually have a team to work with, and I\u0027ve never really had any resources to toss around, so I\u0027ve never gotten to focus on \u003cem\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e design. Instead, I\u0027ve had to put many years towards learning how to be an artist, a programmer, a psychologist, a musician, and more. As such, everything you see and hear and feel while looking around these pages and projects is 100% me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Which brings us these pages and projects: where they are, what they are, and what they aspire to be. This website is called Patreon, and Patreon a place where creators can put themselves out on the internet in hopes of finding a supportive audience. For my page specifically, which is where you find yourself (and I do thank for coming here), you can use the big orange button above to become a patron of mine. By doing so, you can choose to send me any amount of money once a month, and you can choose how many months you want to do this for. In return, I can begin to have those resources to use to make bigger and better games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 At the moment, that doesn\u0027t feel like it means much. This is a bit of a new endeavor for me, so I\u0027ve got a blog where you can read up on my progress and see what I\u0027m currently up to. I\u0027ve also got a Dropbox where you can download any prototypes, images, MP3s or other files I think are prevalent. These are the links to those places:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://destryu.squarespace.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Blog\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe Dropbox\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Having said that, if the \u0027where\u0027 is Patreon, and the \u0027what\u0027 is the two links above, then what\u0027s left is what I aspire to make of all this. The answer is that I\u0027ve wanted to make games for a living for as long as I can remember. I want this to be my job. I plan on going until that happens, and after this is my job, I want to make it someone else\u0027s job as well. I want to keep going until I can open a development studio, and then keep going beyond that. So, if you like what you see, if you want to see where this can go, and if you choose to support me in my endeavors, then I owe you all the energy and excitement I have for this. I\u0027ll do my very best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e:Destry\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
