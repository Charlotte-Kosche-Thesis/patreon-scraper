    "summary": "First of all, thank you for stopping by here and showing interest in what we are doing. We are so glad to have you as a fan, and hope you can help support the future of our network.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoctor Stew is a parody web series of the iconic \u0027Doctor Who\u0027 series on BBC. Made by a small group of people from all over the world, we do this in our free time completely for free, and because we love Doctor Who. At this time, our series is completely \"budget free\" which means there has been no money (unless you consider time a currency) passing through our hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis stagnated our production capabilities, as we were unable to get more animators and character modelers to help with production, it fell to one person to be the driving force behind its completion. We realize now that we need to start expanding our horizon, looking for a financial backbone to be able to call upon talents to create these episodes faster, and help keep the content fresh and exciting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re walking into this with 80 dollars, which we just used to pay for a 3d character model of the Doctor. With your help, we can grow and expand this series into multiple episodes, seasons and spin-offs! We have a 12 month strategy in 2018 to help make this more financially viable, we will be relying heavily on our fan base to grease the wheels and get the engine started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this far, and if you can, please become a patreon. Even a dollar will go the extra mile. If you can not donate, we understand, and as always our finished content will be free to watch. Thank you for giving us the chance to be able to create this webseries With your help, I know we can make this dream a reality!\u003cbr\u003e"
