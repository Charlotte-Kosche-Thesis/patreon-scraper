It\u2019s called Scion Linux.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal here as a creator is to deliver content for people who are new to Linux, as well as current users who want to learn more or customize their system. My channel is still fairly new, and while I have a wide array of hardware to run on, they\u0027re getting a little old. This is a good thing since many people switch to Linux to revive older hardware. However, I would like to add some new things to test out software and distros, and I would also like to move to working with a wider range of peripherals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also looking to improve my setup to help make me more productive. Things like a new microphone, a decent camera, and hopefully a dedicated system for video rendering.\u00a0 If you look at my\u00a0channel\u0027s videos, I\u0027ve been steadily increasing my content output, and in just the past 4 months (as of February\u00a02018) I put out 38 videos!\u00a0 This, of course, takes time to plan, record, edit and render.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I would like to set up my own domain to make my software more accessible and make Scion Linux available there. I could then also\u00a0have a good blog and how-to posting system, and be able to run my own repo so that I can easily update Scion software.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a regular guy with a family and full-time job, I\u0027m hoping that some extra support can help me dedicate more time to creating quality content on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e"

This will help speed up the process of recording and editing.  Setting up in my office every time slows me down since my wife and I use it for our jobs as well.  I need to setup a 2nd space, with a desk, better microphone, some sound deadening panels to reduce echo, a mic stand, and some extra equipment for all my computers.  I also need a video capture device and a decent camera.  Having a proper setup will make me more efficient and help me produce higher quality content!  I\u0027ve already upgraded my home network, bought extra screens,\u00a0bought 2 different microphones\u00a0so far, and bought a NAS to store all my ISO\u0027s and video files, all at my expense.  Some community-backed support will really help my channel shine!",
