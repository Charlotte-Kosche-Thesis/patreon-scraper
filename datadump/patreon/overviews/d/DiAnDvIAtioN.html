The crowd back home was tough, but when I moved to the southwest a few years ago, I met some amazing queer folx and magick workers who gave me the space to share my story! In my spare time I began to work on my webcomic\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theindigopath.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIndigo:Sisters\u003c/a\u003e, my first ongoing digital project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://comics.theindigopath.com/indigo/images/IMAGE1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theindigopath.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIndigo: Sisters\u003c/a\u003e has been around about 10 years. My partner and I have scripted it as a movie, short film, novel, and I finally crafted it into this comic! The story follows Angel, who has been having disturbing visions. Things only get worse when her haunted roommate Sam moves in. They have to learn to master their fears and awaken their powers if they want to save Sam\u2019s ghost.\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://comics.theindigopath.com/indigo/images/IMAGE2.jpg\" style=\"width: 215px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s a paranormal thriller full of heartfelt\u00a0magic\u00a0and lots of emotional turns.\u00a0My comic is free to\u00a0read online with no ads and no gimmicks.\u00a0I intend for it to stay that way as long as I can keep making it. \u00a0And that\u0027s where Patreon comes in! \u00a0\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will ensure that I can keep making this comic and others to share completely free. \u00a0For as little as $1 a month you can say, \"Yeah, I want you to keep making comics!\" AND get access to cool Patron Only Bonuses! \u00a0How it works is you pledge whatever amount you want, from a dollar up, and in return I grant access to neat features like digital copies of my sketchbook, sneak peeks at artworks, and even art tutorials. \u00a0As I reach new goals I\u0027ll be able to add bigger, better rewards!
