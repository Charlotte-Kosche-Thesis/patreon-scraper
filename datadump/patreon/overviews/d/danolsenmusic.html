Whichever reason you decided to come here, I\u0027m saying a huge thank you for your curiosity and for all the support you\u0027ve already shown me. Here\u0027s your invite! I hope you\u0027ll enjoy this crazy ride ahead of us as much as I will (or at least half as much!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I spend most of my time doing is writing songs, producing them, releasing them to you, and performing them for you online, at shows and festivals. And last but not least I spend my time communicating with you on instagram, youtube, facebook, twitter etc.. This part - my interaction with you - is something I want to take to a whole new level. That is mainly why I created this page. I\u0027m inviting you to join me here for exclusive access to live online performances, Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s, early access to music and videos and much more. I\u0027ll even write a song for you if you want to go big! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou guys have asked for all of these things, and you can get them right here on this page. You only have to pay a dollar a month (which is the cheapest plan and gives you loads of access). You\u0027ll find all the plans on this page. At the same time of course you will also be supporting me in continuing creating music. It means I\u0027ll have an easier time paying for all the music instruments and tech equipment that I use to create music with - down to the smallest things such as new guitar strings and website hosting fees. If you can\u0027t afford to support me here, no worries at all! I already appreciate your support elsewhere, and you still know where to find me on social media, on online music services or at my shows here in the U.K. and around the world when I\u0027m touring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving said all of this, I would love for you to come closer, take part and for me to get to know you better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to everyone who is already contributing on this site!
