    "summary": "Welcome to the wonderful world of\nDalon! My name is Runa and I will be your guide! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhy make a Patreon? Well, I love to\nwrite. I love to write a lot, and I\u0027ve wanted to make it my job for a\nvery, very long time. The only thing that held me back was that I\ndon\u0027t like to put my material behind pay walls or lock off content\nthat not everyone can enjoy, but I have to eat (and I do love to\neat). I know that there\u0027s literally nothing I can do to stop the copy\nand distribution of my material for free on art sites, so why not\nlean into that and use it as my base philosophy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike the great Neil Gaiman, I believe\nthat one of the best things you can do for an author is share their\nworks, because it\u0027s just as important to the soul of a writer to have\npeople read and enjoy your work as it is to have money. In many ways,\nthe joy felt by readers is as integral to an author\u0027s heart as food\nis to their belly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil recently, I was convinced that\nnobody would pay for my work, and honestly, I would do this free of\ncharge if I could, but that\u0027s just not how the real world works. When\nI opened up commissions, I found quite quickly that people are\nwilling to pay for quality work if the price is right; while good for\nme, that started to put a bit of a drain on me as I was doing what\nothers wanted more than what I wanted. That\u0027s not to say the\ncommissions were bad, I love the people I work with and I have been\nquite fortunate to get a lot of stuff I loved, but this left no room\nfor personal projects or the art for writing trades I\u0027d been doing\nfor years. I want to continue to put time and effort into stuff other\nthan commissions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where my Patreon comes into\nplay. My intention is to continue doing commissions through\nYCH/Collaborations as well as the quickie combos with my frequent\ncollaborator \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/FoxraFluff/\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/FoxraFluff/\u003c/a\u003e\nin order to ensure a steady stream of new content while also taking\nwhatever money I make here to put towards at least a few personal\nprojects per month; size and frequency determined by my overall\nfunding. These personal projects \u2013 since they are not commissions \u2013\ncan also include your characters interacting with mine and others and\ncan be influenced by my patrons! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that this will create a\ncommunity of friends and lovers of literature who will help deepen\nthe world my characters live in, while also funding me well enough to\nexpand my horizons to include more than just smutty short stories. I\nlove erotic fantasy, but I also like building worlds and telling\nstories that people are emotionally invested in, so with luck I\u0027ll be\nable to foster both sides of my passion and share it all with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information about what you can\nexpect as a patron and how the rewards work, click the links below! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/16864427\"\u003eWhat you can expect as a patron\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/16870521\"\u003eHow the rewards work\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/16871475\"\u003eFuture Projects/Goals\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/16874544\"\u003eTerms of Service/Legalese\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you all so very much for your\nconsideration, and remember that no matter what happens I plan on\ncontinuing to post my work on my art sites in the same manner you\u0027ve\ncome to expect from me, with patrons getting a bit extra. With any\nluck, I\u0027ll find myself in a position where I can more freely write\npersonal projects that will include you all in one capacity or\nanother!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
