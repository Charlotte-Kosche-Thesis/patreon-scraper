Here you will get an inside look at the production process for the DreamReal YouTube channel. That is, if you become a patron.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDreamReal is the name of my YouTube channel. \u003c/strong\u003eThis channel makes short films based on strange dreams that people have had. Fans of the channel can send descriptions of their dreams to me, and the best of the best are chosen to become DreamReals. The films are made using 3D animation software and usually run somewhere around three minuets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xco_IWBfqsQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago I released my first video, it managed almost half a million views in a single day and several thousand channel subscriptions. I released two more videos and received a similar response. \u00a0A few of the videos even made it to the top of the front page of Reddit. After my third video my life picked up quite a bit. I was in school and I managed to get a job in my field, which allowed little time for my Youtube Channel. As much as I loved making these videos, I had to make a living.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow with school finished I believe I can finally\u00a0dedicate a legitimate part of my life to DreamReal. I want to attempt to build a successful channel. DreamReal videos are unique to youtube and the concept allows for many different experiences. I believe that this concept will appeal to many people and, with a consistent release schedule, will grow to be very popular. The response my original videos received helps to reinforce these beliefs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s why I am starting this Patreon. The aim is to begin laying the ground work needed to create a fan base around my work. It takes a lot of effort to run a YouTube channel, and im not just talking about the videos. I will have to work hard to make sure I manage this site as well as other social media outlets and my own website. With your help I can afford to spend more time investing in these things, as well as the videos.\u00a0Each video takes a very large amount of effort.\u00a0I currently run this channel alone making the animation as well as the sound effects, voice acting and music. With the funds raised from this Patreon I will be able to focus my efforts and afford the help I need to complete each video. Basically I want to expand my team a bit and increase the time I put into this channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become one of my Patrons then you will be getting in on the ground floor of something that could be great. For a very long time now I have wanted to take DreamReal as far as it can go. I hope you are as excited as I am to see what happens next.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
