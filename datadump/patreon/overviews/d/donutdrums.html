Video game music is an ongoing part of my life. I\u0027m always listening to it and recording it. Since I play, record, and film everything myself it takes a lot of time and equipment to produce my videos. There are many upgrades that would improve the quality of my work. That\u0027s where patrons could help me. For example, I have an acoustic drum set that I\u0027d love to use in my covers but I don\u0027t have the required microphone equipment to record it with. Thank you for checking out my channel. You can cancel and limit your pledge amount anytime. My videos are free to watch. Patreon is a way for me to get support for doing what I love most. Thanks again!!!"
