I love to create.. well, a lot of things actually, but mostly art. My biggest passion is modelling \u0026amp; the ability to do my photo-shoots that are with a little touch of darkness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a couple of things I would like to say. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, thank you so so very much to everyone who supported me \u0026amp; my work so far! Your support is incredible, it means a lot to me, you made me who I am today - the model Darya Goncharova - and I don\u0027t know if I ever will be able to thank you enough!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate everything, thank you for making one of my biggest dreams come true!!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAnd so! \u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page is not created to support my work. It\u0027s about me, personally. I\u0027m going through very tough time (and I don\u0027t want to get into details because you know me, I\u0027m all about positivity n\u0027 stuff ^^ don\u0027t want to bother you with that). So you won\u0027t be financing my photo-shoots, you will just be able to help me out with my difficulties. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount given will be extremely appreciated!! And let me just say - I would never \u0027divide\u0027 my fanbase into two (like, people who support me financially and people who don\u0027t), I will always love you all equally! \u003cbr\u003eAnd since day 1 my photos were available for absolutely everyone, everywhere. And I won\u0027t change that. I want it to be the same. Which means, there will be no tiers for exclusive content (for example behind-the-scenes photos \u0026amp; videos or \"extra stuff\", or anything like that). All the content that I\u0027m about to have is going to be published everywhere, for free, just like it was so far. \u003cbr\u003eI just don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair my supporters to pay for a content that I either way would post online, content that I would love to share with all of you. Or even - content that I either way will create, because once again - I don\u0027t need funding for my photo-shoots. My photo-shoots are something that I\u0027m doing just because there\u0027s nothing else that I can do \u0026amp; I just don\u0027t want to waste this time, I\u0027m \u0027trapped\u0027 with problems related to my ID card \u0026amp; my legalization here, in Bulgaria (I\u0027m an immigrant here). That\u0027s why I\u0027m creating my art, instead of doing nothing. Also because I love it, of course. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I would love to give you something in return for your help, but for now there\u0027s nothing much that I could give..\u003cbr\u003eLater on I\u0027m planning to include stuff like posters (a lot of you guys have been asking me for this! ^^) but first I need to figure out some things. Also a Skype conversation with you sounds fun, but at this moment I\u0027m very vey busy (I can barely have any sleep) so I guess this will be available a little bit later as well. Although, if you need HQ files of my photos - let me know! ^^ I would gladly send you these, just leave me a message during pledge checkout! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, stay tuned for that \u0026amp; more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you once again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch, much love, \u003cbr\u003eDarya \u003cbr\u003e"
