    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/byfansforfans.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDread Central has always been a family endeavor. We\u0027re a mom and pop shop to the greatest extent. We\u0027ve made it 10 years with absolutely no help from anyone. No parent company. Nobody watching our backs. It\u0027s with a great deal of humility that we say we think we\u0027ve become a cornerstone within the genre. And that\u0027s because of you guys. It\u0027s you, the talented creators out there, the readers, and the close friends who have lifted us up when we were down, who have allowed us to do what we do for this long; and words cannot describe how grateful we are to each and every one of you. We will never forget this time... these past few years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said... we know this news that Dread Central needs your patronage may be a shock to you. Hell, it\u0027s a shock to us.\u00a0Unfortunately, after dealing with a perfect storm of sorts where everything has either changed abruptly or just not gone our way, we find ourselves still standing, but on our last legs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZtMYpYRcqY\" width=\"853\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though our site is doing great traffic-wise, advertising dollars are shrinking more and more every month. These changes are largely beyond our control and have hit the entire online publishing industry hard. Quietly many sites have been absorbed into parent companies, filed for bankruptcy, or have closed for good. Even sites that get 10x our traffic have felt the squeeze, laying off writers or in some cases turning to crowdsourced content and paying far below industry standards for articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the tipping point. Ad-supported websites are on the way out. We have staved this off for as long as possible. We are tired of running click-bait stories, of making multi-page galleries, of having to put revenue concerns ahead of the user experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/stronger.gif\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are hoping that moving to a reader-supported model will allow us to bring fans and filmmakers the kind of site they deserve. And allow us to continue to grow the site and create original content that celebrates the genre we all have come to love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a scary prospect. People may not be ready for this. Everyone is used to things being free on the internet, but few realize how much time and money goes into running a website. With mounting costs and an ever-increasing demand for original, in-depth content, being shackled to an ad-supported model that is offering publishers less and less is not a sustainable plan anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will allow us to reward our friends and readers who support our site. Those who choose to support Dread Central on a monthly basis can contribute as little as $1 a month and be rewarded and recognized for their contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dollargoeslong.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve launched this Patreon initiative, which will let our patrons get Dread Central ad-free with no click-bait for just $1 a month / $12 a year. We don\u0027t want  to sell out to a company, but rather to the fans and the industry itself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day we remain hopeful that we can actually come together and make this work.\u00a0We don\u0027t know where our future lies, but we do know what we\u0027d like to be doing now, and that\u0027s bringing you all the content you want - THE WAY THAT YOU WANT IT.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love you guys, and we mean that. It\u0027s been a hell of a ride and we hope it continues. This is new territory for us and everyone. But that\u0027s what we do... we get back up and we keep fighting. One way or another. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much, so very much for your time and consideration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
