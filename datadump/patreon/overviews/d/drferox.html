    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome Vetlings!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis is the Patreon for the \u003ca href=\"http://drferox.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDr Ferox blog on Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Dr Ferox blog discusses a myriad of veterinary topics, particularly about what it\u0027s like \u003cem\u003ebeing \u003c/em\u003ea veterinarian, as well as vet clinic stories and regularly applying veterinary knowledge to fantasy scenarios.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWriting the blog takes a lot of time, especially when a can of worms is inadvertently opened. If the blog can earn an income, that means I wont have to work the insane clinic schedules I often do, and can spend more time writing instead. That means more blog posts for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing, and I love the community that has steadily built up around the Dr Ferox blog. I\u0027m very privileged to be part of a community on Tumblr and I\u0027ve grown very fond (and protective) of my little Vetlings, whether they are students, nurses, assistants, techs, hopefuls or veterinarians. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work full time days in general practice, and casual nights or weekends in an emergency clinic. I enjoy both, usually, but there\u0027s no denying that\u0027s a lot of hours spent in the clinics to keep my household afloat. There\u0027s no denying that I\u0027m burning out a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll never completely give up working in clinics, but your support to help me work less and write more is hugely appreciated. That means more content for you, and less sore feet for me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service allowing you to make a small monthly donation to support my blog. Even $1 is appreciated and goes towards letting me spend a day or two each month out of clinics, and writing instead. You can choose to donate at any tier, and you can change your donation amount from one month to the next. For example, you may chose to sponsor a blog topic one month, then drop down to a Vetling level for the rest of the year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is also a way for me to learn what you, as readers, want to see more of. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will have access to \u0027Sneak Peeks\u0027 for certain original posts, namely the Fantasy Biology series and any Vet Stories. I am aiming to have two of each sort posted per month, so that\u0027s four early access posts for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your encouragment and support. \u003cbr\u003e"
