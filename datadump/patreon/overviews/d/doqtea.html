My names Red, and I make a living doing art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been doing art since I was 12, and I realized when I was 14 that I really wanted to make a career with it. But seeing as I\u0027m only 17 now, and I live in such a small town, it\u0027s hard to find a good job these days. I don\u0027t want to do something that causes me stress, I just want to do what I want to do, y\u0027know?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do I even do anyway?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI do digital art! I\u0027ve been doing it for a solid year now, and I must say, it\u0027s extremely fun. I also do animatics. Basically just storyboarding animation. I have yet to create a fully done animation, but I have a few ideas on a few I want to do. And finally, I have a plan for a comic/possible animated series (?)\u00a0in the near future, \"Sleep Deprived\", about how two of my original characters, Ross and Emerald (you might\u00a0know her as Weeb)\u00a0met each other. It\u0027ll be a strange romance thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is sort of just something to put money in my pocket until I can afford to get a real job doing art. As \u003cem\u003efun\u003c/em\u003e as working in a resturaunt sounds, I think doing something I\u0027m really passionate about will make me a bit happier in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by my page, and if you chose to donate, thank you so much for supporting me in doing what I enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat tools do I use, you ask? Well..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDigital: \u003c/strong\u003eThe software I use to create my digital pieces is Paint Tool Sai, and the tablet I use to draw with is a Monoprice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTraditional: \u003c/strong\u003eFor my traditional pieces, I\u0027m often seen using Sailor Fude Nagomi Brush Pen - Ryofuka Model - Double Sided Fine/Medium. I use\u00a0Artist Loft watercolors\u00a0for my watercolor pieces and my markers are either Copics, highlighters, Crayola. (I use a lot of Crayola, save me.)\u003cbr\u003e"
