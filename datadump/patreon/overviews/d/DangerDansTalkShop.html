    "summary": "Video credit to \"Chemical Randy\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Podcast? What the fuck is a podcast?\"-me a few years ago. I first heard\n of podcast after seeing multiple short videos of comedians randomly \ntalking about funny shit with headphones on in front of microphones. I \nnever really looked into it but knew they existed. Up until a couple of \nyears ago I was way too distracted to care. Before I started the show, \nplaying music(sex drugs and rock n roll) was the driving force in my \nlife. Riding motorcycles came second to music but drugs and booze \nsometimes came before the music. My first legitimate road bike was a \nGS750-800???? or some shit? I say legitimate as though it was \nregistered, insured, or was being driven by someone with a license but \nit wasn\u0027t.  Not sure if it was being able to/needing to run from the law\n or just having my kneeze in the breeze. Riding that thing to band \npractice catching a buzz and riding threw the night well, it fucking \nchanged me. I ended up trading that bike for a bag of drugs and a pistol\n and then got my first chopper. A 70\u0027s Triumph Trident sitting in a hard\n tail frame I got for cleaning out a storage unit. Although I never got \nit all buttoned up before the motor was stolen right out of my shop, and\n prob just turned into scrap for dope money. After then I went a few \nyears pursuing drugs, music, and booze. Then one night with head full of\n acid I met my wife. We conspired for a few years on how we were going \nto take over the world but we needed help so we decided to have a kid. \nNow I didn\u0027t have any money at the time so while my wife was pregnant I \nleft town and took a job in Wyoming drilling for uranium so I could make\n some quick cash. But when I got back with all that money(more than I \nhad ever had to my name) the fact that I was fixing to have a kid set in\n hard. I knew I was gonna have to teach him by example so I took all the\n money I had saved up and spent every last dime on a 2007 Heritage \nClassic cause I didn\u0027t want to look like a pussy without a motorcycle in\n front of my kid. Best thing I ever did. Having a couple boys and \nmeeting my wife are right up there as well. I soon started a company \nwith my dad in real estate which gave me time to play music on the \nweekend and go on tour for few months of the year where I\u0027d strap my \nguitar and skateboard to the soft tail and loose myself. Touring with a \nband should always be done by motorcycle when possible. Not exactly sure\n how I was able to make it around without getting thrown in jail but \nseems as though as long as I\u0027m not in Texas my chances are good. But \nafter my last run in with the law and almost certain death to me and the\n other party I decided to kick the booze for good. Now besides an \noccasional run in with DMT I have been clean for about 18 months. After \nhaving child number two and the sober life I traded my twinkie in for a \nshovel and have been trading up ever since. Now that I have been \nspending more time working in my shop I started listening to these new \nfangled Podcast. Hearing Joe Rogan has multiple skeptical guests on his \nshow that end up really enjoying the experience. He would always tell \nthem \"You should start your own podcast\". and well I heard that one too \nmany times. Now between music, skating, and riding bikes I have met some\n really cool characters over the years and I always enjoy talking to \nthem and could see how a mess of other people might enjoy hearing me \ntalk to them as well, so I started the TalkShop.  The TalkShop is an \nexcuse to get people to talk to me who may not have without me having a \nshow and some are just friends that I haven\u0027t talked with in some time. \nThese people are interesting and motivational. Some are into bikes and \nsome have never been on two wheels but they all mean something to me. \n1-2 episodes a week maybe more or maybe less. Damn near guarantee every \nWednesday there will be a new one out. Contact me at \nDan@DangerDansTalkShop and find the show on iTunes or Stitcher Radio \nApp. Less Lip More Hip.\u003cbr\u003e"
