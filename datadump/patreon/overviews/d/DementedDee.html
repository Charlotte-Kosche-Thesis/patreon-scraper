Thank you so much for being here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Dee - a catch-all nickname because I write romance, horror, fantasy, weird fiction, and humor under two names: Allison Rogers (horror, fantasy, weird fiction, humor) and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kelly-Wyre/e/B00IURAYJM\"\u003eKelly Wyre\u003c/a\u003e (romance, niche genre fiction). I have been published under both of those names; one series is in its second release via LT3 Press (coming soon! Stay tuned for updates!). I also have been known to write fanfiction under the name\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/Darkprism\"\u003eDarkprism\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://demented-dee.livejournal.com/\"\u003eDemented Dee\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use all the names to categorize my head and the plotlines, else they take over and I am rendered immobilized by intensely demanding characters. And pretty pictures. I am extremely susceptible to the Shiny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not writing, I like read, watch movies, travel, and - more germane to you! -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP732llZpxt6YAD4-9-pwww\"\u003emake videos about books\u003c/a\u003e. I do book hauls, readings, reviews, and also have open discussion about my life and times. I\u0027d also like to feature artists - of the writerly variety or otherwise - that\u0027s in the works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a life-long sufferer of anxiety, so you\u0027ll probably hear about whatever it is I\u0027m doing to cope with that currently. Also, it seems to be my fate to fall into some supremely interesting life circumstances, (Shamanic Journeying seminars, trips to Spiritualist camp, Chinese Acupuncture, Ghost encounters... some parts of my life are more interesting than others), so you\u0027ll probably hear about those, too. Inasmuch as I can tell and protect the not-so-innocent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a work-a-holic, and this is good news for you! I will update frequently. I plan on posting a free stories, teasers, general updates, Patron-only stories and novels, videos, and otherwise offer a host of goodies, some of which I hope you\u0027ll like. If not - if this isn\u0027t your bag - no worries, nice to see you, and please pick up your complimentary cookie on your way out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this does sound entertaining, then welcome! Enjoy the Introduction to Me video, the virtual baked goods, and the creative stuffs. I\u0027m so glad you stopped by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLight \u0026amp; love to you and yours,\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3 Dee\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.demented-ink.com/smoke-signals\"\u003eGet in Touch!
