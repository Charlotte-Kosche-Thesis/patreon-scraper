We wish to take you on journeys to distant places where the mind is free to wander. And in our wanderings together perhaps we will journey to places deep inside, to those mysterious spaces that bind us all. For it is from these mysterious spaces that our music stems, and also our meager talents, or what you may call gifts...and these gifts we share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo live with a heart full of love and beauty, and to find expression for this in simple acts like a kind word or deed, or an honest smile, we believe fills the world with beauty. And so, the music we make is part of our expression of love and beauty. We believe that sound can heal, and it is our highest aspiration to create music that brings healing, and so with humble hearts we kindly ask for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour participation and support is deeply appreciated and gratefully received and we do hope indeed that you enjoy our work and the journeys with us.\u003cbr\u003eLet us be beautiful together and let us love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore about Driftwinds\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are an acoustic music duo based in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa. Mekhala sings and plays guitar, with Miila on the clarinet who also sings and plays guitar. We both play percussion as well. We have been playing together for nearly two years now, slowly developing our sound, tunes, feeling..\u003cbr\u003ePlease find some of our original songs on Soundcloud:\u003cbr\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/driftwinds\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMekhala has been a self taught visual artist for 16 years and 6 years ago decided to teach himself to play the guitar. He sang in public for the first time 2 years ago. There are many musicians in his family, and up until 2 years ago Mekhala never believed he would be a musician too, neither did any of his family members...but there you go!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMiila is a naturalist, activist and a bit of an artist too, and has also always had animals and music in her life. She learnt clarinet the classical way, and has only recently been experimenting more with this instrument, as well as the guitar and vocals. Busking was how she eventually learnt about performing, and Driftwinds still continue this practise as well as performing gigs and playing at events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor both of us, the musical journey has been intricately linked with all other parts of the Journey in Life. So the stories and songs sprout from the experiences along the way... and the music is shared with the world through the performances as well as CDs - we have just finalized our first one!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page, you can support our music by becoming a Patron. Support is given on a monthly basis and you can choose how much you give. In return of supporting our work you receive Rewards, see them on the right hand side, and can follow our posts and developments on this site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe welcome you here with keen hearts. It is a great honor and pleasure to continue the music making and journey, and we are delighted to share it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Any support we get will enable us to better devote time for our music. First thing, we are just publishing our first ever CD and your support will help us get these works finished and shared with the world.",

     "description": "With the support of all you amazing people we are able to consider upgrading our equipment and instruments. Mekhala would love to expand to another instrument, first choice being a mandolin or a banjo.. to accompany his powerful little guitar! Miila would love to learn a new instrument that would allow her to sing as well as create melodies.. a cello or violin:) Having more support for our work we would keenly look into investing in these new instruments. Also perhaps a new djembe drum with a deeper sound.. dreaming away!\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "With this or more support monthly we would without doubt put money aside to invest in a vehicle. A small bakkie, combi, car.. Our bicycles are invaluable and irreplaceable. Loyal companions, great way to get exercise, no pollution and no sitting in the traffic.. and they have taken us to gigs, markets, and to endless explorations of the beautiful country side. However, 4 wheels would just enable us to upgrade our musical travels and journeys. We would be more self-sufficient in taking our music to places. And of course, it would make it easier to obtain art supplies for Mekhala, as well as for Miila to carry out her community\u0026amp;environment work. A vehicle - something that we\u0027re slowly working towards and something that your pledge may help achieve.",
