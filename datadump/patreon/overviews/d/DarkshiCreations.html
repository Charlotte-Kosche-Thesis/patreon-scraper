My muse never shuts up! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI develop new ideas and concepts every 10 minutes and want desperately to shoot all of these things. \u00a0Sadly, not all of my clients are as game or out there as I am. \u00a0I\u0027m hoping with your help, I can bring at least a few of these concepts and ideas for Cosplay, Conceptual and Contemporary sessions to be recreated from my mind to real life and to your screen or even to be hung in your own home. \u00a0Because in this day and age of Adulting. \u00a0We need more imagination and fantasy to grace this world of gray.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work with 32 unique models and cosplayers over the course of a year to bring many of these ideas and projects to life. \u00a0They are known as Darkshi\u0027s Angels. \u00a0Many of our works need to bring in other team members, new wardrobe to be crafted or acquired and even the cost of permits and venues are needed throughout the year. \u00a0We hope that you will support more than just my work, but their creativity and work as well. \u00a0All of our funds will be driven towards gear maintenance, new gear for unique situations [underwater photography, video, ect], the cost of bringing in hair and makeup teams as well as the permit costs for some of the best locations imaginable. \u00a0Oh, and maybe a road trip or two each year. \u00a0Help us shut up my muse, and cater to their own by donating at least $1 a month. \u00a0And for those that support more, you\u0027ll be gifted many great things!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Based in South Mobile, AL, I work out of a small home studio. With cosplayers and some amazingly creative people being my key to working in my field, I hope to expand into something more. My ultimate goal is to showcase cosplayers of every talent, bring every God and Goddess to life and to showcase dancers in unique scenes from everyday life but keeping to the dreamscape we all have been forgetting since becoming adults. \u003cbr\u003eI am a firm believer that Adulting is the worst. But, with my passion as a photographer, I want to help other forget this bit of reality and escape into the Personas they and others don while cosplaying and bringing the myths and legends of the past to life. With your help, I hope to do just that. And if I can help others in their own journey of similar nature. Even better!",
