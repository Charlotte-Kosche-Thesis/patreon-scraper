Writing fiction has been a secret dream of mine for a while. However, between school and work, that dream seemed impossible to squeeze in. I have a bit more time on my hands nowadays and I decided to finally put my nerdy interests to work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been in love with the growing \"LitRPG\" genre for a few years and have devoured nearly every book and story that has been published in this genre so far. I cut my teeth on Ready Player One and Caverns and Creatures. I\u0027ve also branched into anime/manga. Sword Art Online and Log Horizon are probably my favorites. After running out of reading material, I decided to finally try my hand at writing and publishing my own story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the first book of what I anticipate will be a series. Hopefully you will enjoy it!",
