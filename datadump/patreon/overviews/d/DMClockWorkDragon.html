I have been DM-ing for about 8 years now, and Every campaign I\u0027ve ever run has been steeped in handmade homebrew content. Earlier this year, I started publishing some of this content online, Starting with My Chronomancer Class and somehow despite myself, I seem to have earned a small following.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the content I produce is designed for D\u0026amp;D 5e and meticulously playtested to the joy or terror of my players and more. I\u0027ve done monsters, Items, Races, And of course my Homebrew Classes. I even have a full campaign Setting In the works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut none of that would be possible without the support of you guys. Even before patreon, I\u0027ve relied on the good graces of my fans to help give inspire me and of course to play-test my work. This patreon isn\u0027t my way of trying to cash in - The reason I\u0027m here is for you, through this patreon, I\u0027m hoping to help make you guys a bigger part of what I do, and maybe give you the opportunity to support what I do in a way that means a lot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
