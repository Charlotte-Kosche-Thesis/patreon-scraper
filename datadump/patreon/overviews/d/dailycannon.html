Then read on...\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve tried various ways of funding the Daily Cannon so\nI can pay writers and podcasters properly, including going down the transfer\nnonsense/lots of clicks route as you probably noticed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ended up hating everything about it and driving\naway readers who have been with the site since it began in 2008 as\nLadyArse. It was so far from my original idea - championing unheard voices and fighting against social injustices across football, all while bringing a critical, sarcastic and blunt eye to the workings of Arsenal Football Club - that I\u0027d almost forgotten why I spent so much time working on the site in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019d like to get involved with something that really matters - producing content that resonates rather than makes you roll your eyes - then I\u0027d love it if you could join us on our journey. Here you will get exclusive content created\njust for you and a platform to offer your input, feedback, guidance and suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery penny will go towards running the site and paying those who do all the work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour involvement will mean under-reported issues that make a real difference in the real world will have a chance of reaching a wider audience, allowing us the time needed to dig into complex issues to help bring them to light in a way that is accessible to everybody.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing our platform to improve the lives and rights of women, the LGBTQ+ community and other minorities is a goal at the heart of Daily Cannon and I\u0027d also love to be able to remove ads from the site to improve the experience there for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eJoin Lee Hurley and\nthe Daily Cannon team on their mission by becoming a patron and who knows where this journey will take us...\u003cbr\u003e"
