    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey there, I\u2019m Mariko.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019m a video blogger,\nmusician, artist, writer\u2026 anything that catches my fancy, I\u2019ll have a go at it,\nand anything that\u2019s on my mind, I\u2019ll express it! But I\u2019ve also got long-term\ndepression, which makes it incredibly hard for me to stay motivated. And that\u2019s\nwhere you come in! The fact that so many people are even interested in me, my\nlife, what I have to say, and what I do\u2026 YOU are why I stay alive. I have no\nreason to be here otherwise. So, on whatever platform you follow me, thank you\nso much!! \u2665\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is this Patreon\nthing then?\u003c/strong\u003e\nIn a nutshell, it\u2019s a way for people to financially support the creators that\nthey love. By subscribing to my Patreon for a small amount each month, you help\nme out a lot, because then I can more easily afford to make the things that I\ndo. In return, you get access to patron-only content! In the past, this has\nincluded song demos, hi-res modelling photos, behind-the-scenes exclusives, and\nearly access to things I make. And I\u2019m always thinking about what other extras\nI can give to you! Have a suggestion about possible rewards? Please let me\nknow!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd Patreon is helpful to me\nin other ways as well.\u003c/strong\u003e The fact that I know my patrons are subscribed on a monthly basis\ngives me a much greater impetus to keep on creating, even when I\u2019m feeling my\nworst. The last thing I\u2019d ever want to do is let you down! So because of my\npatrons on Patreon, I find that I\u2019m now much more interested in continuing to\ncreate, whereas in the past I would\u2019ve just wasted my day playing Civilization:\nBeyond Earth or Stardew Valley to escape from the thoughts in my head. So not\nonly are you the reason I stay alive, you are now also the reason I keep on\ncreating!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWould you like to subscribe?\u003c/strong\u003e Have a look on the right\nside of the page! There you can see my reward tiers - currently only $1 per\nmonth for access to everything! If you click \u201cGet Reward\u201d, you can then type in\n$1 or higher as your monthly pledge, and sign up to get instant access to all\nthe patron exclusives that I\u2019ve posted so far! You\u2019ll then have ongoing access\nto all my new content for as long as you stay subscribed. Thank you so much,\nyou\u2019re awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut what if you can\u2019t afford\nit just now?\u003c/strong\u003e\nThat\u2019s okay! While Patreon is the best way to financially support me (as\nopposed to sitting through ads, for example), it\u2019s not the only type of support\nyou can give! Just the fact that you\u2019re watching my videos, or viewing my art,\nor listening to my music is fantastic! Every time you click \u201clike\u201d or thumbs\nup, every comment you leave me, every time you share my stuff, it\u2019s ALL amazing\nand really does help! And you can rest assured that even though I do have\npatron exclusives, I will always be making public content as well, available on\nthe various platforms that I use. In fact, you\u2019ll also find a lot of public\nposts here on Patreon too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to find my content? \u003c/strong\u003eWhile I do use Patreon a lot\nlike a blog, I don\u2019t always post everything here. If you\u2019d like to keep up with\nmy posts on a particular platform, please be sure to follow me there!

     "description": "Now we\u0027re talking! In my previous two goals, I was focusing on art materials and tools that were mainly in traditional mediums, but if we make it to this goal, I\u0027ll also start being able to improve my electronic gear! I\u0027ve had a couple of good microphones on my wishlist for aaages, and a lot of my software is going badly out of date. I\u0027ve been stretching my current resources for as long as I can, but you\u0027ll finally be setting me free! Reaching this goal will have the biggest impact on my music, but could also help with my digital art as well, and I can\u0027t thank you enough!",

This is the level of support at which I\u0027ll no longer feel so anxious about my financial position, and I\u0027ll really be able to put my whole life into my art and get some bigger and more complicated projects moving. It\u0027s not exactly self-sufficiency, but it is enough that it\u0027ll take a huge weight off my mental health. You\u0027re not just improving my art at this point, you\u0027re improving my entire life! \u2665\u2665\u2665",

The day this comes to pass, we\u0027ve gotta do something special to celebrate, because I need to thank you for all the support you\u0027ve shown me over the years. There\u0027s just no way I could ever make it this far without you. And it\u0027s not just the financial contributions either - the most important thing is that you believed in me and my art, pushing me to keep doing my best even when life looked its darkest. There\u0027d be little point in me being a creator if there wasn\u0027t someone like you to appreciate the creation, so from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you. I don\u0027t know what kind of celebration we\u0027ll have yet, but when the time comes, let\u0027s go all out and party!!! \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u003cbr\u003e",
