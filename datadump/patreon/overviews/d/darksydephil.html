Overall Patreon has allowed me to do things I never would have even thought of by myself, and my content has gotten all the better for it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for your pledge, I will provide \u003cstrong\u003epremium perks \u003c/strong\u003eto those who choose to be ongoing Patrons of my work.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll be keeping the most popular donations levels LOW \u003c/strong\u003eso that as many people as possible can be a part of the Patreon experience!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU for the NOW TEN YEARS of support!
