Very expensive. It\u0027s even more difficult if you are a producer based in Uganda, East Africa. I have to dig deep for ways to make it on the cheap, with resources I can easily find in my home town, so I produce short films as a training, to enhance my skills, and to show case my abilities. It\u0027s very difficult to gain the attention of the world, unless you have backing of Europeans or Americans, unless you are an African in the diaspora, but I hope I can make it from right here in the continent. With your support, I sure will.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you back me, your money will be well spent. I\u0027m Dilman Dila, a writer and filmmaker.

It\u0027s how they made films like Star Wars in the 1970s. It\u0027s often very difficult to find materials in my home town, and every artist I work with always has to learn from scratch, so your help will be very much appreciated.",
