It\u2019s a word I made up to\ndescribe the illustration style I developed to work with various communities. They\u2019re\na cross between maps, diagrams and comics and made through extensive work in\nthe field. The best way to explain what they are is see one which you can do \u003ca href=\"http://www.dialectograms.com/dialectograms/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehere\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003ca href=\"https://issuu.com/dialectograms/stacks/8d88b1662ad84a8d853360bc8d65cb73\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehere\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.

Dialectograms\ntake time, they require conversation, being there, lots of thinking. You can\u2019t churn one out in just a few days.\nThe process is long \u2013 weeks and months divide that first handshake, or sip of\ntea, to scrawling the last ink-line on the board. And it often doesn\u2019t end even\nwith that; most dialectogram projects end with the original being gifted to the\ncommunity involved, which means getting it properly framed, installed and\nhanded over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s14.postimg.org/f5kfz0om9/Piershill_excerpt.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s why I love working\nthis way.

If you can give me whatever support you\u2019re comfortable with, then I\ncan continue the slow, careful work of producing dialectograms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut how will you know I\u2019m working in a slow,\ncareful manner? \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.dialectograms.com/2015/04/#2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Dialectographer\u2019s Bulletin\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eis a free, bi-monthly blog update on all my\nactivities. This consists of illustrated essays, comic strips, sketches, short\nstories and anything else I can think of \u2013 excerpts from dialectograms in\nprocess, insights into my methods or reflections on past works. I also put\nversions of my dialectograms up on ISSUU for people to take a look at. Both of\nthese are free to view so you don\u2019t have to back me to see what I\u2019m up to \u2013 but\nif you are able to spare a bit of cash, then you\u2019ll make it a lot easier for me\nto carry on my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile I do attract project\nfunds here and there, the work I do is long in the making and not very\ncommercial. The communities I work with tend to be marginal, overlooked and are\nthemselves trying to make ends meet. The money would give me the freedom to\nexplore new ideas, scope out dialectogram projects (including those with little or no project support around them) and, knowing that at least\nsome of my own basic costs are covered, go that extra yard with my\nparticipants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s10.postimg.org/mnhsyohe1/MBstadium_lores.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDoing this work doesn\u2019t\njust require a pencil and paper. You also need pens. And erasers. And inks,\npaints, sometimes new brushes. I work out of a small studio in Glasgow and\nwould be lost without it \u2013 it\u2019s not just a place to draw, but meet my participants,\nhold workshops and talk to myself (as well as store all the junk that doesn\u2019t\nfit in our small home). This costs me in rent, on top of the usual mortgages\nand bills to pay, so even just being able to keep this valuable resource\u00a0 would be huge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then there are the\nother non-dialectogram projects I would like to find more time for \u2013such as\u00a0 a documentary\nwebcomic I\u2019m trying to get started, a comic book series about the filmmaker\nAlice Guy, plus some one off projects such as a crazy idea I\u2019m currently\npursuing bringing together archaeology and illustration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you enjoy what I do and\nfeel it should continue, then I\u2019m happy to oblige! But any help you can give \u2013\neven just a quid a month \u2013 would be massively appreciated and gratefully\nacknowledged at every opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s16.postimg.org/4x4yi1zkl/Showmansyardlores.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
