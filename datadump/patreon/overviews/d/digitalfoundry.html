    "summary": "Digital Foundry specialises in \u003cstrong\u003etechnical analysis of gaming hardware and software\u003c/strong\u003e, using state-of-the-art capture systems and bespoke software to show you how well games and hardware run, visualising precisely what they\u0027re capable of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn essence, \u003cstrong\u003evideo really is at the core of everything we do\u003c/strong\u003e, and we use\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/DigitalFoundry\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e to distribute our graphics comparisons, frame-rate tests and tech analysis, while our written work is found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/?topic=digital_foundry\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEurogamer\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut there\u0027s a problem we need to address\u003c/strong\u003e. We create our work to the most exacting standards and YouTube is unable to provide a platform to see our videos at the best quality, owing to a lack of bandwidth. It\u0027s a great platform for convenient viewing, but at 1080p, often you don\u0027t see the full picture with \u003cstrong\u003efast action lost in a sea of macroblocks\u003c/strong\u003e, and with the arrival of PlayStation 4 Pro and the latest top-tier PC graphics cards, \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube is unable to fully capture the 4K experience\u003c/strong\u003e. You can stream ultra HD for sure, but much of the precision detail is lost - and that\u0027s really the whole point of 4K in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bottom line is this: \u003cstrong\u003ewe need a new video delivery system\u003c/strong\u003e where we aren\u0027t as constrained as we are by streaming bandwidth. We need a platform to be able to show you \u003cem\u003ewhat 4K gaming actually looks like\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and at the same time, we can use this system to deliver pristine quality 1080p video too. \u003cstrong\u003eSo we\u0027ve built one.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re talking about multi-gigabyte files here\u003c/strong\u003e, and we\u0027ve chosen a high quality provider to ensure fast downloads, but the bottom line is that bandwidth isn\u0027t free, so we will need to charge a small monthly access subscription fee - but $5 is a small price to pay for unlimited access to \u003cstrong\u003etop-tier quality encodes of our content \u003c/strong\u003eand it\u0027s also a way to show support for what we do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://images.eurogamer.net/2015/eurogamer-net/Comparison.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRight-click on the thumbnail above and open in a new tab or window to see the difference between a high quality encode and YouTube\u0027s version. The difference is even more pronounced in motion.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDigital Foundry has analysed games for nine years now and everything we produce has always been free to view, whether it\u0027s video on YouTube or articles on Eurogamer. \u003cstrong\u003eNothing will change here\u003c/strong\u003e - but if you want to see our video content at its best, subscribing to our video download service is the way forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a quick FAQ, and we\u0027ll update with any further questions you may have!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow are your\ndownloads improved over YouTube quality?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe use a video encoding technique based on the idea of a\nconstant quality level. Typically, the more complex the image, and the more\nmotion there is and the more bandwidth used. It ensures a consistent level of\nimage quality throughout and keeps file-size bloat down. We\u0027ll be using the\nh.264 codec, along with a second HEVC option, both using the MP4 container. As a rough ballpark figure, a\n4K 60fps video file can be as much as 500MB per minute of footage, with HEVC running at around half that.1080p will\nbe much lower! We are still looking to optimise our encoding to keep file-sizes down without unduly compromising quality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I play your\nvideos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur standard 1080p60 videos should work just fine on any\nmodern computer without too much effort, using the media player of your choice.\nHowever, 4K video - especially at 60fps - may require a more powerful computer, or a better media player. For\n4K TV owners, we recommend copying our videos onto a USB 3.0 flash drive and\nrunning them directly on your TV. Most modern branded 4K TVs should be able to run our videos without issue. In terms of the h.264/HEVC split, most most screens should be able to handle our HEVC content easily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://images.eurogamer.net/2015/screenshots/comparison.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWant to check out the quality of our video?

We aim to do a lot more in 2018, but this is going to involve purchasing more equipment - something that this Patreon helps with handily. You can see all of our existing HDR content\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.digitalfoundry.net/browse/hdr\"\u003eright here\u003c/a\u003e. As with our other content, HDR videos are also hosted on YouTube, though right now there is limited playback support. We recommend downloading our HDR videos, copying them to a USB stick and plugging that directly into your TV for playback.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAre you planning to\nproduce any exclusive content for subscribers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time that we\u0027ve been running this Patreon, we\u0027ve offered a small range of raw capture and trailers. Essentially, when we have cool extra stuff to share, we add it.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.digitalfoundry.net/browse/patreon-exclusive\"\u003eThis\u003c/a\u003e is the current range of Patreon goodies we\u0027ve uploaded.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the\nsubscription money be used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrimarily you are paying for the bandwidth used for the\nvideo downloads. This is not insignificant bearing in mind the high bit-rates we are using. We\u0027re offering this option because\nso much effort goes into producing high quality video and it\u0027s a genuine shame\nthat you don\u0027t get to see the content as we produced it. The move to 4K makes\nthe need for a quality-driven content delivery platform even more important. Over the last year, producing so much 4K content has warranted significant investment - capture equipment upgrades, SSDs (a lot of SSDs) and to ensure a speedy workflow, we\u0027ve found much faster editing workstations are essential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
