I\u0027m attending the University of New Hampshire in the class of 2020 as a Computer Science major.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027m sure you are aware, college is expensive. My family is working hard to contribute as much as possible, but your support would help greatly. There are very few free lunches around, so I would like to not just receive your support, but earn it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoy when I can explain something well enough to inspire wonder in my fellow learners - so I have worked hard to become a good teacher. I hope to create an interesting and entertaining summary of each of my classes each week. By supporting me, you will get summaries of each class I attend, written so as to be engaging and accessible to people without any particular talent in Computer Science.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExamples of my writing (and new posts) can be found at \u003ca href=\"https://setupminimal.github.io/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://setupminimal.github.io/blog/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt costs me $9,800 each year - after scholarships and work-study - to attend college. That\u0027s only $800 a month. So please - brighten both of our mornings with a contribution.\u003cbr\u003e"
