    "summary": "I\u0027m a man who loves to make music! I challenged myself to make a song a month, and after a crazy year of showing myself that I could actually do it, I\u0027ve decided to make it an official challenge on Patreon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m here to show my music to anyone who\u0027s interested and to hopefully get constructive comments and criticisms along the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly Song:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe goal of this patreon is for me to make a song a month and share it with everyone here. The types of songs I make usually have a basis in piano, but the genre can definitely vary. \u00a0Sometimes It feels pleasant to make a simple piano piece that\u0027s beautiful and quiet, and sometimes I really like to fill the song with instruments I\u0027ve not tried using before.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery song I make I upload to\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dave-schab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy soundcloud\u003c/a\u003e, so it\u0027s the place to go to get a feel for the kind of music I make.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, I\u0027m open to taking suggestions on what kind of song you want to hear next,\u00a0so just comment away and I\u0027ll see about picking a suggested theme for the next song\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFor those who are interested \u0026amp; those of you who support at the $10+ tier:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI use various tools to make my music depending on the type of song I\u0027m making and which program I feel will provide the best environment for that song. The fun part, is that I get plenty of different sounds and a different musical feeling from each DAW. The downside is that the project files I upload will be in different programs depending on which I made it in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe DAWs I\u0027ve used include:\u00a0\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGarage Band\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCakewalk Music Creator 6 \u0026amp; 7\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSonar\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAbleton\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFL Studio\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSamplitude\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to these programs, I also use Vocaloid 3 (IA) to add lyrics to some of the songs. \u00a0Since I have the Japanese version of IA you get to hear my attempts at translating the original lyrics to Japanese, for better or worse~\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf there is particular interest in seeing a project file from a certain program, I\u0027ll try to make sure I use that program for the next song. I know I\u0027ve learned quite a bit from seeing completed songs before and it really helps when trying to learn about a particular DAW.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Note: while I can provide the project files, I can\u0027t provide all the plug-ins and sound packs that I use with it. The midi should remain intact, but the audio won\u0027t load for the tracks that use packs that you don\u0027t own as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCommissions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve ever dreamed of having a song written just for you, or want music to go with a game or project you\u0027re working on, I\u0027m open to talking about commissions. But as a general rule, I\u0027ll only take one\u00a0commission\u00a0at a time to help ensure quality and timely responses to feedback and suggestions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe price of a commission is negotiable but generally starts at around $50. \u00a0The complexity and length of a song are taken into consideration, but the final cost is never paid until you are satisfied with the job :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if for some reason you haven\u0027t already, I suggest listening to my previous works first to determine if my style of music is something you\u0027re interested in~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in commissions you can email me at:\u003cbr\u003edave.schab.music@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e"
