    "summary": "I am so humbled and grateful that you have come to this page As a person with a history in Automotive manufacturing, wood working, metal working and all of that good stuff. DillysAdv is my way of sharing the adventures of life and working through solutions to problems that regular people who like (Love) tools will encounter. That is not all, over the years, I have not been able to look at pretty much anything without thinking about what would make it better, what would revolutionize it, what would change the way we look at things forever. I have some awesome ideas that have been bouncing around in my head, some from as long ago as the 3rd grade that push limits, convince, and so much more. \u00a0I want to share these ideas with all of you. As a Patreon supporter, you would be making that possible. You would be the reason that these ideas, projects, videos, ect are not locked away forever. Since starting Youtube back in February of 2010 my goals have always been to create a community of individuals with sharing ideas in many ways. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideos will be released every week (Sometimes more often), so donations would be a monthly investment. \u00a0I have never been one to receive handouts and I would never intend for this to be that either. I intend to make sure every penny invested is returned back in quality ideas, entertainment, better and better content. \u00a0In advance, I cannot thank you enough for even considering to be part of this adventure.\u00a0"
