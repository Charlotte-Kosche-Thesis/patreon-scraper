    "summary": "Hi Folks,  Well,\nwe\u0027ve been doing the \u003cstrong\u003eDelboy\u0027s Garage Videos\u003c/strong\u003e for 5yrs now, yep, half a\ndecade already!  We truly never believed the show would find such a huge\naudience, last so long or become such a huge part of our lives.\nYour amazing support changed everything and motivated us to just keep\ngoing.  \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u2019re\nalways hungry for more, and we deliver as much as we can in the\ntime between our \u0027day\u0027 jobs!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eI reckon we all\nagree that we don\u0027t upload as often as you would like. Not nearly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u2019s the\nhold up? It\u0027s the \u0027Day jobs\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eAs much as we\u2019d\nlike them to, Delboy\u0027s Garage videos \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edon\u0027t\npay the bills\u003c/strong\u003e.\nWe have funded this entirely ourselves from the beginning, and\ndeliberated many sleepless nights over whether it\u0027s all worth it when\nwe find we can\u0027t afford the things we need, such better equipment and\nmaterials.  It\u2019s also always hard to read through pages of e-mails\nasking when the next video is, \u0027when will a build be finished\u0027 and\n\u0027what\u0027s coming next\u0027 when so much of our time is dedicated to the\n\u0027back door\u0027 admin... It has also been disappointing that we\u2019ve done\nthis for five years, built up credibility and a loyal viewer base,\nand still cannot secure any sponsorship from the parts companies we\nhave supported. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eWhen\nnot filming, we\u0027re editing, answering comments, and replying to\nquestions, (and with 72,000 of you now, that\u0027s a full time job)..which\nis the other problem...\u0027time\u0027..! \nWe\u0027ve always been happy to spend our free time at this...in fact..\u003cstrong\u003eALL of our\nfree time.\u003c/strong\u003e..but as the channel has grown, so has the time required to\nrun it, meaning, that our spare time is just not enough any more, we\nnow need to dedicate real time to the channel for it to keep\ngrowing and bringing you the cool videos you enjoy, and with the\nright financial support to free up some work time, we can achieve this. \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eTo be honest, we\u2019ve\nnow reached a point where the show needs to make some self sufficient\nmoney or the workload will roll back over us. As we get bigger, it\u0027s\nnow harder to dedicate the necessary time to produce new\ncontent, so you could say, the \u0027tail is now wagging the dog\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eWe want to be clear\nhere, \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027re not \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003elooking \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eto\nlive off this, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ejust\nbe able to dedicate two days a week, to make the channel realise it\u0027s\nnatural potential\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e spend a little\nless time worrying over the bills, and more time making quality\ncontent for you to enjoy, maintain your bikes and save you money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eSo, simply put, if\nwe have helped you, in any way, or just provided entertainment that\nyou\u0027ve enjoyed, and want to continue enjoying, then becoming a\n\u0027patron\u0027 of the Channel is a great way for you to help us in return. \nEvery dollar you feed into our Patreon account, means you get new\nDelboy\u0027s Garage videos to watch, and more often.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is way\nbetter than other crowd funding platforms, as with Patreon, you\nbecome an \u0027investor\u0027...a part of the DBG team. \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ll\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e help\nturn a \u0027time expensive\u0027 hobby into something very special...
