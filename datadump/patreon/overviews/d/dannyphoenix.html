    "summary": "Near the end of 2017 I started posting a short story called Snow White \u0026amp; Rose Red on Webtoons, and now here we are only a few months later, and my story has over 13 thousand views and a 9.8/10 star rating! \u00a0And I couldn\u0027t be happier. \u00a0But Snow White \u0026amp; Rose Red was just the introduction to a story I\u0027ve been writing in my head for years. \u00a0That story is called Checkmate\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheckmate is the story of\u00a0Dustyn and Lyle, a pair of freelancers who will solve\nany problem. \u00a0It\u0027s a story full of laughs and action, and maybe even some sadness. \u00a0But at it\u0027s heart, it\u0027s the story of how we as people move on from the tragedies in our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging to me you\u0027ll get all sorts of cool benefits, from being able to see the pages of Checkmate as they are created, to tutorials, and loads of other bonus artwork (including some NSFW). \u00a0I also want to take a second to thank everyone who has read my work and supported me, because it really does mean a lot. I had no idea that when I started this webcomic project that I would get the feedback that I got, and it always brings a smile to my face to read all the wonderful comments I get. And to anyone who pledges to me, thank you so much. It\u0027s always been my dream ever since I was a kid to make comics, so that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m gonna do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re in interesting in previous story,\u00a0Snow White \u0026amp; Rose Red is a\u00a0short story about an overly happy bounty hunter and her cynical friend (Who totally doesn\u0027t have a bounty on his head). \u00a0It\u0027s only 12 chapters long + an Epilogue, but it\u0027s the prologue to a much larger world. \u00a0If you like bitter sweet stories, with a bit of comedy and action, than you might just enjoy this one, just make sure you have some tissues in case. You can read my comic for free on \u003ca href=\"http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/snow-white-rose-red/list?title_no=127491\"\u003eWebtoons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
