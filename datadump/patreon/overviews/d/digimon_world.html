    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://vanguardus.blogspot.com/2015/10/announcement-disbandment-of-cardfight.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhen I left \u003cem\u003eCardfight Pro\u003c/em\u003e behind\u003c/a\u003e,\n I asked all of my patrons to cease their donations. I didn\u0027t want to \ntake their money while I wasn\u0027t producing content. Ambiguously, I said \nthat I would repurpose the Patreon page when I worked out what my new \nproposal would be. I now understand what I should direct my abilities \nto.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy four years at \u003cem\u003eCardfight Pro\u003c/em\u003e ended because\n I stepped down to begin working on\nsomething that I could pour all my heart into. I want to create a\nstrong centralized news source for all things Digimon, one that will \nclose the gap between the western fandom and overseas news by\nreporting reliably, honestly, and quickly. I\u0027ve begun by translating\nJapanese magazine articles, press releases, products information, and\nfan pages. As tournament play for \u003ca href=\"http://www.digimonworld.org/2015/11/digimado-to-host-december-cyber-sleuth.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emodern Digimon games like \u003cem\u003eCyber Sleuth\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e begins to develop, I want to take advantage of a unique\nopportunity to restore Digimon\u0027s lost legacy; the \u003ca href=\"http://www.digimonworld.org/p/d-1-grand-prix.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eD-1 Grand Prix\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn\ndoing so, I plan to follow closely and promote the mobilization of\nthe world\u0027s Digimon tamers. To help inform and educate on how fan\nevents are being run overseas, and how we can apply those methods to\nour own countries. This is a fandom that has been scattered to the\nwinds time and again, yet always perseveres. We all wish \u003cem\u003eDigimon\u003c/em\u003e\ncould have the kind of artistic freedom that \u003cem\u003ePretty Cure\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSuper\nSentai\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ePok\u00e9mon\u003c/em\u003e, and other long-running series have. Right now we\u0027re\nin a tightrope situation such that if one \u003cem\u003eDigimon \u003c/em\u003eseries\nunderperforms, it\u0027s an immediate franchise killer. Imagine if instead\nof playing a guessing game of whether or not \u003cem\u003eDigimon \u003c/em\u003ewould be alive\nevery year, we could be guaranteed the stability of a new season\nannually regardless of its critical and public reception.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nInternet forums have played an\ninstrumental role in uniting the fanbase, but in terms of their\nmainstream exposure these methods of information distribution are too\ninsular. It\u0027s difficult for everyday people to be exposed to a\nwebsite like With the Will, Digital Dive, or one of the other big\nnames in the forum community. Some of these have fallen into disuse or \ndisappeared entirely. What we need is a resource that is as\naccessible to the general public as an off-the-rack magazine, and is\nwilling to institute the necessary measures to be indexed by popular\nsearch engines, aggregators, and social media platforms. This will\nhelp sustain our membership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision is to help cultivate the\nglobal digital community laid out in \u003cem\u003eOur War Game\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eAdventure 02\u003c/em\u003e,\n\u003cem\u003eDiablomon\u0027s Counterattack\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eDigimon Story\u003c/em\u003e. Not just to dictate\na body of \"news\" to the public, but to contribute to a\nnetwork of fans that can keep each another informed, exchange ideas,\nand support one another. There will come a time when Bandai \u0026amp;\nToei will try their hands at airing another weekly \u003cem\u003eDigimon\u003c/em\u003e series.\nWhen that time comes, we will be ready for their pass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have\na wealth of experience to draw on, having helped support and organize\ntournament play for \u003cem\u003eCardfight!! Vanguard\u003c/em\u003e and contribute to the \nTCG\u0027s\ngrowth in the west. The training I received\nfrom several eminent journalists will inform how I operate Tamer\nUnion in the years to come. Donate what you feel comfortable donating. \nWhether it\u0027s $2 or $20, I want to prove to you all that I\u0027m worthy of \nyour pledges.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecuring funding and building my audience are my primary concerns \nright now; everyone will be given appropriate credit for their \ncontributions, and it\u0027s my plan to build towards setting up event \norganization and announcement through \u003cem\u003eTamer Union\u003c/em\u003e when it becomes practical to create funding goals to pay for those events.\u003cbr\u003e"
