    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eWelcome and thanks for visiting my Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003eLet me first say that this project is addressing both people who are new to the whole topic of visual programming with vvvv\u00a0/ VVVV.js, and people who are familiar (or pro) with it.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eBeginners will feel quickly empowered to program awesome web and mobile apps without the need of textural programming and advanced users will love the way of how you can structure large code libraries in a modular way which allows to program complicated applications with a visual editor.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1.) Background\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs you might know already, I am happily working as a VVVV freelancer, artist and researcher at the interplay of computer graphics, procedural generation, human-computer interaction, media arts and data-visualization. Here are my favorite projects summed up in a little graphic:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.000.graphics/tutorial/img/000.graphics%20overview-Renderer.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn recent years I was involved in the development of VVVV.js, a visual programming environment which runs directly in the browser. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou can try it out yourself here: \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.000.graphics/tutorial/vvvv.js-examples/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVVVV.js examples\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here you can read through a\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://000.graphics/tutorial/02_VVVV.js_Introduction.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e \u003cstrong\u003edetailed overview about VVVV.js\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e .\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e2.) The short introduction to VVVV.js\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the interactive node-graph editor of VVVV.js, it is the perfect tool for rapidly creating a wide range of web and mobile applications (games, data-viz, touch interfaces, header-graphics, full web pages etc.). \u003cbr\u003eBeginners can do this without textual coding involved and advanced users can benefit from the visual programming paradigm since it is a great way to structure and reuse large libraries in an open source ecosystem. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEspecially in the past two years, I spent an intense time implementing a high-end rendering engine and various game engine components for VVVV.js. All this in the context of my master thesis which was about the development of a game engine for VVVV.js which is streamlined for procedural content generation. Here are some of the results in a video: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\t\u003cdiv\u003e\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/255544587\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e \t\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\tThe reason why I am making this Patreon page is that I think it is about time that everyone can get started with VVVV.js.

My developing goals are clear, and since I know there are always special needs for different projects, I will dedicate extra time to my Patreons to prioritize their wishes and in addition, I will make regular online-workshops and direct support for your VVVV.js project if you become a supporter! \t\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cstrong\u003e3.)

Conclusion\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAs you can see there is a lot of potential in the VVVV.js project which waits for curious developer and designer willing to incorporate the visual programming paradigm into their work. The recent years I was lucky enough to have the time to get into this amazing framework and work with it both in science and for freelance projects. In that time I accumulated many awesome methods which I packed into modular node sets. Nowadays when I use them again in projects or when I show the programming design patterns to participants of my lectures, I repeatedly realize how fruitful this whole technology is: Within a matter of minutes I can set up procedurally generated 3d scenes, touch-screen interfaces, data-visualizations and little games that run directly in the browser and eventually can be wrapped to cross-platform apps in a matter of minutes. In lectures, people who never touch programming code or even a simple HTML file, understand everything in the first day and in the second they feel already confident to make a web page with 3d graphics themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI only wish there can be more users in the future, and this is my initiative to make it happen.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eSo I would be happy if you join me on this awesome journey! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you consider becoming a patreon, habe a look what the rewards are! \u003cbr\u003eYou can also text me via davidgann [at] 000.graphics if you want to know more details first.\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much and wish you a great time, \u003cbr\u003eDavid Gann. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.000.graphics\"\u003ewww.000.graphics\u003c/a\u003e"
