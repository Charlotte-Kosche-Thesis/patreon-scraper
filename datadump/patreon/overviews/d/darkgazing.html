Each episode is a structured video-essay that sheds light on a game. Inside the other-worldly \u003cem\u003eDarkchive\u003c/em\u003e, we focus on the piece - providing both an outline of the main story, and a general review that carefully avoids spoilers. The show will introduce you to an interesting or obscure title you\u0027ve never heard of before and whet your appetite enough that maybe you\u0027ll not overlook it again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlongside these scripted episodes of \u003cspan style=\"\"\u003eDarkgazing\u003c/span\u003e, we\u0027ll also be \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eSpeed-Running\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e some horror games and trying to set a World Record or two if possible - starting with Gregory Horror Show. The dream would be to get to an AGDQ/SGDQ event one day!

We also cover news and recent releases, as well as focusing on older titles - all peppered with zany and humourous off-topic conversation. At the end of each episode, we select the topic of the next episode - the audience (and us!) has time to go away and watch/play/experience that thing in time to discuss it next time. Episodes are free and you can find us on \u003ca href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fsotdscloud\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fsotditunes\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fsotdyoutube\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e - don\u0027t forget to subscribe on your platform of choice so you don\u0027t miss any new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePut simply, if you enjoy my content, supporting my Patreon in any way that you can helps remunerate me for time spent creating that content.
