With hints of Old School Industrial Rock and Nu Metal blended with current EDM, House and Break Beats; these two are doing more than just picking up the baton from bands like Marylin Manson, Nine Inch Nails and Rob Zombie; they are creating what can only be described as the best fusion of Industrial Rock \u0026amp; EDM today!  Get ready for an other-worldly experience as D-Punk and Kato take you on a journey that deals with the loss of love, the depths of human deceit, self loathing and frustration evolving into every aspect of hate and all the things they experience along the way.

     "description": "As our patrons grow so will our products and so will the rewards we are able to give back to our fan base! As we all know, the music industry has changed quite a bit over the years and as a result, it has become harder and harder to support ourselves on just the music alone. With that in mind; we are really excited to get out on the road, play more shows, create tons of new, fun and innovative merchandise, and most importantly make more incredible music for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of Patreon and people like you, we now have the ability to create a solid monthly income. This income will give us the financial freedom to continue to grow as a band and accomplish all of our goals! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe three main reasons we are excited about using Patreon to help grow our business are as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1) In order for us to grow as a band and as a business, we need to get on the road and stay on the road! Having a steady monthly income would go a long way toward maintaining longer tour schedules and ensure that we take advantage of every opportunity that comes our way. Some opportunites are financially challenging to take on, as they may be more about exposure than actual dollars in the pocket. These are the things we really want to say yes to, and you could be the ones to make it possible!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2) Since the advent of streaming, revenue from CD sales and Digital Downloads has decreased quite a bit. However, the cost to make the same high quality music we\u0027ve all come to enjoy has stayed the same. With that being said; having a solid monthly income will go a long way toward helping us achieve our goals in the studio and provide you with all the amazing music you need and want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n3) Merchandise is one of the primary ways in which bands make money these days. We are literally overflowing with ideas for unique and amazing things we can create for you and make available both online and on the road. However, Merchandise costs quite a bit of money up front to create and this monthly income would go a long way toward helping us actualize these awesome pieces of band memorabilia!\u003cbr\u003e",
