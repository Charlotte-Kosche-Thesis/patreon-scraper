I want to tell as many different kinds of stories visually as I can. Comic books, Kids books, Illustrated novels all of it if possible. I want to write and draw my own stories. I would love to invite Writers I know to work on stories with me. And possibly have contest\u0027 later on this site to win having one of your own stories come to life(who knows we\u0027ll figure that out as we go). \u00a0I want to try new visual things and show as much of it as I can to Fans, and now Patrons, as I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first issue of the book I wrote and drew \u0027\u003cstrong\u003eWerewolf Run\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027 (which is available for \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFREE\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e here!) \u00a0was a long journey that I took primarily \u00a0by myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIssue 1\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/rg0e79atob2nr1p/WWR%20%231%20-%20FINAL.pdf?dl=0\"\u003ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rg0e79atob2nr1p/WWR%20%2...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon I hope to have many people coming with me so that I can show you the things I\u0027m working on as I go. And having the support of Patrons would mean I could focus more of my attention on \u00a0writing and drawing to complete these projects in a decent amount of time. Here\u0027s what I have planned for now. I will put up all 4 issues of \u0027\u003cstrong\u003eWerewolf Run\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027, which the art is already finished for.

And after that, something I\u0027ve been wanting to work on for almost 20 years But we\u0027ll have to really work up to that one (But I seriously can\u0027t wait to show people that one).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f213/DanLeister/3%20stories.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNow I really hope to go off the beaten path here with many different types of stories and I would love for all of you to come along for the ride. I think it will be a seriously fun ride! \u00a0Once a story arc is completed I hope to take it over to Kickstarter (where Werewofl Run was successfully funded) to make it into a nice TPB and hardcover that I would put a bunch of extras and fun goodies into.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003eMy hope is that this site will bring a bit of extra stability to my career and to be able to share stories that \u00a0may be out of the mainstream norm of things. \u00a0Above all I would like to thank you for your patronage and support.
