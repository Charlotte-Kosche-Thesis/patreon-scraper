    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi, everyone!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name is Gerardo, but I\u0027m also known as \u003cstrong\u003eCaveman\u003c/strong\u003e. Most people ask how I got my nickname, so long story short, I used to have dreadlocks and a huge beard, and of course, the nickname came naturally. I love to create. If it\u0027s with a camera, paintbrush, or digital, I enjoy it all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall photography is my favorite way to create. It has been my life since I picked up a camera ten years ago. Picking up a camera for me was the equivalent of Noah and Allie falling in love in the movie The Notebook. So beautiful, I know I\u0027m crying too. It wasn\u0027t long until I started doing street photography and taking pictures of everything. Then I got into portrait photography and fell in love with taking pictures even more. At that time, just like other photographers, I wanted to focus on fine art photography. But one day I woke up with a different view on portraits, I wanted to use anyone. As I captured these images of different people, I learned that everyone has gone, or is going, through something. Everyone has a story. Then a few years into having Instagram I shared an image, and someone responded: \"When I look at this picture I feel like I can breathe.\" That comment changed something in me. I can make people relate and feel through my images. That\u0027s what my goal is with this Patreon, to capture moments that tell these amazing stories and create feelings that will move people. All through my portrait and landscape photography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I make my living doing freelance jobs (photo retouching, graphics, and videography) while doing as much traveling and photography on the side as possible. My dream is to be able to capture different perspectives of life and cultures around the world. I believe there is so much to learn from people and their views in life, and I want to show people that through photography. If it\u0027s a poster or a book, I just want people to understand other people. By supporting me here on Patreon, you aren\u0027t just making my life a little less stressful, but you are giving me a chance to create content that will, hopefully, change the views of other people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my photography, pledging the minimum (the amount of a cup of coffee) will help me get closer to doing this full-time. The more you support, the more I can do and create quality content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I will do with your money:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I am currently a freelance graphic designer/videographer/photographer by supporting me on Patreon you give me the opportunity to take less freelance jobs and focus more on creating content (photos, books, postcards, youtube videos) for you. Most things I post here will be exclusive to you!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for all your support! I seriously appreciate it more than you can imagine and it helps me out so much!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
