I co-founded \u003ca href=\"http://blogboundcon.com/\"\u003eBlogbound\u003c/a\u003e, created #quietYA and run its social media (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/quietYA\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://quietya.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e), and write for \u003ca href=\"http://www.yainterrobang.com/\"\u003eYA Interrobang\u003c/a\u003e. Additionally, I created \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?src=typd\u0026amp;q=%23askanace\"\u003e#AskAnAce\u003c/a\u003e, a chat for asexual-spectrum people to talk about our experiences and educate allosexual people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I love all of these projects, they don\u0027t pay - at all. I\u0027ve been unemployed since spring 2015. I did a semester abroad in fall 2015, then graduated college in May 2016. I\u0027ve been job hunting since then and despite four years of freelance experience and three internships, I\u0027m struggling to find work. I\u0027ve taken on some freelance manuscripts and publicity work and don\u0027t have many bills, but I can\u0027t really justify doing all of the creating and writing I do and want to keep doing without some sort of income. I\u0027m also a really deadline and incentive motivated person - knowing I have deadlines and people paying me to provide services helps motivate me to keep working. I feed off positive reinforcement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy tiers are all somewhat vague, because I want your input. Is there something I should try, a list I should make, something you want to learn about? I\u0027d love to hear your suggestions! If you can\u0027t afford to subscribe to a patreon right now, I completely understand and I hope to be able to make a lot of these things available for free in the future. But for now, I\u0027d just like to have a little more financial security so I can worry less and create more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me on \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyJulianne\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e, on \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/juliecaughtreading/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e, on \u003ca href=\"http://readingjourneywithjulie.blogspot.com/\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e, and on \u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/A4489CF\"\u003eko-fi\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
