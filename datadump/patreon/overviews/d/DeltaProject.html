    "summary": "The Delta Project is my latest comic project, after \u003ca href=\"http://blacktapestries.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBlack Tapestries\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://kaerwyn.blacktapestries.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Realm of Kaerwyn\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u00a0 Both of the aforementioned comics are my creation entirely, with the help from some others, of course.\u00a0 However the Delta Project differs in that we will be taken story submissions from the public and those lucky enough to be chosen, will have their stories drawn in comic format - mostly for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Delta Project has one goal in mind - to create comic issues based on shapeshifting.\u00a0 Some element of the story will be about shapeshifting, and will depict shapeshifting within it.\u00a0 The project itself is all about change.\u00a0 It will be an anthology of stories. Each issue is either an independent tale, or we may have some issues from time to time that feature the same characters or the same setting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there\u0027s a catch, right? There\u0027s always a catch.\u00a0 The catch is that The Delta Project is crowdfunded.\u00a0 As much as I would love to draw comics for free those that demand I pay for rent, insurance, bills, and other things wouldn\u0027t really accept comics instead of money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic will be publicly available - in it\u0027s entirety.\u00a0 It will be free for the public to enjoy - but will only update as long as the goals are met.\u00a0 I want to make sure that everyone has access to the comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now we are not accepting story submissions.\u00a0 We have a lot of rules and such to make before we can open this up.\u00a0 Please keep in mind that we will not be able to create comics from all the stories submitted to us. And some stories, with permission, may need to be edited before they can be used.\u00a0 Also keep in mind that story writers will not be paid for their work or submissions - but you won\u0027t have to pay to get it drawn in a comic format.\u00a0 Essentially the public will be paying for your work to be put into comic format.\u00a0\u00a0 Story writers will get all the proper credits for their work as well. But we\u0027ll have more information on this if the project seems like it will be something that can be maintained - with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust for the record, right now I need some time to start working on the site and the first issue.\u00a0 So any pledges made between now and the end of July will be used to get the project off the ground.\u00a0 If I get enough funds, I would like to launch the comic and the site by August 1st.\u003cbr\u003e"
