    "summary": "I first started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sacredhearth.com\"\u003esacredhearth.com\u003c/a\u003e as a personal blog while I was in college and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.witchipedia.com\"\u003ewitchipedia.com\u003c/a\u003e came soon after. I found that I really enjoyed writing essays in college, where I majored in Anthropology and I used my online platform to continue writing essays after I graduated. I chose to write about witchcraft and the occult because these are topics that I have been a part of my life since childhood and I never grew tired of learning more about them. I was personally frustrated by the complicated structure and misinformation that was prevelent in so many resources available to me at the time. The idea that in order to do magick, one must go through complicated rituals only after obtaining several expensive items was truly annoying and I determined to combat that nonsense. I had already been a witch for most of my llife and I knew from experience that it wasn\u0027t that complicated. Studying witchcraft in an acedemic setting opened up a whole new world for me, and I wanted to share it. I felt that bringing bringing solid, no-nonsense information in a free forum was important and so Witchipedia was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal with the Witchipedia was always to keep it as easily accessible and fact-based as possible while providing resources for additional information. That meant that a lot of the traditional money-making plans simply don\u0027t work there. I often refer people to other websites that give me no revenue and I have never approved of intrusive ads and refuse to use them. But a girl needs to eat, and so do the kids.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople contact me often to ask for more services, which I would love to provide: Apps, videos and physical books, etc. But the time/money situation makes it difficult to even research the processes of making these things happen, let alone actually doing them. I am hoping Patreon will allow those people who are are most interested in the progress of my work to really influence the directions I go and help me to spend more time creating, and less time looking for odd jobs to scrape together enough cash to keep the sites online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should also know that I am very shy. Creating videos will be hard. I will first create videos for my patrons, to get me warmed up, before creating videos for the general public. I hope that you will be critical and make lots of suggestions so that I can make the best videos possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and get to know me. I am just a Mid-Western Kitchen Witch and you are giving me the opportunity to continue doing what I love while also serving the community."
