    "summary": "Hello Folks, I wanna thank you for checking this out and thanks to those who already have supported me on this platform. \u00a0 I appreciate you listening to my music and helping to keep this boat afloat. \u00a0This is a monthly subscription platform to help ease the financial burdens of being an independent musician. \u00a0It helps to pay for rent, food, health expenses, traveling costs, \u00a0insurance and other bills that crop up. \u00a0The money is also used to pay for various things such musical equipment and software for recording. \u00a0I\u0027m reaching out to people who are interested in what i do and want to help keep it rolling. \u00a0Every little bit helps. Whatever the amount, if you decide to pledge, it will be charged every month to your account. The lowest amount being $2 per month and up, depending on the reward you choose. \u00a0This is an ongoing monthly fund raising campaign. So any of the rewards that you see to the right are what i can offer at this point.\u00a0To generate a steady supplemental income to keep going and have a little bit of stability! \u00a0 Being a songwriter at my level can be pretty challenging financially. \u00a0Patreon has helped to ease the loss of income due to free music on the internet and low payments by online music streaming. \u00a0Since i started this site in June of 2016 i\u0027ve been able to keep a rental housing situation while on the road, purchase a new camera for videos, buy final cut and logic pro software and finance a newer touring vehicle. \u00a0 I\u0027m hoping to keep raising monthly funds to help the creative process along. Allowing more time for making music,videos and writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve posted a video for the recent \"All Request Video Show part 1\" to show you an example of what i do with video. \u00a0 I have also been posting travelogues about the shows and places i\u0027ve played recently along with a monthly newsletter and a \"song of the month\". \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, \u00a0I have a \u00a0 re-issue of Spider West Myshkin and a City Bus coming out on Keeled Scales on double vinyl. \u00a0\"Inside the Cat\u0027s Eye\" \u00a0 12\" vinyl was released by \"Koschke Records\" last year and i\u0027ve begun working on a new album. \u00a0I\u0027ve already got 6 songs in the bag. \u00a0I\u0027m planning to stay on the road as a continually working musician through 2018 and hopefully complete a new record this year. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m reaching out to any of you who like what i do and would like to support my future endeavors. \u00a0Thanks for listening! .... and many thanks to those who have contributed already!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ew/love!\u003cbr\u003eDavid Dondero\u003cbr\u003e12/23/2017"
