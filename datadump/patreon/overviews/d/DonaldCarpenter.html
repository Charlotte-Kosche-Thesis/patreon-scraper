I am encouraged to make music by those who give their love, respect and support to me and others who dedicate their lives to the art. I am excited to see a site like Patreon that takes the 2 fundamental elements of this process, the Musician and the Music Supporter and brings them together in a musical partnership. Together the possibilities are endless! No Label, No Greed, just Us and OUR music! To me, after doing this for over 20 years, it doesn\u0027t get any better than that! All are welcome, All are loved!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I was born in Fort Worth, Texas \u0026amp; grew up in a small town called \nStephenville about 60 miles southwest of Dallas. My passion for music \nbegan at the early age, starting with instrumentation \u0026amp; then moving \nto vocalization when I was 15. During this time, the release of \nSoundgarden \"Superunknown\", Alice In Chains \"Dirt\" and Live \"Throwing \nCopper\" drew me in and never let me go. I enlisted in the US ARMY \nshortly after High School and Served 3 years at Ft. Hood, Texas before \nmoving to the DFW Area and beginning my journey in Music. At the end of \n2001 I formed my first band \"Submersed\" and shortly thereafter we were \nsigned to Windup Records where we stayed for 5 years and 2 albums. After\n 2 years away from the game, I was contacted by Corey Lowery in October \nof 2009 about joining what would become \"Eye Empire\". It has been a \ncrazy road but ALL has been for a reason \u0026amp; I am extremely grateful \nto have the opportunity to make music \u0026amp; impact people\u0027s lives \nthrough this incredible gift of sound. My Family is my Life \u0026amp; \nMotivation! I am blessed with the best of both worlds \u0026amp; understand \nhow rare that is \u0026amp; appreciate it. Their love \u0026amp; support carry me \neveryday, I am nothing without them.\u003cbr\u003e",
