Be it pushing new styles, settings, buff anatomy-- \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo image gating\u003c/strong\u003e.

An hour of my time to sit and... perhaps you\u0027d like me to look over a picture you\u0027re having issues with, or some thoughts on anatomy, how to push the things that are working in your style- However you think I can help, I will do my utmost to be of help! Can of course screenshare and talk over voice (skype all being well).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember my practice is mostly with Photoshop/SAI if you\u0027re working digitally (and if you\u0027re traditional, you\u0027ll need digital copies/scans/photos). However most programs end up having the same sets of tools, if working digitally is something you\u0027d like advice with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll offer 8 slots, so that means 2 people per week of the month, and will ramp this up if its successful and people find it beneficial! I\u0027ll organize time slots for anywhere between 12am and 12pm GMT on Saturday or Sunday and will give warning of any changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDISCLAIMER- IMPORTANT- This is tailored 1 on 1 sessions. NOT a structured tutorial. Meaning its down to you what we cover. Bare in mind what my experience is in and how I\u0027ll be able to help -you-. So, if you\u0027re looking for some help with drawing or colouring for instance, or perhaps feel like you\u0027ve stagnated and cant improve, I\u0027ll hopefully be able to give better advice. I\u0027ll contact you prior for skype info and briefly discuss what you\u0027re looking for so that I can come prepared.\u003cbr\u003e"
