\u00a0The first thing you should know is that if you subscribe via Patreon for any pledge amount (even just $1), you should no longer have to purchase any new albums via Bandcamp because I\u0027ll already be sending those to you for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is also a much better way of supporting me overall.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Many of my albums are offered on Bandcamp with either no minimum price\u00a0or at extremely discounted rates. \u00a0For example,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ddrkirbyisq.bandcamp.com/album/celestial-melodies\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCelestial Melodies\u003c/a\u003e is 23 songs for only $5, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ddrkirbyisq.bandcamp.com/album/the-ecstasy-of-life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Ecstasy of Life\u003c/a\u003e is 21 songs for only $2! \u00a0I do this because music is not my primary form of income, and because I care more about having my music heard than about making money. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePledging to me on Patreon ensures that I get paid properly for my efforts as an artist.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Plus, you get free exclusive perks! :D\u003cbr\u003eAll that said, if you can\u0027t afford to make a pledge or are only interested in a few of my albums, I\u0027m totally OK with you supporting me via Bandcamp instead!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I become a patron, do I get free downloads for all of your PAST albums?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNope, sorry! \u00a0You\u0027ll get access to all of the songs that I make from your subscription point onwards, but you\u0027ll still have to purchase my past music separately. \u00a0This is to prevent hit-and-run scammers from paying $1 for a single month and downloading all of my music. =(\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour rewards note that you \"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emust be in good account standing to be eligible\". \u00a0What does that mean?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEssentially this means you must have actually made one or more payments at the appropriate pledge level before I will consider you eligible for rewards. \u00a0Again, no scamming the system by manipulating your pledge level without actually paying for rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does the personal remix request queue work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/14493175\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis post\u003c/a\u003e for an explanation of that, and to see the current status of the queue!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdditional questions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any other questions about Patreon, pledging, payment, rewards, or just want to chat, please hit me up at ddrkirby@gmail.com!"
