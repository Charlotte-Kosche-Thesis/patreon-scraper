    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Name is James and I am a BIG NERD from the U.K.! I am a die-hard Doctor Who fan, general sci-fi and fantasy lover as well as a self-acknowledged Otaku (Japanese culture fan ;3)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started going to Comic/Film/Anime Conventions in 2013. I started with one con in the Summer of 2013, but it wasn\u0027t the best of experiences seeing as my lack of decent food caused me to feel ill as hell that afternoon. Though my second con experience in November of that year was one of the best I had, combining the fun of con with the excitement of going out with friends to see the 50th anniversary special of Doctor Who in the cinema. Since then, my amount of cons has roughly doubled each year. (2 in 2013, 4 in 2014, 8 in 2015, 15 in 2016 and I have been 9 so far in 2017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until 2015 that I began doing photography. I HAD attempted a first year in Photography at University as it was a combined honors degree with Television production which I was more interested in at the time. I only really learned some basic skills and tips for Photography which I didn\u0027t anticipate would assist me greatly in the long run. By Birmingham MCM Comic Con came around I was attempting to become a Cosplay Music Video maker and was advertising in various facebook groups and events pages for potential cosplayers to work with. Late on Saturday of the event I attended a Rooster Teeth Fan meet and was waiting for cosplayers to become free from the other photographers, but in that second I only just remembered that the DSLR I was filming with could take photos too (Duh!). So I took a few snaps here and there and really liked the results, and so started a page for my photography on the 22nd of March that year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver time I met many cosplayers (some of which are my best friends) and photographers from the UK cosplay community across the country. Since beginning my journey into cosplay photography I have invested in attending more and more new and exciting cons, new equipment to improve my output for photos and also to be able to afford on-location shoots with up and coming cosplay stars so as to create new and more exciting sets of photos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, My goal is to travel to new places, work with new people and keep improving myself and my skills. I am quite a shy and bashful person, as much as you might think I shouldn\u0027t be after meeting so many people. Compared to most photographers, I find it hard to walk up to cosplayers anew and ask them for photos, though when I actually manage to talk to them, I like to think I get on with them like a house on fire ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for support through Patreon so that I can further my goal to go to cons in other countries, such as the US, Central Europe or even Japan. As well as improving my shooting setup more with better flashes, soft-boxes, beauty dishes, etc and also helping to reimburse the cosplayers who have lent me their time to shoot and pose for my content to bring to you awesome people ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read my story and hopefully giving what you can to help me out, and I\u0027ll be sure to repay any contributions you can make in some form or another.\u003cbr\u003e"
