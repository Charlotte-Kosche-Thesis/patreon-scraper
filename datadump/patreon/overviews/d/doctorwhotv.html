    "summary": "Doctor Who TV has been serving Whovians news, reviews and features daily since the revival of the show itself in 2005. Over the years it has grown to become one of the more popular Doctor Who fansites on the net.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nBut now we really could use your support\u2026\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately the harsh reality is that popular websites today cost a lot of time and money.\nThere is always the requirement for faster and more reliable equipment so the server can hopefully stay online during a big breaking announcement, trailer, or when the latest episode airs and everyone jumps onto the site at the exact same moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe readers have come to expect daily updates, 365 days a year, which has meant that a lot of time goes into it. Unfortunately we don\u2019t have a real life TARDIS so keeping the site going is a full-time endeavour that is no longer sustaining itself.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe simple fact is, without any form of direct support now the site will only be \nable to exist in a severely limited form, or worse, be forced to close.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAren\u2019t there ads to help with costs?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarly on when the site was still relatively small it was able to support itself acceptably enough through ads. However things have changed dramatically in the past couple of years. The costs have gotten more and more expensive and the ads are simply no longer covering things as companies cripple sites by wanting more and more invasive ads for less. There\u2019s also the major issue that many readers block ads these days.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe could push out more and more adverts in the hope it would boost things, but we really don\u2019t want to go to those lengths. There is no guarantee the ads will generate enough, and more and more ugly ads will only harm the site and put people off from visiting permanently.\u00a0 We\u0027re hoping we can eventually remove them entirely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what can you do to help?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site needs your support to keep going and growing, and survive basically. Patreon allows you to donate on a per monthly basis. Those that do directly support us will receive some extra perks as a thank you, as detailed below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your consideration and support. Allons-y!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note you can donate from anywhere in the world. This is not \nrestricted to the US. Currency conversion will automatically be worked \nout.\u003c/span\u003e"
