    "summary": "Through numerous unmistakable means, God has led me to pursue a full-time career in writing and editing.  In addition to giving me a special giftedness, two related degrees, and over thirty years of experience, he has also provided me with an amazing variety of opportunities to impact the world by doing this kind of work for Christ.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom projects with InterVarsity Press (a study guide for the new edition of James Boice\u2019s classic book Foundations of the Christian Faith) to Christian Focus Publishing (a series for the highly respected church leader Dr. Harry Reeder) to Cruciform Press (as submissions editor and curator of a new line of books) and others, I have enough projects lined up to be using my talents as a writer and editor for years to come, in a way that will be of significant use to God in the building of his kingdom throughout the world.  The only problem is, what I\u2019m doing for the Lord doesn\u2019t pay nearly as much as similar work in the secular business world, so that\u2019s why I have this account here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI heard about Patreon from the prominent evangelical blogger and author Tim Challies, who is supported by many through it.  (Tim is one of the men who started Cruciform Press, which is also now publishing books for John Piper\u2019s ministry Desiring God.)  Kevin Meath, the publisher at Cruciform Press, encouraged me to seek support for my work in this way.  Writing and editing is my sole employment now, and because it is as much of a ministry as it is a career, it has not provided enough money yet to fully support our family of six (three of our children are now married and on their own, but four remain in the home).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you please consider contributing so I can continue this new ministry for the glory of God? Such help from Christian brothers and sisters like you in the past has enabled Jill and me to plant two churches and start two Christian schools, and although this is a different kind of ministry, it has the potential to have an even larger and broader impact for the kingdom. And like the support I was given to start those ministries, your help will only be needed until God provides a sufficient income for us.  If you help me get to that point, I may never be able to pay you back in any earthly way, but based on God\u0027s promises I can guarantee that you will be making an investment with eternal returns! (Luke 16:1-13, Gal. 6:6-10).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will not only allow me to continue producing quality books and other written materials that God can use in great ways, but would also help Jill to be able to provide a quality home education for our children, and to pursue the unique ministries of hospitality, mercy, discipleship etc. through which she has impacted many lives in untold ways for almost thirty years.  For example, if we are able to stay in our house, we can continue hosting and evangelizing numerous international students (from Russia, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, to name a few we\u2019ve already had).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the more traditional ministries of writing and editing I mentioned above, I have opportunities to write meaningful Christian fiction for Cruciform Press as well as novels for a large publisher that have the potential of being made into movies.  I have one coming out in March 2018 with Tor Books, and Macmillan Films is seeking to develop the project.  Your support would enable me to participate in advertising the novels I\u2019ve already written and produce others for the secular market, something I\u2019ve always believed more Christians should do.  I\u2019m excited about the gospel bridges that could be built through my connections in the entertainment industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf God leads you to support me through Patreon, I promise to give you an in-depth report on everything I am doing at least once a month, answer any questions you might have, and share reports about my time and income (plus the \u201crewards\u201d listed for specific donation amounts on the bottom left of this page).  Thank you so much for praying about and considering a partnership with me in using the gifts and experience God has given me, for the purpose of glorifying Him and blessing my family and many other people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Christ,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDave\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(If you haven\u2019t seen them already, please take a look at my two blogs, \u003ca href=\"http://www.thewaywithwords.net\"\u003ewww.thewaywithwords.net\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.truthisnostrangertofiction.net.)\"\u003ewww.t\u003c/a\u003eruthisnostrangertofiction.net)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I have been the primary editor on five published non-fiction books, the co-author of two, and sole author of two more. I have worked for World Magazine and am currently an editor at Cruciform Press. I have written two novels published by Macmillan and have an upcoming release with Tor/Forge. I have been a founding principal and teacher in two small K-12 schools, taught high school classes for four years at Delaware County Christian School near Philadelphia PA, and taught middle and high school classes for a combined ten years at Grace Academy of Napa CA and Generations Home Scholars in Chester Springs PA. I started two churches from scratch as a \"church planting pastor,\" one in Sonoma CA and one in Malvern PA. I served and managed those entire organizations as their primary leader for a combined seventeen years, and did that for various departments of other churches for an additional seven years. I was a personal assistant to Dr. John MacArthur for seven years. I have also failed repeatedly (and sometimes spectacularly) in all these endeavors, and have learned as much if not more from my failures as I have my successes.\u003cbr\u003e",
