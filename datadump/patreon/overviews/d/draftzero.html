Our episode are epic deep-dives into the art and the mechanics of storytelling for the screen.\u00a0With every episode, our goal is to unearth practical techniques and tools for storytellers.\u00a0If you want to sound fancy, you\u0027d call it \"narrative aesthetics\". But we ain\u0027t fancy...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are Chas and Stu, two Australian filmmakers, who are trying to really understand our craft. And we do that by looking \"under the hood\" of great movies and TV shows.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve been doing this since 2014. We pick a particular topic or thesis \u2014 for example, how shifting the audience\u0027s point of view can heighten their emotions \u2014 and then set ourselves homework: reading scripts and watching screen stories. We then record our podcast \u2014 arguing, debating, and exploring these topics in depth \u2014 and share our discoveries with our listeners. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur episodes aren\u0027t for the faint of heart: they average 90 minutes each. Our longest is over 3 hours. If you want something like \n\u003cem\u003e\u0027Top Ten Tips For Dialogue\u0027\u003c/em\u003e, we ain\u0027t for you. But if you want an in-depth, passionate and analytical discussion: you\u0027ve come to the right place. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur listeners run the range from complete beginners to established showrunners \u0026amp; directors, and everyone in-between. Some of our listeners\u0027 favourite episodes tackle catharsis, exposition, tactics and dialogue. We even got schooled by Tarantino himself after his listened to us breaking down his work. It was humbling... but it was rewarding, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can find and listen to our current episode list here: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://draft-zero.com/episodes/\"\u003ehttp://draft-zero.com/episodes/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOr listen to our latest episode below: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" height=\"120\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eSo far, we\u0027ve done this at our own expense. As we said, we love it. We\u0027re going to continue doing it too for as long as we can \u2014 which, if you\u0027ve heard an episode, can be a really long (and fun) time. So no pressure. It\u0027s all there and freely available.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe most common complaint about Draft Zero (surprisingly) is not the epic length of our episodes. It\u0027s that they don\u0027t come often enough. If you\u0027re lucky, you get an episode every 6 to 8 weeks. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main reason for the delay isn\u0027t the homework or the recording. It\u0027s finding the time to edit when both Stu and Chas are trying to y\u0027know actually make films.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf Stu and Chas could pay someone a fair rate to edit their monster podcasts, then they could release more episodes, more regularly. It\u0027s that simple.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://draft-zero.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/03_SoWhyPatreon.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u0027t want sponsorship for Draft Zero. We don\u0027t want to endorse any particular product or service. Unless you\u0027re Laphraoig and want to send us sweet, peaty whisky. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe won\u0027t paywall our content. We want Draft Zero to be freely available to everyone, everywhere. We have listeners worldwide from Iraq to China to Russia to the US and, of course, Australia. If you can\u0027t afford film school or a online master class, you can always listen to Draft Zero.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe may do merchandise cause merch is cool, but it\u0027s a poor way to raise money that feeds directly into us producing more episodes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re not script gurus. We\u0027re not trying to sell you our \"script coaching\" services or workshop tours or our e-book. We\u0027re just two screenwriters trying to work out how to get better at our craft.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re not here to monetise Draft Zero. We\u0027re here to make better movies and TV... and maybe narrative games too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon offers us a simple, direct relationship with our audience. If you like our podcast, want more episodes more frequently, \n\u003cbr\u003e\nthen please consider becoming a patron.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for continuing to listen and support what we do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://draft-zero.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/04_WhereDoesMyMoneyGo.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s where your money will get you (and us)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e$20 an episode will cover the hosting fees\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e$600 an episode, we will guarantee a monthly release\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e$1000 an episode, we will guarantee a monthly release plus be able to pay for a transcript of an episode.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e$1500 an episode, we will guarantee two episodes a month plus transcripts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe different reward tiers are detailed on your right. \n\u003cem\u003eRight\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0as in your not left.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
