    "summary": "For me, drawing isn\u0027t just a fun creative outlet, it\u0027s been a tool lately that has helped me open up, not just as an artist, but as a person.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee, up\u00a0until very recently I suffered from crippling anxiety and depression. Among the many other limitations that it placed on me was how difficult it made it for me to be myself. I had no confidence whatsoever in myself, much less for my capabilities as an artist.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of months ago my doctor put me on a combination of medications that have made a world of difference, but in spite of the progress that I\u0027ve made I\u0027m still fighting some 30 odd years of habit, for lack of a better term. Sharing my art on Twitter has been very crucial to helping me break those habits and build the confidence in myself that I deserve.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for why I\u0027m starting this Patreon, it\u0027s because I\u0027m facing a conundrum of sorts that could keep me from doing what I love for a good long while. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I\u0027m on a very tight fixed income, with every last cent that I get having been spoken for long before I ever get a hold of it. I\u0027m only drawing now due to the amazing generosity of a great friend of mine, who paid for pencils and paper for me and encouraged me to give serious consideration to using them again. Unfortunately, though, the materials that he hooked me up with are quickly drying up.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that in mind, it\u0027s my hope that if you dig the sketches that I\u0027ve been uploading to Twitter and would like to help me continue along my journey of self-improvement and progression, both an artist and a human-being, then perhaps you\u0027ll consider donating a buck or two towards helping to help me keep this positive creative outlet for a little while longer.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy sketches are rough, but I think that I\u0027ve already managed to make significant progress in the couple of months since I picked up drawing again for the first time in 13 years. With your help, I\u0027m excited to continue to improve my skills and further hone my style.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your time and consideration.\u003cbr\u003eDr. Science Wizard. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
