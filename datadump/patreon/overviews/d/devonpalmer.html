I also just started an exclusive patron only podcast that I plan on doing once a week! I also do a lot of giveaways. Most of the time I give away pieces from The Palmer Company brand, and choose multiple winners. If any of that interests you, it would be an honor for you to join and check it out. Thank you for your support and believing in whatever it is that I do. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHELLO, MY NAME IS DEVON PALMER. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW ME AS @LEATHERSHIRTS FROM TWITTER AND FORMERLY VINE. SINCE THE CLOSING OF VINE I HAVE MOVED ON TO MAKING LONGER SKETCHES ON YOUTUBE. HOWEVER, THE QUALITY OF MY WORK HAS SUFFERED, SINCE ALL I HAVE TO CREATE VIDEOS WITH RIGHT NOW IS MY IPHONE 5C. NO SPECIAL LIGHTING, OR STUDIO SETUPS, OR EVEN A LAPTOP IS INCLUDED IN MY CREATING PROCESS DUE TO MY CURRENTLY VERY TINY BUDGET. THIS WASN\u0027T A PROBLEM WHEN I WAS MAKING 6 SECOND VIDEOS, BUT THAT TIME HAS COME AND GONE, AND I AM READY FOR MY FUTURE OF CREATING. I HAVE TONS OF IDEAS, HOWEVER,THE LACK OF RESOURCES HAS A MAJOR EFFECT ON HOW WELL I CAN MAKE MY VIDEOS AND HOW OFTEN I CAN MAKE THEM. I WOULD LIKE TO BE RELEASING VIDEOS AT \u003cstrong\u003eLEAST\u003c/strong\u003e ONCE EVERY WEEK, AND WITH YOUR SUPPORT I TRULY BELIEVE I CAN DO THIS. FOR THOSE WHO MISS MY VINES AND WOULD LOVE TO BE SEEING MORE FROM ME, I CAN DO IT WITH YOUR HELP. I ALSO LOVE MAKING MUSIC AND HAVE HAD PLANS OF RELEASING AN EP THAT HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW, AGAIN DUE TO THE FACT THAT I DON\u0027T HAVE THE INSTRUMENTS TO PROPERLY CRAFT MY SOUND. YOU CAN SEE THIS IN THE MUSIC I HAVE RELEASED IN THE PAST. ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, I HAVE RECENTLY STARTED A NEW CLOTHING BRAND, \"THE PALMER COMPANY\". IT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY TO FUND A BRAND, AND CURRENTLY I AM TRYING TO COLLECT THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE HIGH QUALITY CLOTHING AT THE LOWEST PRICE POSSIBLE FOR ALL OF YOU. SO, SUPPORTING THIS PATREON WOULD ALSO BE HELPING ME GET THIS BRAND OFF THE GROUND. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE OF MY CRAZY IDEAS THROUGHOUT THE PAST 3 YEARS, AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE COMING HERE TO SUPPORT ME TODAY. I AM SO GRATEFUL AND I LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
