    "summary": "Creating games is awesome. Writing code that controls how your game is played, designing models and assets, building immense landscapes, composing epic soundtracks, or recording hard-hitting sound effects - it\u0027s an incredible experience when many talented individuals work together to produce a work of art. But none of that is free. For better or worse, we exist in a world with an economy, where talented individuals require money to do things like eat or buy basketballs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Sol Prime?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSol Prime is a space exploration game with heavy focus on player-driven research and development.
