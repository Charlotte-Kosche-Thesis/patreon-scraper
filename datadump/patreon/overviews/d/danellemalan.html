I graduated from the Michaelis School of Fine Art (UCT) in 2010, with a BA in Fine Art,\u00a0majoring in painting. I currently live in Cape Town with my husband Ben and our two needy but adorable cats.

I am also recovering from a severe case of RSI in my drawing hand. I have struggled with this condition for more than 9 years now and lately it has gotten to a point where loss of fine motor control and pain make it difficult for me to commit to illustration commissions. I have tried several types of treatments but to no avail. I finally saw a neurologist on 29/03/2017, and he said that what I have is not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome as was previously thought, nor is it focal dystonia (phew!). I need to rest the hand... for a LONG time. We\u0027re talking months, perhaps even a year or more. As a result, I have practically stopped taking commissions, but instead make art that I feel is within my capacity, and which I don\u0027t feel pressurised to complete by a set deadline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the RSI, I will be doing a lot of left-handed work. You can follow along and see my progress as I try to get my left hand up to speed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like working in watercolour, ink and pencil. I love many types of media really, but those are the most common ones you will see from me. Watercolour in particular is my favourite. I also work digitally in Photoshop CC but the stylus hurts my hand so I don\u0027t do that as often lately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I can, I stream my traditional work on twitch!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dwuff\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCome on over!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also sell my work on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/dwuff\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy seeing my art and reading my ramblings.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove\u003cbr\u003eDanelle\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS:\u00a0For obvious reasons, I will wait for payments to clear before mailing off any physical Patreon rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e-FAQ-\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have a list of rewards which you can see listed on my page.
