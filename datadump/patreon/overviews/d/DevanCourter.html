     "description": "Three is one! This is the concept of the trinity. Take Red light, Green light, and Blue light for example. All three of them are light, all three are separate colors of light, but when those three colors are overlaid, the result is white light. This white light is one light, but it is also three different lights, red, green, and blue simultaneously. They both work together and become one and the same. Conveniently and coincidentally God is described as light! Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are like the primary colors of what makes up the Most High God. In the Hebrew, He is called \"Elohim\". The word \"Elohim\" is plural. The general name for \"God\" in the Hebrew is plural indicating more than one, but over and over again in scripture we see that God declares that He is one person and that there is none other besides Him. Elohim would be the one perfectly unified white light containing three individual lights (plurality).",

     "description": "The Ten Commandments fit into two categories of 5. The first five deal with having love and reverence for God, and the second five deal with love and reverence to man. We might be wondering about number 5, which seems to be leaning more towards loving our fellow man instead of our God, however God puts emphasis on respecting those whom He has put in authority. Unless the authority is going against the authority of God, dishonoring and disrespecting authority, especially that which God has placed in charge is the same as disrespecting God. We see this in the book of numbers with Korah disrespecting the authority that God gave Moses.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire Law is summed up in two principals. Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength, which is the great commandment. The second is like it, love thy neighbor as thy self. Jesus split these into two commandments because most of us don\u0027t realize that if we love the LORD our God with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind, and with all our strength that this actually includes loving thy neighbor as thyself. That is why Jesus says \"Blessed is He who keeps the Ten Commandments\". At the end of the day, it is the Ten Commandments that should be the guiding principles of our lives. The Law is one, Love the LORD our God with all our hearts, with all our souls, with all our minds, and with all our strength.\u003c/p\u003e",

     "description": "Seven is often a number that is associated with God. For instance, God has seven Spirits:\n\u003cp\u003e1. Spirit of the LORD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Spirit of wisdom\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Spirit of understanding\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Spirit of counsel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Spirit of power\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6.

We know that God is light and that the trinity is explained by the three primary colors of light coming together to make white light which is one and three simultaneously. Now, take that same white light, which contains the three primary colors and shine it through a prism. The result is a band of light made of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These seven colors make up a complete rainbow. All seven of these colors are separate colors, but they are all light, and they even farther are all contained within the one white light. This explains the seven spirits of God and how He has seven spirits.\u003c/p\u003e",
