    "summary": "Thank you so much for checking me out. It means that you are considering and that means a lot to me. My channel is meant to educate as I educate myself in learning all things that go into lighting a set. From breaking down tools in very quick episodes to lengthy setups or tips and tricks. I am probably no different than you in the sense that Ive seen tons of information out there on how to filmmaking such as FilmRiot, Cinematography Database, VideoCopilot, DSLRvideoshooter, IndyMogul etc etc etc.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I started this channel to really highlight what goes into lighting as I feel that most tutorials out there are usually just scratching the surface with c-stands only. But there are literally thousands of tools that seem to have little to no explanation as to how to use or what its called and I hope my channel helps clear it up for the new guy....or girl.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn my channel, I dont talk about cameras, lenses, after fx, special fx or any of that. This is strictly a channel that I hope helps people better understand lighting tools and lights.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the time of this post I have 38 episodes and people really dig it and im sure that i have about 1000 more to go, but Im coming up to the end of my inventory and will either have to purchase or rent equipment to continue making tutorials. Not to mention even the rentals can become very pricey and even though the rental house is willing to help here and there, there are just some tools they cant let me just borrow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example, one of the most expensive lights out there is called an 18k and it costs about $40,000 and it\u0027s as big as an orchestra bass drum. Obviously I cant buy something like that for 2 reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1) I\u0027d prank my roomate by setting it up outside his window, to make him think its noon when really its 2a.m. consistently\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n2) its expensive\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut to rent that light for the day is $1200. I can\u0027t afford that either and that\u0027s not to mention what else I need to rent just to power it and show an example on the show. Here\u0027s a link that shows the light\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details\u0026amp;O=\u0026amp;Q=\u0026amp;ap=y\u0026amp;c3api=1876%2C%7Bcreative%7D%2C%7Bkeyword%7D\u0026amp;gclid=CjwKEAjw3pTJBRChgZ3e7s_YhAkSJAASG9VruYKxBn2DdPUQDeNPH7eG_1lm1KbBxhgW0DgUWBSDERoCAG_w_wcB\u0026amp;is=REG\u0026amp;sku=192477\"\u003ehttps://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to continue making weekly videos but I need your help in order to really start digging into the more complicated and fun stuff. There\u0027s also some interviews Id like to shoot but requires me to travel to either LA, NY, or Chicago. Additionally I have another channel that I am thinking about creating, but I haven\u0027t thought of a name yet and has nothing to do with film but I think it\u0027ll be a good one. So with your support I can continue to make not just this channel, but launch the other as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much again for taking a moment to read this. I really appreciate the support.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details\u0026amp;O=\u0026amp;Q=\u0026amp;ap=y\u0026amp;c3api=1876%2C%7Bcreative%7D%2C%7Bkeyword%7D\u0026amp;gclid=CjwKEAjw3pTJBRChgZ3e7s_YhAkSJAASG9VruYKxBn2DdPUQDeNPH7eG_1lm1KbBxhgW0DgUWBSDERoCAG_w_wcB\u0026amp;is=REG\u0026amp;sku=192477\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
