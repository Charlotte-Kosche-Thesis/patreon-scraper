    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA nobody. Well... I guess you could say I am a gamer from way back then who still enjoys 2D games. But lately I\u0027ve been feeling that they\u0027ve been lacking something... for that reason I have decided to make my own game with my little amount of knowledge I have over coding to fill that void. I also have nothing better to do... and I need to find an excuse so that I can procrastinate on my homework.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy make a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell I honestly didn\u0027t want to make one at first but a certain friend of mine kept insisting that I do make one. So I did not sure if many people would follow me but I appreciate all the support you all can give me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHonestly... I just have free time and want to learn more about coding by\u00a0\u003cdel\u003etorturing\u00a0myself\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0learning as I go by creating something I find fun and that other people may possibly enjoy. This really is just so I can give the guys who created these texture packs money so that I can add on what I need as I work on the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about the game?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIts a 2D Dungeon Crawler so the good old fashion grinding, looking for chests hidden in places, beating bosses, \u003cdel\u003ekilling your friends\u003c/del\u003e, and maybe in the future co-op. Not sure how I\u0027m going to work out co-op yet to be honest. PvP is quite simple your party goes up against theirs whoever is a bigger noob gets an L. There are thing I want to try with this project in mind so if certain things get added on and then later taken off it probably means I didn\u0027t like that.\u003cbr\u003e"
