How to play without anxiety, how to change your ideas and change your playing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u2019re not a guitarist you may enjoy supporting this work, having front row seats to new sketches, home recordings, musings, stories...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps me carry on working, carry on creating new music and sharing this music with others in lessons, learning materials and recordings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBackground...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a guitarist based in Cape Town, South Africa. I have been translating the music of the kora (a 21 string harp from West Africa) onto solo classical guitar. The first album I made of this music (my ninth album) was Top of the World for Songlines Magazine and has resulted in global tours and offers to collaborate or arrange for some of music\u0027s greats (John Williams, Toumani Diabate, Debashish Battacharya, Kronos Quartet). The follow up album Libraries on Fire was awarded Best Album Africa and Asia for 2017. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to see great classical musicians the world over recognising the composers of Africa, especially those that come from oral traditions and whose music has not been available to classical musicians who can only work from written scores.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd at the same time to transform how we play and listen to music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "\u003cem\u003e\u201cFive stars\u2026Gripper has brilliantly transferred [the kora] repertoire onto a regular six string guitar. He sees [Toumani] Diabat\u00e9 as the Segovia, or indeed John Williams, of the kora, championing it as a solo instrument. And Gripper brilliantly takes it back to the guitar. He\u2019s opening a whole new repertoire of classical guitar music\u2026bringing African guitar into the classical mainstream.\u201d \u003c/em\u003e[Simon Broughton - Evening Standard]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo reads the Evening Standard\u2019s review of Derek Gripper\u2019s two sold out concerts at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe theatre with legendary classical guitarist John Williams, just a little over a year after the release of his 2012 recording \u201cOne Night on Earth: Music from the Strings of Mali.\u201d In this album Derek arranged and performed on classical guitar the compositions of three of Mali\u2019s greatest instrumental virtuosos: Toumani Diabat\u00e9, Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 and Ballak\u00e9 Sissoke; most of which were originally composed for and played on the kora, a 21 string African harp-lute, one of Africa\u2019s most beautiful and complex instruments. UK\u2019s top world music publication Songlines Magazine called the album \u201da staggering achievement,\u201d selecting the recording as a Top of the World album in March 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDerek\u2019s output extends beyond Africa to include original compositions, interpretations of the works of Brazilian composer Egberto Gismonti, collaborations with classical Indian tabla, innovation of South African folk sounds, and arrangements of J.S.Bach\u2019s solo violin works. Classical Guitar Magazine called his 2011 recording of original compositions set alongside the works of Gismonti \u201can excellent album\u2026of hypnotic beauty\u201d whilst Guitar International says of the same album that his world class ability \u201cis able to transcend the instrument itself.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cGripper has cracked it\u2026his playing has a depthless beauty, which does full justice to the complexity of Toumani\u2019s compositions. To do so without any hint of the music being dumbed down is a staggering achievement on solo guitar.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e [Nigel Williamson, Songlines Magazine] \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cMore than a labour of love, Gripper has brought a new purity to the dream-like improvisatory nature of these compositions. My recording of the year, so far!\u201d\u003c/em\u003e [Tim Panting, Classical Guitar Magazine]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201dThe result is astounding, not just for its technical brilliance, but its musicality. Gripper executes these pieces with the precision and attention to detail one might expect from a great classical musician\u2026It\u2019s hard to imagine a more impressive and passionate rendering of Malian music on classical guitar.\u201d \u003c/em\u003e[Banning Eyre, Afropop Worldwide]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cA true synthesis and a great album.\u201d \u003c/em\u003e[Ian Kearey, fRoots]",
