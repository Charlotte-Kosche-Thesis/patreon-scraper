    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell HELLO, and THANK YOU for visiting my Patreon community page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Dan Drouin, but my friends call me \u003cstrong\u003eDanno\u003c/strong\u003e and I run \u003cstrong\u003eBlack Heart Designs\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 For over 30 years now I have operated as an artist, sign painter, pinstriper and an all around graphic designer. I am involved in a variety of mediums ranging from photo realistic pencil sketching, commercial lettering and sign making to pinstriping and doing hand painted graphics on hot rods, classic cars and motorcycles. A lot of what I do is done \u003cstrong\u003e\"old school\"\u003c/strong\u003e which is to say...\u003cstrong\u003efree-hand\u003c/strong\u003e. However over the years I also learned how to create computer generated graphics which, in conjunction with my hand painting skills I output commercial signs, logo designs, T shirts, stickers, flyers and business cards. Heck, just about anything that has an artistic graphic design to it, I have done it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ever since I was a child I have been drawing, painting, fabricating, daydreaming and exploring and I always knew this was what I wanted to be doing for the entirety of my life. Over the many years that I have been engaged as a professional artist I have had the pleasure to meet and befriend some wonderful clients. Many who have gone on to become actually quite good friends of mine who I am eternally grateful for, not only for their friendship but also for their patronage towards my career. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why is Danno on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 I joined this exciting new platform in hopes that I can pursue my personal dream of creating and selling artwork that isn\u0027t as much tied to a commercial level of output as I have been doing in the past. I love all the work that I do and plan on still working at whatever comes in the door, however I have a number of personal art projects that I would love to get started and see them finished to the end. With your support I could now dedicate the time I need to in order to accomplish this goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Well hey...you\u0027ll be helping out a friend to live out his dream, right! Furthermore, I have listed on my page a number or Reward Tiers ranging from $1 per month support all the way to $1500 per month. \u003cbr\u003eEach Tier has different perks as described and some of the support I get from you and other patrons will go towards improvements and adding variety to those reward tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd just where does that monetary support go to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 I have a few ideas I would like to expand on, ranging from adding a few more designs to a t-shirt line and having more prints readily available of my pieces (which will both become available to my supporters), to making purchases of new equipment and better supplies which in turn will go right towards improving my art productivity.\u003cbr\u003eI do also have an ultimate goal of purchasing a truck camper so I can take myself and my dog on the road and travel about meeting new people and creating new video content as well as artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my hope that you will be interested in becoming a patron of my page and join me in this opportunity to see the growth and development of the work I do and we too can become life long friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAgain, I thank you for checking out my Patreon community page and I hope to hear from you soon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eregards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDanno \u003cem\u003e\"the artist\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
