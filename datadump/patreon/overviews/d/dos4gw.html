HIT THE FREE SAMPLER PACK HERE!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s some more backstory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m based in Melbourne, Australia, and my productions have been used in releases with artists, in indie films, and in games all over the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe whole thing is\u00a0pretty trippy. I can still clearly recall where I was when I heard the first track a rap artist I\u0027d never met had done with one of my beats - on the toilet in a house I shared with a friend in Perth. I almost fell off. It felt like I had climbed a mountain that I never expected to even see.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u0027ve: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ereleased a double EP and full length instrumental albums on different labels\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehad beats featured on digital albums, mixtapes, vinyl, remixes, and collaborations with artists from Vienna to Venice Beach\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003etoured Australia and the USA, played in warehouse spaces in Brooklyn, pubs in Collingwood, house parties in Portland, and forest raves in WA (they paid me in LSD; it was a good day)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edone production for rappers like GDP, Armand Hammer (Elucid + billy woods), released vinyl in Europe with Mr DNA, and\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehad a tune of mine in an independent gay adventure game (Escape From Pleasure Planet, check it out on steam!).\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd it\u0027s still a crazy buzz. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m just a dude with a computer and a synth or two, making music whenever I can, in the gaps between family, work, and life. I didn\u0027t expect to do these things. It\u0027s.. trippy. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel very flattered and lucky to even be in the position where I can use my time and creative energy to make new art with other artists and also engage people with new material. So .. thank you. I really appreciate the opportunity to do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because I want to try a different way to distribute and release my music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you look at my accounts over at places like Soundcloud or Bandcamp, the releases are quite sporadic. It looks like I take ages to put together a release (because good art sometimes takes time, especially when there\u0027s more than 1 person involved), but the reality is that a release can come together quite quickly these days. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy latest LP, \u003cem\u003eONE\u003c/em\u003e, was written in an ~8 week period, mostly on the train on the way to work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s by far my most cohesive and best work, which is great. But it took ages for it to see the light of day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s lots of material still \u0027in the works\u0027 with artists all over the place. There are about 4 irons in the fire right now at different stages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a lounge-room-studio independent musician in 2017 - it shouldn\u0027t take me years to release music that takes me hours to write. These aren\u0027t concertos. This is the god damn internet we\u0027re talking about here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe big downside to my current\u00a0release process is that my fans (you guys!) don\u0027t get to hear most of the music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOnce I email over some files, I lose control over what the process is from that point. And that\u0027s hard to deal with, I really struggle with it, probably because of my enormous ego. But I write music so that I can connect with the world and the people in and around it. If the music is stuck on a hard drive or in an inbox, that doesn\u0027t happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s a recap:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI make a lot of music, all the time\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s good enough for artists to want to use it and people tell me it\u0027s good\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy supporters are lucky to hear something less than 2 years old, once a year\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDamn\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime to try something else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to connect directly with my listeners, and give them my quality product for a reasonable price, and be more self-sufficient. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to expand my audience and my collaboration potential by getting my beats out to as many people as possible. And I\u0027d also love to just make beats and support my family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThese are possible things on Patreon!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons here at Patreon will receive pretty much my entire output as it happens, in monthly batches of at least 2 beats.
