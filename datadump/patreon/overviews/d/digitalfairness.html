    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFounded in 2017, Consumers for Digital Fairness is not-for-profit advocacy group based around a team of motivated gaming citizens who have no ties to the gaming industry. We come from various backgrounds and sources of experience, but are unified in our concern for the state of gaming today. Many games, both free to play and retail, are moving towards a games as services model.  Commonly this is done in the form \"loot boxes.\"  Due to the potentially addictive and predatory nature of the loot box systems that require real-money inputs, other countries have already moved to protect consumers and regulate these types of loot boxes as a form of gambling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe know we can affect positive change in an industry we care deeply about, bring about real change for those who enjoy this medium, and restore the normal and honest practices games were known for. Our operational objectives include the implementation of state and federal advocacy plans, an education initiative for public officials, grassroots mobilizing opportunities for the concerned and gaming public, as well as the formation of a 501c4 organization to support these operations until our goals are met.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearn more at:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://digitalfairness.org/\"\u003ehttp://digitalfairness.org/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
