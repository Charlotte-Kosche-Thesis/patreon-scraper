Political street battles are becoming common, Jesus is appearing in waffles, cops are executing black people for breathing, and an entire section of the population legitimately thinks capitalism can be destroyed by the ballot box or without building a few guillotines. Yes, the age we live in is weird, truly and horribly weird, a breakneck techno-hellscape where you\u0027ll either be killed by flying robots or eaten alive by cancer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut when the going gets \u003cem\u003eweird\u003c/em\u003e, the weird turn\u003cem\u003e pro\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to cover the grandest story of any journalistic investigation: the epic tragedy that is the human condition and its unrelenting desire to be free. No assurances about the ending, no home office to report to if things get too tight, just 7.5 billion rabid apes armed to the teeth and spinning on a rock getting more filled with poisonous shit by the day. It\u0027s a story I tell through news reports, narratives, books, and essays.\u00a0My tales are bitter truths and rousing calls for rebellion, narratives both mundane and soaked in sorcerous wisdom, shared freely at no cost as my gift to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I need your help in telling them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided long ago that I\u0027d be a new breed of writer, a hoodoo-slingin\u0027 gonzo reporter with a personal vendetta against all he finds exploitative. I\u0027ve done well so far and you, dear reader, are to thank for that, but\u00a0I can\u0027t afford to do the amount of writing I\u0027d like to working 40 hours a week. Your help will allow me to investigate more stories, write more books, and drunkenly trek to wherever the action may be, with the goal of eventually writing full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return at every level you\u0027ll have access to my patron-exclusive \"Afterthoughts,\" short videos dealing with concepts discussed in my articles I couldn\u0027t explain elsewhere as well as answers to any questions that might have come up along the way. I often have to leave 1,000-2,000 words on the cutting room floor; this is your chance to hear Bonesy wisdom free from editors and polite society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe media has the power to shape real events by interpreting them, a power increasingly capable of mobilizing bodies: Breitbart is in the fucking White House, InfoWars is only growing, and right-wing hacks like Sargon of Akkad are rolling in cash. This is not the time to be silent.\u00a0Each dollar you send my way is a bullet in the chamber of a gun we\u0027re building together, one that fires a massive .44 round at the heads of politicians and capitalists alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to inject an Anarchist opinion into the wider world, one that calls not for peaceful marches but riots and death hexes, do me a favor and help support my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t, support me anyway. I\u0027ll at least make the extinction of everything very entertaining."

     "description": "The big one. I\u0027m getting to the point where I\u0027m just popular enough to have my writing take over my life but not making enough to give it the attention it needs. If I can get $1000 a month I can go down to part time and focus on writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a dangerous move. Full-time jobs are scare in these parts and my benefits are almost unheard of. I\u0027m willing to risk everything, including retirement, on the hope that my writing matters enough to pursue full time. With even just an extra 5 hours a week I can up my social media game, do more essays, and start churning out my next book. There is no promise I\u0027ll make it and if Patreon zucc\u0027s me I\u0027d be deep, deep up shit creak.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m willing to take that chance. I\u0027m willing to believe in the words I write enough to stake my family\u0027s livlihood on them. Help me achieve this dream and I promise you\u0027ll give birth to a monster.",
