So I invited all my friends with dogs. And they invited all their friends with dogs. And then YOU joined!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTHEN WE ENCOURAGED YOU TO \u003cstrong\u003ePARTICIPATE\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe encouraged you to jump right in, introduce yourself, and tell us your story. We all began sharing this really special part of our lives, and then something incredible happened...\u003cbr\u003e\nDWD started to become really important to people!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOver the last three and a half years, we\u2019ve been your entertainment, your therapist, your vet\u2019s waiting room, and your personal cheer squad. We\u2019ve encouraged you to be your \u003ca href=\"http://dwd.is/drools\"\u003ebest self\u003c/a\u003e and pay attention to the life lessons your dog teaches you: be authentic, be inclusive, \u201clike\u201d everyone. We support you in every phase of your dog parenting journey. We\u0027re probably even your favorite thing on Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, with over 55,000 members, we\u0027re more than just a big family of like-minded dog lovers. We\u2019re a movement. It\u2019s time to take DWD to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut what\u2019s that mean?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt means getting the word out so every like-minded Dog Dad and Dog Mom has the opportunity to join us. It means creating new ways to engage, like a mobile app that makes it easier for you to meet DWDs in your area. It means using our size and our influence for good, through charitable giving. And it means being the change we want to see in our community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is the future of Dudes With Dogs. But we can\u0027t get there without YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNOW WE\u2019RE ASKING YOU TO \u003cstrong\u003eCONTRIBUTE\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIntroducing the \u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/dudeswithdogs\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCONTRIBUTING MEMBER\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e program.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eStarting today, for as little as $1 a month, you can be a Dudes With Dogs Contributing Member. We\u2019re using Patreon, a platform that uses crowd-sourced regularly-occurring micro-payments to help provide creators a stable source of income so they can achieve their goals and continue to do what they love to do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAsk yourself:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo you believe in our mission to encourage, celebrate, and support Dog Dads and Moms?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo you appreciate the positive environment we\u2019ve created, and realize it\u2019s the result of a lot of hard work?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHave we helped you through a tough time, and have you wondered if there was something you could do to give back?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWould you feel a loss if DWD wasn\u2019t around, especially knowing there was something you could have done to help?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLastly, are you excited about DWD\u2019s future and the tremendous amount of good that we can do not just for ourselves, but for our community?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you answered YES to any of these questions, then I hope the answer\u2019s already clear to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDudes With Dogs is without a doubt the most meaningful thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life. You guys are my passion, and it\u2019s my heart\u2019s desire to continue to grow DWD and create new ways for our community to connect both online and in the real world. But I can\u2019t do it without you. The truth is, I\u0027m just wasting my time if you guys aren\u0027t on board. Be on board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe a Contributing Member.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank You!\u003cbr\u003e\nChris\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris Rolczynski\u003cbr\u003e\nFounder, Dudes With Dogs\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWHY NOW?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, we\u2019re becoming a victim of our own success. With our size and sheer volume of posts, managing the group has become more than a full time job, and rents, websites, advertising, and development projects don\u2019t pay for themselves. Rather than continue to limp along, we\u2019re asking for everyone to pitch in so we can move forward. If we\u2019re gonna do this, LET\u2019S DO THIS.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIS IT MANDATORY?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNo, but since you can contribute for as little as $1 a month, I hope you\u2019ll choose to! After all, that monthly micropayment means the difference between DWD slowly dying or continuing to grow. It means we can finally be more than just a Facebook group. It means you\u2019ll be better able to meet other Dog Dads in your area. And it means bringing the awesomeness of DWD to more people around the world. Isn\u2019t that an easy decision to make?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWHY MEMBER SUPPORTED?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMuch like your local public radio station, what DWD offers, we give away for free. But our costs can\u2019t be ignored, and rather than sell out to companies eager to sell stuff to you, we\u2019d rather retain the pureness of our community. Besides, it\u2019s human nature for people to get increased fulfillment from something in which they\u2019re personally invested. Being a Contributing Member is a great opportunity for you to invest even more in the community you love.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWHY SHOULD I PAY WHEN FACEBOOK IS FREE?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFacebook doesn\u2019t manage, administer, moderate, or cultivate our community. Nor do they share any of the ad revenue our community generates. In other words, Facebook may give us the groups framework for free, but otherwise we\u2019re on our own.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCAN\u2019T YOU JUST GET A CORPORATE SPONSOR?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eDon\u2019t you find constant advertising annoying? I know I do. Yet, that\u2019s exactly what a corporate sponsor would require. Also, our 100% original content format makes ads stick out like a sore thumb and changes the user experience. I don\u2019t want to do anything that would damage the community we\u2019ve worked so hard to build and I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t either.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDON\u2019T YOU MAKE MONEY FROM THE DWD SHOP?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMerchandise sales aren\u0027t a significant source of income and any profits made are used to develop new products. Merchandise isn\u2019t our priority. Community is.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWILL I RECEIVE A TAX DEDUCTION?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNo, since we aren\u2019t a non-profit. However, you can mark my words that a spirit of charity is in our future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOK, I\u2019M ALMOST SOLD\u2026 ARE THERE INCENTIVES FOR CONTRIBUTING?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYes! Please check out the reward levels at \u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/dudeswithdogs\"\u003epatreon.com/dudeswithdogs\u003c/a\u003e. Being a Contributing Member also makes you eligible for occasional perks like raffles, free products, and events. And if you sign up soon, you can be a FOUNDING MEMBER!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I hope the most important incentive is the satisfaction of knowing you\u2019re not only participating, but also contributing to the community that loves you back.\u003cbr\u003e"
