    "summary": "Hi There!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Matt and I operate out of little \u0027ol New Zealand. \u00a0I have been a passionate roleplayer in many genres of games, and I love the game and the people who play. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd... I freaking love maps...I love the stories they tell, the stories that unfold, and the sheer \u003cem\u003epotential \u003c/em\u003ethey hold. \u00a0Every map just speaks to me as GM, and they tell a different tale for different groups, PC\u0027s, scenario. \u00a0I love \u0027em.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to use the old laminated variety and whiteboard markers...but then, along came VTT\u0027s (Roll20, D20Pro, Fantasy Grounds etc)...and my word, everything changed. \u00a0I could barely hobble together ad-hoc maps on the fly...but put me in front of a computer and all the power came to my finger tips!! \u00a0I can make maps! \u00a0Good maps!! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo gather around the camp fire friends... I have a dream... to shed the chains of that burdensome real life job, and to make maps for roleplayers, people who spend their free time escaping that reality too. \u00a0But the reality of western capitalist democracy is... I need money... it sucks... I want to feed my kids with your gratitude, but they just want vegetables. \u00a0I want to pay my bills with your \u003cem\u003efeels\u003c/em\u003e, but customer service people just don\u0027t take maps for currency. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlas, I come to you in virtual rags...hand out...and ask for a little...neigh, a scrap...and plan to do that to the thousands who walk our path...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMake my dream a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do I make?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDamn fine question that. \u00a0I make Battlemaps. \u00a0They are digital in nature and can be downloaded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEach map is generally 85x48 in grid size (11520x6480 pixels)...so much larger than most maps that circulate for VTT work. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEach map is provided in High Resolution (in case you wish to print them out), and in Low Resolution (which is still great, and smaller file sizes are better for VTT\u0027s). \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMost come in both a Day and Night Version, and Gridded and Gridless versions. \u00a0A few don\u0027t.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAnd heres what makes my maps special...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI also provide Point Of View Shots taken from within the scene...from a characters perspective. \u00a0These really help set a scene quickly, and help a game run smoothly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThese are usually taken with both Day (Light) and Night (Dark) filters... so that the same map can be used with variety of time needs. \u00a0Another possibility, is to give the Night (Dark) POV shots to characters without darkvision...and the Day (Light) ones to characters with darkvision. \u00a0This will help characters actually appreciate a character ability in a non mechanical way.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI already host these maps on RPGNow, so when posting the Map Packs for my Patrons, I will send a link for a free download. \u00a0Please note, that this will require you to have a free RPGNow account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will I get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnother good question. \u00a0I generally manage to make one map a week when I\u0027m working. \u00a0When I\u0027m on holiday, I generally pump out 3-4 a week. \u00a0That would be reflective of how many I can make if I could dedicate myself full-time to this.\u003cbr\u003eSo dependent on the limit you set for your monthly payments, you will get a great deal on my maps. \u00a0If you miss something that is released after you reach your limit, you can find my maps on RPGNow - link below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also expanding my repertoire of map making skills, a work in progress if you will. \u00a0So, I will probably post them up for all Patrons to have freely as I learn these skills. These maps will be made using different software, and will probably be overland or city maps. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo far, these Battlemats have been really successful on RPGNow. \u00a0People really like them, and they do pay for them - generally US$5 each, more for more complex multilevel maps. \u00a0But having worked in the public service for too many years...I hate it when people don\u0027t show loyalty. \u00a0So this is my way of opening up a loyalty system. \u00a0Become a Patron, and you will get maps. \u00a0Way more maps, and cheaper than buying them one at a time. \u00a0Sure, some may not be exactly what fits right now...but they will fit one day...and knowing they\u0027re there might mean you won\u0027t hesitate if an opening appears...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to see my maps that I have made so far, check them out at RPGNow...\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com/browse/pub/9843/DM-Philosophy\"\u003ehttp://www.rpgnow.com/browse/pub/9843/DM-Philosoph...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach map has a video highlighting the features of the map - I make the video quite low res so that people don\u0027t screenshot it."
