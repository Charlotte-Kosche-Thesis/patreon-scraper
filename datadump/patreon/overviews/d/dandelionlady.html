    "summary": "I am a priestess in the the ADF tradition, a spirit worker, a homesteader, a spiritual artist, and a writer. \u00a0I swore my oath thusly:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI swore to serve the folk, love the land, and honor the gods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s what I do, in a nutshell. But if you peer inside that shell there is a world of work that happens. \u00a0You can help support that work as well as get inside peeks on my ongoing projects, choose topics for me to research and blog about, and get exclusive videos and blogs of my processes to make life more sustainable, beautiful, and child friendly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try and make as much of my content as free as possible, with the idea that the patreon and my etsy store will fund that content. \u00a0This is a business model I can get behind. It\u0027s how Wikipedia, Welcome to Night Vale, and The Guardian all run their businesses. I know that paid pagan clergy are simply not possible at this point, but I want to pioneer how we might actually leverage our skills to do such a thing, because this calling drives me. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see myself as working to create a world that is more sustainable, beautiful, and equitable. \u00a0I run funerals, weddings, baby and momma blessings, coming of age rites, high days, moon rites and more for my local community. \u00a0I live and work in the depressed economy of the Rust Belt, and sometimes the people I support have a hard time paying the $42.00 a year for grove and ADF membership. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been blogging through various methods for well over a decade now, and have created a great deal of online content, including articles, coloring pages, and videos. \u00a0My hope now is to earn enough money to update my video recording equipment so that I can start recording what I do again. \u00a0My videos focus on trancework, crafts, sustainability techniques, farming skills, and all the wide range of what I do. \u00a0I also hope to begin to record my workshops so that they can go digital too. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a great many pagan solitaries out there and I want to reach out and help create the things they need to have a thriving spiritual practice. I want to keep serving my community locally as well as my wider online community. Please help me to do so by becoming a supporter today. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo find my work around the web check out these social media sites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dandelionlady/\"\u003ehttp://www.patheos.com/blogs/dandelionlady/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/dandelionlady\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/dandelionlady\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dandelionlady/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/dandelionlady/\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe_P2SiobBcK1bIfJ5BOccg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
