    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome everyone to the Unreal 4 Lighting Academy!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am\u00a0very happy you found this page, so let me give you an overview of what you can expect :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Unreal 4 Lighting Academy is supposed to be a place to learn about video game lighting, composition and materials in a hopefully fun environment, which is led by Tilmann Milde aka \u003cstrong\u003eDaedalus51\u003c/strong\u003e, a technical Lighting Artist working on Star Wars at \u003cstrong\u003eEA DICE\u003c/strong\u003e in Stockholm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main pillars of the Lighting Academy is to be like Morpheus in the Matrix, showing and opening doors, rather than going the whole way until the end. I want to teach you how to use your tools effectively and not have you follow step-by-step guides that teach you almost nothing because you don\u0027t\u00a0think on your own and don\u0027t\u00a0really understand why you ended up with that particular result in the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMake your own decisions, try things out, be inspired by these videos and connect the dots to master your own lighting, environment art, and material creation skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Academy, I work on scenes from the community to help people with showing how someone from the industry would work and improve on them. We go over various things and theories, such as composition and the importance of color or value while tackling as many technical basics and workflows as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese scenes will never be released though, as they are a) not my property and b) I don\u0027t want you to follow step-by-step with these videos. Watch them while working on something similar or just to get inspired, but I think the learning effect is actually way bigger this way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne last thing which I think is important to know for you too is, I go in as unprepared as possible when starting new scenes and I usually \u003cstrong\u003eDONT \u003c/strong\u003eedit my videos! I want to show you my thought processes and how I approach creative problem solving, which is why my videos contain all the ugly stuff people usually cut away :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all that said, I hope you have a great time and enjoy my content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eDaedalus"

Before I joined DICE, I worked at YAGER in Berlin on the sadly canceled\u00a0Dead Island 2 and Dreadnaught as well. During this time and also my studying before, I heavily used Unreal Engine which actually kicked off my love for lighting and taking an already established image and push it even further visually speaking. Although I work with Frostbite now, I am still heavily using Unreal Engine for private\u00a0fun and I am very active on the forums, as I believe a healthy community is a vital part of every developing environment :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
