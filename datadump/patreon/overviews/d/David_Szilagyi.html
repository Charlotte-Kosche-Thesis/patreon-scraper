Lovecraft, Guillermo Del Toro, Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dead Space, F.E.A.R., Slender, Silent Hill, Akira, The Guyver, among many other wonderful classics. I love the worlds and lore that these experiences provide me, and I\u0027m here to give that experience back to the world, one horrific image at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patrons receive 2-3 high resolution illustrations per batch of content I make.
