    "summary": "Chances are, you\u0027re here because you found me on YouTube and we share an interest in adventure, treasure hunting and video production. If you\u0027re not familiar with my work, I\u0027ll give you the quick run down. My name is Brandon Neice. Some people know me as \"Dr.Tones\" from my YouTube series \"Dirt Fishin America: Off the Grid Treasure Hunting\". A series of videos that follows me and some of my crazier friends around the world metal detecting for coins, relics, gold nuggets, meteorites and more. Here\u0027s the thing though, we don\u0027t just go to the local parks and beaches. We put a special emphasis on rediscovering long forgotten and extremely remote civilizations, hence the name \"Off the Grid\". As you can imagine, it\u0027s an expensive and challenging endeavor. The time involved in researching the locations.The logistics of actually getting to the sites. Maintaining, replacing and upgrading equipment needed to film the adventures. The hours upon hours of editing the videos, and to top it off... All of these things need to happen in between my day job as a full time Firefighter Paramedic. Did I mention I\u0027m the sole supporter of my wife and 3 year old son? I\u0027d love to be able to have enough funding (and time) to consistently put out top notch videos for you. My aim is to show you exotic places and amazing treasures being rescued in a fun and family friendly manner. Your donations help keep this ship from sinking, and right now... I\u0027m climbing to the crows nest before this ship sinks silently into the ocean. Let\u0027s try to keep this treasure afloat! From here on out, my videos will ALWAYS remain FREE! Who knows? Maybe we\u0027ll even get to the point where I won\u0027t have to run adds over the top of them? \u003cstrong\u003eYour pledges will be on a per video basis and will be a monthly subscription that renews automatically.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Please keep in mind that no matter how many videos I upload, you\u0027ll only be charged for a maximum of 2 videos each month\u00a0i.e. If you pledge $1 per video, the most you\u0027ll pay per month is $2. You can also put a cap on your monthly limit if you choose. So please, if you enjoy my work, you watch it consistently and would like to see more of it, consider donating a small portion to help out. Watching the videos is free but making them isn\u0027t.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003eBrandon \"Dr.Tones\" Neice"
