Going from being a corporate graphic designer to a freestyle-anything-goes body artist?!... \u003cbr\u003eThe opportunity to be a true artist has been the greatest experience of my life!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince becoming a tattoo artist, i\u0027ve be \u003cstrong\u003emore creative\u003c/strong\u003e than I\u0027ve ever had the chance to in the past. Working with amazing clients and adorning their bodies with my work permanently, has been a \u003cstrong\u003edream come true\u003c/strong\u003e, but I still feel a void in my heart. While I spend so much time and energy bringing other peoples visions to life, I have no time to work on my own creations.\u00a0Most of my time and artistic energy has been directed to earning a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you can \u003cstrong\u003ehelp! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can spend more time working on Illustrations. The \u003cstrong\u003eultimate goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is to meet and work with other artists. To travel and showcase my work across the nation. Collaborate on putting together gallery events as well as attend national and international tattoo/ art conventions, so I can be available to meet fellow artists and fans from all over. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI know this dream has ways to go and a lot of planning, but with passion, support, and networking it can happen.\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003emost rewarding\u003c/strong\u003e part,of working on this project, is the shared passion of everyone involved.
