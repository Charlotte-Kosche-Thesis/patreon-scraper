    "summary": "Thank you so much for dropping by. It\u0027s nice to have you here for a visit. If you\u0027re here, it\u0027s because you probably read one of my books on Amazon and want to know what I\u0027m currently writing. Right? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo,\u00a0I\u0027m working on a series I call \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Edge of the Universe\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e. I currently have 259 story ideas for this series. Here\u0027s a quick synopsis of what it\u0027s about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\"When an international technology company, offers a naive young scientist billions of dollars for his technology to splice DNA, Art thinks he\u0027s made it and is living the life of his dreams. But when jealous colleagues, greedy corporations, and corrupt politicians get whiff of its true potential, Art will have to do whatever it takes to keep his invention from falling into the wrong hands.\"\u003c/blockquote\u003e Episode 1 is ready to read. It\u0027s called \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027On The Run\u0027 \u003c/strong\u003eand it\u0027s 34,730 words (about 100 pages) long. Here\u0027s what one recent reader\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/FijiMermaid89/status/1000414676201689088\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e @FijMermaid89 told me on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eI finished both and really liked the details where Art is making the deal. Wouldn\u0027t being an instant billionaire ROCK? Looking forward to more :)\u003c/blockquote\u003e My goal is to write at least a chapter a day. So, feel free to follow along with Art on this journey and enjoy the ride. I plan to drop stories in here before they go live\u00a0on Amazon once Season 1 is complete. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I plan to share all the extra stuff from the creative process that you wouldn\u0027t normally see. That\u0027s because a lot of my writing is just to try to get into the character\u0027s head and understand who they are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you sponsor me and these stories as a Patreon, you\u0027ll get extra stories and behind the scenes view as well, that wouldn\u0027t normally get published.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you\u0027ll get the satisfaction of helping the struggling artist who\u0027s been planning and outlining these stories for over two years now. I\u0027m just happy to have the opportunity to bring these characters and their stories to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to sponsor Dave Bailey and these stories, just click the big red \u0027Become A Patron\u0027 button to get started. Thank you and I look forward to what you think of Art\u0027s journey."
