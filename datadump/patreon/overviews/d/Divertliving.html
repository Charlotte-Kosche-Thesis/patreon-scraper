If you would\u0027ve asked us what we would be doing at 25, we would have never said traveling full-time. But we love it. The money will cover transportation costs when we are out travelling and creating videos! This will also help cover the majority of my accommodation which will keep us on the road longer and making a new video every day! We take our work very seriously. When we are travelling, we work everyday, filming all day and then editing all night, filming for up to 10 hours(sometimes longer, Editing for up to 10 hours+ for a single video. Vloggers are the new media now and we love to show everyone what the world is really like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAgain, thank you so much for even taking the time to read this.
