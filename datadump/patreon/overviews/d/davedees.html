    "summary": "I am Dave Dees, known to many as Mr. D or Dave the Doorman. \u00a0I have been a middle school art teacher for almost 11 years here in Baltimore, MD. \u00a0I am the type of teacher that gets along with the \"bad kids\" and I have been considered a favorite teacher by quite a large majority over the years (their words, not mine... \u00a0got some awards, and degrees too NBD.) \u00a0I respect the kids, and have a great passion for passing on my love for art. \u00a0I absolutely love what I do and want to do it for as long as I can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Because of this recent life experiences, I have decided I want to make something lasting that shares the thing I am most passionate about with the art education world, and all of it\u0027s art students. \u00a0In order to make that possible I have been creating lessons that can be used by students to teach themselves, or better yet parents can use them to learn it and then teach it to your kids. \u00a0ALL OF THAT IS FREE!!! ...Yes, I am quite magnanimous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have already started making things including sketchnotes on a blog at \u003ca href=\"http://www.stuffgettingmade.com\"\u003ewww.stuffgettingmade.com\u003c/a\u003e as well as creating YouTube videos on my Stuff Getting Made channel at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyup9stiN4ZkbM_mt5-m5w?view_as=subscriber\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyup9stiN4ZkbM_m...\u003c/a\u003e. However this takes a great deal of time and not an insignificant amount of money to do well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically I want everyone to enjoy learning how to draw for free. \u00a0I would also love it if people who had some extra cash, or people who just really enjoy what is getting done... or just fans of Mr. D forked out a little something for the cause of ART FOR EVERYONE!!! \u00a0Hold the applause, but come with the stacks. \u00a0This project needs cash to improve video quality, production quality, speed of release, time available to make videos, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards are BALLER!!! First, you get to influence the content. \u00a0If you wanna kick in a little something and you really want some particular subject covered in a video or a sketchnote... \u00a0I got you BOO *smooches* \u00a0Then there are autographed beard photos, personal videos, etc. go read it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShip it because you love art. \u00a0Chip in because you love ME. \u00a0Be a patron because of a secret life long love affair with sketchnotes which you never had the nerve to admit to the world, but you\u0027ll be damned if you aren\u0027t going to keep the Hottest sketchnotes on the web going forever. \u00a0Your secrets are safe with Old Mr. D. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*****LET\u0027S MAKE SOMETHING AWESOME FOR THE FUTURE OF THE ARTS, AND LET\u0027S DO IT TOGETHER!*****\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. I recently consulted with someone I know who is a total internet rockstar, so the next batch of stuff will KILL IT!!! (that means be good if you are a nerd... which is cool too. Nerd money is green, thats my scene.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~SAD HEALTH NEWS WARNING~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of last school year I found out I have cancer. I am lucky to have such a great doctor that found it almost impossibly early. I am also super lucky to live around the corner from one of the worlds foremost thyroid surgeons. I cannot believe how fortunate I have been with well wishes from everyone who already knows about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was working, until I recently was told to stop by a doctor (actually she laughed in my face when I told her about my 20 hr workdays on Fridays,)  the worlds greatest extra job as the doorman at the Bluebird in Hampden (basically worlds best bar, because of the worlds best ownership.) Unfortunately, even though I am super lucky to have some decent insurance, CANCER IS EXPENSIVE!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e That is hopefully where you want to come in.  I want to make these videos and lessons for the students in case I can\u0027t make it back to them as soon as I want to, but that requires time.  I could spend that time finding and working a less demanding second job...  or we could work together and make this into my second job which primarily pays for all my new medical bills, prescriptions, and lost wages.  Not to mention the small stack of bills that are waiting to be paid as we speak (what can I say, I tried not to have to tell anyone so they wouldn\u0027t look at me \u0027\u003cem\u003ethat way\u0027, \u003c/em\u003ebut now I have a cane and don\u0027t want to lie to my friends so I might as well ask for the help I have always offered to my friends when they were sick.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hello My name is Dave Dees, but many know me as Mr. D. \u00a0I have been a public school art teachers for (going on) 11 years. \u00a0I have always been the teacher the \"bad kids\" could get along with, and (their words, not mine) a favorite of a multitude of students over the years. \u00a0I have a passion for teaching and relating to kids during the middle school years when they need it most. \u00a0I absolutely love my job and I enjoy every student in their own way. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately I found out I have cancer at the end of last school year. \u00a0I have been living a normal life since I found out, and there is surgery coming up soon on the 10th of October. \u00a0I am really lucky for my doctor to have found it so early, and to live near the best thyroid surgeon in America. \u00a0I am super lucky to have all the well wishers, and super close people in my life. \u00a0I am just hoping the luck keeps up for the surgery too... Fingers Crossed! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe positive I am taking away from this situation is trying my best to create lasting versions of me doing what I have always loved, and what has created a passion for the arts in more than a few kids through the years. \u00a0I have been making YouTube videos \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyup9stiN4ZkbM_mt5-m5w?view_as=subscriber\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyup9stiN4ZkbM_m...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I have been creating blog posts with Sketchnotes (the coolest thing ever,) and videos for my blog at\u003cbr\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.stuffgettingmade.com\"\u003ewww.stuffgettingmade.com\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have been printing some of them out and using them at school when I have to miss days to go to the hospital, and the kids are absolutely obsessed with them. \u00a0I want to make them for everything I know how to teach eventually. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is that, even with the insurance I am lucky enough to have, it is not cheap to have cancer. \u00a0I was working the best second job ever as the doorman for the Bluebird in Hampden (aka Baltimore, Bmore, the 410) but I had to stop doing that because I started getting sick and the 20 hr workdays were no longer doctor recomended, actually she called me insane, lol. \u00a0So now I am trying this to make the money to cover my medical stuff and be able to make something lasting for the art education world, and all the art students. \u00a0I hope you want to help out with that!!",
