    "summary": "It was over a year ago that we \u2014 Courtney Algeo and Chris Zumski Finke \u2014 decided to start a podcast to talk about movies. We labored to find a concept that worked, lined up a roster of smart and inquisitive people from around the world, and started making a podcast. With some help from a local sponsor, Double Exposure was sent into the world. Our ultimate hope was that people might actually want to listen along, and it turns out some do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, after two full seasons of movie battles, two mini-series\u0027 focused on Steve Bannon and the end of the world, and even an\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.doubleexposuremn.com/episodes/2017/3/12/an-interview-with-guillermo-del-toro\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einterview with Guillermo del Toro\u003c/a\u003e, we are staring down the launch of season three. And to do that, we need some money. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA generous sponsorship from\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.trylon.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Trylon Microcinema\u00a0\u003c/a\u003ecovered most of our season one expenses, and support from our diehard fans has helped to support season two. Heading into season three, well, we\u0027d love to be able to reach more audiences. And to do that, we need money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe financial needs of Double Exposure are not complicated, but they are real. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst, Double Exposure isn\u0027t free. Not really. We have podcast and website hosting to cover. These are recurring, monthly fees. Additionally, there are equipment costs and occasional unexpected service fees that hit our pocketbooks. Not to mention fees associated with growing our listener base through that dirty thing called marketing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSecond, Double Exposure is growing. And as we do, we want to give more to our listeners. Compared to many podcasts, Double Exposure sounds pretty alright (good on Chris for making that happen). But we don\u0027t want to compare to many podcasts, we want to compete with the best podcasts. We want to give you a better experience every time you engage with us. That means recording more episodes, upgrading some of our equipment, creating our own ads, and giving back to you, be it with swag, giveaways, or events. The sky\u0027s the limit, once we know what it is our donors want. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, Double Exposure is hard work. We spend hours working on every episode, even before we watch two films and spend a couple hours in the studio. Editing and engineering, poster design, website management, guest outreach and scheduling, all of this, plus the creative work involved in recording, is work. Work that we believe is worth doing. And if you think so too, perhaps you can find it in your kind soul to pay for that work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have enjoyed Double Exposure during its time on the digital waves, or recently found us and like what you hear, please consider donating. (And\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/double-exposure/id1129956922\"\u003esubscribe on iTunes\u003c/a\u003e, if you haven\u0027t!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you, everyone. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nChris and Courtney"
