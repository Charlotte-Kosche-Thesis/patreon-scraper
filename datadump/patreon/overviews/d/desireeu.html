If I manage to finish it during this period, YOU choose which comic I\u0027ll start next!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will make a digital artbook, featuring original characters; it will be a 12 image pack, and 8 of the characters included will be of the 8 higher-donating Patrons, who can choose the specifics of the illustrations as well! Of course, all patrons will still receive a free digital copy of this artbook!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also make an illustrated/animated music video (think of it like a Vocaloid PV), if background characters will be needed I\u0027ll use patrons\u0027 ones, and every patron will be given a special thanks in the credits \u0026lt;3",

I can dedicate 100% of my time to art, and still have money left to use to help others, host giveaways, etc.; afterall, it\u0027s thanks to my fans I\u0027ve got here, so it\u0027s only right to give them something back!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will take the time to learn more about handcrafting and sewing; the online store will then include more handmade items, and also handmade plushies and perhaps even clothing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will allow me to focus more on comics as well, the monthly pages will be 10-15 depending on my other workload, and you still get to choose my next project once I\u0027m done with one!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will definetely have enough money and free time to have professional eqipment to sing to my heart\u0027s content; I will cover a song every month, and every two months patrons will be able to choose one song for me to cover (so basically one month I choose the song myself, the next patrons decide, the very next I choose myself again, and so on)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will make a big artbook, a real physical one to be shipped out this time, with one character for ANY of my patron; 500 patrons would mean 500 characters, and so on!
