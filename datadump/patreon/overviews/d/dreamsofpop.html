    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Dreams of POP! \u00a0For many years, I had been a Warhammer 40k modeler and painter and was suddenly thrown into the world of Funko POP almost by accident. \u00a0I was encouraged by my girlfriend to join a local POP customization contest. \u00a0She wanted to see how I can translate my modeling skills to the POP medium. \u00a0The result was this, \u00a0an Adeptus Mechanicus based on a Warmachine POP\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc8af8bda9.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo my surprise, I won the contest and I was hooked. \u00a0I used the prize money to buy more POPs and materials (epoxy clay, super glue, glass beads, instant mold) to try and make more. \u00a0Eventually I made a few more for myself and some Pokemon POPs for my girlfriend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc8c9e06b4.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc8f4db047.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc8d1a734b.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point people started to take notice and commissioned me to make customs for them. \u00a0Many properties such as anime are not very common in POP form and a number of commissions were taken from such media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc906c6177.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc908bc94a.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc91bb6b9e.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc93a2e657.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral other commissions from other properties such as movies (Twilight, Star Wars), video games(Call of Duty), TV Series(Stargate, Sanctuary) and sports (WWE, MMA) were also commissioned to me over time. \u00a0The money from these commissions helped me get more raw materials to work with to make more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc95a92d10.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/cc/cc954c22b0.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I was starting to hit a wall... available time. \u00a0I was doing these in my spare time (evenings and weekend) while most of the week I worked as a teacher in a local university. \u00a0As much as I would like to try and make a living out of these, the money I get from them isn\u0027t enough to cover my expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really feel I can make more stunning stuff if I can have more time dedicated to this craft without jeopardizing my financials. \u00a0 I have so many ideas that are ready for implementation, I just need the time to do it, e.g. \u00a0I already planned out how to make a Galactus from a 9\" Buzz Lightyear POP, \u00a0I already have the figure to customize, the epoxy, etc. \u00a0Just need to window of time to make it. \u00a0I also have many Obiwan and Darth Maul customs from the Clone Wars cartoon already planned and ready for implementation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the proper funds I\u0027d like to elevate my craft to an even higher level.  I\u2019d like to get into more efficient molding and casting so I can reuse parts for other projects. \u00a0Maybe I can even sell generic versions of these parts in an online store to other customizers to help them in their craft while at the same time maximizing the gain from my initial effort in making the parts. \u00a0Maybe I can even get a professional sticker printer to be able to produce professional quality boxes for the customs or a 3D printer to print parts."
