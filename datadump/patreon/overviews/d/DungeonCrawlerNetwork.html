    "summary": "Welcome to The Dungeon Crawler Network Patreon funding effort! From\n all of us here at The Dungeon Crawler Network, we would like to take this \nopportunity to thank you for stopping by and checking out our funding \nplan. Whether you decide to give or not we\u0027re so thankful for listening to our podcasts and for your continued support! If this happens to be your first time coming \nacross The Dungeon Crawler Network, we are a podcasting network \ncurrently covering the online multiplayer genre and gaming in general! Our current podcast listing is as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Dungeon Crawlers Podcast: A Bi-Weekly MMORPG Discussion Podcast\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFrom The Ashes: An Ashes of Creation Podcast dedicated to Intrepid Studio\u0027s MMORPG\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTales of Tamriel: An Elder Scrolls Online Podcast dedicated to The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTavern Talk: A Saga of Lucimia YouTube-Exclusive Collaboration between The Dungeon Crawler Network \u0026amp; Stormhaven Studios\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s the plan here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\n you want to know what exactly you\u0027re supporting and why you should? Well, we have a \nfew goals in mind. The first goal is to allow The Dungeon Crawler Network to grow by expanding our programming list! We originally started out with only one podcast, the flagship of our network, Tales of Tamriel. After over a year of being only a one show network, many of our fans and staff members started asking about branching out to other projects. Naturally, our goal at The Dungeon Crawler Network is to provide quality gaming podcasts and to help people who want to podcast but don\u0027t necessarily have the means or skills to start one for themselves. We take care of all the server maintenance, the software costs, hosting fees, etc and we allow our podcasters to just do what they do best, podcasting about the games they love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur second goal, is to eventually branch into more permanent career out of this and allow some of our staff to preform the roles full time instead of just a part time hobby. We know this is a far off dream and if we ever get there that is great! If not, we are content to keep producing shows as we currently are. However, by getting a workable budget, we will be able to support all of our hosting costs without it being a burden on any one of the hosts, do more giveaways on the network to help give back to the community, and allow us to send our staff to the various gaming conventions around the United States and Europe so we can get you the gaming news you love from people whom you have come to trust and welcome into your home!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past two years, Dungeon Crawler Network has been funded solely out of pocket by the founder of the network, Aggelos, but due to your generous contributions, you have helped alleviate a lot of the costs associated with running the network and allowed us to purchase equipment and software needed by our hosts so we can provide you with more programming! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s up with the rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe want to reward those who support us to the best of our ability. One of the ways we try to do this is by giving double entries for any time we do a give away on any of our podcasts! For as little as $1 a month, you will be able to get your name into the pot more then the average contest entries. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe also want to give people the chance to get a shout out on our shows for their own works to help get your name out there as well! We are also offering guest spots to people on the show of their choice to help get their thoughts heard. We love hearing from the community and we wanted to offer something special for those that support us financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we want to start offering more tangible rewards. The first of which is a character head shot that you can see our talented artist, Lituna! We will also be expanding our reward tiers as our funds grow with physical items such as t-shirts, branded trinkets, etc so keep your eye out on this page for details as they become available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEW REWARD:\u003c/strong\u003e Available to ALL Patreon Supporters. A Patreon Supporter ONLY Discord channel where our Streamers will be logged into each time we stream and allow for verbal interaction with our hosts while they stream. You will need to send us your Discord name so we can promote you accordingly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get a few things clear: The Dungeon Crawler Network is dedicated to delivering high quality podcasting. Just because we\u0027re exploring the possibility for broadening \nour horizons with new content doesn\u0027t mean our commitment to making \nour current lineup the best it can be will wain in the \nslightest. The Dungeon Crawler Network will continue to be an MMORPG gaming \nfocused podcasting network. Nothing will change in that regard.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe deeply appreciate your support. We can\u0027t make The Dungeon Crawler Network without you.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that\u0027s about it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\n are so excited that you have even considered to support The Dungeon Crawler Network. We could have never dreamed when we started Tales of Tamriel that it \nwould get even half as popular as it is. The past 4 years we\u0027ve done this podcast have been some of the most interesting, fun,\n and surprising experiences in podcasting and you guys have allowed me to expand upon my dream of building this network far above what I ever could have hoped! \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Aggelos\u003cbr\u003eFounder of The Dungeon Crawler Network\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
