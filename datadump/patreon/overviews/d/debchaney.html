    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page. My name is Deb Chaney and I am a contemporary abstract artist creating large and small mixed media abstract paintings inspired by the question; \"Where does Spirituality meet Physicality?\".\u00a0Creating art is a healing process for me and the journey of making each art piece always brings me a gift. These beautiful meaningful art pieces then get to bring those gifts such as vitality, passion, grounding, \u0026amp; serenity (just to name a few examples) to the homes and offices that acquire them. As I create, I love to share my behind-the-scenes studio process; my thoughts, inspirations, breakthroughs and challenges. I do this via writing, sharing pictures and videos. My ultimate dream with my art is for it to be enthusiastically appreciated and collected all over the world, and - because I am a huge fan - to have Taylor Swift as a collector (!!!).\u00a0 If you choose to subscribe and support me, I thank you for helping me work towards my dream. My portfolio is at \u003ca href=\"http://www.debchaney.com \" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.debchaney.com\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; my original artwork and prints are available for sale at \u003ca href=\"https://www.saatchiart.com/debchaney\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.saatchiart.com/debchaney\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 Thank you for your interest, support and enthusiasm in myself and my work!"
