This is not MY Patreon page but OUR COMMUNITY PAGE and with your help, we can take COOKING to the NEXT LEVEL!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e YouTube is fun, do not get me wrong but the one thing I feel that is missing, would be the CONNECTION between Creators and Subscribers. Of course Playlist Live and VidCon exist where we can all connect but even then, there still exists a disconnect and that is where a change NEEDS to happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Patreon is an amazing format that allows ALL TALENT to communicate DIRECTLY with every Patron. A place where all of our hard work is truly recognized and those that wish to support, CAN SUPPORT. This takes place all while we build something OUTSTANDING together and so there is no other place that I would want to start my journey with a Cooking Show than right here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Days of work, learning recipes and eventually, creating my own recipes will happen on Patreon and I would LOVE to bring many of YOUR recipes to life here also. I was thinking of even meeting up with some of my Patrons in the near future to Collaborate on some Cooking shows and truly GROW TOGETHER! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot to just talk about us building but to actually BUILD!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I do not expect for ANY of you to break your banks for this show. Please only pledge what you can \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCOMFORTABLY\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e afford each month and keep in mind, the best part is you will get a MINIMUM of 2 or 3 videos each month for $1.00 if that is what you choose to pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU and I look forward to chatting with my Patrons about recipes and MORE!"
