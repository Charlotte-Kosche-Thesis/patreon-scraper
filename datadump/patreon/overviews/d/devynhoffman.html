Eventually I will be able to hire people who can edit videos, film the videos, etc... I cannot make this dream a reality with the help of others in hiring my own team, and most importantly, without your investment to help get this started!\u003cbr\u003e- You might now ask, \"What qualifies you to do this?\"\u003cbr\u003e- I have (in 3 months) a degree in Health, Human Performance, and Psychology.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- I currently have built most of my following on SnapChat, but I need to start a youtube channel to be able to create more specific avenues of my content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Your INVESTMENT (which can lead to me paying dividends in the future) will allow me to start making PROFESSIONAL content for each of my skill sets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Skill sets including: Nutrition, health physically and mentally, workouts, and soooo much more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- I create content in a wide variety of areas such as: Creating funny/engaging stories through my SnapChat or Instagram story. I post Motivational and Inspirational messages. I talk about many topics in my \"Life Talks\" such as Relationships, Business, Success, Happiness, Depression, etc...\u003cbr\u003e- My ultimate goal through social media is to help as many people as I possibly can in ANY aspect of life that I can provide service :)\u003cbr\u003e- Please help me to help you and to help those I haven\u0027t been able to reach by investing in me, and ultimately believing in me. Thank you :)"
