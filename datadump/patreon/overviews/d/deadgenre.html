We also have a website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jrpgsaredead.fyi/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ejrpgsaredead.fyi\u003c/a\u003e, where we post\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jrpgsaredead.fyi/category/content/writing/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecritical writing by the hosts\u003c/a\u003e generally related to the genre. An introductory minisode\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Vcp4iteUw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eis available here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e for those who want to know more without committing to a full episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are we?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Invisifool\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDevon Carter\u003c/a\u003e is the ringleader of this merry band of genre necromancers, and against all odds, the sheer volume of bad opinions present online hasn\u2019t yet swayed him from his love for games. Though he has taken a break from long-form critical writing, he insists this is only because he\u2019s gathering power for an upcoming series. His hobbies aside from playing games include making spreadsheets cataloguing his queued games hellscape, watching and hating anime, and putting off finding a tabletop RPG group. He will gladly regale anyone who will listen with reasons why\u00a0\u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy XIV\u003c/em\u003e is the best \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e game. His favorite games are always shifting, but a reliable couple are \u003cem\u003eTales of the Abyss\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eKingdom Hearts 2\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/eatthepen\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBecky Davnall\u003c/a\u003e disguised herself as a human male twenty-eight years ago and has only recently realised this was a bad idea. While trying to remedy this mistake, she lectures in metaphysics and logic, and is working to develop an arts-and-humanities course in video games. Her main critical interests are the relationship between Japanese games and Anglo-American audiences, the presentation of masculinity and heroism in narrative games, and movement as an aesthetic. When not playing video games she can mostly be found playing other video games or running other people\u2019s jokes into the ground. Her favourite games are probably \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy XII\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eTales of Vesperia\u003c/em\u003e, but this is subject to change without notice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/wasnotwhynot\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLeeRoy Lewin\u003c/a\u003e is living the dream: being a gamedev in his mom\u2019s basement. Perpetually unwell and stubborn to a fault, his foremost value is the power of friendship, so it\u2019s no surprise that he\u2019s stuck with japanese media. His \u201cexpertise\u201d is in game history, a cobbled together knowledge from just being a huge nerd, and often writes about forgotten margins of game history. If he\u2019s not ranting about lore or making arguments out of thin air, LeeRoy is playing a videogame a part of him hates, somehow also convinced the game is an individual work of genius. Other interests are old anime, abstract prose, implications of memes, noise music, and drinking weird soda. His favorite videogame is \u003cem\u003ePathologic\u003c/em\u003e; his favorite jrpg is \u003cem\u003ePersona 3\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
