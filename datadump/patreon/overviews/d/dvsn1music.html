So glad you landed here :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know who we are and what brought us to Patreon then watch the video above; otherwise if you prefer to read continue on....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Division 1?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe started in 2014; with a competition that taught us how to DJ. From there, countless hours of mixing, designing, brainstorming and creating has occurred\u2026 but of course, we are ready for MORE! Division 1 is going to be a global brand, filled with incredible music and performances as well as the clothing line that until now, we have only dreamt of. The countless hours of hard work and dedication without a doubt is worth it - but to have the support of YOU, will allow us to expand our passion faster than previously possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and how does it work? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an amazing platform that allows creatives to connect with their supporters (who are known as Patreons), whilst getting paid for doing the work they love most! \u003cbr\u003ePatreons have the flexibility to choose how much they want to contribute on a monthly basis and in return they get awesome rewards and perks. We have tried to make our rewards as valuable as possible no matter where you are located in the world or what tier you land on; but we will continue to improve and upgrade our reward tiers the more we grow! After all, the rewards are our way of saying thank you; so THANK YOU for believing in us and not only \u0027wanting\u0027 to see Division 1 grow, but actually contributing towards that growth. We are truly grateful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a lifetime member - \"First 50\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BU242MHFCgs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first 50 Patreons that sign up on the $5 tier or higher will be inducted into our \u201cHall of Fame\u201d and you will forever be recognized as one of our most valuable supporters. We will display your name and image on our website as a major contributor and once we have our own studio we will get a plaque with all of your names on it!

A good chunk of the money we make at our day jobs goes towards sustaining the business, (which you can see in the section below) but in order for us to grow, we just need a little extra support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis platform is rich with opportunity; at its most basic level, creatives like us are able to connect with people who like what we do (which is super rewarding), and for those who run successful pages, they have been able to replace their income, grow their business and truly dedicate their time and energy to their craft (that\u2019s the dream!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore we launched Division 1 in October we sat down and discussed our values for the brand, which are;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e1. Intense Focus on Innovation \u0026amp; Growth\u003cbr\u003e2. Setting Uncomfortable Goals\u003cbr\u003e3. Live with Passion \u0026amp; Excitement for Life\u003cbr\u003e4. Let Curiosity Lead\u003cbr\u003e5. Work with Integrity\u003cbr\u003e6. Empower by Example\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting a Patreon account is completely in harmony with our brand and what it stands for.\u00a0Just like Google is always experimenting with new ideas, so are we.

Please know that we would never refer people to products/services we don\u2019t like or use ourselves).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince Patreon is still a fairly \u2018new concept\u2019, you have a great opportunity to get started on here and build a following before everyone catches on and the market is saturated! We would love to be one of your first supporters, so let us know if you are thinking of starting a page and we would be more than happy to help you get set up :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal words\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you so so much for your support.
