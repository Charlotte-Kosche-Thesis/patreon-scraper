    "summary": "I first started taking photos years ago, with my crappy phone from back then. A lot has happened since then but one thing remained constant: animals and specially cats were among my favorite models.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis happens because my love for cats comes from way earlier than my love for photography. Having a cat in the house is one of my first memories. And that has never changed. There are now seven cats living with me in my current home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I came to the idea of this patreon by mixing two of the things I love more: photography and cats. There are tons of animals in need of help. They are abandoned, or they have medical conditions and their owners cannot afford treatment. My own cats also need sometimes things that I struggle to pay as most of them are past 15-16 years old already. And I know a lot of shelters that also need a helping hand. And that\u0027s what I want to do. I want to use half of whatever income I may get here to support and help animals in need:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eGive abandoned animals a home until they can be adopted.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay for the medical bills of those who are in need.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp out shelters whose owners dedicate so much of their life to help animals.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTake beautiful photos of animals that are in need of adoption so they stand at least a slightly better chance.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe rest of the money will go to my photography gear that I so want to keep upgrading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince this is not really a business Patreon I haven\u0027t thought about possible Tier rewards to offer really much. I appreciate any ideas that you guys could have. High quality versions of the photos? Phone and computer wallpapers? Videos? I\u0027m grateful for any feedback on potential tier rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
