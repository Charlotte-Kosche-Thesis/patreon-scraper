    "summary": "Hello! For those of you that don\u0027t know me, my name is Dextra, and I make art type things. Mostly, I like drawing portraits, but I\u0027ll give anything a shot, and I am prone to taking someone\u0027s crazy ideas and making them come to life. It\u0027s the thing that I\u0027m best at, and I want to make a career of it. I have done, on and off for the last 20 years, but life gets in the way, so I could never do more than make it a hobby that occasionally earned me a little extra cash.\u00a0Which is why I\u0027m doing this Patreon. I\u0027ve been told to try it because I\u0027ve had a few people express to me that they would support it, so here we are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what is it that I do that would make you want to support me? Well, as I said, portraits are kind of my \"thing\", and I often find myself sketching my friends as practice, and they don\u0027t seem to mind, such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/35b1ed1f0cb31eb11631c976506f0442/tumblr_oozrdnK4gH1ry9deao1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen sometimes I get a little fangirlish and sketch out a bit of fan art...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7595/16692136507_471bd3d959_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut when I really get my engines going, I get a lot more serious. And this is what I want to do a lot more of:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1442/25678714600_845b800f6f_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1577/25678708780_970ba94b77_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are just a couple of examples of what I can do when I have the time and energy to do so. Which is where you come in. I want to be able to make more art, and I want to make it my career. And right now, it\u0027s very difficult, considering I live with both physical and mental illnesses that make working most \"normal\" jobs hard. So I am looking for work, because I was on disability and now I\u0027m not because I was not deemed sick \"enough\" for it. It\u0027s just difficult to find something that will be a decent fit for me at the moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I want to do what I do best, which is art. I want to make a lot of art. I\u0027d really like to do this for a living. I\u0027ve been able to do a little bit selling prints and t-shirts, but I\u0027d like to do more. I have lots of ideas for perks for patrons, and I plan to do special events, sales, and special commissions. I haven\u0027t done any commissions in some time, so when I do plan to start again, patrons would get first notice before going public. You\u0027ll get to see patron-only progress shots, personal photos. That are relevant to the art of course, I promise there won\u0027t be too many cat photos. Unless you really want the cat photos. Because I have some quality felines up in here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway! Take a look, see what I can do, if you like what you see, and you\u0027d like for me to make more of it, please consider becoming my patron. You\u0027ll give me at the very least warm fuzzy feelings and possibly a little peace of mind and reasons to smile. You\u0027ll get lots of shiny new artwork from me, and some other little goodies, too. And you\u0027ll be supporting someone trying to live their dream, which is what it\u0027s all about, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight, no, it\u0027s about the cat photos, I get it.\u003cbr\u003e"

Doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s just a portrait of a dog, or something completely off the rails, I will do my best to see your insane vision come to life. Remember, I have already drawn a crest of Neil Armstrong on the moon being eaten by a mutant barracuda. Nothing is out of the realm of possibilities. So get your ideas brewing, because when we hit this one, it could be yours!",
