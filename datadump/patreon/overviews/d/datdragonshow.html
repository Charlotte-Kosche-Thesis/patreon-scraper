Our story began with 4 hours of purestrain tabletop RPG chaos live-streaming to a community of 30,000 fans every Friday night. It embodied the core of what tabletop gaming is all about: good friends, wild stories, and high fantasy adventure. It was a show all about \u003cem\u003eDragons and Stuff\u003c/em\u003e, so that\u2019s exactly what we called it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017 we streamed 37 sessions of an ongoing, living story that fans flocked to from around the world (Literally, we had a guy fly in from Germany to see our set in LA!) It was a top of the line production that was unmatched in the arena of actual play rpg shows! However, top of the line production value means a ton of work and a huge amount of resources. Sadly, in 2018, we don\u2019t have access to a lot of the equipment, facilities, and crew that made \u003cem\u003eDragons and Stuff\u003c/em\u003e what it was. What we still DO have, is the epic story, crazy cast, and, most importantly, you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we will arise anew, as \u003cem\u003eDragons and Things\u003c/em\u003e, an epic tale live streamed right to your face every single week. We encourage you to become a Patron today and help \u003cem\u003eDragons and Things\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0continue what\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDragons and Stuff \u003c/em\u003estarted\u003cem\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e"
