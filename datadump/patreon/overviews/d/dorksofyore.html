    "summary": "Welcome Fellow Gamer!\u00a0This project is close to my heart, and I appreciate your interest.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you imagine if we had hours-long HD video interviews of \u003cstrong\u003eGary Gygax\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eDave Arneson\u003c/strong\u003e? What a treasure that would be to hear their stories in their own words and get a sense of them as people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was this thought that motivated me to create this project. As someone who is deeply inspired by the hobby, I understand the value of learning its history \u003cstrong\u003efrom the creators themselves\u003c/strong\u003e. Dave and Gary are no longer with us, but many other RPG pioneers still are, and there is no time to waste in documenting their stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eRPG History Project\u003c/strong\u003e is an ongoing effort to foster a deeper appreciation of roleplaying games and honor those who created them. We are doing this by way of \u003cstrong\u003ethree objectives\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, to \u003cstrong\u003ecreate an online archive of HD video interviews with the pioneers of tabletop roleplaying. \u003c/strong\u003eNot only would it\u00a0be gratifying to give them that opportunity, it would create a resource that can be appreciated for generations to come. Our objective is a publicly accessible archive of dozens of hours of interviews, all with \u003cstrong\u003ecrisp video and sound\u003c/strong\u003e. The full-length interviews will be posted regularly following the release of our documentary film (see below).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, to \u003cstrong\u003eproduce a feature-length documentary about the dawn of roleplaying games\u003c/strong\u003e. The real-life adventure undertaken by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson is worthy of a feature film. We\u0027ve been compiling footage for over a year now and are thrilled with how it\u0027s taking shape. We feel that the movie is important because it will make this \u003cstrong\u003einspiring story\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0accessible to those both in and outside of the hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird, to create\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0RPG-related web series\u003c/strong\u003e so you never have to wait too long for some tabletop inspiration. We want to keep you excited and passionate about the hobby with short-subject videos cut from our interviews, as well\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eRPG Science\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, which explores the physics and biomechanics of roleplaying games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn many ways I see this content as being for people like myself who can\u0027t get enough of the hobby. We\u0027re always searching for something new about the games we haven\u0027t seen before so we can feel that little burst of magic that we\u0027ve known since childhood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for your interest. Please join us in this exciting and worthwhile project!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Pat Kilbane\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some common questions we get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is like Kickstarter, but to support content that is released regularly. With Patreon you back projects with a small amount every month instead of a lump sum and can cancel your support whenever you\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am \u003cstrong\u003ePat Kilbane\u003c/strong\u003e, and most people know me from my years on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMad TV\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand my appearance as Bizarro Kramer on an episode of \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeinfeld\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. The last eight years or so, I\u0027ve been doing my work behind the camera writing and directing. As a gamer, I started in 1979 on the Holmes basic set and quickly moved to \u003cem\u003eAD\u0026amp;D\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ve also played a lot of \u003cem\u003eTwilight: 2000\u003c/em\u003e and a variety of home-brew systems. When I say \"I\" in the above text, I\u0027m talking about myself, and when I say \"we\" I\u0027m including our other team members, \u003cstrong\u003eMelissa McQueen\u003c/strong\u003e (producer), \u003cstrong\u003eMatt Renoir\u003c/strong\u003e (producer and director of photography), and \u003cstrong\u003eJohn Bennett\u003c/strong\u003e (producer and sound engineer).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the money be used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will see our objectives one at a time under \"Goals\" on the left side of our profile page. So far, the content has all been produced out of pocket and during spare time between other work. Your support for the project \u003cstrong\u003ewill primarily cover travel and equipment expenses\u003c/strong\u003e. At higher goal thresholds, we will be able to do some fancier things with the productions, especially with graphics and archival footage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will the documentary come out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not sure, but the pace will be quickened if RPGHP is robustly backed. The good news is that you will be getting \u003cstrong\u003econtent every single month\u003c/strong\u003e, along with updates on the film.\u003cbr\u003e"
