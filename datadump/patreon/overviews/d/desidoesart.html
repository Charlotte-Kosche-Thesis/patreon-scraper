It\u0027s nice to draw in new people, if you\u0027ve wandered in from any of the various art sites I post at, it\u0027s nice to have you back.\u003cbr\u003eFor the sake of simplicity, call me Desi. I\u0027m an artist, perpetually aspiring to be better, to appeal to that niche crowd, and to find my place in the art world. You\u0027ll see a lot of furry art here, but also other kinds-- I don\u0027t consider myself one type of artist, but simply an \u003cem\u003eartist\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in the general sense.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon to me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eA throwback to a practice that\u0027s been around as long as artists have embodied the old adage \"starving artist!\" I\u0027ll try not to bore you, but what you do as patrons is rather important to the art world, and has been for a very long time. This is a place to promote my art in hopes of finding those with the means to help support it while I improve and create great works we can both be proud of! We\u0027re not \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0going to be the next Rodin, or Botticelli, but making a mark even in a small community is an admirable goal to have.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI live primarily as a freelance commission artist, and while my art is liberally steeped in the furry genre, my interests don\u0027t end there. In order to create the things I want to create, I need the backing to keep financially afloat while working on it. As a \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003efor instance\u003c/i\u003e... I\u0027ve been in the midst of creating a comic for so long it feels like it\u0027s been with me since the beginning. If I were to be able to begin creating it and still pay bills, you guys would be the pioneers!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAs a backer you\u0027ll have access to things otherwise unseen on any of my other sites, as well as streams, videos, chances at free art, and - as my following grows - I\u0027ll be adding new levels, new milestones and new incentives to match said growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I create?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eMy hope is to delve more into fullscale illustration that challenges my sense of image composition as it is (which can sometimes be a bit stale) and push boundaries. If I receive enough support the primarily post apocalyptic, but generally mixed genre (e.g.; dystopian, apocalyptic, sci-fi and historical fiction themes) story and characters I have will come to life here first. After a certain pledge tier, all commission work and personal work will be available at full resolution, rather than the compressed versions posted elsewhere. There\u0027s no real \u003cem\u003elimit\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to what I intend to create.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you get from pledging?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAh-hah! The most important part of the pitch. There are a few available tiers, some more exclusive than others, but all beyond the $5 point have some perks. I\u0027ll do raffle streams every few months for you to cash in your tickets in, winning you basically what amounts to free art! If you pledge higher, the amount of stuff you get naturally becomes slightly more worth it. This is a definite work in progress and I greatly appreciate feedback, so if you see something, feel free to PM me about it!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eYou\u0027re a \u003cstrong\u003epatron of the arts\u003c/strong\u003e, remember that. Your kind have been responsible for some of the world\u0027s greatest works.\u003c/div\u003e"
