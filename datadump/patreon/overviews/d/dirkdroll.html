Our current system is broken so badly that \"conservatives\" and \"progressives\" must come together to build a better one. The fight is not left-right, but bottom-up. There is no red or blue way to be poor. We can build a thriving world rather than a world run by thieves and bullies. The solutions are there, right in front of us.
