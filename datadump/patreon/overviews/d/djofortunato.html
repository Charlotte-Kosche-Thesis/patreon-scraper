     "about": "My name is Djo Fortunato and I am a lifelong teller of stories through pictures and professional storyboard / comics illustrator and character / toy designer.  I studied Studio Art \u0026amp; Theatre at Rowan University in NJ, \u0026amp; the Tyler School of Art at Temple University, in Philadelphia, PA, w/ post-bacc. studies in Digital Media design at UPenn (where I took classes, while working ).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYears out of academia, I undertook intensive training alongside a handful of students with Classical Painting mentor Myron Barnstone, whose school - set up in an converted cigar warehouse in NE Pennsylvania, set a high standard for his award-winning students from Fine Arts to Architecture \u0026amp; across other fields as well.  (NW artists familiar w/ Julia Aristide\u0027s school \u0027Aristides Atelier\u0027, in Seattle may know Myron as her long-term mentor.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent a full year in this studio as a resident, student \u0026amp; teaching assistant, studying classical geometry, observational drawing \u0026amp; analysis techniques as well as color theory, and in that intensive environment my abilities to realize \u0026amp; refine my Art by \"thinking with a pencil\" were reinforced to a previously unimagined degree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut after a year, I returned to the outside world and was left to do my own work - far less formal, much more cartoony \u0026amp; geeky, comics oriented work.  While the learning I gained informs everything I set pencil, ink, charcoal \u0026amp; paint to, that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003eI want to liberate other artists from the feeling of being stuck.  To empower them, too, with a system to get closer to what\u0027s in your head, \u0026amp; actually putting it on paper.  I can provide you with some super helpful tools, toward that end.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy approach is to give you as many of these tools as you see fit, but empower you with the freedom to put your own ideas on the page, from the very start.\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "The \"Big Picture\" goal of engaging the community by providing art classes is that I may be liberated from taking part time jobs that have drained a good deal of my creative energies throughout the years. \u00a0As of late, the demand for my freelance work is such that I can feasibly start teaching classes to support my personal freelance businesses. \u00a0Sustainability is key when launching my private \u0026amp; public art instruction, requiring renewed student registration as well as investment in technology \u0026amp; materials with which to produce and teach !\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs we enter these levels \u0026amp; upward, the Digital Realm of Comics Creation \u0026amp; Character Design comes ever closer to being a reality - both for my students and (frankly) for my own work!   The introduction of Wacom tablets (for \u0027digital drawing\u0027) \u0026amp; use of photoshop, Corel Draw \u0026amp; other such tools has massively propelled the abilities of freelancers to generate eye-catching, professional work.  While I am trained in \u0026amp; fully capable with a pencil, ink \u0026amp; paper - I fully recognize the realities of various arms within the entertainment industry.  Be it Gaming Design, Concept Design (for film or games) , Toy Design, Comics , Manga, Animation or Magazine Illustration - the Era of the Digital Studio has long since arrived.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt is my personal belief (\u0026amp; observed experience) that gaining a fluency in drawing fundamentals will only increase one\u0027s successful expression with digital tools.  (Just look at Pixar - who re-trained Disney\u0027s animators to learn CAD, rather than trying to teach CAD operators how to animate\u2026)   This is the Ultimate Goal of my work as an artist \u0026amp; educator: To empower other artists and the next generation - with competitive tools to work effectively \u0026amp; professionally- to flood the world with cool looking art made by knowledgable, confident artists!  =)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCheers!\u003cbr /\u003e~ Djo Fortunato ~\u003cbr /\u003e",
