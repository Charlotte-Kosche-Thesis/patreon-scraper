    "summary": "Hi! My name is Jamie and I\u0027m a Mexican trans woman working as a writer, translator, and editor. As you might have guessed, the kind of work that I\u0027m doing, alongside a number of other emerging trans writers of color, is really vital because so little of it is available for us. For generations, it has been nearly impossible for us to write our own stories and share our thoughts and experiences with others in our communities. The same social conditions that erased much of our collective past, and that to this day make it hard for us to even survive, make it so that our creative work is devalued, underfunded, and ignored when it is not being attacked out of hatred. That\u0027s why I\u0027m asking for your support: to make it possible for me to continue my writing by helping me cover the cost of essential things like rent and bills for the trans health care I need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I continue my current writing projects, I\u0027ll be posting my work \u003ca href=\"http://desdeotromar.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eto my blog\u003c/a\u003e and sharing drafts and finished excerpts from the books I\u0027m working on. In addition, I\u0027ll also be blogging about my work as an editor, which includes making translations and preparing books for publication at the \u003ca href=\"http://transwomenwriters.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTrans Women Writer\u0027s Collective\u003c/a\u003e, as well as co-editing a groundbreaking \u003ca href=\"http://twocfictionanthology.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eanthology of fiction by trans women of color\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will receive access to ebook copies of the books I\u0027ve written: my poetry book, my book of short fiction and essays, my first novel, and a chapbook of my translations of poetry by Esdras Parra. \u003cbr\u003e"
