    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eA Passion for Game Development\u003c/h3\u003e\nCreating video games is a dream for many people, and a passion of mine for many years.\u00a0 As a child of the 80s I got to experience the evolution of the video game industry, from its start with arcade classics like Space Invaders, Pac Man and Mario Bros., to the modern day Triple A titles that continue to out-mode the most powerful hardware each day.\u00a0 Needless to say, video gaming has always been a part of my life, and these days I try to make it my daily work to give a bit back to the industry.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnlike the modern era, when I was growing up there were no real channels for game development as a child.\u00a0 Online resources had not even been dreamt up yet, the term indie gaming hadn\u0027t been coined and other than waiting for a new issue of Nintendo Power in the mail, I had no real way to know what was happening in the gaming industry.\u00a0 I can recall my first ever experience was attempting to make a Gauntlet style game on QBasic as I had found a beginner\u0027s guide for making games at a yard sale, and begged my mom to buy it for me.\u00a0 Needless to say without any further resources, art software and so on, the project failed miserably.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFast forward umteen years, now pushing my late 20\u0027s, seeing ads for online gaming degrees every which way I turn on the internet, my quest for the meaning of the term Indie Gaming lead me to reopen that chapter of my life.\u00a0 I was of course a bit too old to restart college and go in debt for such a silly dream, I had responsibilities, mortgages and so on to handle, but I had to find a way.\u00a0 \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first break came with the Sword of Moonlight Game Making Tool....perhaps you\u0027ve heard of it?\u00a0 Probably not.\u00a0 The toolkit, SoM for short, was only available in Japan.\u00a0 It was barely marketed by a smaller video game company called From Software, the same folks now world famous for the Dark Souls series.\u00a0 In 2008 I released King\u0027s Field - Dark Destiny, a game that straddled the story between the first two U.S. release King\u0027s Field games.\u00a0 To this day I still operate and maintain a developer website and forum for other folks using the tool at swordofmoonlight.com, doing my best to continue the success of other folks trying to break into game making using this wonderful tool.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe following year I began scouring the XNA (Microsoft\u0027s development tool) forums for programmers to help make more games.\u00a0 A close friend and I were able to hook up with a great development team, and together we have made several great games across multiple platforms including Xbox 360, Steam PC, Mobile and so on.\u00a0 It has been our goal to stay true to ourselves, make games we enjoy playing, and support the games as long as possible to give players a great experience for their valued dollars.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course not all games are a success, and even those that are don\u0027t make each and every member of the team a rich man.\u00a0 With that in mind I decided to work very hard at getting contacts, business relationships and my foot in wherever possible to get a small nest egg together to quit my day job and go for my dream of making video games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.swordofmoonlight.com/DarkDestiny/westernshore.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.swordofmoonlight.com/DarkDestiny/westernshorethumb.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nThe Dragon Necropolis along the Western Shore\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n Making the leap to work for myself was a scary decision, one that thankfully my wife agreed to stand by me, regardless of what happened.\u00a0 To this day I have been self employed for 1.5 years and am happy to say we are still keeping our heads above water.\u00a0 We have certainly cut back on the expenses and some of the excess we used to enjoy, but it has been worth it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been able to farm my talents out to several companies and folks to make enough income to keep going, but somewhere along the way I have lost site of some of the goals that made me take that leap in the first place...the most important one being making a game that I enjoy playing.\u00a0 Unfortunately I am just one man, and modern gaming certainly takes a crew of folks to really put forth a worthy effort in game making.\u00a0 I have spent quite a bit of my reserve cash purchasing hardware, software, assets and help to breath new life into the game that truly started it all for me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the course of the next 1.5 - 2 years I will be creating my newest RPG from the ground up, with the Unity3d platform...updated to the graphics and gameplay standards of today\u0027s games, but keeping it true to my purpose to create something that doesn\u0027t just follow the cookie cutter games that overpopulate the bins at stores, but to provide a truly unique and enjoyable experience, and show gamers everywhere that a small group of people really can make great games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.swordofmoonlight.com/DarkDestiny/elvenhuntingparty.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.swordofmoonlight.com/DarkDestiny/elvenhuntingpartythumb.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nElven Huntress and her Undead Army\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\nTo that end I will push forward defining my world of Dark Destiny, evolving the content, the features and depth of the experience, showing everyone along the way the tips and tricks (and pitfalls) of newbie programming, of working with a small team with a small budget and getting more bang for your buck.\u00a0 \n\u003cbr\u003e\nPreliminary test environment videos have been uploaded to my new Youtube channel at \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/darkdestinygame\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/darkdestinygame\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd information regarding the new game can be found on \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.darkdestinygame.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.darkdestinygame.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you choose to become a patron of my project, rest assured I will complete that which I have set out to do, I have a long list of games (Steam Heroes, Ampu-Tea, FortressCraft, King\u0027s Field: Dark Destiny to name a few) that I have worked through completion, even getting some through Steam Greenlight and onto other platforms.\u00a0 Your help will improve the speed at which I can get things done, and the overall quality of the final product.\u00a0 I wish I could say game development was cheap, but it is not, and I really could use a helping hand to keep providing great games and websites/assets to other developers to continue to bring folks quality games at a low (and oftentimes free!) price.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be updating this page with a Facebook and Twitter channel, as well as a dedicated forum area and launch page for the development of this game. \u00a0I will try to keep posting special updates for my patrons and at some point I will try to offer my benefactors some reward for their help, be it digital copies of my games, specialty artwork, their names in my credits and so on.\u00a0\nStay tuned for more ways to share in the development and keep a lookout for my live Twitchtv feed coming soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note, all rewards such as DLC, game download codes etc are not contingent on continual funding, whatever you spend total, whether it be $10 across 10 months or $10 just one time will still put you in the same reward tier when the game is finished!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI thank everyone in advance for their consideration!\n\u003cbr\u003e"

This will go to supplement the payouts I am making to musicians, 3d artists, asset stores and so on.  The more I can set aside to spend on the game, the faster it will be done.\u0026nbsp; I intend to add more and more content to rival games the size of Dark Souls, including unique content, more quests, more equipment, magic, enemies and areas to explore.\u0026nbsp; Each month I meet my goal I will be able to continue to commission the creation of new exciting content, manage new videos of the production and create more content to show patrons.\u003cbr\u003e",
