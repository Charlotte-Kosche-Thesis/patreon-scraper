    "summary": "My name is\u00a0Darcie, better known as Darcizzle Offshore on social media, and I LOVE to fish! I have been fishing since the age of 3 years old, when my dad started taking me on exciting fishing adventures in Miami, FL. I recently quit my full-time job to pursue my fishing dreams. To read the full story about me click here\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/Who-is-Darcizzle\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWho is Darcizzle?\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI make fishing/travel videos on YouTube! \u003c/strong\u003eI provide \"how to\" tips, information, weather/fishing reports and great entertainment through my YouTube videos, pictures and adventures to my fans \u0026amp; followers on Youtube, Roku, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and G+. For the last three years my boyfriend and I have been producing action-packed and informative fishing destination videos all over the state of Florida.  We travel around Florida fishing in our own boat, with my fans, or with well-known captains exploring the most tropical destinations in the U.S.\u00a0I also write monthly for The Coastal Angler Magazine, speak at seminars \u0026amp; attend fishing tournaments around the state of FL. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA Quick Patreon Explanation:\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is basically like a \"tip jar\" for YouTubers and content creators alike! I am absolutely loving this platform because I can connect with my fans on a more personal level. If you enjoy my videos, please consider giving me a dollar (or however you much you like) per month for all the videos that I upload to YouTube. Currently we are producing \u0026amp; uploading 15-25 videos per month. Please don\u0027t donate anything if you\u0027re strapped for cash and certainly don\u0027t feel compelled to support my work in this way.\u00a0I will continue to bring you nothing but the absolute best production and effort that I have since the first time you ran into some of my fishing videos on YouTube- my videos just keep getting better! If you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, there\u0027s an easy way to set a monthly maximum for yourself when you\u0027re entering your payment info.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?:\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eWe would love to continue documenting my fishing/travelling adventures to share with you all as the adventures unfold.\u00a0We have a fleet of boats (17\u0027 flat\u0027s boat \u0026amp; 23\u0027 center console) that we constantly are filling up with gas to film our adventures. With your support,\u00a0we can buy new filming equipment (which the salt air \u0026amp; ocean seems to destroy/erode at a fast rate), make repairs to our boats (if you own a boat, you know there is always something that needs fixing),\u00a0bait (dead or live bait) to catch big fish and to help cover room and board while on the road to bring you more videos! Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money (Honestly, I know what that feels like) and please don\u0027t feel like you have to. We will continue making entertaining videos whether you donate or not.\u00a0I am able to keep on making videos because of YOU. I make the videos entertaining and informative because YOU ask for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is your ultimate goal?:\u003c/h3\u003e\u00a0FISH.DREAM.INSPIRE. A very important part of living my dream is helping. \u00a0I show children and other ladies by example that they can fish too and it\u0027s \"okay\" to get your hands dirty. I also love to promote and encourage parents to take their kids fishing. My father introduced me to fishing and I\u0027ve always been an outdoors girl growing up...I think I turned out pretty well! Fishing has taught me from a young age to be independent and self-confident--qualities that I believe every young woman/man should possess. \u00a0We also give back by taking veterans fishing, attending various charity events and participating in charity fishing tournaments and by using my social network to support environmental policies that protect our waterways for future generations.\u00a0We will expand our content and Youtube episodes, not only throughout the state of Florida, but to other thrilling fishing locations around the globe! I would also really like to start taking women, veterans, and kids on more of my fishing adventures and give these great people the exposure and cherished fishing memories they deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! \u003cem\u003eFOLLOW YOUR DREAM \u0026amp; KEEP ON CATCHIN\u0027!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0--Darcie\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDarcizzle Offshore\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
