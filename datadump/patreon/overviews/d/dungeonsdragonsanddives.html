The game has been featured most recently in Stranger Things, the Demogorgon being an actual monster from D\u0026amp;D lore. *Many people think D\u0026amp;D is closely related to devil worship and other things. It\u0027s really not - unless devil worshipers happen to play it in their spare time, then I suppose it would be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is kinda like a Kickstarter, but ongoing. It is set up to allow creators to make money from the fans who support their work. It works off of the old idea of arts patronage - people used to give money to artists they enjoyed so they could continue their work. If you click \"become a patron\", you\u0027re able to choose a donation tier. We currently have tiers ranging from $1 all the way up to $50, most of which have rewards like stickers, prints and bonus content. You can cancel or adjust your patronage at any time. And don\u0027t worry if you don\u0027t have any money to donate - our podcast will always be free to access via Podbean (link at the top) and *hopefully eventually* on iTunes and maybe Google Play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it\u0027s just too darn fun. All four of us are actors, writers and artists and not only do we love hanging out and playing D\u0026amp;D, but this is a new, modern type of interactive storytelling and we\u0027ve caught the bug!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for visiting our page and giving us a listen!
