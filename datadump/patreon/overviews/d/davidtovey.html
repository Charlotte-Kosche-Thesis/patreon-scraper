    "summary": "David Tovey is a formerly homeless artist, educator and activist who works in a range of media. He is a photographer, painter as well as an installation artist and performance-maker. At the heart of David\u0027s practice is a very special quality - the ability to bring you to the subject in ways both beautiful and hard-hitting in equal measure in order to raise awareness about the social issues he tackles. \u003cbr\u003eDavid has exhibited internationally in locations such as Somerset House, Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool, Montreal and he is also the founder of the UK\u2019s first One Festival of Homeless arts. \u003cbr\u003eHe speaks regularly at housing and homelessness events and teaches art to people experiencing homelessness at the Pilion Trust and Passage Day Centre. \u003cbr\u003eHis Man on Bench performances have earned him significant acclaim and have taken place on the pavement of the Southbank and the halls of Tate Exchange.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me tell you a little bit more about my proposed show;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMan on Bench is a participatory performance art piece. The work involves hand creating couture out of discarded clothing and directing volunteer models to perform a narrative informed by the artist\u2019s experience of homelessness. The previous two iterations have focused on the idea of a catwalk, taking tropes from high fashion and reshuffling them, placing ownership of beauty firmly in the realm of society\u2019s most rejected people. \u003cbr\u003eThe Man on Bench is the artist. Physical and psychological traces of David\u2019s homelessness are embodied in the artwork. Its repetition and development are an integral part of David\u2019s recovery process. \u003cbr\u003eMan on Bench Fairytale will be an ambitious, spectacular promenade staging of the full story for the first time. The artwork will be developed to incorporate operatic elements and will address universal themes \u2013 life and death, despair and redemption, adversity and triumph. Man on Bench will take place in the public realm, interrupting everyday life to convey not only that there is beauty to be found in rubbish, but also that we all share common hopes and fears. Together, we can connect with the metaphors and meanings that are found in fairytales. \u003cbr\u003e"
