     "description": "There\u0027s no better feeling in the world than claiming something, then actually making it happen. That\u0027s how the Comic book for Moon Melanin Mami came into play. It started with a thought, and one day, I came across a guy named Dave Branch on Facebook and he just so happened to be a comic illustrator. We quickly become friends and began our collaboration.\u00a0Long story Short, I am here now to set a $500 goal to get the comics printed out. Dave and I really made it happen. For now, the comic is completely digital, but with your help, It could be printed out into physical copies. There\u0027s nothing like that nostalgic feeling of physically holding (your new favorite) comic book right in your hands.",

     "description": "Traveling the world while performing my music and inspiring people through simply what\u00a0I love doing, would be an absolute dream come true. I want to set up the very first tour with the team (3rd world Music Entertainment). I plan to build a tour bus that\u0027s comfy (for at least 12 people) \u00a0to sleep, eat, and record in. 3rd World Music Entertainment is all about spreading positivity, love and enlightening the world through entertainment, art and music. In this world full of hate, there\u0027s a lot of love and peace that needs to be spread, and what stronger influence is there than music? Our team is full of hard working people who all do a range of things such as Rapping, singing, producing, engineering, song writing, dancing, drawing, painting, film making, photography , djing, sewing, embroidering, and we even keep everything in house...Literally. \u00a0It ranges from creating our own custom merch, to recording, to flyers, to music videos, to really anything, you name it. The $8,000 would help us out a lot as far as building our tour bus, creating more merch, paying out artist, paying for venues to perform at, traveling, food and really investing in all that we do.",
