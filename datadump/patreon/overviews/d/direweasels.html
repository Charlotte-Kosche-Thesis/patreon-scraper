Obviously, the podcast will still be free for anyone who wants to listen, but for those of you who want to support us, we appreciate it a whole lot. It still blows my mind that we have fans, and if I am being honest, you guys (and gals) are pretty much the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I am hoping that we can randomly drop in some surprises on occasion, because such things strike me as being pretty cool.
