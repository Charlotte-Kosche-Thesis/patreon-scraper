    "summary": "Hello, I am Dustin. I run the creatively named Youtube channel Dustin where I make videos about nature, science, art, and whatever else I find interesting. Most of you know me for my ecosphere and fish keeping videos, and some of you are fans of my videos on roly polies, charcoal making, animation, etc. I appreciate each and every one of you and thank you all for the support you\u0027ve given me so far. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get a lot of enjoyment out of making these videos. They are really important to me and I want to continue making them for as long as I can. My goal is to create fun and entertaining videos about nature and science without loud obnoxious music and excessive product placement. I want my videos to be easy for anyone to understand, not by dumbing things down, but by talking about hard concepts in ways that are easily relatable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided that I want making videos to be my full time career. I\u0027m amazed at the amount of success I\u0027ve enjoyed so far, and the fact that I can make any money at all doing this is simply mind blowing. At this time, I am very close to being able to pay all of my bills just by making videos on Youtube, but I\u0027m not quite there yet, and this is where I need your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $1 a month you allow my channel to continue existing. You put me in the black. You allow me to make the videos that I care about and can feel proud of without stressing too much about if a video is \"advertiser friendly\" or not. As thanks for your support, you get to watch all of my videos at least 1 day before anyone else on the internet. Sometimes 2 or 3 days in advance if I\u0027m able to finish a video faster than usual. There are no higher reward tiers. $1 gives you everything. If I decide to do any more patreon exclusive stuff in the future, you automatically get access to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money that you contribute will go toward improving all aspects of the channel. With the money I can buy better equipment to make videos with as well as provide funding for bigger and better projects than ever before. The money allows me to dedicate myself to making videos for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether or not you decide to contribute is entirely up to you, and I completely respect your decision no matter what you choose. I am so fortunate to have such an awesome fanbase already and I count my blessings every day!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, \u003cbr\u003eDustin\u003cbr\u003e"
