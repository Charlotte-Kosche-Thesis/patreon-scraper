The 4-week preparation is excellent, I wish I had invested more time in the preparation. Most concepts and practices introduced in the retreat were new to me and very well demonstrated by Simon and Dara. I love the enthusiasm and passion they have which is evident through each element of the retreat. I am particularly grateful for the safe and intimate space they have created for others to share and own. The group really transforms into a new family, a truthful tribe that you can lean on when you need support. It\u2019s a blessing. Every member is there to develop themselves, yet the group energies are working together to allow us to fall into this safety net with all our emotions, suppressed and expressed. This is just the beginning for me on this journey and I look forward to attending more workshops and retreats by Simon and Dara.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://simononthesofa.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/teachers_final.jpg \"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHogar del Nino - Super Hero Teacher Training Day 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://simononthesofa.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/team-hopsters.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Grassy Hopper Corporate Team Day 2016\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://simononthesofa.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/acro.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
