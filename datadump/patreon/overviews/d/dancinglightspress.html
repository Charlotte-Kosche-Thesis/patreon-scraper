    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eAbout the Foragers Guild Guides\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for supporting Dancing Lights Press! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eMost tabletop roleplaying manuals will tell you everything that you need to know about running a game. At the same time, they offer precious little information on how to tell a story. There will be a wealth of advice on how to build a world and develop a setting, but not much on what you should do with those details once you have them. You\u2019ll find volumes on how to maximize your character\u2019s abilities and put them to the best tactical use, but not much on how to use that character to help bring that world to life and tell the story. The Foragers Guild series is for everyone harboring a desire to create better fantasy adventures, no matter what system or setting you\u2019re using. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Three Pillars of Fantasy Adventure\u003c/h2\u003eThe Foragers Guild series asserts that fantasy storytelling requires three essential, non-negotiable elements. You need compelling characters, a captivating setting, and electrifying adventure. These elements apply to any fantasy world and work with any rules system. The interplay of these three pillars is what will make your fantasy adventures stand out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCharacters\u003c/h3\u003eThe best fantasy stories have memorable, even iconic, characters. We all have our favorite fictional heroes and villains. They\u2019re always shaped and supported by the setting. Adventures are about their attempts to achieve their goals and fulfill their ambitions. Characters are the first pillar of fantasy adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWorldbuilding\u003c/h3\u003eSomething about the fantasy genre makes people go crazy for worldbuilding. It\u2019s important to understand why the setting is important, and how the other two pillars balance it out. Your creative efforts must serve the needs of characters and adventures, and not be an end unto itself. Worldbuilding is the second pillar of fantasy adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eStory\u003c/h3\u003eYour adventure needs a plot, whether it\u2019s simply and linear or complex and convoluted. There has to be a beginning, a middle, and an end. There have to be clear goals and objectives for them to accomplish. Otherwise, they will wander aimlessly without any sense of purpose or satisfaction. Story is the third pillar of fantasy adventure. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/h2\u003eThe goal is to publish two Foragers Guild Guides per month. Becoming a patron will allow you to download the PDF and ebook versions earlier, and at a lower price, than they will be available elsewhere. You will also have access to the patrons-only feed and the community area. When we publish things outside of the Foragers Guild line, like original roleplaying games and other creative writing guides, you\u2019ll have access to discount codes on those releases as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ll also get our thanks, no matter what amount you pledge! Your patronage lets us know that this is worth doing, above and beyond the fun we have doing it. At higher levels, you\u2019ll get a direct thank you in the credits of the guides themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Often You\u2019re Charged\u003c/h2\u003ePatronage is per release, rather than per month. When you first sign up as a Dancing Lights Press patron, you will not be charged immediately. When the next guide is released, Patreon will then charge you the amount that you have pledged. We will post a reminder the week before each guide is publisher, to let you know what\u2019s coming. It may take up to 72 hours for the payment to process, and Patreon will send you an email to let you know if your payment has been accepted or declined. We never see your payment information \u2014 you pay Patreon, and Patreon pays us. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy We Need Your Patronage\u003c/h2\u003eIn our first 18 months of existence, Dancing Lights Press released nearly 50 titles for creative writers and tabletop roleplayers. Nearly everything we published became a best seller on DriveThruRPG. We earned a publisher rating of 4.8 out of 5. Our work is well-reviewed, and we have a loyal fan following. It\u2019s something we\u2019re very proud of. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe can do better, though, especially with editing and production value. Economic necessity has forced us to be prolific in order to stay in business. Having a reasonably steady and stable subscriber base, via your patronage here, will mean we don\u2019t have to grind as hard and can put more care into each release. It will allow us to grow, so that we can continue to bring you great releases that are useful and informative.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbout Dancing Lights Press\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://dancinglightspress.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDancing Lights Press\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eis an independent small press publisher that specializes in helping people to discover and explore their own creativity. Our mission is to provide the world with simple and effective processes and techniques that encourage people to try their hand at telling stories, and to help all types of story tellers become better at their craft.\u003cbr\u003e"
