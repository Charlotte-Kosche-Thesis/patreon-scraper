    "summary": "My work has long been about fighting for justice for the least of these, for bringing light into the darkness, and for working to help people to understand themselves as they explore and own their faith. In that vein, I\u0027ve gained a lot of wonderful, kind readers who are smart, engaging and challenging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, I\u0027m asking my readers to help me out by giving back a little. A Patreon campaign is different from Kickstarter in that it\u0027s an ongoing pledge rather than a one-time donation for a large project. It suits blogging and podcasting because it supports ongoing efforts rather than just one large project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s how it works:\u003c/strong\u003e you pledge to tip me an amount - say, $1 per post. I post anywhere between 15-20 posts in a month, which means I would get paid for however many posts I can create. But you, the reader, don\u0027t have to worry about your wallet because you can set a monthly maximum on your donation. Say you can only donate $10 a month but I post 16 times? You still only pay that $10.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will your money be used?\u003c/strong\u003e Money generated from this campaign will go toward website hosting costs, rent on a small co-working office space here in town, and toward podcast start up costs. I plan to put the money from this campaign back into generating content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve set up some rewards for monthly pledges that I think will fit my readers\u0027 sensibilities. As a teacher and a writer, I believe good editing and tutoring sessions are helpful, especially since so many of my readers are in college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if you can\u0027t help out monetarily? \u003c/strong\u003eThis Patreon campaign changes literally nothing for readers of my blog - you won\u0027t suddenly be charged to visit my site or be annoyed with pop-up ads. I will still be producing content and curating blog posts - I\u0027ll just be doing it in a more financially secure state."
