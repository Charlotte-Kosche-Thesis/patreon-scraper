    "summary": "Dead Company is a game media company that specializes in Fallout lore. Our main project at the moment is \"Tales of the Waste\", a machinima about a group of mercenaries in post-apocalyptic Boston. We would eventually love to start creating quest mods and other Dead Co-related content as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes us different from other machinima-makers? \u003c/strong\u003eWell, for starters, Tales is not a comedy. While the more popular Fallout machinimas like \"Raiders\" and \"Psycho\" are awesome and very funny, the vibe we\u0027re going for is something in the realm of story-driven action-adventure. There are still tons of laughs and sometimes we suspend our disbelief, but at the end of the day we want to portray the weight and hardships that come with living in a post-apocalyptic world. We strive to tell a story with a lot of heart that people can relate to, while keeping it fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut isn\u0027t machinima kind of a dead medium?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Yep. Pretty much every machinima we\u0027ve ever loved has run its course or seems to be on an indefinite hiatus, save for the ones that have 30k+ subscribers. (RIP K\u0027Joor) Part of the reason is that the people involved got offered work in the game or voice industry that actually pays, and we are thrilled for them! It\u0027s probably also partly because streaming and Let\u0027s Plays are what\u0027s popular right now, and we understand that sometimes you just have to go where the money goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo if machinimas are dead, why a machinima series?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Well, many reasons! One reason is that everyone involved lives in different parts of North America; we can\u0027t live act even though we would love to. No one among us is an animator, and we are all broke young adults who can\u0027t afford to hire one. Machinima is an equalizing medium; the results and quality you get are directly related to how much time and effort you put in. Anybody who has a gaming PC and a decent mic can do this, but very few people are willing to put in the work. Our team has spent hundreds of hours learning console commands, scouring the Nexus for mods, recording audio, editing, and of course writing the scripts. It\u0027s a labor of love... Which leads me to reason number two: \u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s not about the money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s not about the money? So what are you doing here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I said it\u0027s not \u003cem\u003eabout\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0the money, I didn\u0027t say we don\u0027t want any money! But seriously, we do this because we love what we do. We are invested in these characters and their story. We have never intended to make money from this project, and even if we never earn a dime, we all intend to stick with it indefinitely. We never anticipated we would have fans, and we didn\u0027t expect how much other people would enjoy the things we create. That said, we are all either full-time students, have full-time jobs, or do both part-time, and one of us has a kid; we give all the free time we have to Dead Company, and all of the editing is done by two people. We don\u0027t monetize on YouTube and we don\u0027t profit from any ads. We figure if we had a little help, we could do even more for our fans, who we love more than anything and who we would be nothing without.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven if you can\u0027t afford to back us, \u003cem\u003ethank you \u003c/em\u003efor your support! \u003c/strong\u003eMoney doesn\u0027t grow on trees, and we know that most of the people who enjoy our content are young like we are and don\u0027t have the means to send money; that doesn\u0027t matter at all. We freaked out when our YouTube channel hit 100 subscribers, were stunned when we passed 200, and now we are up to 300 in three months. There aren\u0027t any words that describe how much every fan means to us. We have been sent beautiful fan art and even a music video featuring scenes from our show, and at the end of the day that\u0027s all we need. I tear up when I think about it. We love you all.\u003cbr\u003e"
