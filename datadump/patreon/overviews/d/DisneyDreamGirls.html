    "summary": "Michelle and Jayne are just a couple of girls from the UK who met due to their mutual love of theme parks. At the time, Michelle was the host of another Disney theme park podcast - called the Minnie Minxies whilst Jayne and her husband were listeners. One day, they messaged the show to say how much they enjoyed listening. Well many messages later, Michelle and Jayne met up and became friends. Alas the Minnie Minxies podcast ended but Michelle could not think of anyone else to co-host than Jayne. Nearly two hundred shows later, the show is still going strong. That is currently down to having such wonderful Patreon supporters. They help cover the costs associated to create and keep the show running. In return,\u00a0 they give their thanks but also additional content.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the podcast they share their passion of the theme parks. Whether it being the amazing attractions, spectacular entertainment or delicious Disney food they talk about it all! Through their knowledge, or that of their guests, they share tips, news, park history or just talk through a trip report but the aim is to make the show as informative and fun as they can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, you can help now support the show grow by giving any amount you wish; whether a one off amount, or a monthly contribution. \u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
