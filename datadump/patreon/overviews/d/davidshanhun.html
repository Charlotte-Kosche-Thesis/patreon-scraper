Up until now I have had to work feverishly hard playing gigs at bars, functions, have performed at birthday parties from a 1 year old and also a 100 year old (both pretty cool!) - and while I love this, it has me left stressed and burnt out... and that means I only share a small part of myself with you all. With your support I can do one less gig per week, still pay my rent, and have the time and energy available to share heartfelt music with you all via video.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy heart is in contributing and connecting with people - and I feel that I can best do this through sharing my music with you and connecting soul to soul on video, and by giving other musicians a helping start with recording and videoing them - for an example check out this super talented guy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/2B5KpC86vgA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eZarek Silberschmidt\u003c/a\u003e that we recently created a video for - what a guy!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tYour money will go into one of 4 things.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t1. Paying the colleagues that up until now have done recording and filming for free.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSome of these people turn up with $1000\u0027s of dollars of equipment (myself included), that we have spent a lifetime to purchase in order to make better music and video and be able to share our love with you.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t2. Paying my bills. Really. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tA chunk of each donation will go towards my rent and living costs - this allows me to take one day a week (at this stage) to work on recording, filming, and editing.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t(I am responsible at the moment for not only performing and singing and working on becoming a better guitarist and musician - but also planning video shoots and locations, colour grading and correction, shot to shot matching and editing, recording/mixing and mastering audio, and also releasing and promotion of the music. One day a week of my life paid for to be able to pursue this worry free means the world to me - thank you!)\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t3. Your support allows me to film and record younger artists that deserve a break, and not charge them for my time, equipment, editing etc. I am super passionate about seeing young artists follow their dreams, and my hope is I can make their journey an easier road than mine.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t4. Equipment. Sometimes video\u0027s need some fairy lights in the background. We need to hire a hall or stage. Perhaps we feel we need a clown costume. There are always some incidental costs to set the stage and your contribution will help to fund these.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for being a part of the team!\u003c/strong\u003e I can only create and share my heart with the world with you on my team. Whether it\u0027s $1 or $1000 per creation we are all on the team together making this happen. Plus I get to share some cool footage of behind the scenes, as well as being grateful for your input into this journey as we grow and evolve together. Thank you so much for helping start this next chapter of music and video creation and support of artists!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\txox\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tDavid Shanhun\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE NOTE: I will never collect on video\u0027s where I have been paid upfront to create them, or on short vlogs or updates. Until now I have been creating all video\u0027s using my own time and money and the generous donation of time and equipment from friends and super helpful people. It will be so nice to be able to pay these generous people for their time/equipment and skills. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"

I\u0027ll be creating unique content for you above and beyond - your support really means SO much to me, and I want to pass on that gratitude. Think personalised short songs that might appear on a usb drive in the mail, or perhaps it would mean the world to have a video made for a friend of me singing a song just for him or her... Let me know how I can share the love you\u0027ve passed on here!",
