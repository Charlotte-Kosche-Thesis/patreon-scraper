Your monthly contributions helps me pay for lodging, studio/dungeon rentals, touring expenses, repair our gear, buy new equipment, plane/bus/train/ferry tickets, merchandise costs to produce DVDs, t-shirts/hats/etc. for you \u003cem\u003e(my loyal diehard fans and low income kinky queer/Trans/gender nonconformists who pay for amazing stuff that I create, write/produce, etc., at affordable prices)\u003c/em\u003e, and the basic overhead costs I need paid for to keep myself afloat so I can work less at my day jobs and dedicate more time to multiple projects/ventures, Black Swan Productions, CrashPad Series, writing for BDSM blogs/magazines, host a podcast show, write more, filmmaking/producing/directing, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eI use Patreon not only as a way to sustain a stable source of monthly income to be able to do what I love doing on the road, in studio spaces, dungeons and all over the world, but also as an official online fan club platform for you, the fans, to gain access to many exclusive/Patreon-only content not found anywhere else, gain an in-depth unrestricted all-access special fan club-style membership to see what I\u0027m doing behind-the-scenes, on the road, off the road, at home, in studios/dungeons and basically anywhere, everywhere and nowhere I go, wherever my multi-industry/multimedia kinky smut entrepreneurship career leads me to. You also get the ability to get some really cool freebies/bad-ass gear, merchandise, and many more fan club membership incentives as well. Your recurring monthly pledge of $1, $2, $3, $4 and/or $5 gives me more freedom to do what I love doing best and continue to do it for you all. Patreon provides part of the solution to the tricky question of how an kinky and queer entrepreneurial creative artist can afford to make their work in the 21st century; at the same time it gives you and the entire world a chance for a deeper connection on the Patreon-only Delirium Sade Fan Club platform right here, right now and live anytime, anywhere, any place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eTo pledge to become an official fan club member here on Patreon, choose one of the reward levels on the right side. Your credit card(s) is charged monthly upfront, around the 1st. So it\u0027s a monthly recurring donation, kind of like the way you support NPR or PBS or having a magazine subscription monthly to your favorite magazine(s). You get the idea. Also, what I mean by upfront, for example, if you join me on Patreon today as a patron/fan and be a part of the Delirium Sade community, say on January 5th, you would get charged automatically on the first of every month, so basically you can join any day of the month and not worry about being charged until the first, so it\u0027s always good to have your credit card(s) handy and funds available. I only charge you based on how much you donate to my fan-club platform every month, so rest assured, I\u0027ll be very respectful of your monthly budget and living expenses. You also have the ability to change your monthly membership fee(s) at any time in case your monthly budget and living expenses get to be a wee bit too pricey - believe me, I know what it was like living off PB\u0026amp;J sandwiches and ramen noodles for months on a very tight living expenses budget, trying to keep a roof over my head and paying the bills on time; so I definitely don\u0027t want you to be broke or homeless or a combination of the two, if you can\u0027t afford a higher-level monthly fan club membership with us - which is why we made it so cheap for you to get on the Delirium Sade Fan Club for only $1, $2, $3, $4 and/or $5 a month! The $10/month subscription option is for VIP subscribers that can afford it, whilst the other subscription options is for low-income/marginalized members who cannot afford the higher price(s).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImmerse yourselves in my kinky and queer world behind the scenes, in studios/dungeons, on the road, on/off camera and everywhere else, help keep the bohemian art revolution alive and enjoy this amazing journey with me and my crew. And guess what? You\u0027re not just my fans/patrons here on the Patreon-only fan club platform; you\u0027re about to be a part of the independent artist/creative entrepreneur/small business multi-industry progressive revolution!
