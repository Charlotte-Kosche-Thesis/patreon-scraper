I love a good, creepy, supernatural thriller, and most of my work falls in the horror or mystery category. As a comic book fan since I was about 12, I also love a good superhero story where the good guy prevails and the villain gets his.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy most recent work appears in\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Dark Reaches,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a horror comic anthology that brings together writers and artists from all over the country and from different backgrounds and styles. I have three shorts included in the first volume. I also serve as editor, and Volume 2 is currently in the works. I\u0027ve also been included in other horror anthologies as well as a comic tribute to the late David Bowie, \u003cem\u003eSpiders and Stardust\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my \"day job\" I\u0027m a freelance writer and provide daily content for various online companies and websites. I\u0027ve also been an editor for almost 20 years. My training in editorial and writing in different genres, styles, and media have made me a better storyteller. I write every day, whether for my freelance gigs or just for myself, and the more you write, the easier it is to get your voice out there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being part of my writing. I hope you enjoy the journey, and I hope it inspires you to create and express yourself in whatever way works for you."
