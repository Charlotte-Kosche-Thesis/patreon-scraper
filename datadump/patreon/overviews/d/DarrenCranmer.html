    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings art-loving Patrons!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I am a professional visual artist who currently works mostly with oil paint. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy conceptual series titled \u0027Being\u0027 combines realistic figurative portraits within a ethereal environment. \u0027Being\u0027 is an ongoing series of oil paintings expressing my exploration of scientific and philosophical theories and issues related to \u0027illusion of self\u0027, \u0027influence of environments\u0027 and the \u0027question of consciousness\u0027. I aim to accomplish this by producing detailed figurative work interacting with abstract and surreal techniques that act ambiguously yet symbolically. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim for my Patreon page is to simply raise support from people who like/appreciate this body of work to help me cover the ongoing material and future promotional costs towards organising an exhibition of the paintings once enough are completed (excluding those that may be sold prior).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee the pledge tiers for the rewards and perks I am offering in return for your kind support. I post regular progress updates at least on a weekly basis minimum. An opportunity to critically engage with the journey of this series is also present through becoming a patron, this excites me very much because I will be able to pick your brains about how my work is digested by different people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit more about who I am and what I do...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBorn in England and raised in Guernsey of the Channel Islands most of my life, I have been drawing, painting, making since I was crawling about as an infant. I gained a BA (Hons) Degree in Illustration and a BTEC Diploma in Art and Design by 2011 and I have worked as a professional illustrator, a graphic designer and fine jewellery maker to name but a few. The art was always been there though and in 2015 my partner Viola and I moved to a rural cottage and plot in west Hungary to be self-sufficient and to enable us to work in our passions. We have three goofy rescue dogs and we have never been happier. We live very modestly and enjoy being in this lovely nature environment. I have been making a living painting affordable semi-abstract landscapes and seascapes along with personalised portraits with good success. However during this time I have also been creating conceptual series of works such as \u0027Being\u0027 for which this Patreon page has been created - and that\u0027s where I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many an artist knows, creating for a living is a very intrinsic impulse yet it can be difficult to get your work seen to the right audience thus improving your income stability and career. I hope you can feel the craftsmanship and concept throughout my paintings upon viewing and feel this body of work is worthy of your pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEternal thanks and biscuits,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDarren Cranmer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll artwork\u00a0\u00a9Darren Cranmer.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrevious exhibitions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomerset House, London, England\u003cbr\u003eLa Galleria, London, England\u003cbr\u003eSaatchi Gallery, London, England\u003cbr\u003eRoyal West of England Academy, Bristol, England\u003cbr\u003eThe Old Truman Brewery, London, England\u003cbr\u003eGuernsey Picture Framers, Guernsey, Channel Islands\u003cbr\u003eGate House Gallery, Guernsey, Channel Islands\u003cbr\u003eGuernsey Airport, Channel Islands\u003cbr\u003eToko, Guernsey, Channel Islands\u003cbr\u003e"
