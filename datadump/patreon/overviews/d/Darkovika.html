I\u0027ve learned what it feels like to overextend past your limits, and I\u0027ve carefully learned to recognize what it feels like when I\u0027m losing that love for my content. Right now, we\u0027re in this tentative place where I\u0027m loving what I\u0027m doing- but I\u0027d love to do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was always really nervous about creating a Patreon. But receiving support in the way that I have from my community has been... it\u0027s been a huge lift to my spirits. To my energy, my hopes, my dreams- and it reminded me most of all of what\u0027s literally at the core of my youtube channel: my community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo while there\u0027s only a single tier right now, know that anything you give is helping mounds in bringing me one step closer to dedicated, constant content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs cheesy as it sounds, ever since I was a little girl all I\u0027ve ever wanted was to spread happiness and make people laugh. If I\u0027ve succeeded in that for you, then that\u0027s all that matters to me. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"

Watching my little Potato Buddies interact and become a tight knit family has become one of my most favorite things about this, and while I don\u0027t always hop in or join in, it\u0027s because I love seeing people who may never have met interact and grow together and become good friends. I love everything about the people that have joined this youtube family, and while I know it won\u0027t stay innocent forever, in this time it\u0027s beautiful in all of its youthful glory.",
