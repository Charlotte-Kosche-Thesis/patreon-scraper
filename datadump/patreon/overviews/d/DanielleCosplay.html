    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BHSout7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey guys! I\u0027m Danielle Beaulieu, \u00a0but you can just call me Danielle or Danielle \"Baloo\" since no one can pronounce it! I live near Boston in Massachusetts, been here my entire life! I am an ex-World of Warcraft addict and used to raid 8 hours a night, 5 nights a week in two guilds as high as top 100 US. Lately, I spend my time playing a MUCH healthier amount of video games and now I have even picked up this crazy hobby called cosplay! I found a way to project my obsessions in a productive manner. I\u0027ve had my own apartment since the young age of seventeen, still live here with my two shelter mutts Dante and Sophia. Growing up, my brother and I shared a passion for video games. We both became obsessed with MMO\u0027s when we got our first PC. This is why a good portion of my cosplays today are inspired heavily by PC games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been technically cosplaying for over a decade now. I was fourteen when I made my first cosplay, Kairi from Kingdom Hearts 2 with my great grandmother. Before that, my dad used to make us our halloween costumes since my brother and I wanted to be characters like Charizard and other pokemon you couldn\u0027t just buy at the halloween store. I picked up an interest for costume making from that. I would go to Anime Boston every year and attend panels with a small group of friends and browse the dealers room. I had NO idea cosplay or conventions would be so huge back then. I\u0027ve always been a good artist so it was only a matter of time before my love for art and my obsession with video games crossed paths, I was pretty much destined to become a cosplayer at some point. \u00a0However, It wasn\u0027t until a few years ago that I quit raiding so much and focused on really harnessing my craftsmanship skills and putting out impressive work that would go on to gain me some recognition in the cosplay community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past three years, cosplay has shaped me into a better person. I was always a hermit, I grew up preferring to stay in on my games than go out and socialize. I always had a hard time with social interaction and I still struggle with social anxiety. Being pretty much flung into this cosplay world all of a sudden thanks to social media has made me face my fears of social interaction straight-on and helped me cope better. I have learned so much and come so far, I am so grateful to have had this life experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wg1VeGw.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI signed up for Patreon as a way for my followers and I to mutually benefit from each other. I spend all of my time on these costumes, and to be able to do what I love makes me feel so unbelievably fortunate. The support I gain from you helps me continue to be able to do this as much as I do, and in return I offer all of my secrets and tips that I am learning along the way. I appreciate all forms of support, you know just following me on social media, chatting with me at a con, sharing a photo, writing me a letter/message, I am beyond appreciative no matter what shape the support comes in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is no secret though that cosplay can get expensive. I will typically create all of my costumes completely from scratch which will range in the $200-$1,000 price range depending on what the project calls for. I would say on average it takes $300 to complete a good costume from me. Your support on here will allow me to create these costumes faster than ever before and produce new content each month. Since cosplay is a hobby, I prioritize my real life over it, never putting it before rent, bills, feeding myself or my dogs. Before Patreon, this meant that I would have to wait months before I had the funds to finish the next big project making sure it never got in the way of responsibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e No matter what, I will always have the same high standards for my craftsmanship, but the support from Patreon allows me to continue my cosplays uninterrupted as I grow my workspace, quality of my content, and my equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always give back to anyone that supports me on here. Even the lowest pledge grants you access to my Patreon exclusive newsfeed where you get sneak peeks of what I am up to that I don\u0027t post on my public pages. You\u0027ll also get all of my tutorials, handy tips, and\u00a0all of my works in progress photos as a huge thank you for enjoying my work enough to want to fund it. And of course higher pledges receive rewards in the mail each month! I will also try to occasionally bring people random goodies that aren\u0027t part of their pledge agreement as I get them to thank you guys :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Gmy0NUC.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/TjvraQo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to keep a good balance of both! No matter what reason you follow me for, I am so appreciative for you visiting my Patreon to check it out! Thank you!\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"
