    "summary": "A huge thank you for coming here today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me tell you just a bit about me. I am 42 as of this posting, obviously male, and have been playing video games since Pong first became commercially available. Grew up with rolls of quarters in an arcade, and when times were tough, when my mom would make her monthly payment at some department store, I would go next door to the Federated (big box store like Best Buy today), and I would play the Nintendo that they had hooked up. The employees all knew me, and knew when I\u0027d be coming, so they would make sure the game was ready to go. It was pretty cool, so were they. I have played on various consoles, and even built several kickass gaming computers in my time. I am currently living in Texas, but was born and raised in San Diego, Ca.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube journey started with this killer idea I had for a guard tower in Fallout 4. I made a short showcase video, with a crappy mic and \"less than HD\" video quality. I so badly wanted to share this idea I had with others. See, that is my life purpose...to share what I know with others. I currently have around 2200 subs on YouTube, and that is incredible, to me at least. I never went into any of this thinking I would make it a long term hobby, but then some of them messaged me telling me to set up a patreon, that they wanted to contribute to the little community I had built.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am incredibly humbled by this sentiment.\u00a0If you like the work I do on YouTube and Twitch, and want to show me some love, that is awesome and incredibly generous of you. Check out the patron tiers to the left to see which tier works with your current situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDraco"
