    "summary": "My name\u0027s Alex. I\u0027m a sociologist at RMIT in Melbourne. I study how social movements shape popular culture and the global political economy of late-capitalism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve just pledged to become a Patron, thanks so much for your support! By pledging you\u0027re now enabling me to focus on developing my writing and sharing it with you. The last few years I\u0027ve struggled with this as I\u0027ve never had enough time between teaching, marking, thesis fieldwork, conference papers. What can I say, I\u0027ve been a busy boy and writing was sacrificed to make everything else work smoothly. Enter the Patreon. So what can you expect to find here if you subscribe? Quite a lot as it turns out:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- short articles\u003cbr\u003e- essays \u003cbr\u003e- first drafts of book chapters\u003cbr\u003e- short videos \u003cbr\u003e- eventually a podcast, pending enough support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put our sociologist hats on for a moment, your support isn\u0027t so much about me as an individual but rather about what kind of society we want to live in. I see Patreon as a platform for us to take a \nstand against the idea that only those born into privilege and wealth \nshould be free to express themselves creatively. If we grow it, Patrons could effectively form a global \nmovement for a world where the \nautonomous, creative labour of all is valued by society as a whole. That seems like an idea worthy of a reward - so I think you just earned yourself a treat!"
