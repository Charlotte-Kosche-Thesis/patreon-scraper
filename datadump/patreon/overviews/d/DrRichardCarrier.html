I\u0027m a published philosopher and historian of antiquity, \nspecializing in contemporary philosophy of naturalism and in Greco-Roman \nphilosophy, science, and religion, including the origins of \nChristianity. I write on many subjects, ranging from social issues to modern philosophy and ancient history, especially the philosophy of naturalism and the historicity of Jesus. I also publish advice and resources for critical thinking and countering Christian apologetics. I also teach online and have written lots of books. For more about me and my work\n see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.richardcarrier.info\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.richardcarrier.info\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how you can help. And what you get out of it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve escaped the interdepartmental politics and tanking fortunes of the formal academy to write independently and pursue my uses as an educator, activist, historian, and philosopher. Through your patronage you will help support and inspire me to produce excellent and original content in many subjects, both in books and online. With your pledges you will be investing in and rewarding this content production and benefiting directly and indirectly by making it available, for consultation, as well as reference and dissemination. You can make use of my research, and enjoy learning from it as well. I will in turn benefit from having more financial security. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou get to post comments on my blog.\u003c/strong\u003e And they won\u0027t go to moderation like others do. They\u0027ll publish immediately! As soon as I get your email address on my blog\u0027s white-list. Note that few others are allowed to post comments on my blog.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou get to comment on my Facebook posts.\u003c/strong\u003e If you want that privilege. Just send me a Facebook Friend request and remind me you\u0027re a Patreon patron. Only my Facebook Friends can post comments on my Facebook.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou get my time.\u003c/strong\u003e If you email or message me in any medium with a question, just remind me you\u0027re a Patreon patron, and I\u0027ll give you a thoughtful answer as soon as I can.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou help make my work accessible to the public.\u003c/strong\u003e You will find many of my articles useful to cite or point people to, or as resources that help you and your allies argue better with your intellectual opponents everywhere. And I couldn\u0027t produce so much work each month without growing patron support.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd all that, for just a few dollars a month. I will not collect pledges for just any blog post. I will collect only for substantive blog posts of original content in some area of intellectual or factual knowledge and concern. Posts announcing classes or events, or making brief observations, and the like, won\u0027t be counted. So you will only be funding the big stuff. Check out my most recent posts (below) for some examples. It\u0027s almost always just four posts per month. And never more than six. Regardless, when you pledge here, \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913729-How-do-I-set-a-monthly-limit-to-my-pledge-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon your patron page\u003c/a\u003e you will have the option of setting maximums per month that won\u0027t be exceeded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig pledges can earn yet more perks (see right margin). But small pledges can mean a lot when a lot of patrons join in. So if you think my work is worthwhile, please do recommend this page to other potential patrons you may know. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
