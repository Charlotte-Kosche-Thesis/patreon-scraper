Thanks for visiting.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Dave and I am a writer\u00a0and game designer.\u00a0I blog too, on a blog called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://karavansara.live\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKaravansara\u003c/a\u003e (in English)\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand a blog called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://strategieevolutive.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estrategie evolutive\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e(in Italian).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI write science fiction and fantasy, adventure and thrillers, often with a historical element. I blog about anything I like, along those same lines.\u003cbr\u003eMaybe you\u0027ve read some of my stories, or played some of my games, or visited my blogs, and that\u0027s the reason you are here.\u003cbr\u003eOr maybe not. You\u0027re welcome anyway!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e I \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eam here, on the other hand, is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eto connect with my readers, in order\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eto write more, and to write better.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a paleontologist and geologist by trade, and I worked for many years in academia. I always loved writing and reading fiction - it was my hobby. But when my job expired in 2014 (not many dinosaurs around anymore) I decided to start writing professionally, while I waited for the phone to ring and a new job to appear. The phone has not rung yet, and in the last two years I\u2019ve been (barely) paying my bills with my writing and my translation work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd really, it\u0027s so fun it\u0027s almost exhilarating, this writing business.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s uncertain and risky, but it\u0027s lots of fun. For me and, hopefully, for my readers.\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why this Patreon page exists is, I\u0027m trying to find more time to write, and I\u0027m trying to keep the occasional bouts of panic at bay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNo more fear of late payments, of disappearing clients, of sudden unexpected bills. No need to take time-consuming side jobs to avoid bankruptcy.\u003cbr\u003eMore tranquility, more time to write, to write more and to write better.\u003cbr\u003eAnd thanks to you I will make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what\u0027s in it for \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e, when you join this Patreon thing?\u003cbr\u003eI will post a lot of behind-the-scenes and notes, and character sketches and to-do lists and deleted scenes, photo references and fist uncorrected drafts... all the flotsam and the jetsam of a writing life. Just for you.\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027ll post new short stories, one per month, and you will see them here first.\u003cbr\u003eIn English, for sure, and also... \u003cem\u003eah, anche in italiano se qualcuno fosse interessato.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you\u0027ll also get a first look at my new stuff.\u003cbr\u003eThis, for starters. Who knows what else we could start - a podcast would be fun, but that\u0027s just me. Got any ideas?\u003cbr\u003eAnd most of all, do you feel like joining my community, read my stuff, and make it easier for me to live a panic-free writing life?\u003cbr\u003eBelieve me, this is going to be fun.\u003cbr\u003e"
