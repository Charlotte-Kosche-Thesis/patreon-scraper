    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSeveral years ago, my life was changed forever when I experienced fire dancing for the first time at Burning Man. I endeavored to learn the art and channeled my heart and soul into it. To give myself a regular goal to shoot for, I started uploading weekly videos to my YouTube channel showcasing what I\u0027d learned every week. These videos quickly took on a life of their own and I got unprecedented opportunities to travel, teach, and perform. I\u0027ve grown from a hobbyist to an educator in this art that I love and have spent a huge portion of the past seven years spreading that love around the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the Flow Arts?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Flow Arts are a collection of movement arts that include elements of circus, dance, martial arts, sports, and meditation to create a unique and rapidly growing artform. Usually, this consists of learning how to manipulate one more more props such as Maori poi, hula hoops, staves, juggling clubs, or many more in an aesthetically pleasing way. Practicing this art frequently has meditative benefits for participants and for many the goal of this practice is to attain a state of \"flow\" in which movement becomes effortless and unconsciously guided. Even if flow isn\u0027t your goal, however, spinning props is great fun and a wonderful form of exercise!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my Goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Flow Arts is an amazing community for self-empowerment and fulfillment, but our resources haven\u0027t kept pace with our meteoric growth in the past few years. We have a wonderfully diverse and passionate group of people to draw on, but frequently the resources they have to draw upon are scattered and incomplete. Over the past 7 years I\u0027ve learned a lot about educating people on how to spin their props but that only scratches the surface of what we need as flow artists to realize our goals. I want to take knowledge that has been accrued within the community and make it more broadly available to the wider world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have viewers in countries and places that I\u0027ll never be able to visit myself. I\u0027d like to give them the tools that they need to be able to select which tools they want to spin, meet other individuals that share their passion, how to spin safely, learn to dance with their prop, and many many other topics. I want my channel to become an online knowledge base for the Flow Arts world. A place where people come to in order to get the answer to common questions. Help me get there by supporting this effort here on Patreon!"

If we get to this point I\u0027ll go through each and every video and arrange playlists by tricks, concepts, and learning progressions to make them a much more user-friendly resource and not a scary and shapeless blob of content (there are over 400 of them, so this is actually quite a lot of work).",
