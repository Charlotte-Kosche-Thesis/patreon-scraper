Now... what would one do here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is Patreon, the home of starving and not so starving artists getting pledges from people who like them. It\u0027s a fantastic way to support me, if you\u0027d like to support me. I can make more content for you all! I\u0027ve also come to the conclusion that nothing should be totally exclusive. Sure, you get access to posts you wouldn\u0027t otherwise get access to if you pledge a dollar, but nothing more than that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlright... cut the crap. How much do you want?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSure, money is the root of all evil, but it sure helps us creators out with funding for anything involved in the process. Keep in mind that pledging more than somebody else won\u0027t get you anything more. This isn\u0027t a business, it\u0027s an abstract upturned hat on the sidewalk in front of me drawing. You can pledge however much you want, and I\u0027ll be eternally grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I get if I throw money at you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ll get access to my Patreon and everything it has to offer, which is a godsend in itself. That includes Patron-only posts, polls, drawings, whatever. You\u0027ll also get access to my drawings a day earlier than when I post them on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e-D3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
