    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFour years ago I had a cardiac arrest and it changed everything.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e It has made me really passionate about healthcare and how technology is used in this space. I\u0027m also super interested in helping individuals track their health, be it physical or mental, and then compare that data to find useful insights. Three months of sleep data is really helping me personally see its affect on my anxiety and depression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy goal\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is to dedicate my time to building useful hacks around my ideas and releasing them to the world for free. I\u0027ll be trying to organize hack meetups to try to bring others together around common good. I personally suffer with mental health problems which are currently preventing me from working a \"normal job\" but I still want to contribute. I plan to try to organize something that can allow others in similar shoes, be it poverty or poor health, to come together and work on things in a constructive environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYour pledge will help\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I currently live on sickness benefits your pledges will immediately help to make this possible. Simple things like bus fare and tube travel are out of my budget right now. I can work on some of this from home, but to make meetups work I\u0027ll need to go places. To test ideas with real people will require that I can get to real people. Some hackdays already exist, like NHS Hack Day, which I often cannot afford to attend due to transport and accomodation fees. Your pledges will help me turn my ideas into reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy can I do this? Why me?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve worked in technology across numerous disciplines (marketing, healthcare, business) as a Software Engineer and Systems Administrator. My work in healthcare was at the personal healthcare company\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.babylonhealth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBabylon Health\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve studied Information Architecture and Practices \u0026amp; Theories in Interaction Design at City University and have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://didlix.net/portfolio.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eposted my coursework online\u003c/a\u003e. My hacks have won prizes at NHS Hackday. I can code both frontend (HTML \u0026amp; CSS) and backend (Rails, Django \u0026amp; Drupal).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy work to date.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eAll of my hacks to date can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/crowdhealthio\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy github\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027m working on getting my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://crowdhealth.io\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eportfolio website\u003c/a\u003e back up and running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eInclusivity.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a queer transgender woman and I care a lot about inclusivity. I want everything I work on to be as inclusive as possible by default, not the other way around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eFirst Step. \u003c/i\u003eMy first step is to organize a weekly working session at a community workspace in London. I\u0027ll be there working every week. I\u0027ll get the website back up, setup collaboration tools and then start my first project. A mood tracking hack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSecond Step.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eOrganize a weekly work group so that others can come along and work on hacks (be it there own or one of mine). With focus on making the meetup compatible with people on low-income or people with health problems. Try and find sponsorship for this to cover expenses like travel for people who are on benefits or have specific travel needs, as well as inclusive food for people so they don\u0027t starve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThird Step.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eHopefully I\u0027ll have something good going, rinse and repeat. Look into setting up rewards for backers, like stickers and t-shirts, or something. Review everything, make sure I\u0027m doing a good job. Seek feedback.\u003cbr\u003e"
