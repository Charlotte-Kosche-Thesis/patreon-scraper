    "summary": "Hello! My name is David, but the name I go by on my art pages is Diction. I am a small artist who works primarily on NSFW (18+) art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is simply an opportunity for those who wish to support me to have a simple way of doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my current work is nsfw. I primarily draw \u0027clop\u0027 art. As a result, most (but not all) of my \"full drawings\" will be nsfw in nature (probably going to have hard core sex). The point of this patreon is so that I can continue what I love, as well as comfortably branch out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter an amazing experience vending at Bronycon 2015, I want to pursue my work as an artist. But at this point, I don\u0027t quite have the time to draw anything but commissions. I can\u0027t spend my time drawing things for myself or for conventions, because I am not making any money while doing so. That is why I am starting this Patreon! I can deviate from commissions a little bit, and not have to worry as much about lack of funds for day-to-day life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you can help me out by pledging to give me an amount you decide (under a budget you decide on) for every full drawing of mine.\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I mean \"full drawing\"? Something that has been lined, colored, shaded, and finished. This doesn\u0027t include colored sketches or WIPs. The drawings may be safe or unsafe for work. \u003cbr\u003eThe frequency at which I draw full drawings heavily depends on a number of factors. I may to two in a month, or three in a week. For this reason, I\u0027d advise setting a maximum budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis only applies to non-commissions. I will not ask for money for something that has already been payed for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease visit me at any of my webpages\u003cbr\u003edictionart.tumblr.com\u003cbr\u003edictionart.deviantart.com\u003cbr\u003edictionscloset.tumblr.com (NSFW)\u003cbr\u003efuraffinity.net/user/dictionmlp/ (NSFW)\u003cbr\u003e"
