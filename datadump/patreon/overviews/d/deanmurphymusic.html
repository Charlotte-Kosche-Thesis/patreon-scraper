I\u0027ve done this for a few reasons that i feel are important both personal and professional. After a very important regrouping time I\u0027m focusing Youtube again but really honing in what it is I\u0027m trying to get across. The pledges will be taken after a new video is posted on my Youtube page, Ill be mostly focusing on Original song play through\u0027s (starting with very in depth play through\u0027s of the songs on my new CD Biodiversity) and more in depth extended range guitar lessons. I\u0027m hoping that i can get out at least a video per month but going to be shooting for every two weeks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron will give me the resources i need to put out videos to the quality that i feel matches the music. Ill be able to hire on camera operators when need be, rent or purchase new equipment like cameras, microphones, props, location rentals, etc. All my videos on my Youtube will remain free but this gives me the ability to get them finished quicker and to higher quality and gives you a chance to see and hear what is going on before its released.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
