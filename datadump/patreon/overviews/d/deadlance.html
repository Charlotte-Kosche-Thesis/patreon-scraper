Having this creative outlet allows me to get my head out of the cloud and into a mode of relaxation and self expression. Artwork is my passion and I would love nothing more than to make it my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary passion is in leatherwork, some photography, and now more recently, video production. Deadlance Steamworks gives me the avenue to express myself while enjoying the beauty in the world around me. It allows me to venture into my imagination and bring to life all the things I envision and dream about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeadlance Steamworks is also an artist collaborative. Frequently I host productivity nights in the shop where other artists gather and work on their projects in the company of others who enjoy doing the same things. Writers, photographers, painters, other leatherworkers, and other crafters alike. Not only that but I frequently utilize those other artists in my own projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowd funding website that enables me to reach out and ask for financial help to support my family and the artwork I do.  Patron\u2019s can pledge a certain amount of money per thing I publish and earn rewards based on the amount they pledge. At the beginning of each month, Patreon processes all the pledges and transfers that to me so that I can purchase supplies, pay other artists for their assistance, and continue to support my family all while pursuing my dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI greatly appreciate those of you who support me in any way, whether it be financially on Patreon, or just sharing the posts of my work. It means the world to me that people out there enjoy what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we all know that word of mouth is the best form of marketing, please don\u2019t hesitate to share and click the like button on my videos.\u003cbr\u003e"
