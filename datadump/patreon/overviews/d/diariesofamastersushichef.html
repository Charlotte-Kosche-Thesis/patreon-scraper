    "summary": "For the last 5 years, many of you have followed my journey on YouTube where I have showed my sushi making and kitchen skills that I\u2019ve learned as a child growing up in Japan and through proper training; some of the techniques are quite basic, and some of them more intricate. Through it all, I feel as if I\u2019ve made so many friends who have taken the time to post comments and questions in the video section forum or even many of you who have offered your opinions; it\u2019s been the best way for us to communicate and to have so many really great discussions and yes even some really heated debates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo many of you have been the greatest of fans whom have traveled from the other side of the world just to enjoy something I\u2019ve created from my knife and cutting board, and honestly, I know I had the greater pleasure; just seeing your faces in person brings the greatest joy out from me, and although I have been brought up to be more quiet and reserve due to my culture, I can assure you that I am deeply touched and profoundly humbled by your presence.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlso as a chef, there\u2019s absolutely no greater flattery than when I\u2019m asked if you can work with me, so that you can gain additional experiences and apprentice next to me; I have turned all of you down due to our limited kitchen space, but I have searching for a better way for me to give you personal guidance and give you the knowledge you\u2019re looking for, whether you\u2019re a professional sushi chef, or a weekend chef that\u2019s always entertaining guests, which could be your greatest accomplishment. Whatever the reason, I have been so humbled, and so grateful for the outpouring of so many of you who have asked to work with me, so that I can share my experience and knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is the reason why I have joined Patreon, and this is why I\u2019d love for you to join me here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have decided to follow my dreams of creating a virtual reality sushi school, making in-depth sushi making and Japanese cooking videos full time here on Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn making this my full-time career, I am in need of a new kitchen studio where I can spend my time filming and making even better quality videos with no background or mechanical noise. The new studio will also incorporate a place where supporters to my Patreon channel can come visit and learn first hand with limited one-on-one training; also, I will eventually offer sushi making classes for those who have interest to attend. My ultimate goal however, is to be able to provide the highest level of sushi making instruction without you leaving the comfort of your home, no matter where you live in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently in a studio space but it is actually smaller than I would like, however, I am dreaming of the day where I am able to utilize a larger space and have students from all over come and learn the art of Japanese Cuisine, though the eyes of someone who has spent their entire life to this art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has been my virtual home for the last 5 plus years, and I simply can\u2019t express my gratitude for this platform for existing. I will continue with the current channel programing but let\u2019s be honest; YouTube has been more for me, entertainment and less about being educational. Yes, I\u2019ve shown many of my sushi making skills on YouTube and have even given many of my recipes out, however, there is so much more I wish to share with the ones who are really interested and looking to stand apart from their professional peers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs a professional, there are obvious reasons why I haven\u2019t divulged all of my knowledge, all of what I\u2019ve learned throughout my life on YouTube. Nobody would and nobody has, however, here at Patreon, I believe this to be the perfect scenario for those who are really interested in the next level of Japanese Cooking and Sushi Preparation and find value in what has taken me my entire life to master.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel pressured to support me here, however if you decide to, I will be forever indebted to you for allowing me one step closer of my dream becoming a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo all of you who have followed my journey and have been active on my YouTube channel, I am grateful for your time, passion, comments, but most important, for your personal visits; with Patreon, I can continue on a much higher degree in making better quality videos and offering better professional instruction, with perhaps the greatest benefit of them all: a place for you to stop by and enjoy something that I have personally created for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me here, and I look forward to seeing you in the very near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRespectfully,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHiroyuki Terada"
