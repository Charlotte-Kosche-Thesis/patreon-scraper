The intention of my art is to allow people to enter into a childlike state; regressing back to a simpler time when the only thing you had to worry about was making it to the bathroom in time or worrying about someone noticing your diaper through your pants ;) A big part of feeling childish imo is the feeling of bashfulness or embarrassment. So I tend to focus my art around that a lot. But I draw all sorts of things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy coming aboard this vessel, you\u0027ll have access to all my new artwork and comics long before they\u0027re released anywhere else. In addition, you\u0027ll be able to submit your own art requests, communicate with me directly,  and even watch me as I work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I plan to release new comic pages for my ongoing series as well as work on sketch requests and commissions, all while keeping you in the loop with work in progress updates and live streams. I\u0027m also trying Discord for the first time to allow people to chat and talk with me directly in real time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/de5b/f/2018/081/d/1/patreon_profile_03_discord_by_dyperdrive-dc6nzuz.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor certain tiers, I have exclusive Discord channels dedicated to work-in-progress images, live stream notifications, and even art critiques!

Depending on the amount of commissions and requests I work on, that number could go up or down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/7100/f/2018/081/7/6/patreon_profile_04_sketch_by_dyperdrive-dc6nzul.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSketch requests will work like this: At the start of each month, I\u2019ll post an official request thread. If you have the Engineer tier or above, you can leave a comment in that thread and request what you\u2019d like to see me draw. If you request more than one thing (you can request up to 3 per month), be sure to leave each request in a separate comment.\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the month I\u2019ll pick a handful to draw. My selections will be based on a combination of user likes, user comments, and my own personal preference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/ac30/f/2018/081/b/b/patreon_profile_05_sketches_by_dyperdrive-dc6nzug.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRequest sketches will feature 1 to 2 characters and will be regulated to black and white.
