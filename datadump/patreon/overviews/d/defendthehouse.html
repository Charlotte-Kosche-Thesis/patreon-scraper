    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the Defend The House Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey! My name is Joe, I run the Defend The House Youtube channel. DTH is best known for the Myth series that has been running since 2008 along with it\u0027s editing style and music. I want to make DTH the best produced and most unique gaming channel on Youtube and keep expanding on a library of videos which showcase the unseen and unknown of your favorite video games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created this Patreon page because I truly believe DTH can be something really special. I am super proud of what is created on DTH but these videos take a lot of time and adsense does not coincide well with channels that prioritise quality over quantity. One of the most important parts of DTH is the music, it\u0027s an essential part of our videos and what you guys have come to love. While finding the music is time consuming and difficult, it is always worth it. Unfortunately, the music we use leads to some problems. The Youtube copyright system is far from perfect and the lack of communication between artists and their record labels leads to continuous occasions of our videos not being monetized, even when we have full permission for the music used. The more successful this Patreon, the more freedom it starts to unlock in terms of music usage. Patreon might start off as way to cover the videos that are demonetized all the way up to allowing DTH to run completely ad-free and use a wide range of copyrighted tunes (by openly allowing the artists to take the adsense from our videos) to take the videos to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive Rewards!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a way of making this Patreon something great, we are offering a variation of exclusive content for our pledgers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e tier that grants you access to the EXCLUSIVE Defend The Podcast, a podcast run be me, Jamison and Ben!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the \u003cstrong\u003e$2\u003c/strong\u003e tier we have two DTH Spotify playlists, the main one sitting at 150 songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the \u003cstrong\u003e$5\u003c/strong\u003e tier we have an EXCLUSIVE show called \u0027Behind The Edit\u0027, which includes behind the scenes commentary on past videos including new, unheard information on how the video was brainstormed, filmed and edited.\u00a0Plus you get your name credited in all of our future main videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$10 \u003c/strong\u003epledges will have access to our early video/video drafts and a pimping GOLDEN name for being a top tier supporter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Money.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money from Patreon will go towards paying for music licensing or simply covering for the next inevitable video that gets it\u0027s demonetisation taken away. All Patreon donations also help me continue to do this full time. I work on DTH everyday and it\u0027s a massive time eater. Youtube Adsense is an unpredictable thing, your support won\u0027t only lead to an increase in quality but also security for me to keep making the videos on the channel at a consistent rate."
