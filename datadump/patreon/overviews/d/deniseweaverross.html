Then recently, I participated in an artist \ntrading card project where I was challenged to make a ten 2 x 3 inch \noriginal cards that then were sent to other artists and I received 10 in\n return. I usually work fairly large and as I was rummaging around my \nmind for something that would work at that size and the I-Ching idea \ncame to life as a scalable idea that could work very small or very \nlarge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are the trading cards\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"327\" src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/158b4b219841d782b1427c94c/images/f91db616-1d74-4bd6-8d46-0af9817637cd.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 327px; margin: 0px;\" width=\"600\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027ve begun a series of 12 x 12 inch works-on-paper that will allow me to explore each Hexagram in more depth.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFor $5 a month you\n will receive an monthly email with a digital image of each hexagram \nwith an explanation of the thought process behind the image.  \u003cem\u003eUnlimited Subscribers.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $10 a month you will receive a 4x4 inch original, signed, hand-drawn hexagram on archival quality paper. \u003cem\u003eLimited to 25 patrons.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $25 a month you\n will receive a 5x5 inch original, signed, and hand-drawn hexagram on \narchival quality paper with an original poem handwritten on the back. \u003cem\u003eLimited to 10 patrons.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $50 month you\n will receive a 8x8 inch original, signed, and hand-drawn on archival \nquality paper with an original poem handwritten on the back. \u003cem\u003eLimited to 10 patrons.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $75 month you will receive a 12x12 inch original, signed, and hand-drawn work-on-paper of each hexagram.\u003cem\u003eLimited to 5 patrons.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the first hexagram\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/hexagram-1-chien-5452082\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHexagram 1: Ch\u0027ien (The Creative Force)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\n first 12-12 inch hexagram on paper.
