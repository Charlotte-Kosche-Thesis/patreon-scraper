For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve been trying to \u003cem\u003etangify my imagination\u003c/em\u003e. From fleeting images to full fledged characters, the ideas in my mind yearn to be brought to life. Clay, jewelry, fabric, and paper are just a few of the mediums I often employ to create these objects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut my curiosity compels me to explore the characters and stories in my imagination through the creation of not only objects, but also images, writing, and performance. I struggled to find a way to merge the breadth of my interests into my work as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDream Up is the culmination of years and years of trying to define what it is I\u2019m trying to do. Simply: Capture an idea. Shape a thing. Share it with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis Patreon page serves as my blog and primary form of written communication with my online community. Open to everyone, it\u0027s where I share the stuff I think the majority of my followers would like to see. Tutorials, patterns, product reviews, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I share my deeper thoughts, messy behind the scenes work, and the sort of \u003cem\u003eget to know me\u003c/em\u003e type things that aren\u2019t really of interest to everyone, I make those posts private for my Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat is a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons are the people who financially contribute to my growth as a creator and professional \u003cem\u003edreamer upper\u003c/em\u003e. While I can usually cover the ongoing expenses of creating, there are times when I find myself unable to easily fund new experimental ideas. Patreon would provide me a consistent stream of income to help fund these new projects, and to share more of these projects than I\u0027d be able to on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreators everywhere are achieving financial independence through the support of people like you. You can help me by pledging as little as $1 per month, and you can change or cancel your pledge at any time without fees or restrictions. But please do not feel obligated if to contribute to this campaign. I\u2019ll always share lots of free stuff here, on my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dreamupart.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDream Up\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0and on my YouTube channel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/DreamUpArt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDream Up Art\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information on how Patreon works, check out their support page of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200359925-Patrons\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatron FAQs\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
