    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi there! I\u0027m Dominic \"\u003cem\u003eDomadness\u003c/em\u003e\" Keravel, and I am a full time creative streamer at www.twitch.tv/domadness. I am a 2D artist and ex mobile game developer. I have spent the majority of my life pursuing my dream of giving smiles to people with my art and music. I studied and practiced both for as long as I can remember. I have been a struggling, but passionate artist for the past 10 years of my adult life. I have had all kinds of unrelated jobs: janitor, cook, factory worker, etc. Always to bring just enough funds to allow me to spend my remaining time devoting my heart to my artistic projects. But luckily, I never, ever dared giving up! This year, 2016, is the first year of my life that I can finally say that I am a full time artist. After all of these sacrifices, this hard work, this incredibly difficult adventure, I have finally achieved my dream. I am giving smiles to people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy live streaming show on Twitch.tv\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy freelancing success had slowly started when I reached out to twitch.tv big streamers to make their arts, emoticons, and animations for their channel. (All thanks to my background as an indie game developer.) My art for streamers quickly became a word to mouth subject and I was able, in October 2015, to quit my job at the factory, and pursue a freelancing career. But it did not end there. I decided to use this opportunity to create a live show of art variety on the creative section of twitch.tv!\u003cbr\u003eI am streaming my art as a full time job. I have a LOT of big plans for the future with this show. I want to create advanced illustrations, sell prints, make animation projects, and even go back to my music composing roots one day per week, to add my own songs to the stream\u0027s music playlist. For now, I create art for clients, and simply for entertainment. As a result, I have created the kindest and most awesome community on twitch! This is my family now. And I hope you become a part of it. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI call my freelancing a \"success\" because if I keep the hard work going, I can pay my rent and build up my show towards a better future, slowly. This is why any amount of help will drastically help me survive through the journey of improving my show, and eventually reaching the twitch partnership with my show. A streamer\u0027s income, well it does come from the viewers themselves after all. ;) And since I am not yet a twitch \"partnered streamer\" (I don\u0027t have a subscriber button yet), I think that having this Patreon page can help me have a stronger and more intimate relationship with my supporters. I intend on giving back to my patrons and staying very close to them. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
