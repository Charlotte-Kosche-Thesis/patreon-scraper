    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eDeviant Witchery\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is devoted to creating fun, exciting, fresh, useful and powerful content for the Witching community. We have always been about fluid communication and talking about subjects that many do not wish to talk about or are scared to talk about for fear of being judged by their peers. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Deviant Witches\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0simply do not care about being judged, we seek to bridge the gap between such heated topics in order to empower the Witch. If we are too scared to talk about something or we keep fearing that other practitioners will shun us for our beliefs then we keep ourselves in a state of fear, in a state of disempowerment and that is something we seek to eradicate. That is one of our main goals here, to speak up and make sure that every Witch knows that it is okay to talk about these supposed \u0027Dark\u0027 topics. We are very rooted in our beliefs, strong in our craft so we are comfortable in discussing these topics and bringing them to you when nobody else will. Our hearts (yes we have them) are so involved with our mission here, we seek to express our personal experiences, our joined knowledge base to provide you with as much content as we possibly can. This is done in hopes that you will be able to take this information and make it yours, you will become stronger, better, more potent and more confident in your craft. We seek to bring Witches back to their Origins and to awaken in you what we know is truly there. Our mission has always been and will always be to inspire, to create, to stimulate the Witchy mind and to not take power but to bless others with knowledge to create power for themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe invest a lot into creating the videos that we release. We take a huge chunk of our time to produce these. We all have families and other responsibilities that we have to put on hold for the time that we do create videos for you. There is a lot more that goes on behind the scenes that not everyone gets to witness. We are in constant contact with each other, talking about what we need to discuss next, what future projects for Deviant Witchery we may have. You see we aren\u0027t simply a YouTube channel, we also run a Page and a Group of the same name. This is our passion, we seek to give more of ourselves to you because we seek for Witches to stand in their own power, to have the support that we all need, to have more, to be MORE, to find the confidence that comes with true experience, that comes with true understanding and this is what we seek to produce, to give to you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith \u003cstrong\u003eyour support, \u003c/strong\u003eDeviant Witchery will be able to purchase a more professional and upgraded website. We plan on using the funds generated here to maintain the website as well as pay for monthly and yearly fees.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are in the process of working together to create some pretty potent Products for Deviant Witchery which requires inventory and it requires specific items that are at times hard to come by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also seek to create a more professional (yet, still fun and laid back) atmosphere for you which requires us to have better equipment, Webcams, Microphones, Lighting, Headphones, etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also seek to produce more written material, books, blog posts, oracle decks, spell cards, Witchcraft affirmation cards and so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI (Michael) just purchased a new computer which doesn\u0027t have Photoshop on it so I also need to acquire photoshop again which I used a lot to create graphics for the page, the group, and the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA part of our mission is to keep up on our craft, to learn as much as we can and to bring to you what it is we learn and what we experience. Taking advanced training, investing into our education with Herbal Training, Naturopathy, Essential Oils, Healing, and other areas which will enhance our work which in turn will enhance the work we produce for you is a HUGE priority for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother \u003cstrong\u003eHUGE \u003c/strong\u003edream of ours is to purchase land and create a Witchy homestead. We seek to create a place where other Witches can come to, to celebrate the Sabbats, to train with us and a place we can hold retreats. We also seek to have a legit brick \u0026amp; mortar store.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo again with your Support we will invest into creating even more content for you, we will have the ability to purchase herbs, crystals, rare books, bottles, beads, packaging materials, training courses, we will be able to hire professional editors and formatters for the books we seek to create for you and so much more! We will keep you constantly updated on what we are doing and how your support is being spread!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appreciate you! \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
