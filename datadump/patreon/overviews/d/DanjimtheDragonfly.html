    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e*squeak*\u003c/strong\u003e Hi there, patron! Welcome to my buggy Patreon-page~\u003cbr\u003eSo my real name is Christian, but you can call me by the name of my dragonfly-fursona, which is Danjim. He can both be a tiny feral or a big anthro dragonfly, depending on your preferences ;-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI claim myself as a passionate and hardworking comic artist with a drawing technique that is mostly selftaught. I use Paint Tool SAI and Photoshop as my drawing programs and I do livestream every Thursday and Saturday from 10 pm to 2 am CET.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you are new to be knowing my comics, they are both based on story-driven as well as for being kink-driven drawings, with mostly foot fetishism and macrophilia as the main featured kinks, while there exists many others for only a few scenes done for my comics. So that is for the very warnings of me giving to you, hehe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI upload all of my stuff on FurAffinity and DeviantArt:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/flybynightsky/\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/flybynightsky/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://danjimthedragonfly.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttps://danjimthedragonfly.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is by no surprise that I draw Danjim through many of my comics, which I\u0027m anticipated to be showing you through my gallery and scraps. Although one of my comics are also showing an interest of other people\u0027s fursonas to be taken part of this comic project, which is what I believe catches most people\u0027s eyes on if they stumble on my comic-works. Other than that, I am greatly thankful for you to come and have a visit on my Patreon-page \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what brought me to open up a Patreon-page? Honestly, as a hardworking comic artist that doesn\u0027t accept commissions seems to be the sole purpose of why I decided to open up one. I know that I do my stuff with a certain amount of passion and that I have my appreciation every single feedback I get from my fellow supporters, watchers and friends that I have gained from it. But I have done this matter without thinking about a financial contribution from you guys for about 3 years. So with that said, I will be allowing these certain people that are willing to be my Patreon-supporters to be getting something extraordinary besides being there to give me feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy gratitude won\u0027t get any higher if you think my work is deserving some funding. That counts for both small and high. I will make sure to improve myself over time, helping myself out through my own way of living, and let alone remind you that I would list you as a Patreon-supporter through my livestreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks a lot for reading. If you enjoyed what you\u0027ve read, then please don\u0027t hesitate supporting me. That both counts for non-funding and funding-wise. Love and peace!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
