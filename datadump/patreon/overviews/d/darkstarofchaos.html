    "summary": "Greetings, friends. I am a writer of fanfiction. But I\u0027m not here to make money off of that; I\u0027m here to request support \u00a0for a blog.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA little background: I\u0027m single, living in an apartment with two roommates, and making minimum wage working part time. Thanks to a combination of luck and a willingness to cover shifts for others, I can pay my share of the bills, but it\u0027s a very close thing that leaves me no money for savings. Additionally, living with roommates who are considerably older and share none of my interests - or even similar lifestyles - is an unenjoyable arrangement.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy long-term goal is to make enough money to be able to live on my own. For this purpose, I\u0027ve created a weekly blog about writing. It\u0027s more advice column than how-to guide, but I hope it will be helpful to aspiring writers, editors, and anyone else who regularly works with words. If you\u0027re not a wordsmith but you still want to help out, that\u0027s fine too. I\u0027m grateful to all who can spare even a few dollars. And if you become a patron you could gain access to behind the scenes stuff like bios of characters I\u0027ve created for my stories, which you can study as examples for creating your own characters. You might also be able to vote on what topics I talk about on the blog: just remember that I write a few weeks in advance, so the winning topic may take a while to appear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to reiterate, I am NOT out to make money on my fanworks. If you\u0027ve read my stories and want to become a patron for that reason, you\u0027ll have my amazement and gratitude, but donations are dependent on blog updates. The blog itself updates every Wednesday, and you don\u0027t have to donate to read it. I will also have a post at the start of each month to answer questions; as a patron, you\u0027ll gain access to a stream where I\u0027ll answer questions within a few days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all for now. Thanks for taking the time to read, and I hope\u00a0to see you around!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
