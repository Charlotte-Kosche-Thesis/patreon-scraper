FoS is a science fiction novel set in a world beyond \ndeath and it\u2019s inspired by the science fiction masterpieces of the \ngolden years of the genre. It is an original book, in that it is raw and\n uncensored, but at the same time profound in its philosophical \nreflections and in the issues it tackles. I have tried to create a work \nthat is both atmospheric and profound, exploring in depth the human and \npsychological facets of the various characters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is FoS not?\u003c/h3\u003e\nFoS is not a visual novel for children, nor a commercial story aimed \nat teens. Neither is it a shallow work made up purely of dialogues: \nindeed, as well as fast-moving parts, with plenty of action, it contains\n slower, more descriptive passages, intended to be thought provoking. \nFoS contains some violence and nudity because, although the genre is \nscience fiction, the aim is to present the situations realistically, but\n it is not a pornographic work, and these aspects are not central to the\n plot.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhere is it set?\u003c/h3\u003e\nFoS is set in a world after death that is neither heaven nor hell. It\n is an insidious and mysterious place, in which a menacing artificial \nconstruction (complex), with no known purpose, extends over thousands of\n square miles. The novel\u2019s various characters move though this dark \nworld of metallic machinery, where humanity is regenerated, striving to \nunderstand the meaning of this new world and their part in it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAnd the illustrations?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI have opted for illustrations with a high level of detail, produced \nin an original style that differs from that of classic Japanese visual \nnovels. It takes a long time to produce the illustrations, and your support \nthrough Patreon is crucial if we are to go on producing quality \nmaterial. In addition, supporters will have access to uncensored \nversions of some of the illustrations.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is the current project status?\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe novel in the original language (Italian) is complete. We are now \nin the process of translating it into English and creating the \nillustrations and the sprites for the visual novel. As soon as each step\n is complete, we will release a new version of the visual novel. The \nversion currently online contains the Prologue and Chapter 1. Your \nfeedback is very much appreciated to improve the quality of the work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.factoryofsouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ch_1_regeneration_cens.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.factoryofsouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ch_1_regeneration_cens.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eTHE PROJECT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe Factory of Souls is a creation that is developing and growing all the time. Its life depends on you!\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe Factory of Souls\u003c/em\u003e is an ambitious project whose future \ndepends on the funds raised on Patreon. For now, I have no intention of \nmounting a kickstarter campaign. The levels reached by the project will \ndepend on the number of followers it attracts on Patreon and thus the \namount of funds raised.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eLevel 1 (requiring a total of 500 dollars a month):\u003c/h4\u003e\nChapters of the visual novel will be released regularly through to \nthe end of the novel. For the moment, this means one new chapter every \n2 weeks, but  I plan to increase this rate in the future. I would also\n like to publish short sci-fi stories every so often.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eLevel 2 (800 dollars a month):\u003c/h4\u003e\nMore illustrations, \n\u003cstrong\u003egreater detail and more  character animations\u003c/strong\u003e. I \ndon\u2019t like visual novels that continue to recycle the same backgrounds \nand would like to see more variety. However, it takes a long time to \nproduce illustrations and sprite animations. With this level of support,\n I will be able to provide better and better illustrations.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eLevel 3 (1200 dollars a month):\u003c/h4\u003e\nAt this level, I will also be able to start creating a \n\u003cstrong\u003esecond visual novel\u003c/strong\u003e using material from another of my novels, or maybe I will write something completely new!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eLevel 4 (2000 dollars a month):\u003c/h4\u003e\nThis level of support would allow me to devote myself full time to \nThe Factory of Souls and the second visual novel, and also to produce \nnew stories (or comic strips). I also  have other works in the pipeline \nand I would love to be able to move on to those, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.factoryofsouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/factory-of-souls-book-cover.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003ch2\u003eDeepspark Team\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003eGabriel\u003c/h3\u003e\nI am an IT engineer with a passion for writing and art.
