Here you can see me create things from drawings to other things like simple games in the formats of VN\u0027s (aka Visual Novels) and RPG maker games. With the later being a lot less frequent than the first. Even if I wouldn\u0027t want to put myself as someone who creates things in certain themes or even genres, so can I not deny that sexual content such as vore and various butt stuff themed things will most likely appear here. So I guess you could take that as a warning before you look through this little part on Patreon any further? Either way, besides those types of things so do I also create random drawings and also, sometimes, random short nonesexual games. So that\u0027s that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like supporting me, then you are very welcome to do so. No matter how much you decide to support me with.
