    "summary": "My name is Adam and I\u2019m the person behind the IG account @dungeons_dragons_club. \u00a0I\u0027ve been asked by several people in the IG community to create podcasts of my gaming experiences, thoughts, and ideas. I love gaming, talking about the hobby, and sharing exciting stories with fellow gamers. Thus, this page is my effort to get things rolling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd...I can\u0027t wait to get started! I already have almost a dozen interviews lined up with prominent gaming voices from the IG community. Additionally, I\u0027m excited to share my gaming groups exploits highlighting our adventures in the D\u0026amp;D and Star Wars gaming universes. Finally, I plan on dedicating time to \"DM corner\", discussing techniques, strategies, and approaches for players to become the best DM possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to produce my first podcast by the end of June. The time from now until then will be spent gathering equipment, organizing interviews, and raising the funds necessary for production. I need to raise roughly $500 to get started (audio equipment is not free). Your pledges will go toward purchasing the necessary equipment and compensating me for my time. Each 30 min podcast will take about 4-5 hours to produce.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to working with you and providing a new, entertaining, and informative voice for the RPG community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support and I\u0027ll see you at the table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdam the DM\u003cbr\u003e"
