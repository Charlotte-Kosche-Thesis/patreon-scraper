I have been extremely happy with how the fan-made \"Legacy YoGPoDs\" have turned out and I\u0027m happy to say that I still enjoy making them and watching them back each time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds used from your Patreon donations will be put towards newer technology, equipment and software. You may be surprised to hear that my current PC is around 5-6 years old and running Windows Vista, which does limit what I can do and what software I can use at this time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect to receive your patronage, but any support you do decide to pledge will be deeply appreciate and will be used to improve the quality and consistency of the content for the future. Thank you!"

I\u0027ve been seeing the occasional comment about receiving possible donations for the fan-made Legacy YoGPoDs I\u0027ve been producing. While I do not really expect to make any money from these series I produce, I would still be very grateful for any support avid fans might like to donate to me. Any money received will be put towards my wishlist of a better PC and other technology/software to make editing and producing future content easier and faster in the future.
