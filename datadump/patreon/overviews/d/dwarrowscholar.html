    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Roy, also known as The Dwarrow Scholar, a huge fan of\nTolkien\u0027s Dwarves, as you might have noticed :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBringing the world of the Dwarves to life\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor over twenty years I have been studying the dwarves of\nGermanic myth and the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. When I first started to publish\nsome of my finding and thoughts on the topic in 2008 I was overjoyed at the\npositive responses and requests for more content. Requests I have eagerly\nattempted to satisfy. Since 2012 my content has been downloaded via \u003ca href=\"https://dwarrowscholar.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e and\nvarious content channels by over a half a million people from all over the\nworld. Through the content I make available I talk about their culture, their\nlanguage, and attempt to answer the questions many of us have, based on years\nof study. On my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DurinsFolk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e\nI share my video productions and content links. It is an amazing opportunity to\nreach out and talk about the dwarves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTaking it to the next level\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nApart from the occasional donation I receive, I have been\npaying for all costs to create new content out of my own pocket. I have a\nmodest income, which sadly is not enough to take my work to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHelp me expand my content!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight now, there is a huge audience on Youtube that wants to see more dwarf content. Luckily, I have some experience with video content\ncreation (mainly in the field of animation), and I have a lot of ideas for\nvideo productions and interactive language classes. Yet this kind of content is very\ntime-intensive and costly if you want to do it right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is a great demand for interactive Neo-Khuzdul lessons and various video content related to the dwarves of J.R.R. Tolkien.\u00a0That\u0027s why I need your help. With your support as a Patron,\nyou can help me expand my content beyond the world of online video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eInteractive Neo-Khuzdul lessons\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne of the projects I am working on this year is a brand new\nseries of lessons that allow the student to learn at their own pace, take tests\nwhen they feel ready and actually become a real \"speaker\" of\nDwarvish. This project is a massive\nproject for me however, with many aspects of it not just requiring my time but also\nfunding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe costs of this ambitious project are roughly $6,000.\nWhich means I need to raise at least $500 per month. If you join me, you can\nhelp to make this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy should you become my patron?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your support, I can realize this project and many other\ndwarf related projects. And of course, I want to give my Patrons loads in return! For instance, you will be able to get early access to the content I release. In addition to the fact that I will be frequently surprising you with extras to show you my gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eIF YOU SIGN UP FOR $10/MONTH OR MORE, YOU WILL GET EARLY ACCESS\nTO OUR NEW INTERACTIVE LEARNING PLATFORM + A PRIVATE 1-HOUR-LONG Q\u0026amp;A SESSION +\nEXCLUSIVE EXTRAS FOR FREE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTop level Patrons will even get an exclusive copy of The latest Dwarrow Scholar Dictionary in book form sent to their door via mail!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut the most important reason to join me as a patron, is\nthat you can help me continue what I love to do and sharing ever better content\nwith you and many others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope you will join me. And together we can crush those\npesky elves... uhm, I mean we can fight as proud dwarves side by side as I\nteach you all you ever wanted to know about dwarrow kind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Dwarrow Scholar - Roy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003ePlease note\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e: While some rewards will be delivered every single month - once payment has completed, others may only happen every couple of months or twice a year. I have tried to specify where possible, but feel free to contact me with any questions. I have listed an array of different rewards to show the full scope of what I\u0027m planning, and I\u0027ll keep adjusting this over time based on the feedback I get from you all.

Some years on, when he got his very own walk-man (aye forget\n about tiny ipods, this thing was a brick and played cassette tapes) he \nmade his own little audiotape of The Hobbit, so he could listen to it  \non his bike on his way to school.  Between reenacting the Battle of Five\n armies with 4 of his school friends (still feel sorry for the kid that \nhad to be the Orc) and before the days of internet, you would find Roy \nfrequently in libraries trying to find all he could about Tolkien and \nhis beloved dwarves. When Roy isn\u2019t delving into neo-khuzdul or \nsearching for lost dwarven treasures on the net he\u2019s enjoying time with \nhis wife and son, re-reading his tormented Tolkien paperbacks, watching a\n good movie or playing a game of Lotro on Laurelin as Kandral \nStrongbeard.\u003c/em\u003e",
