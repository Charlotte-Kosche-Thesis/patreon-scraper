    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis lifetime for me is a personal mission to reclaim creativity, authentic self-expression and BLISS from the sticky clutches of the Global Corporate Troll State.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe in Beauty. I believe that Artists are going to save the world. I believe we are in the infancy of a new Renaissance period and that those of us \"in the know\" chose to be alive on Earth at this time to follow our bliss, live free, and turn on a love light the Matrix-slaves can follow to freedom.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI see Patreon as a really cool experiment. It\u0027s an open source creativity incubator. It\u0027s crowd-funding the Pleasure Revolution. Yes, I said the \"P\" word. Let\u0027s reclaim Pleasure - healthy fucking pleasure, man - as one of the cardinal virtues of the world. To quote the great Buckminster Fuller:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u201cWe should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nPatreon is an opportunity for us to say, \"we don\u0027t need your government pennies anyway, sexless government drones.\" It\u0027s a platform where I can share my new ideas and inspirations with people who really love who I am, what I do, and what I stand for. And where I can interact with you directly without all of the extraneous psychic noise of Facebook or other social media platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really value your patronage at any level. Even if you can only pledge $1/month, the fact that you\u0027re choosing to support my work means so much to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, whatever your level of support you\u0027ll get my patrons-only posts, high quality MP3s of whatever music I\u0027m creating, and you can hang out with us every other week on live video chat and rock the revolution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a self-employed creator, so more patronage = more time-freedom and resources to write, sing, and just generally create more.\u00a0If you really believe in what I\u0027m doing and you can afford to be a patron at a higher dollar amount, you\u0027ll definitely get cool extra bonus stuff. (Want to sponsor the podcast? Free astrology check-in? Email me and we\u0027ll figure it out together.)\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
