    "summary": "Greetings! I am Viarch, and I am creating 3d adult content using RenPy and Daz Studio. I always wanted to produce games, so I started Viarch Production, (which consists of me, also me, little bit of me, and some more me. Plus another guy, helping me with translations).\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the place where you can check on the animations and games I created or in process of creating.\u003cbr\u003eEnglish isn\u0027t my mother tongue, so there will be mistakes. Probably even silly mistakes, but I hope that my patrons will be kind enough to overlook them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy you should support me?\u003cbr\u003eBecause I am nice guy and deserve it? No, not working? Damn...\u003cbr\u003eAlright, because with your support I will be able to get better equipment, spare more time for game developing, resulting with updates being more often, with more content and improved graphic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t use charge upfront feature, so pledges are processed on the beginning of each month, I am sending links and passwords for latest releases to patrons with processed pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now we work on project called \"Rise of the Porn Star\" - story of the girl that you can lead to very top of the adult industry. It is sandbox simulator with visual novel elements. You decide her every step, and she is basically yours for shaping - but be careful, if you\u0027ll keep failing her expectations, or would be unable to entertain her, she might leave you! There is plenty of locations and occupations for your actress - advancing toward main goal, earning some money along the road or provide some fun for her... and more importantly, for you, dear player! Sexy time all around!\u003cbr\u003eWe keep adding new content -events, characters, animations - monthly. So, if you care about future of a poor girl trying to find her place in this cruel-cruel world - follow and support us, maybe?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003edownload link for public release \"Rise of the Pornstar\" v 1.06 :\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePC:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!MMZxDK6J!0rpS_tsSKrxD51XeHaKizo6icdJrTnIJeqsRkqaLVTw\"\u003emega\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMacOS: \u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!tZohmQiD!UHRRiRFBcmTyhVkbFsRyzwzcjO0cL80_UB6UWwtOy9U\"\u003emega\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReversion of Witchery ( on hold )\u003c/strong\u003e-\u00a0fantasy story about girl who came to her sences in the forest without any idea where she is, why she is there and even who she is. Soon she\u0027ll find out about many powerful enemies and only one old mage will try to help her.\u003cbr\u003e For now I\u0027m planning to develop it just as VN, without much interactions.  If it turns out that this story is really interesting for many people, I will move to my main goal - create interactive story with really big difference in outcome, main character can become evil as demon or almost angel or maybe just like normal person. This plan require a lot of work to create many independent branches of story.\u003cbr\u003eThere is also third stage of development, wich I have on my mind : ) like implementing of serious systems of battle, crafting and enchanting and so on... :))) almost impossible for one man.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!IVoz0A4b!PFBSWFwvwHHhndMgprCuoL_MXRfVUdYSCacqTHOWaoo\"\u003emega\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u00a0- Thank you for all your support.\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
