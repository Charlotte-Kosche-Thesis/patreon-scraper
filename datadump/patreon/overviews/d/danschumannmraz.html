    "summary": "Hey y\u0027all, most of you probably came from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dan.schumannmraz\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e but in case you didn\u0027t, there\u0027s a link to see my work in more of a streamlined fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI--I\u0027m Dan. I\u0027m kind of hurt, honestly, like I said most of you came from Instagram. How do you not know that? The guy that takes the pictures you like. You know, the ones with lines \u0026amp; light or whatever\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh, cool! If we didn\u0027t know you, what would your artist statement be?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOh no. Well, to be honest, I\u0027ve thought it over a little bit but I\u0027ve yet to put anything to paper. Looking over what I\u0027ve done, I think I\u0027ve always been attracted to the various shapes around in life. I\u0027ve worn glasses since I was rather young, and I think that having your sight taken away from you is something that does a very good job at keying you in to it\u0027s importance in, well, almost everything you do. That fascination with sight and perspective was something that was always kind of around for me, but photography has given me the opportunity to take the things I see and share them with others. I also enjoy messing with that perspective in natural ways (apart from occasionally flipping a picture upside down or on it\u0027s side). I like to see what can be accomplished just using the normal world, from shifting your own perspective. It\u0027s a little wordy, but it\u0027s gonna do for now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat kind of heartfelt plea can you give us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn okay one. I haven\u0027t been at photography as long as many people, but I think that I have a certain aptitude for it that I\u0027ve never really experienced with other things. Taking pictures calms me, I can walk around town with headphones and be content simply in the act of taking them, I\u0027m also very happy to be able to share them with others. One of my favorite things is sharing stuff with new people, I don\u0027t see the point in hiding your work away, to me it would feel kind of like hiding away something very important. Not a soul, because those don\u0027t exist (but if you think they do I hope you\u0027ll still donate, I like it when y\u0027all look at my pictures too) but a heart, or something that\u0027s real important to your body. Instagram has opened some of those doors, but I\u0027d like to be able to get stuff in front of as many people as I can, and this is how you can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for even reading this, if you did, and even if you didn\u0027t I understand and know I\u0027m better with pictures than words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDan"
