    "summary": "Hey all! Thank you for stopping by my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Das Boot and I\u0027ve been working hard to bring you, the Skyrim SE Community, some GREAT mods for the XBOX One.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know there\u0027s a lot of you out there who have downloaded my work and love what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have the funds to spare, making a pledge would really go a long way in allowing me to continue bringing you awesome content. I know you all work hard for your money and I will promise you that the funds will be put to good use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI figured I would start this Patreon as a way to recoup some of the costs associated with modding, such as multiple copies of the games, program subscription fees (ie. Photoshop, 3DS Studio Max), time spent in front of a computer, blood, sweat, and tears + snacks (ie. Red Bull for those long nights spent modding), etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with my current stretch goal, I\u0027ll be able to buy Fallout 4 and start releasing mods for that game as well. Up to this point, I\u0027ve been working with Skyrim SE exclusively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith these pledges I can promise you three things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) I know the difference between a mesh and a texture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) You can always count on fresh content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) I will always do my best to release quality mods to ensure that you are using your limited mod space well. Any and all bugs reported will be fixed to the best of my ability. I will not re-release a broken mod.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will of course re-upload certain \"hits\" from time to time so more people can enjoy them, but I will not continuously release the same mods every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTerms: I spend my free time working on all sorts of mods. I create my own mods, I add my own twists to some mods, and I also port mods from popular modding websites. If you have something you would like me to work on for you, please send me a link on Discord and I will check it out. It MUST have OPEN PERMS or the Original Mod Author must give you or I permission to port it. I WILL NOT port over mods that have been stolen from other MA\u0027s unless permission is given or the resources are free to use. If permission is not granted, I can try my best to create a similar mod for you, depending on said mod.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Das Boot\u003cbr\u003e"
