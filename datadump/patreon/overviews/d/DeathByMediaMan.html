I\u0027m the chief content creator for the Death By Media Man Podcast Show Thing, and I\u0027m here today because I\u0027d like some of your money, please, oh thank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically? You know how this works. I\u0027m a creative-type who likes telling stories and making little shows to entertain people. And the more time \u0026amp; resources I have to make stuff, the more stuff I can make. So. If you would like help fund me, then eventually, I can make enough money to quit my job, and just be entertaining for you, full-time. And I\u0027d really like that. I\u0027d like to just stay home and write and record and produce little stories and shows for you, the whole livelong day. And I\u0027d do such a good job! I\u0027d amaze you. You\u0027d cry a little, but you\u0027d leave feeling ultimately uplifted, like you\u0027d really experienced a moment of true humanity, and felt a connection with a really special person. And hey, that person could be me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. Please. By all means. Join up today. Your money will go towards improving my life, my self-esteem, and the work that I produce. There\u0027s really no downside, unless you needed that dollar to feed your starving children in which case, jeepers, I mean, jeeze, y\u0027know, thank you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReally, you\u0027re the best, and I literally couldn\u0027t do this without the help of the people who enjoy my work. So thank you, as sincearely as I can muster with this emotional impediment I possess which causes all my statements to sound sarcastic. I\u0027m \u003cem\u003esooooo\u003c/em\u003e happy you decided to help me out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, but really. Thank you."
