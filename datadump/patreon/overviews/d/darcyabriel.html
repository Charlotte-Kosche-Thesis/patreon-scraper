I hope not for long, and I would be pleased to have you join me as I continue on my journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI particularly enjoy writing in the genres of futuristic, fantasy, and the paranormal. I\u2019ve worked with several publishers, including Amber Quill Press which published my Pandemonia series, and Samhain Publishing, which published my Humanotica series.

     "about": "Being a Cancer, Darcy Abriel always has been fond of deep, dark places.\nShe\u2019s enjoyed ghost stories and things that go bump in the night since she\ncould first read. When she was in high school she and her rock band boyfriend\nand his buddies from the band once spent a weekend in her basement with the\nOuija Board contacting a revolutionary war ghost. She\u2019s loved monster movies\nfrom an early age. She\u2019s used to odd looks from people. Facing demons, inner\nand outer, is one of the things Darcy enjoys most when it comes to writing\nstories. She calls her office \u201c the cave\u201d and doesn\u2019t always play well with\nothers.But she tries.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDarcy loves digging in and\ncreating worlds wicked and characters dangerous. Dark fantasy and dark erotica,\nbreaking boundaries in genre and gender, blending angels and castrati, demons\nand gods, humans and succubi. You think you know who the hero is, but do you\nreally? Whether it\u2019s a succubus in \u201cDeadeye,\u201d the Viadine and Diadune in \u201cNightingale,\u201d\na contemporary troubled hero in \u201cCruel Memories,\u201d or a steampunk dystopian\nintersexed world like Quentopolis, there\u2019s nothing simple about these stories\nor the characters. How the heck do you mix gods and cowboys, pirates and\nzombies, and a whole range of other odd pairings. As far as Darcy\u2019s concerned,\nthe darker the better, the more complex, the more fun. Redemption takes many\nforms for Darcy\u2019s characters. Take an idea, twist it, mold it, break it apart,\nand drive that stake even deeper into the quagmire. Spank it, whip it, stroke\nit, tease it, soothe it, romance it to death.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou say it can\u2019t be done?\nHere that naughty chuckle? That\u2019s Darcy saying, \u201cmaybe...maybe not. Let me\nthink about that for a minute. Muse mine, what do you think? Can we make it\nwork?\u201d Oh, yeah, let\u2019s play. Where\u2019s my stash of strawberry Twizzlers and the\npeacock blue ink for my fountain pen, the notebooks, the tarot cards? Let\u2019s do\nthis.\u003cbr\u003e",
