    "summary": "Who are we: Dallas Games is a Long standing board game group in the DFW area. We have been meeting weekly since the 1990\u0027s. We currently meet every Thursday from 6pm to late as well as a monthly mini-con starting on the 3rd Friday of every month at the Dallas Games Marathon event center.  \u003ca href=\"http://dallasgamesmarathon.com/\"\u003ehttp://dallasgamesmarathon.com/\u003c/a\u003e .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur history: A young board gamer moved to Dallas in 1997. He knew no one in the area and so started perusing on-line message boards and found two separate groups that were advertising for players.  There was a Tuesday evening group that met at Border\u0027s book store and another group that met on weekends at member\u0027s houses about once a month. \u003cbr\u003eHaving access to a web server and development tools he put together a small web site DallasGames.com and a mailing list and started promoting both the weekly Tuesday meet up and for longer games at people\u0027s houses.  The mailing list grew in size until there were gaming days being set up every weekend. \u003cbr\u003eIn 2008 an idea was put out asking how much interest there would be in a weekend of board gaming where the doors never closed and folks could game from Friday through Sunday straight through.  A lot of people said they\u0027d pay to come to an event like that and this board gamer\u0027s company happened to have 1000 square feet of unused space in his office building available and empty on the weekends.  A few other folks showed interest in helping organize such an event and so the Dallas Games Marathon was born.\u003cbr\u003eDGM has moved twice and is now located in Plano, TX with our own 4,200 square feet of gaming space. We also have almost 1,700 games in our library (\u003ca href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/DGM%20Library?own=1\"\u003eOur collection\u003c/a\u003e) available for anyone to play.\u003cbr\u003e"
