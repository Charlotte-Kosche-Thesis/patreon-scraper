This is Kimberly, and this is Katie.\u00a0 And we\u0027re A Date with Dateline, a snappy podcast recapping episodes of NBC\u0027s not at all overly dramatic series about murder, Dateline. \u003cbr\u003eWe love doing the podcast. In fact, it\u0027s pretty much all we want to do. But we have these stupid things called jobs, bills, obligations, and life that sometimes get in the way. We\u0027re just like a lot of you, barely getting by every month with the jobs that actually pay and trying create an exciting weekly episode at the same time. It also costs money to produce a podcast. Who knew? There\u0027s equipment, software, something called bandwidth, and TIME. Lots of time. Katie does all of our editing and while she does an AMAZING job, that\u0027s more time and more hair loss.\u003cbr\u003eSome of you have been so generous and already given us some money through paypal, and that\u0027s been INCREDIBLE. But regular income on a monthly basis would take this podcast to the next level! Think about it in terms of murder. We\u0027re at the level of JOKINGLY asking a hitman that we don\u0027t realize is an undercover cop to MAYBE CONSIDER a very well deserved breaking of a\u00a0 kneecap for us for a 2 for 1 coupon at Chilis. But the level we want to be at is full on ordering a hit for $2,500- $200,000 depending of course on the state.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOur podcast is picking up speed and we want you to be part of the diabolical journey. We know you want more content, and faster. We\u0027re talking bonus episodes each month, q \u0026amp; a episodes, our Secrets Series (episodes with Secret in the title), our best of bloopers, and hopefully a professional editor that can help us release our regular episodes on time every week! Sound good? Of course it does. The more money we\u0027re able to raise, the more we can focus solely on the show, the more creative content we can bring to you.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re going to keep doing the show regardless, because we love it.\u00a0 But we really want to do it better and do more of it, for you guys, our amazing flisteners (listeners + friends= flisteners, the more you know). We hope you\u0027ll join Team ADWD! We just came up with that right now. \u003cbr\u003eXOXO, Kimberly and Katie\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
