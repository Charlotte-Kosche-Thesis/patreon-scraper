    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to the Dumpster Pizza Press Patreon campaign.\u00a0Dumpster Pizza Press is the independent publisher of original comix, prints, and other artwork by Craig E. Ross. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCraig E.

Currently living in St. Louis, Missouri, Ross works mainly in traditional woodblock printmaking as well as various digital mediums. Ross is the co-owner and co-curator of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dollararthouse.com/\"\u003eDollar Art House\u003c/a\u003e in St. Louis as well as a member of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.novemberart.org/\"\u003eNovember Network of Anti-Capitalist Studio Artists\u003c/a\u003e.

Ross. This publication features original absurd comix as well as abstract illustrations and drawings. With this project I wanted to really loosen up and let my creativity flow on to the bristol pages without the restricting inhibitions of the ego or super ego. I wasn\u0027t concerned if my drawings looked \"good\" and I wasn\u0027t concerned if my comix \"made sense\". My main concern with this project was that it was fun and therapeutic to create. As a working class and mentally ill artist, material life can be extremely restricting but while creating art I can briefly escape. I encourage the viewer to escape with me, if only for a moment, into the vast and liberating realm of unconscious creation. The first volume of Dumpster Pizza Party\u00a0will be available for purchase in digital and comic book form late Spring 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Communal Order of the Ouroboros\u003c/strong\u003e is a project that exists as a multi-facetted art experience in the forms of music, performance, prints, and art installations. The Communal Order of the Ouroboros (COO) is a highly esoteric yet self-proclaimed open coven for all Communist witches, warlocks, and other magical and/or mystical Marxists. The fragmented story of the COO will be told in comic book form. This comic is the magical diary or \"Communist Grimoire\" told through the first person perspectives of various communist witches throughout the history of Southern Illinois who start a coven dedicated to using any magical means necessary to overthrow the dictatorship of capital. The COO is written by St. Guillotine and illuminated by Craig E. Ross. This project will be available for purchase in digital and comic book form in Summer, 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Red Mass\u003c/strong\u003e is a collection of poetry, spells, rituals, and rambling from St. Guillotine and The Communal Order of the Ouroboros. Originally printed as a zine, this publication is the visual congealment of St. Guillotine\u0027s magical performance rituals known as The Red Mass.
