    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHO WE ARE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt Deerstalker Pictures 2 we create videos inspired by the kawaii Japanese \nsubcultures, ranging from short films, comedy skits, educational content, and day-to-day lifestyle videos. The team consists of Technotropism (Director) and Vysanthe (Cinematographer), and together we have been making videos for YouTube for a few years now \nthanks to our passion for film making as well as the lolita subculture. Some\n people might not realise it, but these films take a lot of time to \ncreate, with dozens of hours spent planning, filming, and editing. As it\n is just the two of us creating this \ncontent, we struggle with balancing work and other \ncommitments. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAd revenue on YouTube is a system that rewards those who post frequently, such as vloggers who post multiple times per week. As we\u0027re creating content that is a bit more complicated than that, including short films, we turned to Patreon. Patreon\nis a platform where you can help support content creators like ourselves. So how does it work? Well, you select a\ncontribution level, and at the end of every month that donation goes into the\nbudget of the next month\u2019s videos. Think of it like a rolling Kickstarter! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided to \njump onto this awesome platform because it can give us the chance to continue producing content for you guys to enjoy. With your support we\u0027ll be able to \ndeliver more videos, more frequently, as we\u0027ll be able to dedicate more time to planning and production.\u00a0 We\u0027ll also be able to tackle larger projects and new web-series that we haven\u0027t had the chance to make yet due to our limited funds. In the future \nwe hope to deliver \nbigger and better projects with higher cinematic production value. Our \nultimate goal is to produce higher quality and more engaging content for people to enjoy, and to become a place where people can connect with others who share their passion for kawaii fashion subcultures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S IN IT FOR YOU?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a thank you to anyone who pledges, we have constructed some unique rewards, from exclusive Behind the Scenes content to having the opportunity to speak with us directly about our creative endeavors. Because we release a wide range of different genres of video each month, we\u0027ve decided to make whatever you pledge a one-off monthly payment, instead of paying per video (so you get multiple videos for the price of one!). Therefore you get significantly more reward for your donation, and you never have to worry about going over your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve also added in some long term goals and milestones that we can aim towards, such as short films, new web-series, and higher quality cinematic productions. With your help we can make these things happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtists usually charge people for their work. On YouTube\nit\u2019s a little bit different because we put it up for free. Please note that we\u0027re not forcing anyone to subscribe to our Patreon, but if you genuinely\nenjoy the content we produce and want us to keep making lolita and kawaii videos in the future,\nplease consider donating. If by some miracle every one of our subscribers was\nable to pledge a single dollar each, we would be able to make content full\ntime, and bring you bigger and better projects every week! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to visit our Patreon page and reading this wall of text.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003eDeerstalker Pictures\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
