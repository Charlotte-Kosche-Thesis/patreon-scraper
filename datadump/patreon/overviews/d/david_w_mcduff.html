    "summary": "I\u0027m a translator of Russian and Nordic literature, with some 40+ published titles. They include Penguin Classics versions of nineteenth century Russian fiction by Dostoyevsky, Leskov, Tolstoy and others, as well as more modern works by Isaac Babel and Andrei Bely. My Wikipedia page is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McDuff\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and my \u003cem\u003eNordic Voices\u003c/em\u003e blog is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nordicvoices.blogspot.co.uk\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Nordic translation work focuses on poetry - I\u0027ve translated collections by the Finland-Swedish poets\u00a0Edith\nS\u00f6dergran, Bo Carpelan, G\u00f6sta  \u00c5gren and\nTua Forsstr\u00f6m, and am currently working on a new collection by the distinguished Danish poet\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tafdrup.com\"\u003ePia Tafdrup\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking versions of Pia Tafdrup\u0027s poetry in English is one of my long-term projects - I\u0027ve translated six of her collections, and five of them have been published in the U.K. by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/\"\u003eBloodaxe Books\u003c/a\u003e. Pia is currently working on a series of collections based on the human senses - the first of these was THE TASTE OF STEEL, which I\u0027ve translated, though not yet published, and the second part, the one I\u0027m working on now, is called THE SMELL OF SNOW. I\u0027m hoping that eventually THE SMELL OF SNOW and THE TASTE OF STEEL will be published together, in the way that four of the previous collections were. I want to keep working on the project, but funding for it is important, so I\u0027m asking anyone who would like to support it\u00a0and make it go forward to donate a small amount -- $1 is the minimum: I suggest $2, $5 or $10.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt some point, hopefully in the near future, I will introduce some rewards for patrons, though I\u0027m still trying to decide what these will be. It would be useful to hear about this from people who visit this site: what would be appropriate rewards for those who contribute? You can contact me at david[at]englishings.com."
