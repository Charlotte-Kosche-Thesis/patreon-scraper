These discussions should not be informed by political agendas or ideology, but this is the reality we face with mainstream media today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made the decision to leave academia so that I could write and speak uncensored about these issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy recent work defends the science around biological sex differences (including a column I wrote that went viral, defending the Google memo). I am also critical of the \"early transitioning\" approach in gender dysphoric children; feminism; race ideology; and misinformation about paraphilias (atypical sexual interests).
