    "summary": "Hey everyone, if you\u0027re here, you probably know who I am and what I do. I\u0027ve been making 3D foot fetish focused smut for somewhere over a year as a hobby and stress relief, and porting models from SFM to XNALara for 2 years. I had always intended for this to remain a hobby and never to ask money for it and I\u0027ll try to make it more or less to remain so, however as a second year college student from a relatively poor background, I had relied on stipends and high-grade scholarships to get me through and recently the foundation which has been funding my studies was hit with budget cuts and so was I. That money originally went to rent, food and minor college expenses not covered by the college scholarship. To put in numbers I\u0027ve lost 90e which without I can\u0027t even pay rent, let alone the rest. Now, I have a \"rainy day\" account with enough to last for a month, maybe two, so that will be my Patreon test run and try to see if it works. If not, I will have to get a job to pull through, but being in college and without a degree, my options are limited, so I\u0027ll have to put a lot into it, which would drastically reduce my free time. To sum up if I can hit the 90e which will be my initial goal (or somewhere around it), I can keep making the stuff at the current pace, that compared to some is not much, but with my timetable, best I can do. My guilt would do me in if I didn\u0027t do the the requests of patrons, so a special round of the voting game will be run here as well, but that will be on hold until I\u0027m done with the current ton I have now. When I open them, please don\u0027t ask of me the stuff I don\u0027t make (it\u0027s written on my tumblr page) and please be reasonable with my time as well and try to send them after each batch is done, because as much as I would like to make the stuff, my lack of free time gets me. If I do manage to grow, I\u0027ll think of some more stuff. All in all, thank you for any support you might give, if you don\u0027t, that\u0027s fine too, nothing I render will be behind paywalls, beside the WIPs.\u003cbr\u003e"
