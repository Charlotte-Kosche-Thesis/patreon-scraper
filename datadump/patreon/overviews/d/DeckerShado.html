Here you can get updates on my videos, comment and of course pledge support for my show. Why support? As with most things in life, producing a weekly movie review show actually costs money. From the obvious costs of buying the movies, to the less obvious parts such as buying hard drives to keep everything backed up in case of a false flag destroying my channel, or the costs of upgrading equipment to improve the overall quality of the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the good feeling of lending a hand to someone whom hopefully entertains you, there are other bonuses for Patrons. Monthly podcasts, access to off-the-cuff riffs of public domain movies, and potential access to a monthly live feed exclusive for Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for reading, I have been Decker Shado, and remember: suggestions for more rewards and or reward levels are always appreciated."
