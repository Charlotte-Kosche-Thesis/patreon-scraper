    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is David \"LOLRUSS\" Bautista. I am a freelance animator, illustrator, graphic and UI designer from the Philippines. I came to the United States to pursue success as a creative and, as it turns out, Patreon will (hopefully) be a big part of my journey towards becoming a full time artist. I currently work a part time job to make ends meet while doing freelance art on the side. I also occasionally stream myself creating art for myself or commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to be a full time artist by any means, whether it\u0027s by getting hired at a big company like Cartoon Network, or through the support of Patreon. With enough support, I will be able to dedicate more time to art and creating content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you join me as a patron, you will receive a spiritual hug from me as well as a thank you. You will also have access to a patron-only drive that will include contents like Photoshop files, notes, scans of sketches and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are not able to support me financially, please share this  page with your social network.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can follow me on my tumblr\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://whatisdavethinking.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttp://whatisdavethinking.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eas well as my Twitter @LOL_RUSS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
