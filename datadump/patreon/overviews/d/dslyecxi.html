Being able to\nentertain people though the gameplay we\u0027ve developed at ShackTac, teach and\npass on lessons-learned over years of experience in the series, inspire others\nthrough the ethos and gameplay of ShackTac, or even help to influence the\nevolution of tactical gaming in some small way - each of these elements acts as\nfuel to keep the passion burning and counterbalance the work involved in\ncreating high-quality content that lives up to the demanding standards I\u0027ve set\nfor myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dslyecxi.com/f/pat/pat_03.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI love creating quality work, I want to keep pushing myself\nin that direction - be that through videos, articles, mods, concepts, or\nwhatever else might scratch the itch. \n\u003cstrong\u003eI have an overflow of ideas tagged as\n\u003cem\u003e\"some day\"\u003c/em\u003e on my to-do list, and it pains me to not be able to find\nthe time to address them. \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I do have the time, I\u0027m motivated through what I\ncan come up with, and it\u0027s inspiring to see the reactions that people have to my\nwork.

Many have asked me for a way to give back and support my efforts, and\nPatreon fortunately offers just that opportunity. \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe goal here is simply to\ncontinue doing what I love, and in the process, be supported by those who see\nthe value in it\n\u003c/strong\u003e. In turn, that support allows me to invest more of my time back\ninto those same creative passions, resulting in better work and more of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155,187,89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003eSo what\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nPatreon allows for perks to be given for certain donation quantities, defined by the creator. The idea is to give some fun little bonuses to people for contributing, and depending on the creator\u0027s style and the kind of content they create, this can take many interesting forms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve carefully considered what sort of milestones and perks\nI can reasonably offer. The \u0027constraining\u0027 factor is my desire to spread\nknowledge - which is to say, I\u0027m loathe to create things that only a limited\nset of people are going to see. It\u0027s very hard for me to come up with these sorts of perks without compromising my vision in some way - either through a loss of sincerity or integrity, a restriction on the spread of knowledge or entertainment (such as with patreon-only videos or content), or something equally undesired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn light of this, I\u0027m only offering a single perk option, aimed at people who donate $5/mo or more. I\u0027ll admit that this isn\u0027t much to write home about - you get access to a private feed that I don\u0027t have any specific plans for - but I\u0027d rather take this path than try to force perks that don\u0027t jive with my vision of how this works. Instead of perks, the collective milestones are where my attention goes - as support increases, everyone will benefit from it through additional videos, more topics being covered, new concepts being experimented with, and so forth. You can find those milestones listed on the left pane of this page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the event that I think of compelling perks that don\u0027t clash with my ideals, I\u0027ll reevaluate things in the future - but for now, this is the way we\u0027ll go. Hopefully everyone understands!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf there\u0027s something you\u0027d like to propose as an additional perk or milestone, feel free to e-mail me at dslyecxi@gmail.com\u00a0to suggest it!

There are occasions where I intend to do an extra video or two from a given session, but simply don\u0027t have the time for it.

Prior to this, Youtube income made it possible to offset some of the time investment involved in creating so many videos, with Patreon doing significantly more. H\u003cstrong\u003eowever, as a result of these changes, Youtube is no longer a sustainable investment for a creator like myself.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen viewed as payoff for the time invested, Youtube amounts to a small sum in the context of the hours that are poured into it.\u00a0To expound on that time, let\u0027s look at various aspects required to make video footage like mine - be that session footage or otherwise. It\u0027s certainly a non-trivial investment, and the critical thing to remember is that the experiences you see through that footage,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI already had them\u003c/strong\u003e. I had the laughs, the tension, the wild escapes and close calls, the harrowing victories and valiant defeats. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI \u003cem\u003egreatly \u003c/em\u003eenjoy having those memories in a tangible video form for later viewing or compilation (as with the Year in Review videos), but at this point, my recording method and archiving methods would fairly easily allow me to keep copies - albeit unedited - of sessions and missions that I found particularly noteworthy. Those memories would be available to me if I wanted to seek them out in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI choose to go beyond that, however, and what happens next is \u003cins\u003ework\u003c/ins\u003e. It\u0027s work in choosing what missions would make good viewing for others, considering how to present it, how to edit; doing technical aspects like intros and outros, audio cleanup; rendering, creating thumbnails, uploading, configuring the video aspects in Youtube; interacting with the community that gathers for the videos, be that through Discord, Patreon, e-mails, or Youtube comments themselves. \u003cstrong\u003eThere is a tremendous amount that has to be done to produce and present these videos to the broader audience\u003c/strong\u003e, and it eats into my recreational time. You could ask any member of ShackTac as to how often they see me around the community playing other games with them over the years, and it\u0027s incredibly rare, largely as a result of this sort of work \u003cem\u003e(or work directed at community management itself)\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very happy that so many people enjoy that work, enjoy watching the videos I put out, and support me through Patreon!\u003cstrong\u003e As Youtube cuts out the legs of people creating gaming content like I do, sources like Patreon will be critical towards financially sustaining those sorts of creators - myself included. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, Patreon continues to provide a level of support that helps to offset the significant time investments required of this hobby!\u00a0The vision of my Patreon campaign has shifted somewhat in response to the changes that have happened over the course of 2017. It has now taken on more of the load of sustaining session videos than it did in the past, as Youtube itself increasingly shows itself to be less and less viable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy intent is to continue to create, but I have to be realistic with myself. So long as I can offset the time investment with a reasonable momentary return - a combination of a solid Patreon campaign and a fairly weak Youtube ad revenue stream - I can justify that investment. If it wanes, I will adjust accordingly, with the intent to do as much as I can \u003cem\u003ewithout \u003c/em\u003eselling myself short and hurting my future in the process.\u003cstrong\u003e I hope to keep creating videos for many years, but I don\u0027t want anyone to be under the belief that it\u0027s an inevitability, or that it happens spontaneously and is self-sustaining!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI \u003cem\u003egreatly \u003c/em\u003eenjoy seeing others get a kick out of my content! I want to continue for as long as is feasible. I could not be more appreciative of your support in this matter - however long you may feel to give that support. Everything has always made a difference, and I hope what I\u0027ve provided, entertainment-wise, has lived up to that!

Together with a fantastic group of ShackTac members,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/Dslyecxi\"\u003eI\u0027ve filmed hundreds of our sessions\u003c/a\u003e as a way to share our experiences with anyone interested - and, to my surprise, it turns out there are a lot of interested parties! In addition to that, I\u0027ve also created instructional/tutorial content as well as a scattering of Arma mods.\u003cbr\u003e",
