    "summary": "Howdy y\u0027all! I\u0027m Duckie but some people know me as digitalduckie, Mama Duck, or even \u003cdel\u003eHRH Sir Butt Lord Duckie IIV esq\u003c/del\u003e. Okay no one uses that last one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get FAQ #1 out of the way, I go by Duckie because I like ducks. It\u0027s a boring, simple story that started almost 20 years ago and now here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ #2: What are you doing here on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, I\u0027m an artist! A freelance artist at that. I produce sketches, illustrations, and comics and share them with the world. Why? Because drawing and making things has been my go-to form of expressing myself for as long as I can remember. Perhaps most importantly, however, I\u0027ve always seen art as a fascinating and inspiring form of communication. It\u0027s one of the primary ways I can engage others in my passions and hopefully spread that passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, freelancing is time consuming. Day jobs are time consuming. And the less I have to rely on my day job for income, the more time I have for illustrating, making comics, and being an artist in general! The more you pledge, the more support I\u0027ll have to focus on the one thing in life I\u0027ve always known I was going to do: Make art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ #3: What kind of art do you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLargely I do digital illustrations, but I also do a lot of marker work particularly of paper children. I\u0027ve also got a large collection of traditional non-digital supplies I\u0027d love to have more time and space to work with again. And as a hobby, I love to take photographs, particularly candid shots of friends and family and of the baseball stadiums I travel to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my current projects includes making a physical copy of the journal my character, Marshall, carries with him. This involves a lot of research, world building, writing, sketching- the works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://couriers-journal.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIf you\u0027d like to see the progress for this project, I\u0027ve got a blog dedicated to it here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the professional front, recently I\u0027ve done some character design, illustration, graphics, and layouts for Anime Ohana! You should check them out if you\u0027re in or looking to travel to Hawaii.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://digitalduckie.carbonmade.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can see my current portfolio here\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ #4: What will pledging do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges will help supplement if not replace my income, pay for living expenses, supplies, and even the expenses of selling at conventions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges will help provide me with the time to really get my feet beneath myself and polish up my portfolio, finally get my website going, and bring some of these dusty half-thumbnailed comics to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges will help me bring more art to you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ #5: What will I get in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you\u0027ll get a warm fuzzy feeling inside for one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from that, I\u0027ve lined up a handful of rewards such as exclusive mini-prints, sketches, and streaming sessions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also open to any suggestions for other rewards and as I manage to reach various goals, I can start working on some projects that may result in even more rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ #6: What about the content currently on your Tumblr, Facebook, and DeviantArt?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese venues will always remain free and will continue to see the sort of content they still see. But anything that\u0027s Patreon-exclusive will not be seen there or will be seen at a later date. I understand not everyone has the budget to help support me and I also don\u0027t want to be the sort of person to suddenly lock everything I do up. That\u0027s why the rewards are -rewards-. They\u0027re to show my gratitude for the extra support you provide me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t already know these accounts already, you can find me on all three as digitalduckie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that answers any questions you might have about what it is I do and why. Thank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e"
