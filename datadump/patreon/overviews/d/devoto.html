This webcomic is the synthesis of basically everything I like to draw--handsome men, assertive women, demons, critters, and obscure references to 1990s malware. Somewhere along the line, I discovered there are actually people who like to read it as much as I like to make it. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping for some support through Patreon to keep my art thriving. First and foremost, I am hoping to get enough money that I can have backups of all my files online, to ensure that I don\u0027t lose the work I\u0027ve done in the case of some calamity. After that, it\u0027s all about the resources to expand the scale and quality of my artwork! Pens, Bristol board, acrylics, software licenses--these things aren\u0027t cheap. I\u0027d also like to remove advertisements from my site, if at all possible, to improve the reading experience. In return, I hope to offer more and better art, including desktop backgrounds and other goodies! If support were very high, I would like to hire help in putting together the comic in a printed edition. As it stands, I don\u0027t know how that is done and would have difficulty providing the best possible product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps me a lot. I\u0027m currently living on a graduate student stipend and I have to be mindful of my budget. For example, a single dentist visit wiped out my post-rent income for over a month. Owch. If you are able to chip in at all, it could make a huge difference. Thanks very much for your help and for your readership!"
