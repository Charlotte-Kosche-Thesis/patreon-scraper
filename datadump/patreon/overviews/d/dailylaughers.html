    "summary": "Health. Happiness. World Peace. A lofty goal, yes, and one you can contribute to every day through the small act of laughing on purpose, without jokes, humor or comedy. It is a form of exercise and self-care called Laughter Yoga and it is done in over 100 countries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a daily laughter practice decreases your stress, increases your joy, improves your overall health, and has a positive impact on people around you. Daily Laughers exists to inspire and support you in creating and sustaining a daily laughter practice by showing you new ways to laugh and new people to laugh with in a new Laughter Yoga demonstration video each day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dailylaughers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLaugh of the Day videos started on January 1, 2016 when host Dave Berman was caring for sick relatives in Atlanta. Mostly thanks to Skype, in that first year Dave laughed with people in all 50 United States and 54 other countries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRelieved of those responsibilities, in 2017, Dave set off on the #HelpTheWorldLaugh tour, traveling to nine countries while continuing to make the daily videos, starting work on his next book, teaching Laughnosis and Laughter Yoga Leader trainings, and giving inspirational talks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2018 has arrived with Dave settled down in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam where he is the only Laughter Yoga teacher. He hosts two free weekly laughter clubs, a daily live laughter session on Skype, and he teaches public speaking skills for non-native English speakers. He\u0027s also offering coaching and consulting services while working on the new book, which is about the impact of having a daily laughter practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it sounds like he\u0027s a busy guy, you\u0027re starting to get the idea why support on Patreon is so necessary. This has all grown to be much bigger than a one man operation. Your support will make it possible to hire a social media marketing intern, a graphics and web designer, a proofreader and editor, and a booking agent and publicist when he\u0027s ready to get back to traveling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, to match the time investment with the largest audience engagement, at the start of 2018 Dave pulled back from posting on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/dailylaughers\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/daily.laughers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e and elsewhere, leaving only Patreon and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://facebook.com/groups/DailyLaughers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e for building the Daily Laughers tribe. That\u0027s why the first of the new goals on Patreon is being able to hire social media support to restore daily posting on other platforms and increase engagement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
