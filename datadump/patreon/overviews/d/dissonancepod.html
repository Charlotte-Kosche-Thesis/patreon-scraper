He\u2019s all better now. He lives with his wife in Chicago. He has two associates\u2019 degrees in culinary and patisserie arts, a BA degree in philosophy, and a Masters in New Media. He makes a living as a new media professional. None of these things qualify him as an authority on anything. He can however, prepare a meal that will make you have a fit of existential anxiety then he\u2019ll give you advice on the best way to tweet about it. He\u2019s never ridden in a submarine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTom is a great lover of sandwiches and the meats and cheeses within them.  He has a degree in English Literature, which, along with three bucks and a kind word, might be enough for a cup of coffee.  A father, husband, half-hearted idealist, and sometimes poet, Tom\u2019s ire is raised before he is every morning.  Tom earns his keep staring numbly downward while listening to people complain about real estate.  He is also afraid of birds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
