    "summary": "I am the creator and host of \"Disaster Area,\" a podcast about disasters and tragedies throughout history. I have always been interested in things like shipwrecks and plane crashes, how they\u0027re caused, and how people survive them. So I decided to start doing a podcast about disasters in December of 2015.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do a lot of research for each episode, whether it be news articles and reports on YouTube, documentaries, books, official reports from federal agencies, or other sources. Sometimes these sources cost a few bucks, so a little help could always help. I try to touch on as many details of the disaster as possible, from the initial stages to the aftermath and its impact on the victims. I will be covering everything from plane crashes, building fires, and shipwrecks to collapses, plagues, hurricanes, and mass shootings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also do a \"Movie Break\" episode every fifth episode to break up the seriousness and have a little fun. In these episodes, I\u0027ll be discussing the disaster movie genre, whether it be specific movies like \"The Poseidon Adventure\" or tropes such as gender disparity or the \"dueling disaster movies\" of the late \u002790s. I love fictional disasters as much as I\u0027m interested in real ones, so I\u0027ll be knocking back a hard root beer or two and talking about my favorite movies of all time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking for patrons to assist with producing the podcast and to help with everyday stuff like bills and groceries so I can focus on putting out more episodes. What I\u0027d love to do is cut down on my work hours to focus on both writing and producing the podcast, but I\u0027d appreciate any help I can get."
