    "summary": "Greetings and salutations, intrepid reader! You are now bearing witness to a fearless furry author\u0027s first foray into cordially collecting compensation for her literary liquid latex loquaciousness and persistent passion to produce pleasing and provocative parables! I am Calyo Delphi, living liquid latex dragon extraordinaire, and I write tantalizing short stories that entertain, enrapture, and sometimes tease and arouse~ \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is just a simple little Patreon tipjar that I set up, with some encouragement from my long-time best friend Marjask, so that I could start on the fantastic epic quest of monetizing one of my most easily utilized skills: creative writing. While I have many skills, some technical, some artistic, none refined to a professional level, one of the first that I started honing and developing was creative writing. I\u0027ve always been a fairly decent writer, and am improving continuously as I write more. So, with Marjask\u0027s encouragement and input, I figured I might as well try to make even a little bit of money off of my creative outputs, from those who enjoy reading my literary compositions enough to support my creative endeavours!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s my little tipjar if you wanna pledge a dollar or two (or five ;D ) for the stories I write for fun! :3 I publish short stories written for myself or for friends from time to time; most of them very lewd and kinky in nature, but some are quite safe for work! I have a few multi-chapter stories in the works as well. Currently, writing is an outlet; a stress relief; and an endorphin release. Much of the writing that I do, I do for my own and others\u0027 enjoyment, so I usually only write what I feel like (for now). Someday I hope to change that and make writing (along with many other creative media such as music and visual art) a primary income! But for now, this is what I have to offer to the world to make it a slightly more colorful and creative place to live. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wanna see what I have published thus far, look no further than my FurAffinity profile at \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/dragon-architect\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/dragon-architect\u003c/a\u003e Enjoy, and do give feedback~! This shiny, squeaky, draconic devil-goddess derives her own greatest pleasures from yours~ ^_^\u003cbr\u003e"
