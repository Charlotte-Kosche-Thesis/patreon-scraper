The chart should be a clue. It was just a few months prior when it actually did something I found notable. It began attracting more and more interest, rising in price as more and more dollars began chasing fewer and fewer Bitcoin. Ah, there\u0027s a market, now. There\u0027s bid, ask, and the spread. Well, of course, there always was these things, but now it looked real and active. The price got bid up until the point where \u003cem\u003eholders became sellers\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI began reading white papers on \"digital cash\" back in the early 1990s. Back then, it was all theory. I understood it conceptually, especially its features\u2014foremost of which was its decentralized\u00a0nature. It\u0027s not \"run\" by anyone, especially not a central bank or any governmental body. All the king\u0027s horses and all the king\u0027s men have no more control or influence over cryptocurrency than any individual anywhere...which is exactly \u003cstrong\u003enone\u003c/strong\u003e. The only thing that has any influence is its market and the individual actions of the traders participating in the market. Buy, sell, or trade.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll the State could really do is outlaw its use, which of course always works so well... It can no more eradicate cryptocurrency than it could eradicate marijuana, poppy, or coca plants.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn its most basic nature, a cryptocurrency is an \u003cem\u003eopen, public\u003c/em\u003e ledger that can\u0027t be hacked, controlled, forged, or changed in any way. Once a block is written (every 10 minutes in Bitcoin) it\u0027s a permanent record forever and the chain of blocks (\"blockchain\") ensures each individual block\u0027s\u00a0absolute integrity since they\u0027re all \"wired\" together and each individual block since day 1 is integral to the entire chain up to and including the last block written within the last 10-minutes, 24/7/365.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n...I just held onto my Bitcoin, no intention to do anything with it. I never checked the price and had only the barest awareness that it was trading below my purchase price for most of the next two years. $500 appears to have been a big psychological barrier. It just didn\u0027t want to stay above it for very long. Perhaps it was all the people who got in on Bitcoin for pennies or less. One guy bought 5,000 coins in 2009 for $27 (about a half cent each). That was worth $5 million when Bitcoin broke $1,000 for the first time in late 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat was probably a critical price point for a whole lot of folk who got in early, then literally sitting on hundreds of thousands and millions for something many just did on a lark, out of curiosity, or even on a dare. At the time, Bitcoin was almost the only game in town and the upstarts weren\u0027t going anywhere because Bitcoin itself was still unproven. For all anyone knew, once those early adopters began selling their coin for thousands and millions, it would return to its lowly state and that would be the end of it. So, I suspect that part of the reason for the lackluster market for three years was lots and lots of people wanting to take their miraculous, lottery-like profits.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne additional data point to check is \u003cem\u003etrading volume.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://freetheanimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-05-at-3.52.06-PM.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-35470\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"259\" src=\"https://freetheanimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-05-at-3.52.06-PM.png\" width=\"680\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e The vertical bars are trading volume.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYep, the highest trading volume for Bitcoin ever was right after it broke $1,000 for the first time. You can safely bet that a great deal of it was plain old rational, mega-profit taking.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA few days back, Bitcoin hit $5,000 for the first time, representing an 830% gain from my own original purchase price only 3 1/2 years ago. OK, so now I\u0027m a believer. And I\u0027ve put that belief into action by learning everything I can about the cryptocurrency markets, with a leg up. I used to be an options\u00a0trader: some stocks and futures, but mostly\u00a0short-term options on derivative instruments like the SPX.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s been a whirlwind of discovery. First, you have to find sources of information who aren\u0027t morons. Check. Some of the guys I\u0027m following have been in the investment research and trading game for decades and I\u0027ve been aware of them since the early 90s. Second, you have to find the right tools. Check. This is one of the most daunting things for someone just jumping into crypto. It\u0027s not like just opening an account with Fidelity or TD Ameritrade and point, click, confirm. There\u0027s a number of moving parts. Third, you have to stay rational. Check.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are now something like 830 cryptocurrencies. The vast majority are crap. Some are outright scams (you need to make sure the source code has been examined by responsible parties). Some, like Etherium and Litecoin, have pretty much proven themselves. There are a few others trading for pennies or a few dollars that meet certain criteria for making a grub stake in them, like $20, $50, maybe $100...basically the cost of a dinner out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the last several days I\u0027ve taken micro stakes in \u003cem\u003eseven\u003c/em\u003e additional cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin. The volatility is crazy. \u003cstrong\u003eMy portfolio is up 21.2%\u003c/strong\u003e. No, not since the beginning of the year. No, not since the beginning of the quarter. Nope, not even since last week or even since I entered the positions over the last few days. No, none of those: \u003cem\u003esince this morning\u003c/em\u003e. Sure, there\u0027s going to be days where the exact opposite holds true, but we\u0027re going to be looking for the big breakouts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyone and everyone has the financial wherewithal to participate\u00a0and to do so only risking the equivalent of pocket change. Consider this: \u003ca href=\"https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html\"\u003ethere are over 1.2 million Bitcoin addresses where the value of the held Bitcoin is greater than $1,000. There\u0027s 340,000 addresses worth in excess of $10,000\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd remember, there\u0027s only one reward level: $5 or more per month. $5 per month gets ALL Patron-only content, NO exceptions. There\u0027s no advertising. There are no up-sells. There are no pop-ups. There\u0027s no \"premium\" content. And there are no trolls.

     "about": "I was born \u0026amp; raised in Reno, Nevada, son of a German immigrant. I attended a private, church-run high school. Went on to attend a first year of college at a fundamentalist Baptist \u003cem\u003eTennessee Temple University\u003c/em\u003ein Chattanooga, Tennessee for my first year of college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI transferred and graduated from \u003cem\u003eOregon State University\u003c/em\u003e in 1984 with a BS in Business Administration, and two minor courses of study: mathematics / computer science, and naval science. I was a member of the NROTC unit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was commissioned in the U.S. Navy as a Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) immediately upon graduation from OSU. After some 8 months attending various schools in San Diego, CA, I traveled off to Yokosuka, Japan to join my first ship, the USS REEVES (CG-24), where I served from 1984-1987 as the Assistant Missiles Officer, First Lieutenant, and then finally, Electrical Officer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter those first three years in Japan, I crossed the pier for another two years, joining the U.S. SEVENTH FLEET embarked aboard USS BLUE RIDGE (LCC-19). From 1988 \u2013 1989, I was both the Assistant Fleet Scheduling Officer and the Assistant Logistics Officer. I managed a fuel budget of $180 million.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI left Japan after those two tours over five years and headed to Monterey, California, where I studied immersion French at the \u003cem\u003eDefense Language Institute\u003c/em\u003e for the latter half of 1989. Upon successful completion of the course, I headed to Toulon, France, where from late 1989 \u2013 early 1992, I took up duties an exchange officer with the French Navy: first aboard the FNS COLBERT (C 611), and later, the FNS DUQUESNE (D 603), both as the Navigator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI left the US Navy in 1992 and returned to the U.S., San Francisco Bay Area. After a few false starts in entrepreneurial endeavors, I started a company in my bedroom in the summer of 1993 that evolved into lots of employees and a 20-year run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI traded options on derivative markets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I tend to a couple of income streams, write, cook, agitate my wife, and am thoroughly owned by three rat terriers who walk me regularly near our home at 4,000 feet of elevation in the Sierras.\u003cbr\u003e",
