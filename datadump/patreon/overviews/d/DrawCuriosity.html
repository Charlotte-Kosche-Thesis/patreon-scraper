    "summary": "Hey - it\u0027s In\u00e9s-which-rhymes-with-space!\u003cbr\u003eThanks for swinging by and for discovering this page.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a final year PhD student researching insect flight (who has run out of funding), and a science communicator. I love learning about the world we live in, and I am extremely passionate about making scientific knowledge accessible, as well as sharing the fun nuggets of research I\u2019ve had the pleasure of encountering with others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love doing this through YouTube and my website, drawcuriosity.com, \u003cstrong\u003ebecause they are both platforms that are free for people to access\u003c/strong\u003e. This means that my videos can reach anyone with a working internet connection and a basic understanding of English or Spanish (I caption the majority of my videos bilingually). To date I have over 500 ideas pertaining to scientific studies and locations that I would love to bring to your attention - but not necessarily the resources to do so!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it probably comes as no surprise that \u003cstrong\u003ecreating good content takes time and effort\u003c/strong\u003e. Currently I do the vast majority of work by myself and in my spare time. The average Draw Curiosity video takes around \u003cstrong\u003e15 - 60 hours\u003c/strong\u003e to produce depending on the amount of research, filming, editing and post-production that needs to be done to bring it to fruition. Making videos doesn\u0027t just come at the cost of my time, but to my wallet too: video-production equipment and its maintenance isn\u0027t cheap, I often purchase props to feature in videos, travel to obtain certain shots or interviews with experts, and of course I pay to keep my website online (drawcuriosity.com), my data and videos safely backed up and to take training courses to improve my content and technique even further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough my content does earn some money back through sponsors and Google AdSense, the majority of my income actually comes through freelance projects that aren\u0027t published on Draw Curiosity. Whilst I do love freelance work and will turn to it alongside sponsors to keep a roof over my head, it does mean that I have less time to spend on Draw Curiosity and therefore, less of an editorial say in the content I produce and fewer stories that I am able to bring to light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you enjoy my content and feel you have the cost of a coffee or two to spare, your patreon pledge will earn my eternal gratitude for supporting my goal of becoming a full-time and independent science communicator, and you will be directly supporting Draw Curiosity in maintaining and improving its quality.\u00a0In exchange, you\u0027ll have a peep behind the scenes, and have a say in some of my future content!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - \u003cstrong\u003eEVERYONE pledging their support BEFORE the 1st of October\u003c/strong\u003e (that is, before I am officially a full-time freelancer) \u003cstrong\u003ewill receive perks from the reward tier above theirs until the end of the year and will be invited to attend and participate in a special founding patreon-only livestream.\u003c/strong\u003e I will tell you everything you might want to know about my PhD research and answer any questions you may have - about science, Draw Curiosity, video making or otherwise - to express my gratitude for believing in me before making the step to going full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your care and attention :)"
