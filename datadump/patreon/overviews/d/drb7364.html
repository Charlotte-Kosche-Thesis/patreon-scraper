The comics are released to patrons backwards starting from the latest to the oldest, each month releasing the previously released comic. If a new comic is coming out, that cuts in on the subsequent month and the next month returns to the process of giving patrons the older comic that was in queue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is only to fund me in the creation of adult comics, both original and parody, which in turn funds and supports artists and colorists when I commission them. \u00a0The amount you pledge goes a long way in helping me bring dreams come true. \u00a0Please spread the word and help support me, but only do so if you enjoy the work I write and commission/produce.\u00a0 If there\u0027s enough support, it might be your comic I\u0027ll fund, if it is to my liking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll artists have a limit to how many pages they are willing to draw for a comic and I have a limited amount of funds. \u00a0I am aiming my comics to be at the minimum pages of 6, and minimum amount of pages is average, depending on how much the artist charges, and not anything lower for quality\u0027s sake. \u00a0Help me reach my goals and I will be raising the number of pages to the max of what an artist is willing to draw.\u00a0 There are black and white comics that will be released in between comics and these will eventually be colored and released as a full comic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am writer and editor of these comics. \u00a0I am only the writer and editor. \u00a0I do not draw. \u00a0The artists and colorists I commission are the ones I enjoy the most. \u00a0They are talented artists and with your help I can afford to commission comics and give them more awareness. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy comics will include these:\u003cbr\u003e- Lots of NFSW (cramming in as much as I can with the limited pages I\u0027m working with).\u003cbr\u003e- Lots of peril (the peril gives it a little flavor).\u003cbr\u003e- A beautiful heroine (who is of course at the center of the whole thing).\u003cbr\u003e- A variation in bondage, tentacles, vore (to a certain degree), slime, and other things I enjoy\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see all of this, support me and I will get them going.\u003cbr\u003e- Less plot and more NSFW moments due to lack of funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy comics DOES NOT include these:\u003cbr\u003e- Brutality (I do not like to see beautiful women marred in any way).\u003cbr\u003e- Death (despite perils my heroines don\u0027t die).\u003cbr\u003e- Futanari (arguable if a female slime monster growing a male genitalia counts).\u003cbr\u003e- Scat.\u003cbr\u003e- Children or lolicons.\u003cbr\u003e- And anything I do not like or find disgusting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, my comics at the moment are planned to be short, 6 pages at the minimum, and to the point as possible and one-shots mainly. \u00a0I am thinking about a series but I need more funding for more pages.\u00a0 I hope someday with enough funding coming through I can commission an artist to create their own comic and character and make their dream come true. Let\u0027s help make dreams come true. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank Creativore for his help in bringing this Patreon alive with him drawing the banner and profile picture. \u00a0Check out his stuff at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/creativore\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/creativore\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://creativore.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://creativore.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy inspiration:\u003cbr\u003eTracy Scops \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tracyscops.\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tracyscops\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/tracyscops\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time in reading this and\u00a0I hope you support me to keep this dream alive for as long as I\u0027m alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know any artists that takes NSFW comic commissions and I might like, please post their name and affiliated sites in my DeviantArt account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeviantArt account:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://drb7364.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://drb7364.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr account:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://drb7364.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://drb7364.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Andy"
