    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Phil Gonzales and for the past two years I have been producing and hosting, \"Deep In Bear Country - A Berenstain Bearcast.\" The show is a more-or-less chronological overview of the works of Stan, Jan and son Mike Berenstain from their humble beginnings under the editorial leadership of Dr. Seuss up through Mike\u0027s current leadership of the Berenstain Bear empire.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode covers a book in the Berenstain Bear series. I occasionally have Collectors Corners, with Brad Mariska - the Guinness Book record holder for largest Berenstain Bears collection - and Jeremy Gloff - the owner of the world\u0027s second largest collection of Berenstain Bears books. These two will join me to talk about the oddities of Bear Country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have on guest experts in some episodes to talk about the effectiveness of a particular book\u0027s message.\u00a0So, for example, on the episode that covered \"Forget Their Manners\" I had the founder of \"Mannerly Manners\" on to discuss her philosophy towards manners and for \"Learn About Strangers\" I had on Alison Feigh, Program Manager of the Jacob Wetterling Resource Center. The guest and I discuss the book and how well it teaches and approaches its theme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have hosted a couple of live events and hope to do more in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Deep In Bear Country\" is a passion project. I recently hit 100 episodes and hope to continue for as long as people want to listen. However, it\u0027s getting a little expensive as I need to keep buying books for myself and my guests as well as pay for equipment and hosting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, this Patreon is here to help me recoup some of those expenses and, if possible, set up a more stable recording platform. Maybe host some more live shows. That kind of thing."
