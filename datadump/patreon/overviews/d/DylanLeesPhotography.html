It\u0027s traditional to spend a little time in this space talking about who I am, what this project means to me, and why you might want to back it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m Dylan Lees, and Dylan Lees Photography is about me being able to do what I really love doing: creating beautiful art that moves people on an emotional level. I\u0027ve been photographing since I was a child, but it wasn\u0027t until much later - towards the end of my teenage years - that I discovered photography for the sake of art, and started to truly explore what my style of photographic art is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo that\u0027s what this project is to \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e. But what is it to \u003cem\u003eyou?\u003c/em\u003e Well, I can\u0027t really tell you that - but here\u0027s a few things it \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e be about: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst off, you could just want to help me create more art, in which case you\u0027re a wonderful and selfless person with good taste! You might also be interested in peering into the inner workings of my photography and my creative process; that\u0027s also something you can get by supporting me here. Or you might want to be personally involved in steering the direction of future projects; that\u0027s also something Patreon is all about!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOr you might be interested in the rewards. I wouldn\u0027t blame you; they\u0027re good rewards, the best I could come up with. There\u0027s something for every level of support, including: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eEvery supporter, at any level, gets access to special patron-only content. This content will include previews of my future projects, peeks into my editing and creative process, \u0027vacation roll\u0027 style shots from my trips that don\u0027t make the official gallery, and more! This is one area where every patron can help their fellows; I\u0027ll be listening to suggestions for what you guys want to see, and your suggestion could very well be the next update feature!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eEvery supporter also gets access to a discount code, usable at all of my online storefronts (at present, that includes the Etsy shop and anything posted to the Facebook page). This discount code entitles you to a 10% discount on all my work, so don\u0027t forget to use it when you buy something from me in the future!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSupporters at or above the \u003cstrong\u003e$5 monthly level\u003c/strong\u003e will have access to high quality desktop wallpaper packs (smartphone sized, too!). These packs will consist of a selection of the best images from every shoot or trip, and will be released throughout the year. Additionally, a number of classic packs are available immediately, containing some of my more popular and enduring current images. Additional sizes are available upon request.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSupporters at or above the \u003cstrong\u003e$10 monthly level\u003c/strong\u003e get a beautiful wall calendar once per year, featuring a high quality and seasonally-appropriate image for each month. The calendar is so big and beautiful, it\u0027s like having twelve small prints fresh every year!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSupporters at or above the \u003cstrong\u003e$20 monthly level\u003c/strong\u003e will receive a photo of their choice in the form of a stunning acrylic photo block, once every year. This three-dimensional presentation is a great way to display your favorite print right on your desk, and doesn\u0027t require any wall space!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSupporters at or above the \u003cstrong\u003e$30 monthly level\u003c/strong\u003e are entitled to receive, in addition to everything listed above, a framed limited edition print of their choice every year. It doesn\u0027t need to be something from the year - it can be anything you like, as long as the edition hasn\u0027t sold out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAt the\u003cstrong\u003e $50 monthly level\u003c/strong\u003e, supporters will qualify as a Sponsor. Sponsors will receive credit in all photo books, calendars, web sites, and any other future work where credit can be given. Sponsors are also entitled to receive a large sized limited edition print instead of the standard sized one.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQuite a list, huh? At this point, you\u0027re probably wondering where all the money is going. Rest assured, I\u0027m not just pocketing it; everything raised from this Patreon project will go towards my work, paying for my expenses and allowing me to create more content, better content, and more frequent content for a bigger audience. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://image.ibb.co/j7dDba/Graphic_Goals.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo begin with, the money will be going towards my basic expenses. I have to pay web hosting for my photography site, as well as fees for the digital platforms I display images on. I also have advertising expenses, and physical expenses associated with my printmaking. It\u0027s all very boring, but it needs paying! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter that, more exciting stuff can start to happen. More money coming in means more photo trips, and more photos produced. For about every hundred dollars a month, I can add another full-fledged photo trip to my schedule, which is good for everyone. From there, the more money my patrons bring just means more stuff produced and shown. The end goal is to have enough coming in that I can rent gallery space somewhere and set up a physical presence of my own - but that would be the start of a whole new project, so that\u0027s where the goals end for this one! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve read this far, thank you for your interest, and I hope you\u0027ve been convinced to join me on this photographic journey. It\u0027s going to be a blast! \u003cbr\u003e"
