There it stayed for the next 11 years - building an audience of up to 1.5 million weekly viewers, and gaining a reputation for being one of the most honest, reliable and (so we\u0027re told) funniest video games magazines of all time. Basically, if you lived in the UK and grew up playing games in the 90s and early 2000s, you read Digi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDigitiser ended in 2004, and - as\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mrbiffo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMr Biffo\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0- I wrote a column for the highly respected\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eEdge\u003c/strong\u003e magazine until 2008, while continuing an intermittently successful career as a screenwriter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not very wealthy.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOH, STOP SHOWING OFF ABOUT HOW RICH YOU ARE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn 2014, or thereabouts, I relaunched Digitiser as Digitiser2000 - and ever since it has provided daily updates. Usually I write about games - sometimes reviews, sometimes features - other times I just write humour pieces, or more personal, reflective articles. In short: Digi2000 is a grab-bag of whatever is rumbling around my head on any given day, but I hope it\u0027s always interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year I launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay for Mr Biffo\u0027s Found Footage - a YouTube series that was as ambitious as it was bizarre, an antidote to the more staid work I do in my day job writing kid\u0027s TV. I loved it, and I want to create more of the same - short sketches, or animations, or weird little videos, on a semi-regular basis, whenever the urge takes me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I\u0027m on Twitter, with no fewer than two separate accounts. My personal account is @mrbiffo, but I\u0027ve also begun @memoryassistant - a spoof nostalgia account, which is proving very popular.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout wanting to get too mawkish about it, on a personal level my experience of the last few years has been healing, and touching, and it feels like I\u0027ve rediscovered my voice and passion. The work I\u0027ve done since re-emerging as Mr Biffo feels like my true voice, and that is profoundly liberating. Also, I hope many of you have been enjoying it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot express the gratitude I feel towards \u003cem\u003eeveryone\u003c/em\u003e who has followed me on Twitter, or taken the time to say something nice, or supported me through Patreon, PayPal or Kickstarter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLET THE BEGGING COMMENCE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAlas, the grim reality is that, like all of you, I\u0027ve got bills to pay - and creating all this stuff is time-consuming, and obviously pulls me away from the day job which pays the bulk of my bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCertainly, if I continue to offer video content, it\u0027s going to cost money, but in a broader sense I hope that you feel what I offer - in the broad spectrum of platforms I use to offer it - is worth supporting, and has a value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support this Patreon I can\u0027t promise you\u0027ll always agree with what we have to say, I can\u0027t guarantee you\u0027ll like everything I do, but I can promise that it will always be interesting and honest, and you\u0027ll be supporting a truly creative endeavour and buying me the time to explore new things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you don\u0027t want to support me... that\u0027s fine too. You\u0027ll still be able to read and watch what I offer. I don\u0027t want to close anything off behind a paywall; you just being part of the audience is encouragement enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided - from my experience over the last few years - to remove all official rewards and incentives, barring - once a month - an exclusive video to supports. It\u0027ll most likely just be me rambling on camera, but sometimes it might be something more - you might get a glimpse of me out and about doing something. Also, I\u0027m toying with offering occasional exclusive blog posts talking about more personal matters; what I\u0027m up to in my regular life, what else I\u0027m working on - that sort of thing. I won\u0027t make promises on these - I\u0027m already offering a lot - but I think it\u0027s something I\u0027d quite like to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s about it. If you\u0027ve made it this far - thanks for reading, and thank you to everyone who has supported me thus far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you see?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
