    "summary": "Hi to most likely fans of the work that I\u2019ve already done so\nfar, but if you\u2019re someone that has happened to just stumble upon this page by\naccident then I hope you give it a quick inspection before you leave.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo if it wasn\u2019t obvious by the top of the page I plan to\nwrite fanfiction, which will mainly be focused on Fairy Tail but I wouldn\u2019t be\nopposed to trying to write it for other animes after I\u2019ve familiarized myself\nwith them of course. Because in my opinion I wouldn\u2019t be able to do them\njustice unless I had a good feel for the universe and characters that live\nthere, otherwise I don\u2019t see the point in me even trying. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that said I\nwould love to eventually start writing my own story that doesn\u2019t rely on the\nwork of other talented people that have come up with complete worlds that have\nnot only inspired me but many others to start writing fanfiction about them\nthat then possibly even led to others creating their own original work that\nwouldn\u2019t have been possible without that original inspiration that I would love\nto eventually become for someone else. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I\u2019d also like to say right now that the main purpose of\nthis is to let people have the chance to donate a little money to me and help\nget by and hopefully let me to continue writing so I don\u2019t have to take up\nanother job. And even if I don\u2019t reach that goal I\u2019ll definitely continue to keep writing and posting my stories under the pen name of digemsmack on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6347541/digemsmack\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFanfiction.net\u003c/a\u003e but the frequency might decrease. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to say since this is all donations in my eyes all of my content will still be free like it always has been,\nbut that also means you won\u2019t be getting it as fast as some of the people here\nwill be or some of the other bonuses for Patreons. Now that brings me to\nsomething that I\u2019ve had a hard time coming up with for this account and that is\nwhat is the appropriate rewards to give out at the different price values of\ndonations.\u00a0Because\nI want to make sure that I am giving you something back worthy of your donation.  So a fair warning is that I might change them ever so slightly later on but\nthat seems very unlikely and if it does happen then it will most likely be me making it better for you. \u003cbr\u003e"
