A milestone is that we have started with weekly classes, building it up to a global affordable lecturing system. As a donator you help building that, and you help the growth of the system. Growth has to bring participation costs down, and our aim is that eventually people can have a university level learning program for no more than 10 euro or dollar per month.\u003cbr\u003eIf you think this is interesting?

     "about": "Are you concerned with your health as I am? Do you believe living a good life takes some effort? My investigations into the science and art of life as a Daoist Medicine practitioner is based on the idea that Living is a job. A job requires learning. In Chinese culture this is called Yangsheng, cultivating life, or birthing life. Both is possible. In its most radical conception it is called Dandao, or the dao of internalized medicine making. Through my posts I hope to involve you in that dandao work, and jointly bring about a true people owned Healthcare system, that after Laozi, I call Daoland.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested, read and view more, become my patron here on Patreon, and work with the infrastructure and materials I offer you. Test it and proof or disproof it. Both deserve a place and proper respons in the program.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMY AIM\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a person I have lived in China and the European Union, and have been allowed to look at unexpected places in the melting pot of past and present in China. I think my perspectives are differnt than most and i like to share them with you, through my professional life, but also through some aspects of my private life. My aim is though to involve you in the Daoland Healthcare project as a partner and/or a supporter. With your participation in any form I hope that we join in developing a broad grassroot healthcare program that can independently of leadership grow as a regular part of modern culture. Survival skills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBETWEEN PRIVATE AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe interplay between private and professional life is rather important in China, but in a different way than here. It also plays out in a differnt way in your health. In some ways I believe that these aspects can help us bring healthcare forward, as they do not use them in China or other east Asian countries, by the way. Like here it is left to entrepeneurs. But they lack self regulation and organisation. Like here they float without ownership, and it is not common knowledge what they can contribute to society.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE JOB OF LIVING\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all have this job of being alive, and the job is in fact almost middle aged in that it is a job that only can be done well as sort of an alchemist. Life in essence is a-symmetrical, complex, and has too many emergent properties to count. Our own biology is complex. Our personalities a re complex, and fragmentary at best. And also, different cultures have different biologies, psychologies, sociologies. Some views are unique, and often useful to help us bring change in our life, or society. The Confucian ideal for instance is a meritocratic society, but as a achieved person you have to uplift the less fortunate. In the end every person is meritious as a result. No one stays behind, you know, like on the battlefield. This fascinates me and I try to make sense of it. Life is a personal event to all of us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMY BACKGROUND\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy own studies centralize on comparative healthcare. Following principles of transculturalism I try to develop a better understanding of health and healthcare. As part of that study I invite you to take part, share the experience. I am gradually laying out the groundwork for an affordable Do It Yourself healthcare that is based on the metaphor of a country: Daoland.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a Daoist and a researcher. I do this work out of dedication and because as a daoist monk I am supposed to live from patronage. This is my dao to achieve it. This story is my begging bowl, so to say. But I am not planning to ask for your support without something in return. I offer you to grow with me. Make the world grow together towartds a brighter future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Chinese alchemy the interior of the body is sometimes described as a society, and sometimes as a landscape. In either case it is based on cross-something-communication. In healthcare you try to make that communication better to produce more functionality. In Chinese and east asian medicine you continuousle try to re-engeneer the health issue towards health. Then you act. Eventually maybe you develop intuition on this. But from your health is also taking place the construction of the health of all the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSOME IDEALS FOR YOU TO LIVE WITH\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not just want to make money here to complete my projects. I want you to co-own the Daoland. I like to see you become Daolanders and co-develop the project. If you get to the point of investing in yourself and study with the project on any of the different levels you become Daoland officials. When you get to open a Daoland clinic or center, you become an ambassador, and your place becomes a Daoland embassy. Things we produce become gardens and buildings. Together we can move pieces in the world. Like in taijiquan, with 4 ounce move 4000 jin (pound).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMOTIVATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also wish to know more about me? Well, also look into the posts. You see how I learn and develop. It is a public process. I went to university and had the freedom to select my own subjects. I lived in a Daoist community in China for 15 years, 13 of which were my PhD research, and still base my work upon. I am a multi disciplinary person. I do not believe in simplification but in complexity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResolving health issues is a multidisciplinary issue. Paracetamol does not resolve headaches, and knocking a gen left or right also doesn\u0027t make you immortal or even live longer as research shows. Most scientific research is researching nonsense, certainly if you look at it from the perspective of the individual. Science is interesting, but it is gossip. Science is subservient to art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow did I found out? I started practicing yoga and qigong at 11 yrs of age, it was only from my later 20\u0027s that I got seriously involved in my studies. My career was first that of an artpainter and performing poet. In some of my video\u0027s you see some of my paintings. But I got to work in Taiji Gongfu and Neigong from when I was a bout 26/27 first as an assistant, but later independently. I wrote some books and got involved in professional teaching. I studied western esoterics at the University of Amsterdam as part of my study of comparative medicine at an internationalized university level program, I studied Massage, Acupuncture, Herbs, food therapy, fengshui, astrology, painting, caligraphy, music and so on. I lived and stayed in many places, some more significant than others, But i consider places that shaped me as having lived there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1999 during my trip to Wudang mountains, following Daoist abbot Wang Guangde, I became a half monk, becoming a disciple of Zhang Sanfeng under guidance of Shifu You Xuande. Living for 15 years in the Wudang Daoist community I sat first rank in seeing where we as westerners and as Chinese, Japanese, Korean and other governments err in our judgement over the backwardness of premodern sciences. There is a lot of potential there, that also is more humane than our modern health industry, no harm intended. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think regular healthcare definately is at the moment undeniably helpfull, but not sufficient and too expensive. And in most cases ir resolves symptoms but carries high risk on side effects, and it doesn\u0027t make you healthy. It lacks proper ethics. Many roles that biomedical science tries to fulfill can be fulfilled in a better way. That is why as part of my PhD study I came up with the Daoland healthcare project. You and I when you sign up will develop that better way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, although I teach in various countries, offer lectures wherever I am invited, I offer clincial practice, as a Daoist, my heart is in creating Daoland Healthcare. My travelling will be more online. The education of my kids towards health, or failing to do so also is part of this. The education of my friends is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMY EXAMPLES TO LIVE BY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy examples are wikipedia, Wudang Daoist Culture, Tao Hongjing, Zhang Sanfeng, Aristotle, Newton, Laozi, Kongzi, Gautama, Rembrand, the Mother of Dao, Grandmother West (not in order of importance and in no way complete, David Bowie also is an example).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHEY!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel motivated, sign- up and become my patron, or better, become a Daolander while patronning your own education, earning a buck yourself on the way, and sharing with others. Sharing is great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRene Goris or You Li-Ou (\u6e38\u7406\u6b27), my Daoist name, whichever you prefer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWudang Valley, 6 m below sea level",
