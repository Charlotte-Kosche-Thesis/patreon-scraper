    "summary": "We live in a time of fear. The world around us is vastly changing every day, but look who\u0027s changing it. A small group of government officials disrupting decades of global improvement. They say they are doing the best for the country and for the security of America, yet, if the majority of its citizens are opposed to the changes being made, why should these elected few be the only ones signing bills and changing laws against the ideals of its citizens. With the government and it\u0027s officials being run by big companies and banks, it\u0027s no wonder why many believe this country is run like a business and why voters think that becuase the elected president has built business before that he should be allowed to run the country.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe United States is not a business. People live here. If it is, then it would be a family business who listens to others and it\u0027s customers on what it should change. If the majority say they want one thing, then the minority should not be the ones to have the power and change it against the majority. But that\u0027s not the times we live in right now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I\u0027m here. I need your help. I am not a non-profit organization, I am one man. One man, a camera, and a passionate drive. I don\u0027t ask for much. I don\u0027t need a lot. I\u0027m not trying got make a profit off of this. I am doing these protests and using my skills to capture the protests and bring them to organizations who could use them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a street photographer turned photojournalist. Unapologetic in my methods and uninhibited by what others think of me, I scramble to take photos documenting protest around New York City. As of 1.30.17, I\u0027ve been to Not My President, Women\u0027s March, CairNY\u0027s Immigration Rally, and NYIC\u0027s Immigration Rally. I\u0027ve been working with the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union to share photos with them and promote the right of others. When a non-profit organizes an event, I do my best to contact them and share my photos with them as well. These are non-profits working hard for our rights.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography is what I do. It is what drives me every day. It is my personal way of fighting and spreading the word about what is going on in the world, but specifically New York. New Yorkers do not give up. We gather by the thousands what feels like every day. But protests and working for non-profits comes at a cost. When the protests and rallies end, I still have to go home and edit for hours into the night and the morning. Coming home with an average of 175 useable photos out of 3,000 taken photos, that still means I have to sift through them, find the good ones and edit them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a freelancer. Work is sparse. In the times that I am not protesting, I am working with others and providing them with photos and content. And with the constant flow of protesting going on, I\u0027m working for hours on end without pay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we were to raise $100 per month for me to do these protests, I would be able to have food for the month. You read that right. I usually eat about $25 worth of groceries a week. Yeah, I\u0027m scraping. I would be happy to post my receipts of what I bought. And if I had 10 friends donate $10 a month, That would allow me to eat for the month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis won\u0027t be my only job. I\u0027ll still be freelancing to pay for my needs. But do you know what would help? Me working for you. I can provide headshots and reels, websites, photos, concert photos, and so much. By you offering me gigs to work on, or telling your friends, that money will be going to a good cause. Not only will you be getting the new headshots for your next audition, you\u0027ll be contributing to the resistance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for clicking on this Patreon account. I truly need your help to continue helping others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

I took a picture of my cousin and said \"I\u0027ll e-mail it to you.\" Since then I\u0027ve moved to New York City and upgraded my gear. As a self-taught photographer, I grew up on street photography and quickly moved into the industry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting out as a filmmaker, I love to tell stories in long form. But filmmaking can take weeks to finish one project. Photography, however, is built on speed. Turn around times are quick and I\u0027m able to work with so many great people rather than sitting at my editing bay for endless days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am grateful to have worked as a personal photographer for a big name artist and to have the opportunities to shoot live concerts around the world. Currently based in NYC, I now shoot live music performances and demonstration protests",

     "description": "I exhaust myself to help everyone else. Protests are a lot of work and tons of running around. I weave through the crowd giving protesters photos I\u0027ve taken of them free of charge just so they can spread the word and have high quality photos of themselves and their children in historic moments. Concerts and live shows so they can have themselves a bit of promotion because I believe in their work and more people should. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m still working to promote myself and hustling hard to get a job, but as a friend told me once, \"A rising sea lifts all boats.\" I believe in working together as collaborators. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach $1000, I will take one day off. That\u0027s truly rare for me. Counter concept of this whole thing, right? The idea is for fundraising for me to continue my work, but I\u0027m going to do the work anyways. What I\u0027m asking for is help. Every dollar counts. I live on a small budget and I give up things that I like in order to keep that budget small, but that also means that I have to work every day to get ahead. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe money that we raise here goes to living expenses. Rent, Groceries (learned to cook to save money. Pick cheaper products to save money, eat one meal a day - breakfast), laundry ( wear clothes more than twice), utilities, and Metro Card. Usually comes out to the budget listed. So, if we raise this all together, I\u0027ll take one day off. Turn off my editing computer, put away my phone, cook a hearty meal, see a friend, and read. I\u0027ll probably still have my camera on me, but that\u0027s because it\u0027s apart of me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThat is what I ask for. I couldn\u0027t ask for anything more than a day off.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "Food for the month. Yeah, I live on about $25 a week in groceries. I love cooking and it has saved me so much financially. I buy the cheapest can of coffee grounds and have my two cups of joe in the morning. I put off my breakfast for as long as I can so that I can only eat one meal a day and make the nourishment last. I cook a meal for dinner, and save half of it for the next day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m in a rush to the next protest, I get a $1 slice of pizza to go and eat it on my way to the subway where I won\u0027t eat again until probably the next day but yet I\u0027ll be running around the streets for a good 4 hours with an hour of travel time each way and then still coming home to edit for another 3 hours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all I can afford right now.
