We call ourselves DIVIDES, and we\u0027re a band from Anchorage, Alaska, currently operating in Portland. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://klickerphotography.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s a Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a website that connects artists of all kinds with people who believe in what they\u0027re creating. You pick a pledge amount, become a patron, and enjoy all the perks - including the coveted \n\u003cem\u003ewarm fuzzy feeling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eIt\u0027s different from Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, or other crowd-funding platforms. Think of it more as a tip jar, and less of a bribe to pay for something that hasn\u0027t been created yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo...why do I care? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI was singing as soon as I could speak. Long before that, I was \nscreaming and flailing in a manner similar to how I perform with my \nband.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n Around the age of 13, I started to ask all the hard questions that early teenagers tend to - and I found my answers in music. Countless voices and instruments carried me through the nights that I cried myself to sleep and the days at school when I felt alone and worthless. They inspired me to channel my own frustrations and turmoil into music.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause of that period in my life, I feel a responsibility to create, to share and to connect with other humans through music. And I\u0027d like to do that with my best friends - my band. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA year ago, Joe, Corey, Bryan and I made the decision to move away from our homes, families and jobs to pursue our passion. Since relocating, we met an honest-to-god rock star named Paul and brought him into the fold. It\u0027s been far from easy; unfortunately we\u0027ve dealt with a great deal of loss throughout this transition. Regardless of the difficulties, we\u0027ve been hard at work over the past year, and we can\u0027t wait to share our plans with you; a new album,\n tour dates, and several music videos are in the works, and that\u0027s just \nthe beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI can\u0027t NOT play music. No matter how discouraged my heart or hoarse my vocal chords, I\u0027m going to wake up the next day and sing. And I want to share all of that music with you. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Pledge\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy pledging with Patreon, you\u0027re helping DIVIDES record new music, create radical new merchandise, go on tour, and write music that we believe in. And, you get all of of these things directly from us - not from a label or distributor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get perks, like free music, merchandise, and special updates from the band, just for being a patron! Additionally, all patrons get access to the interactive Patreon Activity Feed - where we\u0027ll be posting exclusive covers, song concepts, and video updates. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get to decide the amount that\u0027s right for you.
