We are a parenting podcast that focuses on the dad\u0027s perspective. That being said, we welcome any listener...dads, moms, and non-parents alike.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are dads on a journey, taking one step at a time, and trying to do what\u2019s best for our kids and families, and want to share our successes, failures, and anecdotes with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Are Using Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eOur intentions for using Patron-generated funds are to pay for the costs of producing a podcast, which includes hosting and domain costs. It also allows us to boost the visibility of episodes on Facebook for topics that we feel strongly about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we have enough funds coming in, we want to provide affordable t-shirts, stickers, and other merchandise for the listener. We would also use the funds to pay for the equipment we use to record the show, with the goal of improving our mobile setup, which allows us the flexibility to share the stories of other dads with greater ease.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond producing podcasts, additional funds will support contests and giveaways, and whatever else we can think of. Ultimately, we want to have the capacity to give back to the people that support us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Want To Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWe want to build an online community with our listeners and patrons. While\u00a0Facebook and forums provide avenues for group discussion, we are hoping to create something unique in both our lives and yours. Something we are all very invested in and can share with others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what you hear and you want to join our Patreon community, that\u0027s great. We\u0027d be happy to have you and welcome your support. If you like what you hear and you don\u0027t want to become a Patron, that\u0027s great too. We are still happy to have you as a listener and appreciate your support as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re passionate about our kids and they are a never-ending resource for conversation. We look forward to sharing our journeys with you and hopefully helping some of you dads (and maybe even moms) out there as you make your own way through this parenting adventure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe welcome feedback and suggestions around our Patreon and what you\u0027d like to see in terms of tier rewards. While we have a few ideas for additional tiers, there is benefit to considering all the options available to us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep in mind that while DTALKS does talk about family stuff, it\u0027s not always family friendly, safe for work if you don\u0027t use headphones, and might contain subject matter that you don\u0027t agree with. We welcome discussion but will not tolerate derogatory or discriminatory talk."
