    "summary": "Thank you for all of your wonderful love and support. It helps me  more than you even realize. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an artist in California, and I draw and paint surreal cartoons, concept designs, and erotica. My medium of choice is watercolor and ink.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also suffer from mental illnesses and chronic health conditions that disable me from working normal hours at a normal job. It\u0027s very difficult to make ends meet so I\u0027m working hard to get my art out there, expand my skills, and provide services of value, and hope that kind folks who enjoy what I do will be moved to support the art they love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery time you commission me for work, buy a print, pledge to my Patreon, or donate to my ko-fi, you\u0027re doing a huge part to make my life a little easier. I appreciate that gesture so much! If I can grow my following and bring more folks to platforms like this, that would take a huge load off my life and help me do what I really love: which is creating art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cool thing about Patreon is it allows you to make donations of a much smaller amount on a monthly basis. This is good for people who just want to make regular small contributions and support my work, and it gives me a reliable source of funding each month. So it\u0027s a great way to help and support creators you love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like my work please consider making a small pledge, even if it\u0027s $1. ;) Thank you so much for visiting my page!!\u003cbr\u003e"

So there is Safe For Work and Not Safe For Work material here to be enjoyed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy usual style could be described as surreal or popsurrealism, I like to depict emotional states and thoughts as images and sometimes create to cause a particular feeling rather than only describe one. I use symbolism, archetypes, and literary devices to describe states of mind and tell stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of my erotic work is whimsical and sweet, and I like to present sexuality as something that\u0027s fun and delightful to counter the messages floating around that sex and sexual feelings are dangerous, harmful, or unnatural. I enjoy the abstract personal nature of sex, and I like to depict the sexual experience as something private, individual, and full of wild and perhaps confusing concepts. I think everyone has an inner curiosity about sex, and that the place where feelings of innocence and wonder intersect with intense desire and arousal has a special place in our lives. \u003cbr\u003e",
