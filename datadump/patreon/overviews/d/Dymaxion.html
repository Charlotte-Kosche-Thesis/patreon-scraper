    "summary": "All of our day-to-day lives depend on volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous globe-spanning systems. \u00a0Many of these systems have emerged with less care given than we\u0027d like to how they fail. \u00a0If there are folks who don\u0027t like the work you do or the life you live, whether you\u0027re an activist, a journalist, a sex worker, or a member of any number of other at-risk groups, you have to worry even more about those failure modes. \u00a0If you build or secure these systems, it\u0027s often difficult to understand how to make sure your work has the impact you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work on both security and systems failures at a number of different scales. \u00a0I\u0027ve spent more than a decade thinking about threat modeling and application security in an enterprise context. \u00a0As I\u0027ve started working with at-risk communities directly, I\u0027ve realized that we know far less than we should about how to actually keep people safe. \u00a0Without both that direct engagement and a broad, contextual understanding of how these systems fit into the world, this is unlikely to change. \u00a0In my day to day work, I help \u00a0teams and projects to share this understanding, but this only scales so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you guys come in. \u00a0I\u0027ve been speaking and writing informally about these subjects for five or six years. \u00a0You may have seen my talks at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWg2qEEa9CE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e30C3\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://videos.theconference.se/eleanor-saitta-how-to-end-online\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Conference in Malm\u00f6\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://creativetime.org/summit/2015/09/01/day-2-eleanor-saitta/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCreative Time\u0027s annual summit at the Venice Bienalle\u003c/a\u003e, and my writing either on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dymaxion.org/essays\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy site\u003c/a\u003e, on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@Dymaxion/necessary-and-proportionate-9b913057c28c?source=most_recommended---------1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e, or in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/key-ending-mass-surveillance-math/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Nation\u003c/a\u003e. I can only afford to devote so much time to writing, and I\u0027ve got a long back-catalog of material I\u0027d like to write about, everything from very practical information for developers, funders, and field teams to more theoretical and contextual material. \u00a0While a lot of what I write is about security and traditional technical concepts, it\u0027s also important that we learn how to better think about systems and society on longer time scales. \u00a0Unless we understand the philosophy of our connected world, our tools will always fall short. \u00a0With your help, it\u0027s easier for me to find spare time to get this stuff out there. \u00a0I\u0027m planning on publishing one or two essays a month here, but you can also set a monthly cap for your contribution.\u003cbr\u003e"
