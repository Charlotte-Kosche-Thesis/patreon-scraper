When I, Dan Standing, was young I borrowed that book so many times the library asked me to take a break. I never read it in the original Latin - \u003cem\u003e\"In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas corpora...\"\u003c/em\u003e - but all these years later I have created a new Latin phrase that helps guide me;\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eVoluptatem Ironia\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePleasure from Irony\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter a decade of working on \u003cstrong\u003eerotic transformation fiction\u003c/strong\u003e I have come to Patreon in hopes that it can help bring better\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003esexy fantasy comics and stories\u003c/strong\u003e to more people, with \u003cstrong\u003egreater transparency, reliability, and creativity. \u003c/strong\u003eAt the same time I want to work on \u003cstrong\u003ebuilding a permanent and tangible legacy\u003c/strong\u003e for the genre we all love.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sexyfantasycomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/TimeandAgain1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those who don\u0027t know me, I love working on\u00a0comics and illustrated stories dedicated to sexy transformation or fantasy characters. These stories are based around \u003cstrong\u003ekarmic return and character choices\u003c/strong\u003e. Sadly I am not a very good artist, but over the years I have found great and reliable talent who have worked hard to help me create some of the\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0finest original transformation art and literature on the web!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sexyfantasycomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/HELD-WITHIN-78-COLOR.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t limit myself to just \n\u003cstrong\u003ebreast expansion, shrunken women, petrification, multi-limb\u003c/strong\u003e, or any other transformation genres \u2013 they\u2019re fun and work well when it comes to stories hinging on character decisions. Characters who find themselves \u003cstrong\u003etransformed by a wish, spell, formula, or goddess\u003c/strong\u003e because of something they did or did not heed I feel are far more satisfying to follow. This is one area I feel Ovid was lacking in - I take no pleasure in ill fates descending on those who did nothing to deserve it. A mix of transformations combined with this type of storytelling allows for \u003cstrong\u003enatural story progress\u003c/strong\u003e and more varied fiction \u2013 plus, sometimes a reader wants to be surprised! And to be clear, yes, my work absolutely includes \u003cstrong\u003enudity and other adult activity, so no one under 18 should read.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sexyfantasycomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BA-26.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, one other goal of mine is to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/transformeum\"\u003eestablish a physical repository and archive of transformation fiction and related artwork\u003c/a\u003e.
