Writing is not compensated well, or at all, very often, and I have a thousand rejection letters telling me my work is better suited to a \u0027niche publication\u0027 to prove that the world doesn\u0027t think gay stories matter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I take issue with that, so instead of trying desperately to get one story accepted for very little money, I\u0027d rather spend that time writing the stories I think people need. That\u0027s where you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing since I was 8 years old. Here, you\u0027ll find a collection of fanworks and original fiction, (Maybe poetry if you get enough wine in me)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I live, in all my messy, fun, lesbian glory. We\u0027ll revisit characters that helped shape me, show you glimpses into my upcoming novel, and offer creative nonfiction about my life. This will, in many ways, take the place of my password locked blog--Sleeping Beauty will be here first, St. Raph will restart here, as well as works y\u0027all haven\u0027t even seen, like Le Chat and my original horror works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything here will be exclusive to this Patreon for at least 6 months, if it ever gets released at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyi: An awkward thing about Patreon is that they only charge at the first of the month. So if you\u0027re getting a PHYSICAL reward, it\u0027ll the month you get charged that you get it."
