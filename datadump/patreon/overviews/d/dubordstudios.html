Among other passions, I\u0027m a Producer, Writer, Director, Animator, Actor and Dreamer. I \nlive in Reno, NV, USA with my amazing wife and two sons. We have a German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, and a Bearded Dragon named Archimedes (because everyone needs a \ndragon). I enjoy fishing, the outdoors, reading, motorcycles, movies (naturally), music, and darn-near anything creative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY THE RAVEN?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharles Lutwidge Dodgson (better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll) once wrote of a tea party between a Mad Hatter and a young woman named Alice. During the tea party, the Mad Hatter asks Alice a riddle: why is a raven like a writing desk? After careful thought, she didn\u0027t have an answer, but when she asked the Mad Hatter, he didn\u0027t know the answer, either, nor did the March Hare with them. She quips, \"I think you\u0027d be better to invest your time than in riddles that don\u0027t have the answer\". Readers of the famous novel raged at Carroll, demanding what the answer was to the riddle! Yet all the while, Lewis mused, because anyone probing for the elusive answer was only playing into his game. The true answer... is that there was no answer at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEntertaining a new idea is the first step to open your mind to a new way of thinking. Frustrating at first, because the foundation of what you\u0027ve established begins to be knocked and tested, like the idea is trying to find cracks or flaws that it can improve on. Then, as the idea settles and gets comfortable, it begins to change things, mold things into something new. I like change. The new ideas that open our minds to how we see ourselves and the world around us are of the utmost value to me. The way I see it, they are the only stories worth writing (along with the ones that are absurdly hilarious).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"So tie off the bow lines. Sail away from safe harbors.
