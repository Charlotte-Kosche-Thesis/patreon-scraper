    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you and why should I support you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Dinos and you\u0027re probably here for my Discord bot, deeBot\u00a0:D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you might or might not know, programming is my favorite hobby and it\u0027s something I love doing. Unfortunately, for the time being, I\u0027m just a highschool student and affording large scale hosting can get a tad difficult. For the past year of operation, deeBot has been running 100% on money out of my pocket and as a result the hardware it\u0027s being\u00a0run on is restricted to the lower end of the spectrum, which in turn means that its featureset is quite limited. With your support, I will be able to upgrade the server that hosts deeBot to allow for a better overall experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow come hosting a bot can be\u00a0\u003cem\u003eso \u003c/em\u003eexpensive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many features that are feasible in a testing environment but not in production. As the bot grows, more and more people utilise it daily, which requires exponentially more resources to operate smoothly. A great example for this case is \u003cem\u003emusic streaming\u003c/em\u003e, AKA using the bot as a music player for your voice channels. Operating a music bot is extremely demanding, and the machine the bot currently runs on cannot handle that much pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this necessary?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo it\u0027s not, and I wouldn\u0027t ask you to do this unless you have extra money and really feel like helping me out with this project. It\u0027s also cancellable anytime so if you can no longer keep it up, feel free to cancel your subscription.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I get in return?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are several perks that will be handed out to the supporters of this project. More info about the different tiers can be found on this page.
