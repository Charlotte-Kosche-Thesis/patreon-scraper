I am an Australian illustrator and designer who loves, among many other things, making art and playing Dungeons and Dragons. Through my online store, I am selling products and artwork I have created. Sales through my online store and patronage through this Patreon help me fund my creative endeavours. Currently in production are Illustrated Monster Cards for DnD 5e, Character sheets Usuable for 5e compatable games, and a deck of illustrated fantasy playing cards based on my own IP. All DnD content is in line with 5e SRD and used through Dungeons and Dragons OGL.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCharacter Sheets\u003c/h2\u003eEach of my character sheets is illustrated with unique characters fitting with in the guides of the DnD 5e SRD. I am creating various designs for different classes \u0026amp; Races. The goal with this particular endeavour is to produce a catalogue of unique designed character sheets that players can use to bring their characters to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMonster Cards\u003c/h2\u003eEach card has an illustration of the monster on the front for players to understand what the monster looks like and stats on the back for the DM to track and use. Currently I am only offering physical cards in my rewards tiers to Australian residents. This is because International shipping is not a friend to patreon. However those who are keen on buying my cards individually can do so through my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://DragonWarchest.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDragonWarchest.com\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0The goal with this particular endeavour is to create a deck of monsters DM\u0027s can call upon to show their adventurers who is about to kick their arse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe decks are released in volumes and the following list is what I have planned.

The more support I get for this, the faster I can move through the artworks and produce the final products. It is also another dream with this project that if it gains enough support that I will be able to get some other artists, who\u2019s work I really love, to guest spot on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRule of the Gods - Fantasy Playing Cards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will be my first physical product to be released on Dragon Warchest. My fantasy playing card deck will consist of 54 cards (your typical 52 plus two jockers). I am well in to producing the artwork for these cards and will be realeasing them through a kickstarter in early 2019. Patrons will get early access to the kickstarter at an early bird price.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does this Patreon thing work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003ePatreon is an online platform through which artists and creators can crowd fund their creative endeavours. Patrons pay either a monthly pledge amount, or pledge per creation. This will depend on how creators set up their patreons. I myself have set my Patreon up to operate on a per creation pledge. What patrons get in exchange for this is highlighted on the righthand side of this page in the rewards section. The rewards are broken down in to tiers, with different levels of rewards for different levels of patronage. And thats basically it. For a small amount of money, less than shouting me a cup of coffee once a month, you get a bunch of stuff and get to help me create some art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThere are so many Monsters in 5e, how do you hope to finish all of them?\u003c/h4\u003eThis is an on going project. I love drawing and painting monsters and this project if the perfect marriage of interests for me. Also I will \u00a0be releasing decks every 31 pieces of artwork, so you won\u2019t have to be waiting for me to complete the whole catalogue before buying a deck.\u003cbr\u003eThe hope is, if this endeavour proves popular enough, I plan on giving the opportunities to some of my fellow artists to guest spot on this project also.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are the risks?\u003cbr\u003eThe risks with patreon are minimal. If you don\u2019t like the work I\u2019m producing or don\u2019t feel I am producing enough for your pledge, then you can cancel your patronage.\u003cbr\u003eThe risks with my project are minimal also. I\u2019ve sorted out my printing process, and fullfillment process, I will be only launching a kickstarter once I have the artwork completed and ready to rock and roll.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eHow can you support this?... and what do you get.\u003c/h4\u003eReally any amount will be awesome. From 1 dollar to as much as you like, I will put your money to good use and use it to support myself whilst I work on my art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working away on the illustrations for the player sheets, monster cards and playing cards, and am releasing a few a month.\u00a0Each design is available for digital download so you can keep them on your tablet or iPhone and will be selling artwork through my online store which patrons will recieve a store wide discount. I am also sharing my process for creating my art with patrons paying above $5 a month and am releasing video tutorials and PDFs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
