I\u0027ve often times considered it a sickness or compulsion and will pursue it to the detriment of the rest of my life. I eat, sleep and breathe making new pictures and the process of creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will never be considered an even mediocre businessman and wrestle with ways to monetize my work. I do occasionally get commissioned to shoot but mostly I shoot what speaks to me and with people who inspire me. I\u0027ve tried books, prints, tutoring, all in a way to cover basic living expenses and have managed to scrape by for the last 20 years as a full time artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like sharing my work. It doesn\u0027t exist until there is an audience and sitting in a folder on my desktop it does nobody any good. I think Patreon will be an interesting way to show my work and allow viewers to participate in the process.\u003cbr\u003e"
