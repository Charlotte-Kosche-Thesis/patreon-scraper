    "summary": "Greetings and denigrations, loogies and germs. Welcome to my 16th corner of the internet (I spread like an amoeba. It\u0027s horrible, send help.)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Draskon, and you\u0027ll likely know me by my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Draskon5665\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e videos of Video Game Music Covers and Remixes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, welcome to my Patreon page! I suppose this is where I have to somehow convince you lovely people to generously part with your money with me in order to support me and my endeavours, but I\u0027ll keep it short and sweet, because I\u0027m pretty sure no one likes long drawn out essays. (You should\u0027ve seen my last Patreon description, it was a total clusterfrag. Also, I\u0027m a hypocrite, not only because this probably will BE an essay, but because I write more essays on the internet now than I was supposed to in school. sorrynotsorry)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re so generous as to support me here on Patreon, it would be unbelievably appreciated and you would have my eternal gratitude. When I created this Patreon back in 2014 or so, I was under the impression that I could offer a ton of backer rewards such as sheet music, full albums and discographies along with streams and such, but unfortunately, I cannot. It\u0027s an unrealistic level of work for me as just one person, let alone my circumstances, but I\u0027ll leave it at that. Just know that if you decide to donate, it means more to me than you can imagine. You have my promise that all of the funds generated by this Patreon will go straight back into making music content bigger and better, because that much I CAN do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out the tiers below to decide how much you\u0027re willing to donate, but remember that you don\u0027t have to do so if you don\u0027t wish to. If you\u0027re interested in making a one-time only pledge that doesn\u0027t reoccur every video I make, you can purchase my music for as much as you wish over at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://draskon.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e page. In addition, my videos and material will never be paywalled; you\u0027ll always be able to watch and listen to my music on YouTube for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much, and I hope you decide to support me even greater in my journey of musicianship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
