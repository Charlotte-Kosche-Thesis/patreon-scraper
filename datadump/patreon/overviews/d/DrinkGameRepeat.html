    "summary": "Thank you so much just for checking out my Patreon page! My name is Lara, or DrinkGameRepeat, and I stream nearly every day on Twitch! That\u0027s not all, though. I also do some voice acting, story readings, and eventually vlogs! If you\u0027re here I hope that means you like my content and want to support me. Though why, you ask, did you make a Patreon? Well, it\u0027s kind of a sad story, but I want you guys to know why I need this support, now more than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was diagnosed with a disease called fribromyalgia when I was just 21. I could tell you all about it, but it would take a really long time, so please check\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/guide/what-is-fibromyalgia\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e if you\u0027re really curious. In short, I can\u0027t work any normal job because of it. Anything where I would be sitting, standing, or walking for long periods of time, or lifting heavy objects, or working with people (though that one is anxiety\u0027s fault). Even before I was diagnosed I loved making YouTube videos and streaming, and I would love to make it my job. This is where you lovelies come in. I can\u0027t do it off of ad revenue alone, as I\u0027m sure most of you have seen on YouTube, and not everyone can tune in and donate on my Twitch. I started this Patreon to give myself a little bit of income, no matter how small it is. I will continue to make videos, of course, but the monthly income of Patreon would make it so much easier. Not to mention the doctor\u0027s visits and prescriptions I can\u0027t afford at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSorry that was a really long, sob story, but I like to be honest. Back to the fun stuff! All the links to my YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, and Facebook are linked, and you can even become a member of my Discord server! On there you can play games with me in voice chat, talk to others in text or voice, and be notified the quickest on when I go live, or the rare chance I actually get a video uploaded! I hope you find my content awesome! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember to stay lovely, lovelies~"

I swear I\u0027m a woman, no matter how much I sound like a 12-year-old boy. My favourite games are open world exploration, like the Fallout or Elder Scrolls series. I also really love table top games! Pathfinder and World of Darkness especially. I\u0027m also an aspiring voice actor and singer.",
