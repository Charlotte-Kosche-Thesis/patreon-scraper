    "summary": "Hello, everybody! I\u0027m Brendan. I\u0027m a writer. My business card says \"Horror/Fantasy/Strangeness\", and I stick to that, sort of, mostly. My work has appeared in magazines, web sites, podcasts, and in my own books and performances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with my stuff, you can hear/read some of my stories for free on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.brendandetzner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy web site\u003c/a\u003e, but if you\u0027ve made your way here you probably already have some idea what you\u0027re getting into. I like to experiment and push boundaries, and I don\u0027t like to repeat myself. Self-publishing has been a great fit for me. I get to release what I want, whenever I want, without asking anyone\u0027s permission. Novels, novellas, collections, all in different genres and styles, and all under my own name. I can\u0027t think of any other time in the history of publishing when I\u0027d get away with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never been a mass-audience kind of writer, but the fans I do have are smart, passionate, and demanding in the best possible way. I\u0027ve had people shove money into my hand at my reading series, look me in the eye, and tell me to keep doing exactly what I\u0027m doing. Those are the people I want to do right by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my pledge to all of you is as follows. I\u0027m going to keep trying to surprise you. I\u0027m going to keep up with the blood, sweat, tears, and elbow grease that it takes to make something excellent. I\u0027m going to keep putting out beautiful books with awesome covers by great artists. And for folks who go the extra mile by supporting me here, I\u0027m going to make sure that my gratitude is felt. Not only will you be the first to get your hands on all of my new releases, but I\u0027m going to be letting you guys into the sausage factory in a way that is unprecedented for me. Sometimes I\u0027ll be sharing field research and background information that goes into writing my stories. Other times I\u0027ll be sharing scenes-in-progress. Other times I\u0027ll be filming myself at my writing desk while I make plastic dinosaurs fight sock puppets because I\u0027m stuck and would rather do that than get back to work immediately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will be an adventure. Thanks for reading. I can\u0027t wait to show you what\u0027s next.\u003cbr\u003e"
