I grew up with movies like Disney\u0027s Robin Hood, Tail Spin, Pokemon, Star Wars, and the like! Most of my interests have drawn heavily from those, as has my inspiration! When I grew up and discovered erotic fiction, I flocked to galleries of art and stories centered around furries, dragons, pokemon, and everything in between! Now, I am proud to say I am contributing to that expansive fan base! Here, you\u0027ll find mostly erotic fiction centered around established canons like Star Wars and Pokemon, or explicit exercises in hypothetical thought, such as what our world might be like if anthropomorphic people actually existed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever your fancy, the chances are that there\u0027s something for everybody here! Pledge as little as a dollar per story to receive delicious furry erotic fiction and help to propel me on my journey to world domination!\u003cbr\u003e"
