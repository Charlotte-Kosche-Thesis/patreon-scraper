    "summary": "Why? \u003cbr\u003eWe are an independent/commercial free podcast that we research, record, and edit ourselves. This is a total passion project that we do outside of our fulltime jobs, families, and other commitments. We started this project completely out of pocket, and have continued to keep it going through the donations of kind and generous listeners. This is a way for us to continue to cover the costs associated with doing the highest quality podcast that we can create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat? \u003cbr\u003eAll funds donated will go towards paying for the books needed for research and to help support our frequent guests, storage space for our episodes (and to keep the back catalogue available and free!), website fees, software fees/upgrades, computer maintenance/costs, merchandising, advertising, and travel (we will be traveling more in the future for some surprise guests!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho?\u003cbr\u003eYou! The listener! This whole project began between two friends, but has exploded into a worldwide conversation amongst people of all backgrounds, faiths (or no faith), ethnicities, traditions, etc. It has surpassed our wildest dreams in terms of what it has become. We want to keep the momentum going by continuing to hone our skills, upgrade our production quality, continue to book stimulating/interesting guests, and find new ways to bring fun and exciting content. We also want you, the listener, to be at the reins of this project. We continue to hear your feedback, your suggestions for guests, improvements, and so on. What would you like to see us do? Live events? More social media contests? Over the course of 2017 and into 2018 we have some exciting surprises in store! Thanks again for being a part of this project! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Deconstructionists\u003cbr\u003eJohn and Adam\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
