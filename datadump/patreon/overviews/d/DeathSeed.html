    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Briar.  As is the reality for many creative types, writing and painting are hobbies rather than a part of my career in the here and now.  I\u0027m changing my perspective.  I\u0027m taking the plunge in starting the long road to publication, and this Patreon campaign is the first step in this adventure.  I have tried writing fanfiction in the past, but my heart is in writing original fiction.  Particularly genre fiction, fantasy and cyberpunk with a touch of horror.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a witch and a pagan, and I carry the themes I find in my practice into the worlds that I create.  Deity is in everything, including the characters in play, and energy is shared.  Whether it is magic or logic, I would argue it is both, that energy travels through every character, setting, and plot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Death Seed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeath Seed is the working title of my pet project, which has been in development since 2010.  I opened up to friends about the fantasy world I was creating, and after some encouragement, I made \u003ca href=\"http://deathseedreference.tumblr.com/\"\u003ea tumblr page\u003c/a\u003e dedicated to the project.  Although it is a great medium for collecting inspiration and reference material, the platform isn\u0027t ideal for sharing prose.  Most of my work is still in the dozen or so notebooks I\u0027ve filled over the last six, going on seven years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeath Seed is not one story with a single plot and numerous sub-plots.  It is a collective of stories, some even happening at the exact same time as others.  A simple trapper and merchant traveling with a cleric on her final journey, before reaching the end of her third cycle.  A young woman caught in the middle of a shadow war between deities.  A thief saved from execution and seeking to repay the debt, only to be declared the avatar of a deity that may or may not even exist.  And the origins of all that was and that will be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are only snippets of the plots that are currently in the process of being written.  What I am ready to share are short essays, quick sheets, rituals, spells, and other aspects of worldbuilding.  As these are the tools I use to keep me inspired as I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon campaign for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis campaign is a way to share my work while also supporting its creative process.  Since moving back to my hometown in 2013, I lost access to the library where I did most of my previous research.  Patrons will be helping me build my personal library as well as helping me reach a higher quality of life.  But the greatest importance is to help me push toward publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, I will be adding new content as well as creating new tiers.  The first goal is already listed at $150 a month, to bring art into the content that I share with patrons, and one day, I will share the complete rough drafts.  Promises to look forward to in the future!\u003cbr\u003e"
