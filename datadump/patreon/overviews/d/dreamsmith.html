Rather than getting a second job at a hardware store or something (been there and done that!), I\u0027d love for writing to be my second job.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you, my patrons, can help me make ends meet, then I will be a very happy writer indeed, and I\u0027ll do my best to provide you with interesting and entertaining stories, featuring both your favorite characters, and some new ones.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy fanfiction is posted on both Twisting the Hellmouth and AO3, and my Amazon stuff is listed under the name A.J. Kalliver.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a blog dedicated to author-type things--my current thoughts and progress on stories, the various books, movies, comics and shows that strike a chord in me, creative-wise... things like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can find that \u003ca href=\"http://theforgeofmythanddream.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am, of course, deeply thankful for your interest in my work, and profoundly grateful for any level of support you might choose to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlan\u003cbr\u003e\naka\u003cbr\u003e\nDreamSmith\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
