But before all of that, there was \u003cstrong\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s it all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://demon-hunters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bct-420.png\" style=\"float: right;\"\u003eThe stories are true. All of them. Every myth, folktale, horror story, and urban legend. The world is full of nightmares, and the \n\u003cstrong\u003eBrotherhood of the Celestial Torch\u003c/strong\u003e is there to stop them. The Brotherhood is a secret organization of mortals, monsters, and demigods on a divine quest to keep the world safe from the forces of Evil. Fighting demons and madmen. Dark wizards and transdimensional terrors. Pushing back the Apocalypse one battle at a time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nAnd then there\u0027s the Omega Chapters\u003c/strong\u003e. The newbies. The cannon fodder. They pretty much do the grunt work that actual Hunters can\u0027t be bothered with and get killed off by the bucketload. \n\u003cstrong\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/strong\u003e is the story of an Omega chapter.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nInteresting, tell me more...\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://demon-hunters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/gabe-patreon.jpg\" style=\"float: right;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is Gabriel\u003c/strong\u003e. Gabriel used work for the Brotherhood. He was a Demon Hunter, and he was one of the best. Until something bad happened. Most of his team was killed, and the blame fell on him. They kicked him out of the only life he\u2019s ever known. Now he\u0027s sitting in a bar, well past drunk and working hard to forget. But an unexpected visitor is about to show up to pull him out of his funk and get him back to work...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nThis sounds a little familiar...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://demon-hunters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/jim-425.png\" style=\"float: left;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/em\u003e was the first movie the Dead Gentlemen ever made together\u2014way back in 1999\u2014and it\u0027s stayed close to our hearts. We made a sequel,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDemon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake\u003c/em\u003e a couple years later before moving on the the \u003cem\u003eGamers\u003c/em\u003e films, but we always wanted to go back. In 2007, we got a chance to revisit Gabriel\u0027s world when we co-produced the\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDemon Hunters Roleplaying Game\u003c/em\u003e with Margaret Weis Productions. Included with the game was\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Brotherhood Orientation Video\u003c/em\u003e, a half-hour introduction to the \u003cem\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/em\u003e universe that updated the canon, brought some of the original cast out of retirement, and\u00a0introduced some new takes on old characters. After that, well, not much happened. We moved on to other projects, leaving the future of the \u003cem\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/em\u003e franchise in Limbo. Until now...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd now it\u0027s a comic, huh?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://demon-hunters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bijou-425.png\" style=\"float: right;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://demon-hunters.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a full re-imagining of the franchise in a weekly webcomic format. We\u0027re telling Gabriel\u0027s story from the very beginning, the way it\u0027s meant to be told\u2014without the artificial limitations of a zero-dollar budget and an all-college-student cast. We meet up with Gabriel well before the events of the first movie and learn how they became a team, and all the tragedies and missteps along the way to their confrontation with the Earthwalker and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u0027s making this thing?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThe comic is being written by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Jimmy_McMichael\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJimmy McMichael\u003c/a\u003e, with art by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/outlaworange\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBen Honeycutt\u003c/a\u003e. You might recognize Jimmy as \"Herr Doktor\" in the \u003cem\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/em\u003e movies, but he also co-wrote the \u003cem\u003eDemon Hunters RPG\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003eBrotherhood Orientation Video\u003c/em\u003e. He\u0027s Dead Gentlemen\u0027s resident expert on all things Demon Huntery. \u003cstrong\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/strong\u003e is Ben Honeycutt\u0027s first project with Dead Gentlemen, but so far he\u0027s knocking it out of the park. Seriously, he rocks, and Gabriel and his team have never looked better!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so how does this Patreon thing work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://demon-hunters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wolf-450.png\" style=\"float: left;\"\u003eAs much as they\u0027d love to do \u003cstrong\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/strong\u003e for a living, Jimmy and Ben both have full time jobs that aren\u0027t even slightly related to hunting demons. Maybe someday that can change. By pledging your support, you help get us closer to our Milestone Goals, and free the guys up to devote more time to the comic. With your help, we can add more features and regular columns to the site, and move \u003cstrong\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/strong\u003e from a once-a-week comic to a two-, or even three-times-a-week comic! Every little bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo check us out at\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://demon-hunters.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edemon-hunters.com\u003c/a\u003e! If you like what you see, please tell your friends. Spread the gospel of \u003cstrong\u003eDemon Hunters\u003c/strong\u003e to the farthest corners of the earth! If you\u0027ve got more questions, or just want to tell us how excited you are about the comic (us too!) you can reach us on Twitter at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DG_DemonHunters\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@DG_DemonHunters\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for checking us out!
