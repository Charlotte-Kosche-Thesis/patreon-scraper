    "summary": "Since I was young I\u2019ve been working to overcome a genetic disorder that makes my body extremely prone to injury. I\u2019ve always felt that life shouldn\u2019t just be survived, it should be truly lived. I made alot of strides to live without pain and do the athletic things that I loved to do...then my son was born...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuddenly I wasn\u0027t the star in my own movie anymore\u00a0-- My fitness had to stand for more than just my own happiness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut being healthy is like a minefield in our world today, especially for a parent. Choosing the right food to eat can be complicated and expensive. Getting to the gym is inconvenient at best and horribly intimidating at worst. And to top it all off, who has the time and energy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Enter \"Defining Dad Bod\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis show is about empowering you with the knowledge you need to work smarter, not harder (unless you want to work harder, I won\u2019t begrudge you). Its a place for you to listen and be inspired, encouraged and motivated about the things you CAN change in your world to become a better person, spouse, parent, and human being. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDefining what our bodies stand for and how we pass that meaning onto our children is a journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u2019t be a slave. Be an agent. Don\u2019t let your life happen to you. Make life happen. \u003cbr\u003eIt all starts with you. The only thing you truly control in this world is yourself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough intelligent and discipline lifestyle, nutrition, and exercise we can be better. Its time to stop settling for \"Dad Bod\" and remake to mean something awesome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing the content of this show takes hours of research and networking on top of production, planning and editing and you can be a part of keeping it all coming! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the show expands, we (John Bauer and I) will be honoring \"transformation stories\" from parents in the community who have taken the leap to change their lives (and subsequently their children\u0027s lives) for the better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether its information you need, a pat on the back, or a swift kick in the tail -- I got you covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited for you to gain access to all of the awesome stuff I\u0027ve lined up to reward your pledges with.
