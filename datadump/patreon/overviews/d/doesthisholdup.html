No, we aren\u2019t talking about the \nboring black and white films that your parents raved about. We are \ntalking about the VHS tapes that you love and remember as a kid. \nRemember those movies that we all thought were years ahead of their \ntime? Every week TJ and Jaime pick a film from their past, analyze it, \nand tear it to shreds. Only then, will the age old question be answered:\n Does This Hold up? In addition to the weekly podcast, \u201cDoes This Hold \nUp\u201d performs in front of a live studio audience at the Arcade Comedy \nTheater with special guest performances, prize give outs, and audience \nparticipation. Give it a listen, and figure out if those movies still \nhold up today.\u003c/strong\u003e",
