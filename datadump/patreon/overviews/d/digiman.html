Pleasure to meet ya! Looks like you have stumbled across my Patreon page. First of all, thank you for your interest. So, you may be wondering what exactly I do. Well, I make video game reviews and Top 10 videos on YouTube. (How original, I know.) Above is one example of my work. Making videos has been my passion for quite awhile now, but I unfortunately haven\u0027t been able to devote much time to it, as I\u0027ve been working retail and attending college the whole time. I can usually only get 2 videos out a month, maybe 3 if the universe is on my side. But I really want to get them out faster so I can give you guys more content! That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. With the help of Patreon, I\u0027ll be able to fulfill my dream and do YouTube as my job. If that happens, I promise that I\u0027ll give you all at least twice the amount of content you\u0027re getting now. Now like any other Patreon page, \u003cstrong\u003eDONATING IS OPTIONAL.\u003c/strong\u003e If you do donate, then thank you! If you can\u0027t, no worries! I already appreciate you watching my videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I think that\u0027s about it. Thanks again for checking my page out! And if you did choose to donate something, then, again, thank you so much! You\u0027re helping me follow my dream! Whatever happens, I\u0027ll see you all in my next video!"
