I\u0027m Drace, and I write stories. Fictions of fancy and festivity, with a saucy edge to keep your imagination spinning in delight. Stories focusing on romance and sensuality are my forte, though I\u0027m certainly capable and curious enough to work on other sorts of tales.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere was a time many years ago that I did similar stories, under the pseudonyms La Parka Girl and Take Me New. I sort of faltered in my dream to be a writer during that period, but now I\u0027m determined to make it happen. Your pledge, of any amount, helps keep that dream alive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd hey, we\u0027ll have a little fun fulfilling it, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe short answer is that it\u0027s a tip jar. Patreon is a way to support independent creators of content. It\u0027s a form of crowdfunding, but unlike Kickstarter, you\u0027re not paying for something that\u0027ll come in the future, but for something that\u0027s already here! It\u0027s a way of saying thanks to people that post content you enjoy; be it artists, writers, YouTube celebs, and various other content creators. You can pledge to give a set amount of money per month, billed at the end of the month, and you can cancel at any time. Basically, if you enjoy the writing I put up, please consider tossing me a dollar or two a month, to help me work towards becoming a better known author!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat do I get in return?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWell, if the monthly donations reach certain stretch goals, you can participate in polls set up to provide exclusive stories to\u00a0contributors. For even the most basic of donations you still receive early access to my monthly original story, and if you donate enough, you can even have a free commission of your very own. You can have me write a story that you want told!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far, and thank you for any contribution you\u0027re able to make!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e"

     "description": "Wow! If we ever hit this tier, then that means there\u0027s been an enormous amount of support for my work. In addition to the two stories decided through polls, I\u0027ll have the time to write a third story of my choosing. This could be one of the poll stories that didn\u0027t make it, or a brand new creation. \u00a0Stories like Princess Celestia\u0027s Stable, Detention for Kim, and other non-commissioned stories will get a lot more attention!",
