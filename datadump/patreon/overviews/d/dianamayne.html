    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page! \u00a0I\u0027m a musician and songwriter in the Chicago area, and my goal is to write and release as many great songs for you as possible. \u00a0I have already recorded and released multiple songs with my bands in the past, and you can listen to samples of my previous songwriting here: \u00a0dianamayne.com/listen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love songwriting, and I believe that I write songs that people really enjoy and find meaningful. \u00a0If you subscribe to my page for just one dollar per song, you will receive digital downloads of each new song that I release through this site. \u00a0That way, you are never paying without getting something in return. \u00a0I generally write songs that are melodic and catchy, and I am influenced by a variety of styles, including pop, rock, classical, old jazz standards, Broadway, folk, and even heavier rock and metal. \u00a0I plan on writing and recording songs in different styles, and matching each song with just the right artist or band to make that song shine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe song I chose to launch this Patreon page with is \"Meet Me At The End of the World\", a brand new track recorded by my band Sad Monster Party and featuring the vocals of HAHALALA. \u00a0The main message of the song is that \"you\u0027re never alone\", and that message is what keeps me going in writing and music. \u00a0As a kid, any time I felt sad or lonely, I was comforted by listening to my favorite songs. \u00a0If they were happy songs, they cheered me up with musical friendship, and if they were sad songs, they made me feel that I wasn\u0027t alone in my pain. \u00a0I always keep this in mind in my songwriting, and I really hope that my songs reach out to others when they need a hand to hold, a good laugh, a refreshing cry, or just a fun song to dance to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support and encouragement. \u00a0I hope you enjoy my songs as much as I enjoy writing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Profile photo and middle cover photo by Mark Litwicki; left cover photo by Rachel Bonacquisti; right cover photo by Mike Bibby)\u003cbr\u003e"
