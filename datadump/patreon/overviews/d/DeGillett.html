I\u0027m capturing critiques of my student\u0027s works, and demonstrating all my hard-won tips and tricks in a searchable library.\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly membership will directly fund my ability to collate,\npreserve and share the countless things I have learned over a lifetime of\nmaking paintings \u0026amp; being a successful visual artist. As a supporter, you will\nbe in the engine room helping to build a world where creatives like you and me have\naccess to the answers they need to build their own creatively fulfilling life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love to teach the practical aspects of\nmaking bold, painterly, beautiful, lyrical and meaningful art. Art has opened so many doors for\nme in my life, and if I can nudge those doors open for others, (and by others, I mean YOU!) then that feels\nlike a life well-lived!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe idea that you may be willing to become a patron and help me afford more materials \u0026amp; time to continue my\nexperimenting \u0026amp; problem solving in painting thrills me to my core. I\u2019ve never\nbelieved in keeping secrets from my students, and video-blogging takes that to\na whole new fingers-crossed level of exposure. I am SO looking forward to getting to know you, making the clips you ask for, and seeing all the exciting stops on this journey we can take together!\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this, and thanks for warming your clever, creative hands at my fire :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.buyartnow.com.au/de-gillett\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReproductions\u003c/a\u003e  \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.artstree.com.au\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClasses\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://bluethumb.com.au/de-gillett\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOriginals\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.degillett.com.au\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/De-Gillett-BFA-Fine-Artist-23027889345/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

My large scale\nacrylic paintings are multi-layered and highly textured, with deliciously\ntransparent glaze layers revealing and concealing the provenance of a complex,\nsaturated surface.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAbundance and gratitude are my touchstones; I wish for our\nworld to be made a richer and more celebratory place by the presence of my\npaintings. The notion of simultaneity is a passion for me \u2014 where it is, where\nit was, where it will be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have only recently realised that capturing the sounds of\nmy subjects in a visual portrayal is another driver of my practice, whether\nit\u2019s the screech of parrots, the clatter of palm fronds, or the hush of the\nQueensland bush.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also love to teach the practical aspects of making\nbeautiful, lyrical and meaningful art. Art has opened so many doors for me in\nmy life, and if I can nudge those doors open for others, then that feels like a\nlife well-lived!\u003cbr\u003e",
