    "summary": "Hello everyone! I am a transgender quip (queer crip) film director, activist, writer, public speaker, and dad. My true love and passion is as a filmmaker and director. I have my BFA in Film, and I have so many amazing ideas I would like to see come to fruition. So many people have asked me to make a Patreon, so they can help me make works that is meaningful and inclusive of disabled people, trans and other LGBQPIA folks, and Black/POC.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to make my projects a reality, I will need money to help me develop such projects. That is why I am here. I learned very quickly that if you want to make quality projects, you need to be willing to spend money paying people to help you. I have so many ideas, but my day job does not help do more than pay the bills. I would like to eventually, only have to work on film and television projects, because that is the work that makes me happy the most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The money raised would help me to finish projects I have not had the ability to finish, as well as create funds I need for my podcast, to make sure it is more inclusive to everyone. Additionally, I would like to be able to develop additional projects featuring diverse storylines, with diverse casts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, the first set of money will go to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-First $1000 - will go to help pay for translation services for my podcast, and help us get better sound equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Next $3000 will go to help paying to finish my film Nance + Sydney. It is a comedy short film about a former lesbian couple played by Shannon DeVido and Jennifer Suter (see screenshot in the header for this page) - this will pay our actresses, for ADR, sound editing, and coloring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Next $3000 will go to working to develop the first episode of a yet to be announced web series\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my Podcast:\u003cbr\u003eDISrupt the Media - \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/disruptthemedia/id1229487002?mt=2\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/disruptthemedi...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/disruptthemedia\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/disruptthemedia\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your consideration!"
