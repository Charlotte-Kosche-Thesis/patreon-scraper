I explored impacts of oppression on artists and community organizers. I learned that \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoice\"\u003ePhotovoice\u003c/a\u003e can bring art and organizing together in amazing, transformative ways.

I should have my license in 2018. \u00a0I can currently offer support to others in the form of informal assessments, some counseling, and resource recommendations. I take a trauma-informed, antioppression, neurodiversity approach. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, Dialectical-Behavioral Therapy, and Family Based Systems are approaches and tools that interest me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBurnout therapy thru anti-oppression lens:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eBurnout is huge in nonprofits, activism groups, and arts communities. And groups often self destruct. I will be blogging about things like self care vs community care, restorative justice, group processes, and will be highlighting communities who value healing justice. I will also discuss discrimination within our \"left\" or \"progressive\" groups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt + social justice:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Artists and human rights supporters are marginalized in authoritarian/consumerist societies. Creativity and human rights are crucial for our mental health! They are repressed in toxic environments. And, they tend to have different needs within a counseling setting than those who are not doing creative or humanitarian work. Everything I do in my life is pulling social justice and art together, but I have struggled to find a good name for unifying all of it. Your support will help me refine my explanation, and develop my Patreon / career around it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!! \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Joining my Patreon will give you access to art-in-progress, zines mailed to your doorstep, consultations, assignments, feedback, and creative prompts.

I have 10+ years experience in nonprofit program design, facilitating, management. \u00a0While all my skills appear unrelated at first glance, I have unified them into one focused practice: supporting artists and social justice workers to foster sustainable development within themselves, and their projects. I can help you create a tangible, practical roadmap, while also helping you cope with unique demands of social justice or artistic work. I have not come up with a perfect elevator speech to describe my practice yet, so think of me as a creative collaborator/ life coach/therapist/community organizer/ idea machine. \u00a0I have just started this practice, so bear with me while I refine this definition, and develop my Patreon around it. \u00a0Here you will find my art projects, writing, and advice. \u00a0Supporting my Patreon will help me develop my practice, which in turn will help others develop theirs! \u00a0Thank you for visiting my page!",
