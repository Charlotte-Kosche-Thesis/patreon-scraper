I love you for even BEING ON THIS PAGE!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you\u0027re totally new to my project:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Diverse Hawkesbury project is about using a positive, interactive and constructive narrative to break down the structures that support prejudice and discrimination. It\u0027s about adding dimension to our knowledge of who lives here in the beautiful Hawkesbury, and how stories of the past have built upon what we know of ourselves today.\u00a0Often, the clash between opinions can become negative and damaging to the community\u0027s social equilibrium, especially on social media. Misinformation can become viral and documented as \"fact\", and without projects like DiverseHawkesbury.net, those perspectives remain unchallenged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is about capturing small snapshots of who is living here in 2018 to build a truly detailed overall picture of who we are. It\u0027s about representing the otherwise undocumented and underrepresented.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project aims to lead with positivity and a firm objective to educate and advocate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiverseHawkesbury.net and its social media accounts may appear as \"media\" but are not intended to compete with local media. A lot of my work is \"long form\" interviews and articles, which will one day be valuable documentation that will be freely available to anyone online and in our local libraries. I am not restricted by time limits or word limits. I report on one participant per month in my column in the Hawkesbury District Independent magazine, and it\u0027s been lovely to have that opportunity to tell the community all about the lives and achievements of these fascinating individuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT ARE WE DOING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eexploring the diversity of the Hawkesbury region together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOral histories are one aspect of presenting the humanity of diverse Australia. Another way is to discuss and investigate current issues and news.

Disadvantage has been a reality in my life until now but it is in no way defining my future. That said, it takes the support of a village to bring otherwise unprofitable ventures such as this to fruition. Early in the project, I successfully applied for a $500 community grant. My camera cost well over $500, and the website, memberships to historical societies and the big cost - fuel to attend my interview locations - has already outrun that grant by a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout some form of ongoing financial support, my project is funded out of my own pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think my project is worth supporting. I am trained in technical production, media and communications, publicity, research and experienced in teaching and tertiary level training. The feedback from Hawkesbury City Council, the Hawkesbury District Independent and most importantly my beloved community has shown that you agree. I am currently working alongside Darug elders, the Maltese community (and their various organisations), the Hawkesbury Historical Society and a range of other informed individuals (Andy Carr of the SLNSW, Mark Caruana, Dr Barry York, Dr Bronwyn Harman, Danielle Wheeler and local history enthusiasts) to create content that is not only locally relevant but engaging and accessible. I think that knowledge should be free; I also think we have a responsibility to teach young people in ways that they find fun and easy to understand!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf just enough people help me out with just a tiny little regular contribution, I can afford to drive to lots of places, create lots of stimulating, thought-provoking, educational content, and represent YOU in a way that is independent and free of the restrictions imposed upon other forms of \"media\". My biggest cost seems to be travel and just the incidentals of creating content; stationery, digital storage devices, a packed lunch to take with me to these recording appointments and so on. The other cost is time... time that is spent working on these articles during childcare hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m trying to avoid having to register as a for-profit business, because I feel it detracts from the true spirit of the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me keep this thing in its most pure form. \u003cbr\u003eBecome my patron and watch the project give back almost immediately.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
