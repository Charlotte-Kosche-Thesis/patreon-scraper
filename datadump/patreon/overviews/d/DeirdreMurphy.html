    "summary": "I love performing music, I love writing music, I love practising. \u00a0I love jamming with other people and I love music\u0027s capacity to transform and define a moment. \u00a0I love seeing music reach people\u0027s hearts, and create a space -- of abandon, of joy, of glee or tears -- which wasn\u0027t tapped in to before. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage offers a chance for me to make and share music.  I hope that it will touch your heart as it so often touches mine. \u00a0Patreon offers me time to find songs for the world, to find words for my life. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCapitalism: The Musical was the first thing I ever wrote, and sharing it has been a gratifying, trusting, and at times terrifying process. \u00a0For me, the most successful element of the show is the community which has formed around it. \u00a0Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of creating a beloved community, and that is the strength of the show -- both for the cast and crew (22 strong), and for the audience. \u00a0 One lovely audience member, after the show, said that it was the third time he\u0027d seen it, and he keeps coming back because the show offers hope. \u00a0Here is a snippet of it: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij-Tkz5Ufq8\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij-Tkz5Ufq8\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot all of my work inspires hope, of course -- some of it is downright complainy or has more of a GODDAMMIT vibe. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m planning to release a single soon! \u00a0And have been plotting a scheming a music video for it too. \u00a0 I\u0027m also gigging around Dublin. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to offer the same level of reward for all options.  If you can comfortably support me at 2 dollars a month, my gratitude knows no bounds and I don\u0027t like the reward structure that says those who can pay more deserve more.  Maybe this will bite me in the ass in the long run, but for now it\u0027s the option I\u0027m most comfortable with.   I\u0027ll release the work a month sooner for those who are on Patreon.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, for your 2, 5, 10, 15, 40, 50, 100 or a million bucks a month I will: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWrite songs, and sing them. \u00a0I\u0027m thrilled that music has become my first voice, artistically. \u00a0 I love the challenge of searching out a rhyme, of creating the most suitable sequence of notes for an idea, and then being brave enough to expose those things to the world! \u00a0 In addition to original music, I\u0027ll post up the cover songs I\u0027ve been working on. \u00a0I also regularly sing traditional songs with a couple of friends, and will be posting those up here as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOffer occasional videos in Yoga instruction. I have taught Vinyasa Flow, Hatha (more gentle) flow, Ashtanga, prenatal, mum and baby, Yoga Nidra, and Acroyoga, and have been teaching yoga for 14 years.  My videos will be versatile and there will be something for everyone.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to offer video of myself doing something physical that I find interesting -- could be handbalancing, movement/dance, trapeze, acro, improvisational song/dance.
