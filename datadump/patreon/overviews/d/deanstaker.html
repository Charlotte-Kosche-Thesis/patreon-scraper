    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eAustralian indie rock veteran Dean is probably best known as bassist, vocalist and one of the principal songwriters with Australian band 9\u00bd INCAS and as \u0027The Rabbi\u0027 in the politically-incorrect musical collective known as ASYLUM NATION, which toured (or is it \u0027tore\u0027?) around the UK between 2004 and 2006. His music has been heard everywhere from background music to the weather forecast on Japanese television to the soundtrack of cult movie ICED LOLLY at the Cannes International Film Festival, and his work can be found in the State Library of South Australia and the National Library Of Australia as examples of contemporary Australian music. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Since his earliest performances as a busker, playing everywhere from Adelaide (his hometown in Australia) to Tokyo, Dean has been enamoured with the singer-songwriters of the late-60s/early-70s, and this influence has manifested itself in the songs that he has contributed to every project that he has been involved in throughout a career spanning 30 years.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Several years living and performing in Japan (as well as three highly successful Japanese tours with 9\u00bd INCAS in 1999-2001 and a stint as bassist/vocalist with Japanese band DIA MONDo) has given Dean\u0027s songs a unique flavour, the result of blending elements of 1970s Japanese folk-pop with alternative and progressive rock genres and creating a style that is familiar and yet difficult to define.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Since moving to London in 2004 Dean has been involved in several musical projects, the most recent being quirky \u0027food metal\u0027 band REALITY CHEQUES where he appeared as lead vocalist, and he is also one of the founder members of SHABBAT RESOULED, a musical Friday night phenomenon held at Finchley Progressive Synagogue in North London.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e In January 2014 Dean released his first solo album, \u0027Losing It\u0027, which was recorded at Chilli Inc Studios in London. On the album he blends indie, folk and progressive rock genres on eleven songs from throughout his career.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Dean has also made musical contributions to film as the composer of original music for the documentary \u0027Beyond Violence\u0027 (2012), and with three of his liturgical songs being included in the soundtrack to feature film \u0027Deconstructing Griffith\u0027 (2013).\u003c/div\u003e"
