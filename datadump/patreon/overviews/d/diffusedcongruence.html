    "summary": "Greetings of Peace! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its inception in 2013, \u003cem\u003eDiffused Congruence: The American Muslim Experience\u003c/em\u003e\n has been dedicated to highlighting unique and interesting personalities \nfrom within the American Muslim community, and engage them in what will \nhopefully be a worthwhile and invigorating conversation not only for the\n guests, but also for listeners. We like to think of the podcast as part\n oral history/personal narrative and part a discussion of critical \nissues, with listeners feeling as though they are sitting in on a casual\n (and non-scripted) conversation. Our guests include scholars, thought leaders, academics, \nartists, actors, journalists, and activists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we still want to do so much more... But we need your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy\n becoming part of our Patreon family, you are essentially investing in an endeavor that preserves the life stories of key thought leaders within our community as well as the robust and engaging conversations that are integral to the well being of our community. Your patronage will afford us the time and \nresources to continue producing the show, create more\n content, afford us resources to market and promote the show, and most important of all purchase better equipment! In a perfect world, we\u0027d do this for a living, and with \nyour help, each month inches us closer and closer to that dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Break Down\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore content:\u003c/strong\u003e\n We\u0027re looking to step up production on spot pieces highlighting important organizations within the community, attending conferences and workshops to capture attendee feedback and \"behind the scene\" interviews and content, and so much more! We want to dedicate more time for the show and continue scheduling the kinds of guests and voices we have already featured on the show as well as reaching out to some high profile personalities. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarketing and advertising: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe can\u0027t thank our listeners enough for the love and feedback, we have received from our listeners, there\u0027s nothing more rewarding and humbling than having someone approach us at a community event or a social gathering and share their love for the show. Above all we have benefited immensely from listeners who are getting the word out for the show almost entirely through word of mouth. We have come this far on that alone! But we would like to do more for promoting the show by attending major conferences, advertising in publications and media resources, and online campaigns. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetter equipment: \u003c/strong\u003eThe show has come a long way from where we started -- the audio quality \nof some of those early episodes still make us cringe -- but we can \nalways sound more \npolished.\nYour patronage will help us acquire better mics, mixers and other \nrecording gear for in-person interviews as well as with remote guests. We look at each interview, especially the stories and personal narratives we have been blessed to capture and share over the years as a Trust and legacy for posterity. We want to capture and preserve that legacy utilizing the best technology and resources that money can buy. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s our spiel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom\n the very beginning, \u003cem\u003eDiffused Congruence\u003c/em\u003e has been listener-driven and listener-supported. And as more and more time passes since we first started, we\u0027ve realized that we are really onto something very special here and if we\u0027re going to turn \u003cem\u003eDiffused Congruence\u003c/em\u003e\ninto something even greater, now is the moment to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re super excited about all the new ideas and directions we have planned for the show as we head into the \u003cstrong\u003efifth year\u003c/strong\u003e(!) of doing this, and we can\u0027t wait to have you on board helping us out. Help us continue to \"unpack\" topics with our guests and showcase the diverse and rich tapestry that is the American Muslim experience. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are immensely grateful to our listeners for being there for us then and being here for us now. We could not have gotten this far without your support and prayers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParvez Ahmed \u0026amp; Zaki Hasan\u003cbr\u003e"
