Other times I make videos, books, audio recordings, and live performances. In fact, these other elements make up as much of my art as the art itself, and I live for them just as much. I\u0027m as inspired by videos and podcast as I am abstract expressionism and typography. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI firmly believe that my purpose on this planet is to be an encouraging butt-kicker to creative people all over. I want to help foster a creative revolution, where artists, designers, photographers, writers, and maker of all sorts realize their true potential, shuck off old systems, and learn to become the badasses they were meant to be. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere was a time where artists were regaled for being the definers of culture and taste, but that went away after the industrial revolution, where working for \u003cem\u003ethe man\u003c/em\u003e became the status quo, and artists were looked a slackers and non-starters.
