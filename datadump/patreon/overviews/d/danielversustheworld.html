That will go towards recording equipment, technical support, live shows, future projects, travel costs, and other things of that nature. The more you put in, the more I can put out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIN RETURN you get music, videos, stories, thoughts, pictures, cover songs, ALL SORTS OF MAGICAL TREATS! My aim is to put out one or more releases every month, so you\u0027ll always be getting something out of your monthly support. If you give \u00a31 a month, after a year you\u0027ll only have spent \u00a312 and you\u0027ll have more than an album of material. Even better, YOU helped it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why am I doing this now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m ready to start working on new music. I have a bunch of songs I\u0027ve been sitting on for a while now, an album project I\u0027ve been working on and would like to develop, a live cabaret show I\u0027ve just started research for and I\u0027m very excited about, and basically I want to get all the old stuff out of me so I can be completely fresh and make this year my most productive, creative and successful one yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI need your help to make this happen!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not trying to make a profit on this. I\u0027m just looking for support from my community to be able to create and produce work I am proud of. Every bit of help I get makes the journey that much easier. The thing I love about Patreon is it has absolute transparency of what I\u0027m taking in monthly, which I can break down into costs and you can see where your money goes! Hopefully, the outcome each month feels worth the cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQUESTIONS?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can email me at \u003cstrong\u003edanielversustheworld@hotmail.co.uk\u003c/strong\u003e. This is the best way to ask me anything you want, send song requests, share ideas, or confess your undying love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWANNA BUY MY CURRENT ALBUM/MERCH?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks! That\u0027s another great way of supporting me creatively. You can head over to \u003cstrong\u003ewww.danielversustheworld.bandcamp.com\u003c/strong\u003e to buy my debut album \"\u003cstrong\u003eRemember Who You Are\u003c/strong\u003e\", and some gorgeous t-shirts featuring artwork by \u003cstrong\u003eAkbar Ali\u003c/strong\u003e. Everything I send out comes with badges and stickers and patches and fridge magnets until I run out of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
