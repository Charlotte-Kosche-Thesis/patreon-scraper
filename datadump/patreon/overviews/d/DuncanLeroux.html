    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Are We?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, and thank you for visiting our page.  Many of those who have found their way here likely know us already but here is a bit about us for the less familiar.  In 2015, we started the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.blogtalkradio.com/duncdon\"\u003eDunc\u2019d On Basketball Podcast\u003c/a\u003e then quit our jobs as lawyers to make our living as independent NBA journalists, adding the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/NateDuncanNBA\"\u003e#TwitterNBAShow\u003c/a\u003e in 2016. Dunc\u2019d On is a daily NBA podcast published after the games end each night. The show concept is a one-stop audio shop for everything you need to be an NBA fan, with night-of game wrap-ups, detailed salary cap breakdowns, timely news, team previews, mock trade deadline and offseason episodes, and bi-weekly check-ins on all 30 teams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe #TwitterNBAShow on Periscope is a first-of-its kind second screen experience for watching NBA games, providing a more in-depth alternative to the traditional telecast with live in-game X\u2019s and O\u2019s play-by-play, advanced stats, and best of all, no commercials.  During breaks, we engage with users and answer questions on Periscope and Twitter, as well as providing more traditional halftime and postgame content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt feels a little odd, even as independents, asking for a subscription to this content.  After all, you could simply not subscribe and still consume it for free.  And Dunc\u2019d On has advertising support, so we hope it will continue indefinitely.  The #TwitterNBAShow has been more a labor of love as we are slowly trying to build an audience and we hope to support that through subscriptions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you simply enjoy the free content and wish to support us, our suggested donation is $4 per month.  For those who want more, a donation of $7 per month gets you exclusive content that we will be creating solely for subscribers.  Those include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn exclusive podcast solely for subscribers, at least one per month\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAudio versions of Danny\u0027s articles\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrivate periscope broadcasts, at least one per month\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly releases of Dunc\u0027d On Podcasts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive video from Dylan Murphy illustrating concepts from his podcast appearances on Dunc\u0027d On\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAMA-style chats\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSalary projections and scenarios during free agency and trade deadline\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAny other fun stuff we can come up with, like Periscopes of pregame warmup routines and drills, stats tutorials, and more.  The more subscribers we get, the more content we\u2019ll produce.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe struggled a bit to determine what we thought was fair pricing for this content, especially considering that we are each taking home half of what we bring in.  So like we often do in predicting NBA salaries, we looked at the comparables.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDunc\u2019d On conservatively provides about 20 hours of content a month. For the #TwitterNBAShow during the playoffs, we are doing about 60 hours a month and during the regular season we would likely do 15-40 hours a month.  So what are some comparables?  ESPN Insider is $3.99 per month.  The Athletic, another subscription-based sports content service, is $3.33 per month.  More generally, you can subscribe for 1 book per month, usually about 10-20 hours of audio entertainment, at Audible for $14.95 per month.  So $4 per month for supporters and $7 for subscribers seemed a fair number for the amount we are producing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe realize the higher tier does not provide a ton of additional benefits relative to what we provide to everyone but we wanted to give something extra for those who really appreciate our content and form the backbone of what has become a great community on Twitter, Periscope, and Dunc\u2019d On mailbags.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your continued interest and support. We look forward to working for you for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNate and Danny"
