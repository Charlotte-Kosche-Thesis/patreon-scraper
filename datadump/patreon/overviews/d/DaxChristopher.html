    "summary": "Thank you so much for stopping by! I\u2019m a storyteller, and I utilize three main mediums to tell my stories\u2014prose, poetry, and game design. My aim in all three is to create an immersive experience that allows me to reach from my world into yours and leave both of our worlds in a different state than it was in when we met. I\u2019m currently the author of three published, standalone books, which you can learn more about \u003ca href=\"http://www.daxchristopherbooks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u2019m working on my first proper book series. We\u2019ll come back to that in a minute\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m also the creator and publisher of the board game \u003ca href=\"https://www.devilsplaygroundgame.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u201cDevil\u2019s Playground,\u201d\u003c/a\u003e a game that will turn your perception of yourself on its head and show you exactly what you\u2019re capable of when it all comes down to \u201cyou or them.\u201d It\u2019s a vicarious jaunt through the worst parts of who people really are, and when it ends, you\u2019ll find that it leaves you with your own sordid story to tell. The new book series will tell the story of what happens in a life-sized version of the infamous Game, complete with all the soul-selling, crime, back-stabbing, and desperation that comes with a standard game session of Devil\u2019s Playground. Not familiar with the debauchery and dastardliness of Devil\u0027s Playground? \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/GD_iUl5OFMw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick this link\u003c/a\u003e to see the trailer, and welcome to the family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should go without saying that if you support me in this venture by becoming a patron, you will have my sincere and endless gratitude. Very few things bring me as much joy as telling these stories, hearing other stories that other people have to tell, and discussing them on a philosophical, artistic, or personal level for hours on end. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur stories are what give us our identities, test, change, or reaffirm our values, and are an indispensable part of who we are as people. What I strive to do as an artist is relate to you, personally, on a level that simply can\u2019t be achieved through \u201cnormal\u201d discourse. Sometimes I want you to feel better, sometimes worse, sometimes afraid, sometimes loved\u2026but always I want you to feel something. This is at the heart of what I do.\u003cbr\u003e"
