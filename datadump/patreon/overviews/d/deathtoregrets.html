    "summary": "What do you want? What kind of life do you want? What kind of person do you wish you could be?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up, I always wanted the life that I imagined every girl living in California lived. You know, the kind of girl who would surf all morning, then throw on a sundress and hop into a VW to drive around with their windows down and their hair blowing in the wind. These days, you see those girls on Instagram and in YouTube videos, traveling the world, living out of their vans, swimming in lakes and climbing up mountains. They go to Bali and Costa Rica and Bora Bora just to take selfies in front of waterfalls. They\u2019re young and carefree and somehow seem to have lots of money, but no responsibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI, on the other hand, am an overweight 39 year old, married, mother of three with a shitload of responsibilities. That kind of life is not for people like me. Overweight 39 year old married mothers of three don\u2019t go to Bora Bora. They go on diets. They make New Years resolutions to go to the gym more often. They drive minivans to soccer games, with the windows up, because hair blowing in the wind means an hour with the fucking wet brush trying to get all the tangles out of their kids hair. Amiright, moms?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, yes, I am right. That is all true. But it doesn\u0027t have to be true! This is why most people don\u2019t live the life of their dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause they\u2019re too busy living the kind of life that\u2019s expected of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m an overweight, 39 year old, married mother of three and THIS is what that looks like for everybody else, so this is what it\u2019s supposed to look like for me. This is just the way it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuck. that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is MY LIFE. This is MY STORY. I don\u2019t have to play the part of the average, overworked, underappreciated mom because \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d I\u2019m the writer of this story. I\u2019m not fucking dead yet. The story of my life isn\u2019t being written ABOUT me. It\u2019s being written BY ME, right now. And if I want to be the main character - the girl in the sundress, who hops into a VW and drives around with the windows down, all I need to do is put on a cute fucking dress, hop into a VW and drive around with the windows down. \u201cThat kind of life\u201d doesn\u2019t belong to anybody. It doesn\u2019t belong to skinny people or young people or single people. Anybody can make the choice to do any of those things. Want to start your own business? Want to go back to school? Want to quit your desk job to open up an ice cream shop on the beach?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY HAVEN\u2019T YOU?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it\u2019s because you\u2019re comfortable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven when it feels difficult, living the life that everybody expects you to live is easy because they practically hand you a fucking script. As a mother of three, everywhere I look I see blog posts, videos, comedy routines, tv shows and movies that all show me exactly what \u201cmom life\u201d is supposed to look like. I know that I\u2019m supposed to live in yoga pants, wear my hair in a messy bun, be constantly overwhelmed, definitely be too busy to take care of myself and drink copious amounts of wine. That\u2019s the life society expects me to live. That\u2019s the script I was handed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe your script is different. Maybe you\u2019re a tall, blonde, 21 year old who\u2019s expected to go out every weekend and take lots of selfies. Maybe you\u2019re a 65 year old divorced woman who\u2019s expected to knit sweaters and blankets and shit. Maybe you\u2019re a 45 year old CEO who\u2019s expected to work too much and drive a fancy car. There are lots of roles and everybody gets a script. Some people love their lives and happily play their parts. And if doing all the things society expects you to do makes you truly happy, by all means, keep on living that life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you want something different for yourself ... a new story or even a whole new character ... ripping up the script you were given and writing your own story can seem pretty scary. And what if you screw it up? What if you try something new and totally suck at it? You already know you\u2019re fine at playing the part you were given. Why risk change?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you tell yourself to stop being difficult and to stop dreaming. Not everybody can have big, amazing lives. Not everybody gets to be the main character. And you keep on playing your part by living your normal, familiar, expected life day after day, month after month, year after year, until the very end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut just before the end \u2026 you have regrets. They say the number one regret of the dying is \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eI wish I\u2019d had the courage to live a life true to myself and not the life others expected of me.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is heartbreaking. And I refuse to make that mistake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an overweight, 39 year old, married, mother of three. I\u2019m also a pink-haired business owner who\u2019s spent my entire life proudly doing whatever the fuck I want to do. Right now, along with my husband and kids, I\u2019m a full-time, world-traveling writer and photographer, headed to the beach. In a blue and white VW, with the windows down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always thought I was such a weirdo for not living the life everybody around me expected me to live. But I\u2019m really not a weirdo at all. I\u2019m a regular person with regular problems, just like you. I\u2019m just a regular person who realized that I don\u2019t have to perform the script that was handed to me. This is my story. And if I want to be the star of this movie, I WILL BE THE STAR OF THIS MOTHERFUCKING MOVIE. Please be the star of yours. Especially if you\u2019re not the type of person who\u2019s normally the star. Please be the star. Please step out into the spotlight. The world needs to hear your story. The California girl on the beach? We\u2019ve heard her story a million times. Every story is about that fucking girl. Perfection has been DONE TO DEATH. What we want to see now are stories about regular people doing really cool shit. Why are we living vicariously through other people\u2019s lives when we could be making those kinds of lives for ourselves?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have one life. One very short, precious life that can end literally any second of any day. If you\u2019re not living the life you want to be living, you\u2019re wasting your time. And you\u2019re going to regret it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd fuck regrets. No more regrets. Death to regrets!\u003cbr\u003e"
