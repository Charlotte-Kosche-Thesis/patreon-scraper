I have been writing all my life, but always for my own pleasure and never seriously. But the more I developed several characters, the more like real people they seemed, and I felt this desire to share them. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0began writing this book over 20 years ago and had taken it through several workshops and rewrites. \u00a0Then my marriage fell apart and I developed severe depression. \u00a0I lost every flicker of creativity I had. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHappily, \u00a0after over ten years of struggling, I came through that storm, and my thoughts returned to my characters and my book. \u00a0But in the course of time I had my desktop computer crash. \u00a0I had my laptop crash. \u00a0I managed to find an older, printed out draft of the story, though it was missing the last ten or so chapters. I had to retype (rewrite) the entire book back onto my computer and rewrite the ending completely. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the wheels are spinning again, and my creativity is back. \u00a0I have, in the last year, worked to restore and polish this book. \u00a0At this point I feel it is ready to put out there in the big bad world, so I can move forward with writing the sequel.",
