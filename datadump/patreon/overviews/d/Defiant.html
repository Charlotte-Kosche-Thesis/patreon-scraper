Add in badass LGBT characters, like Gottlieb, and the first ever mentally challenged special needs character, like Ivar and what you get is \"Defiant\"!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon offers stability\u003c/strong\u003e that Kickstarter doesn\u0027t. You never know if your funding will succeed on Kickstarter. That makes it extremely \u003cstrong\u003ehard to plan out a budget\u003c/strong\u003e and work with an \u003cstrong\u003eartist that needs to be paid \u003c/strong\u003efor all the amazing work he\u0027s doing. I\u0027m hoping that you all will become my patrons here, if \u003cstrong\u003eonly for $1 or $2 or $3 / month\u003c/strong\u003e. It will \u00a0greatly \u003cstrong\u003ereduce the anxiety\u003c/strong\u003e that goes along with trying to fund this project! But I still plan on continuing to do Kickstarters to help fund this comic and to bring more people such as yourselves, potential readers, into the mix.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe video from Kickstarter that started it all:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjYf7AVkxJc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I\u0027d like to offer patrons on here is \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive content\u003c/strong\u003e from the production of the comic. You will \u003cstrong\u003esee things from my perspective\u003c/strong\u003e, minus any spoilers. \u003cstrong\u003ePlus \"give-aways\" and cool art rewards\u003c/strong\u003e!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n1.)\u00a0For example, each week I\u0027d like to put up an \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive speed drawing videos\u003c/strong\u003e of one or more of the panels from the comic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n2.) Each week I\u0027d also like to put up \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive sketches\u003c/strong\u003e from the current pages being done for the comic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n3.) Each month I\u0027d like to put up a short \u003cstrong\u003eanalysis video\u003c/strong\u003e explaining something from the comic, either a theme, a panel, page or even \u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u0027s\u003c/strong\u003e from this community.\u003cbr\u003e\n4.) Each month I\u0027d like to put up \u003cstrong\u003eexpanded story lines\u003c/strong\u003e that I couldn\u0027t fit into the comic. These will likely be in sketch form but will add great character development with some extra action.\u003cbr\u003e\n5.) I\u0027d like to randomly choose \u003cstrong\u003eone patron each month to appear in the comic as a side character!!\u003c/strong\u003e This will go into effect when we reach 25 patrons, are working on issue 2 in October 2016, and you are in the $3 or greater / month subscription.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n6.) I\u0027d like to also randomly choose patrons in those categories of $10+ / month to randomly get \u003cstrong\u003esigned, hand-drawn (pen to paper, not computer) sketches!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i708.photobucket.com/albums/ww88/ksrugis/9501734336507551344_1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i708.photobucket.com/albums/ww88/ksrugis/highresunderwatersketchtocolor.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i708.photobucket.com/albums/ww88/ksrugis/Height%20Chart.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you would like to see more about the story (for those of you who aren\u0027t directly from my Kickstarter) please check out that Kickstarter I keep mentioning:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/694705875/defiant-horror-fantasy-berserk-meets-walking-dead\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDefiant Comic Book on Kickstarter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

I\u0027m combining this with Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns to make sure I can continuously produce this comic.
