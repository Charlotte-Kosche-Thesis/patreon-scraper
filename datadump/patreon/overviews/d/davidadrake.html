    "summary": "Hello, an introduction is usually a simple thing but like one of my main characters, what name I use changes depending on the context. This isn\u0027t because I\u0027m a double agent like the character, but because I\u0027m in the process changing, from being \"Ke-Yana Drake\", female author of the Time Speaker series, and into a future where I will be David Anaan Drake, \u003cem\u003emale\u003c/em\u003e author of the Time Speaker series. So, you can either call me K, or David, I\u0027m cool with either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for almost thirty years. I\u0027ve written six books and published two of them so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://davidanaandrake.wordpress.com/01-rise-of-hawk/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://keyanadrake.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/daviddrake-roh-cover.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e  \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://davidanaandrake.wordpress.com/02-time-speaker/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://keyanadrake.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/daviddrake-ts-coversm.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m also a massive world builder, so I\u0027ve built up a lot of peripheral content with the Time Speaker Universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Time Speaker Universe\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTSU is special and I\u0027m not just saying that because I\u0027m biased. I\u0027ve deliberately created a universe where almost all of our known human bigotries don\u0027t exist. There are no words for things like homophobia, no distinction between gay, straight, bi or pan. All adult love is treated as a non-event. Same goes for gender identity, sex, race, neurodiversity, mobility. There\u0027s no need for words like trans or cis because you\u0027re just whatever gender you identify as, regardless of your born sex. For example, a woman is a woman, even if she\u0027s born with a penis. Your gender and your identity are inherently things defined only by you, not society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess what I\u0027m saying is that TSU has been designed and created (to the best of my ability) to be a haven for all of us who experience oppression in our real life. Imagine reading a book about a planet where you could live as yourself without oppression. Imagine there are characters who are just like you. Now imagine a whole universe like that, where true universal equal rights has already been fought for and attained thousands of years in the past. (Unless you\u0027re psychic and living in the country of Arana on Planet Shadow, then you\u0027re in trouble.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you read this universe? Would you love it as much as I do?\u003cbr\u003eI think, given the chance to read, you would. And guess what? This is the opportunity!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe answer to this is two-fold. Primarily, as a part of my transitioning, I am relaunching the series under the new name, and with new personal pronouns, ranks and endearments for the third gender in my species (androgyne). To do this relaunch, as well as an actual relaunch party, I need some additional income, and perhaps some external feedback to ensure that TSU is as universally open as I intend it to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d always intended to come onto Patreon when I had a goodly amount of fans, but the reason why I\u0027ve chosen to come here earlier than I intended\u00a0is somewhat more personal. The truth is I need the ability to eat. A change in my circumstances and a lack of change in my government-supplied income have created a situation where I have less than half the money I need to eat properly on a weekly basis. So from August 2017 onwards I am literally the embodiment of the \"starving artist\" meme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you don\u0027t want to hear about my troubles... you want to hear about what you get out of signing up, am I right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToys, you get lots of toys\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have all of this unpublished stuff for TSU. Two calendar systems (one planetary, one interplanetary), an astrology system, card games, a four-dialect constructed language, star maps, I have massive character databases just languishing on my computer, I have deleted scenes, short stories, histories, mythology, religions, space ship designs, cultural norms and customs, cosplay, fifty-odd planets over half of which have their own culture and histories, and five distinctive sentient alien species... and I have five books that need to be properly edited and formatted for publication, as well as potential audio books that need recording once the editing has been done... that you can get first dibs at!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(When able, I\u0027ll put a link to a sample of Book One, Rise of Hawk, in here so you can see that I can actually write. On the website: https://davidanaandrake.wordpress.com/01-rise-of-hawk/)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many toys for people to enjoy, while also loaning your enthusiasm to me to do the hard stuff and helping to feed a person on NZ\u0027s version of Disability. Patreon will give me the ability to share the joyous details and fun adventures, maybe some tiny spoilers of secret things, with people who would be interested, people who have experienced oppression and hurt, who would find joy and safety and belonging in TSU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, please, join us! It\u0027s going to be quite a ride!"
