I currently own a baccalaureate in visual arts and I\u0027m also a part-time character designer. Even if costuming has been part of my life since my childhood, my interest for this hobby really began to bloom when I\u0027ve discovered about cosplay and conventions. My biggest dream at that time was to be an artist and a performer. Cosplay allowed me to achieve those two goals, but now that I\u0027m in it for so long, my wish is to bring it to the next level. My dearest dream today would be to become a full-time cosplayer, to be recognized for my work and to inspire people through the passion I treasure since 2011. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy favorite fictional characters to portray are those who I can relate to from their personality and life experience. I also enjoy to perform as characters whose personality and attitude complete mine. They are characters that I love and admire, and some of them are almost like role models for me. I really would like to inspire people to cosplay whoever they want no matter their gender, age, body type, height, skin tone, etc. This has always been my principal cosplay value.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFrom the very beginning, I have been an autodidact costume maker and a dedicated cosplay performer. I\u0027ve competed in many cosplay comp\u00e9titions and I\u0027ve also won several awards and honors in Canada and the USA. The most prestigious of them all was without a doubt to co-represent Canada at the World Cosplay Summit 2016 Championship in Nagoya (JPN) which was an unexpected dream come true for me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhy did I choose Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eI\u0027m basically a Dreamer Believer Cosplayer, but the goals that I\u0027m pursuing come with a high price.\u00a0Since I\u0027m becoming more ambitious every year making bigger/better costumes, money is always a big issue. I know I want to get better at what I do and I want to experiment alot of new things so I can grow and teach my knowledge to other cosplayers. I see Patreon as an opportunity to get help to fulfill my dream to flourish through the cosplay world and maybe become a full-time cosplayer and costumer. Someday, I also would love\u00a0to be able to travel through several different cons around\u00a0Canada and beyond to share many part of my passion with as many cosplayers and cosplay fans as possible. But like all the great artists, success would never be possible without the love of people. It would never be the same without the supporters, family, friends and fans believing in you and enjoying your work. I\u0027ve already receive so much love from you and everytime I\u0027m touched by it and it warms my heart. It would never be the same without you all and that\u0027s why I chosed to create my own Patreon. The help of each and everyone of my patrons could greatly help me to reach my ultimate goal. It might be a very long trip until we get there, but I will never give up and I will keep fighting for my dream no matter what ;) In return for all the support I\u0027ll receive, I shall provide you with increasingly better achievements and fun cosplay content that YOU will have helped me realize \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 I will always owe it all to you and no matter if you decide to become my patron or not, I hope you will keep believing in me ^^\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"margin: 0px; text-align: left; color: rgb(5, 45, 73); line-height: 24px; font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr style=\"margin: 0px; text-align: left; color: rgb(5, 45, 73); line-height: 24px; font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eAlso, complementary rewards will of course be available depending on the tier that you will choose:\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eSigned Cosplay Prints, Exclusive Access to my Upcoming Projects, Exclusive \"Work in Progress\" Photos, Exclusive Digital Cosplay Photos, Exclusive Video Tutorials (Crafting, Makeup, etc.), Cosplay Coaching Services, and MORE!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"margin: 0px; text-align: left; color: rgb(5, 45, 73); line-height: 24px; font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\n\tSo, if you are ready, I welcome you into my world of magic ^^\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.facebook.com/DarkarnivalButler/photos/a.322301027848068.71944.321816711229833/1591476297597195/?type=1\u0026amp;theater\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eHere are the list of all my previous awards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t2012:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best Choreography - Novice (Nadeshicon)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 224, 236);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2013:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best PuppetMaster Presentation + Honorable Mention for the music box - Journeyman (G-Anime)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best Attention to Details - Journeyman (Anime North)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best Presentation - Artisan (Otakuthon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e2014:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Honorable Mention for the Accessories - Artisan (G-Anime)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best in Class - Artisan (Nadeshicon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Most Enchanting Presentation - Journeyman (Costume-Con 32)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best Screen Accuracy - Master (Anime North)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Honorable Mention for the Accessories - Master (Otakuthon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Judge\u0027s Choice Award (Quebec City Comic-Con)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e2015:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Most Enchanting Presentation - Master (G-Anime)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Judge\u0027s Choice Award (Kastucon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best in Class Workmanship - Master (Nadeshicon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Winner of the Canadian Finale of the World Cosplay Summit (WCS 2016)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best Special Effects - Master (Otakuthon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best in Class Presentation - Master (Otakuthon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e2016:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best Craftmanship Award - Master (Katsucon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best Embellishment - Master (Anime North)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best in Class Presentation - Master (Anime North)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e2017:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best Embellishment - Master (Otakuthon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best Interaction with Stage Prop - Master (Otakuthon)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e2018:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best of the Weekend (Katsucon\u0027s Hall Costume Contest)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Best in Show Overall (Katsucon\u0027s Masquerade)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
