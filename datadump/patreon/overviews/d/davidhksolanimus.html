    "summary": "I\u0027m David Klingler, an indie game developer, musician, competitive gamer, thinker. I want to change the world, but in an unusual way. I want to change the world in a way that is supported by the world itself, the patrons that support me directly, because it\u0027s their lives that I want to make better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve come to Patreon. I have supporters for my indie game development, supporters for my Scottish fiddle music, supporters for my gaming, and supporters of just who I am and what I might do in the future. This is a patreon campaign that is almost as much for you as it is for me. I can\u0027t do all I\u0027m here on this earth to do if I don\u0027t have support from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with this whole system, here\u0027s a quick explanation: Pledge a certain amount to my efforts per month, and get the corresponding rewards. Each month I will get what everyone has pledged, and I will be able to continue to create what I\u0027ve pledged to create for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do/what you\u0027re supporting:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m the founder and president of Solanimus Inc., an independent software/game company\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m a Scottish fiddler, having won several awards on both the regional and national levels\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m a competitive gamer, currently holding 64 world records, and have placed or won tournaments for several games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m a composer, having written over 200 tunes, mainly in the Scottish style\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOther things too\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI believe that video games can be much more than they are today. There\u0027s so much potential in the medium that is untapped.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a strong believer in heartfelt, emotional music that isn\u0027t as much about how good the person is but how they can move people\u0027s feelings. I seek to promote the style of music from the golden era of Scottish fiddling, the 18th century. This includes the music of Niel Gow, Robert Mackintosh, William Marshall, and Nathaniel Gow among others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for classic games, and that\u0027s what I play most of the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance.
