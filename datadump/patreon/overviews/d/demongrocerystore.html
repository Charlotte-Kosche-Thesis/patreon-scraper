    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tHello Internet, my name is Anthony AKA DemonGrocerystore and welcome to my wonderful Patreon page. Now lets go over who I am and what I do, to put it simply: I am an editor currently living in California.\u00a0 I specialize in comedy, animation and over the years I have honed my skills by making parodies series.\u00a0 I currently work on a Legend of Korra abridged series, I am the editor for DC Abridged Universe\u0027s Young Justice Abridged, I provide the animation for HawkAbridging\u0027s Saber and Sons series, and I have abridged the entire Code Geass Series (Don\u0027t believe me check out my youtube channel). And now I am the head animator for the pilot \"Frontier 0\" a project that I am very proud to have worked on.\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://ps0gdw.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y4mmGZF1Goy_fE61cUoU6Qd8mK7A8sLoc_YpU7PHTJxckdXruzXaM4h5OF6gsijQj5khEnjQ8WZlD960-DjtuMKryoSiizCDj4Wx6v9njdpdke_nkYBghmTL8P8VvEJgopsF_VgXMTdl8ygHKtwgaX2MP8cLITWXQ8hGa6EwKafeaeT0Ab9btBIZPfdSiTpJkBISnCyO8y05MVEDt2VPZZRFQ?width=660\u0026amp;height=147\u0026amp;cropmode=none\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThat\u0027s Awesome, but why are you here?\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve made quite a few amazing videos over the years and am looking forward to even more awesome projects down the road.\u00a0 However the main issue I\u0027ve had is that I can\u0027t work on them as much as I\u0027d like to because of financial issues. Like everyone else in the world I need to pay bills and eat food to...ya know....live, and that costs money.\u00a0 Most of my animation work takes time to create and all my abridged parody work can not be monetized. I would love to have a job working for an official animation company but for now I\u0027ve had to make due with whatever jobs I can find right now which...well if you\u0027ve seen the job market you know it\u0027s not an easy task. \u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eThat does sound tough? How can we help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe reason I\u0027m starting this patreon is to help cover my basic living expenses and make it so I can spend more time creating parody works and animations. The more donations I receive, the less time I have to spend working at other jobs to pay for food and rent.\u00a0 Which means faster content and higher quality work. Any and all donations are greatly appericiated and of course it is entirely your choice whether or not to become a patron.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eBut what if I can\u0027t donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAll of my videos will still be free to watch on Youtube and Vidme so you will still be able to see all the work I do. However by donating you will have access to rewards such behind the scenes updates, early access to episodes and producer credits depending on which tier you\u0027d like to choose.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI am eternally grateful for any kind of support you choose to give, whether it\u0027s liking or sharing my videos or just telling people able my work. Nothing fills me with more joy than entertaining you all and look forward to making you laugh as much as I can\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t^__^.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aNumXarSNZw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
