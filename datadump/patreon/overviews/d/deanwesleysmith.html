That blog is called \u003cstrong\u003eWriting in Public\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also put up various articles on the Myths of Publishing called \u003cstrong\u003eKilling the Sacred Cows of Publishing\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0I do other series of articles for free as well, including one called \u003cstrong\u003eThe New World of Publishing\u003c/strong\u003e. Plus numbers of other books. And I answer questions about publishing, trying to help fiction writers have more fun with writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been making my living with my fiction writing for over thirty years. I have also been a publisher and an editor. I have written over a hundred novels for traditional publishing and now gaining on another twenty novels for indie publishing. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I make my living with my writing, and I spend a large amount of time doing the helpful articles and blogs on my site for free, it seemed logical to have a place where the free blog could be supported in a very easy way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I hope you support the writing on my site if you get any help at all from it. I do appreciate the support and the comments on various articles. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I hope in some small way I can help you learn how to have fun with your fiction writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers\u003cbr\u003eDean"
