Due to those requests, I have decided to start this Patreon Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not offering any perks for contributions here... I will continue to work with the community as I have for the past few years regardless of contributions here. This is just a way for those who have asked about ways to support my community work to give back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the pleasure of being a part of a fantastic community built from people all over the world, who accept people no matter what their differences are. All of you are awesome and I love being able to support this community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA vast majority of all pledges will go to supporting the hardware and software used to provide services to the community. Pledges also help me justify to my time to my wife, who is fantastic and very understanding... especially when a server issue takes up my time all Saturday afternoon :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease understand that pledges here will not provide any perks. Pledges will not grant anyone preference over Non-Pledges nor will Pledges gain access to services that are not available to the community as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for being a fantastic community!"
