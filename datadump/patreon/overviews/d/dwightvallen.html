The reality I\u0027ve been living in for the past 23 years has been in love with storytelling and its one of the main reason I feel in love with music the ability to convey a beautiful journey in such a little about of time intrigued me. So I tried it! It did it, and I loved it, but it wasn\u0027t enough. I wanted to tell longer stories, and at the beginning of January 2017, I decided that I was going to write my first book in a month to see it I was cut out for it. I can proudly say that I did, in fact, finish writing my first novel in 30 days to my surprise it was 25 days and I\u0027m currently editing it. I say this to make this one statement... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis book Expansion is the first of many this year, and I want to personally thank you for even taking the time to join me on the epic journey of writing my first books and becoming a published writer."
