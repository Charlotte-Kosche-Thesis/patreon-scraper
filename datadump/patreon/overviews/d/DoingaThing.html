These stories range from uplifting and feel good to \nchallenging and thought provoking. Through this Patreon my goal every month is to raise the funds necessary to grow this show in to a widely watched and \nrespected production.

I really don\u0027t have many interests in any other profession. That being said, it is because of you, the patrons, that I am able to pursue my passions in creating and entertaining. From the bottom of my soul, thank you for taking this chance supporting my work in the present and the future. I carry this opportunity with great humility and responsibility. \u003cbr\u003e"
