    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m an artist and costume maker living in the UK, I usually go by my internet handle of \u0027\u003cstrong\u003eDasker\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027 or my company name, \u0027\u003cstrong\u003eBFF/Blue fox fursuits\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46920626/patreon%20divider.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist and crafter I\u0027ve been around since 2008, trying to offer costumes at a reasonable price to people with a lower end budget. I do this because I want to! The idea of opening patreon to fans of my work is to offer something back in return for a little support that helps make my day to day a little easier. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46920626/patreon%20divider2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy making costumes and illustrations, it\u0027s my only source of income and keeping it this way is ideal! Not just for me, but for commissioners, so wait times can stay reduced, and there won\u0027t be another job in my life to take time away from what I enjoy doing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I ideally want to offer through Patreon to patrons is a few things that better the experience for everyone. While some milestones will be available to everyone, others will be exclusives here, such as in depth tutorials, ask sessions via streaming, advice on acting in fursuit to bring your character to life, and the ability for me to start making and casting resin and silicone items to aid starting fursuit makers and anyone else wanting to use resin parts from a more local supplier when overseas shipping isn\u0027t an option. I also want to be the first person to consider and make resin fursuit head bases with glasses wearers in mind. As someone who medically can\u0027t wear contacts, it can be frustrating to not be able to wear resin heads without extensive modifications, and not have optimal vision as a result. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill tutorials be available to everyone?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, they will be! Tutorials will be condensed for easy reading down to key images and important text for everyone, but the in-depth tutorials with small video clips if or when needed will be limited to patrons. Essentially, the tutorials given to patrons will be easy to follow for even a starting artist with basic knowledge, or someone looking to jump into fursuit making. The tutorials given to everyone will be more aimed at intermediate, assuming you know the basics already, as they won\u0027t be explained as clearly as the in-depth tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s this we hear about moving?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was actually the main driving force behind this campaign! Every reward tier on here will get access to the work being done on my work room.  Everyone supporting me until the work room is finished will have their names put into a little art piece to go in my work room, so I can remember everyone who supported me. I hope to start progress on the work room sometime after may! This way you also get to see how your money gets spent on furnishing the workroom and buying tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e~At the moment I\u0027m not in my new home/workspace, and I won\u0027t be until around november. If the resin item milestones get hit, I\u0027ll be sure to make good of them as soon as I\u0027m moved and settled! Something else will be offered in return.~\u003c/strong\u003e"
