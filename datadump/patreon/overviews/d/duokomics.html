I wrote it as a pilot script for an animated series, but I\u0027ve been thinking...Where should I start? And I decided I should start here. Creating this story as an online webcomic, gaining a following, and then trying to put it into print, and then maybe having it produced as an animated series. That is our goal in a nutshell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we have to start somewhere. And we have to start here. With you. Helping us get to a point where we can reach our goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your Donations go Towards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations will go towards...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) The hiring/paying of artists and contributors (because this is a demanding project)\u003cbr\u003e2) The maintenance of our website, Duokomics (we have to pay a fee to keep the site up and running smoothly)\u003cbr\u003e3) Our future goal of putting this comic in print\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy This is Important to Me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only do I find it important to have an African American, female superheroine in comic form, but I also just want to create something that\u0027s wholly mine. I want to put something out there and be proud of it and say \"I did that.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be my own creative boss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to start something from the ground up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to CREATE something successful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly comedic, but entirely real. Please contribute to Duokomics\u0027 Generation Y. Help us get this project off the ground. A new issue will be released every month. With more donations, we can probably churn out more content. So, there\u0027s that as well. Keep us in your thoughts, and if you don\u0027t want to commit to making a monthly donation, you can make a one-time donation to my PayPal.
