    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWitches are shapeshifters, and I am no exception. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch like\nmy magick and mother moon, my writing has waxed and waned over the years,\nswelling and thinning in its importance to my work and my Craft. In May of\n2017, my first published book\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Woman-Most-Wild-Liberating-Within/dp/1608684660\"\u003eWoman Most Wild\u003c/a\u003e (New World Library) was born into\nthe world, and my second book baby (kick-ass title TBA) is due on the Autumn\nEquinox of 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThose\nwho follow my writing on social media know that I produce pretty goddamn prolifically (I\u2019m a Heathen with a renunciate\u2019s work ethic), and, in 2018, I am\nmaking Patreon my primary online writing platform. I will still be submitting to the publications that have supported me and helped me grow my audience these\nlast long years (namely The House of Twigs, Rebelle Society, School of\nWitchery, and WITCH), but what I am cultivating here on Patreon is a wild\ncommunity of those interested in predictable and scheduled content focused on\nthe following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Short stories and tales of rebellious sorceresses, wise crones, and spitfire Witches\u003cbr\u003e~ Wild feminine philosophy and the wild woman archetype\u003cbr\u003e~ Practical magick, wild divination, and eclectic spellcraft grounded in the elements\u003cbr\u003e~ Magickal activism and spellwork for global justice\u003cbr\u003e~ Integration of a living Craft into the everyday life of a busy-bodied Priestess\u003cbr\u003e~ The Celtic Wheel of the Year and the Celtic Pagan pantheon\u003cbr\u003e~ Video content of body prayers and moving rituals (less often, but still...)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e~ Lists of recommended reading and (affordable, moon-specific) must-haves of wild spirituality\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Here and Why Now\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNever\nwill I stop being positively (and sometimes literally) floored by the support\nand stories of those who read my work and somehow see it as a black mirror\nreflection of their own journeys. Never will I stop brewing up blood-and-bone\npoetry and sharp-tongued prose, and never will I stop offering gratitude to\nthose who make my work sustainable in a changing world where the most hunted\nWitch is our planet. I am creating on Patreon in order to free up more time for writing, to raise some funds for my next book tour, to create a more cohesive community of those genuinely interested in what I have to offer (as opposed to diluting my message on social media for likes. Not that I do that, but sometimes I do that), to be able to lend more often to women business owners on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kiva.org\"\u003eKiva\u003c/a\u003e and donate to feminist charities, and (ultimately, honestly) I want to have an epic Witch shop and Pagan retreat center. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than all of that, I am creating on Patreon so I might better entertain and bring a little joy to the Witches, Heathens, and wild hearts of the world. We\u0027re a bitter bunch, after all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat\nyou will find here, regardless of your level of patronage, are words written,\nand written often, by a humble Witch and eternal student on a mission to\nsupport those looking to awaken, honor, and/or revitalize their inner wild\nHeathen. I am interested in a joyful ride on this pleasure planet, and I\nbelieve nature has much to teach us all about living in alignment with these\nspiral dancing cosmos. I believe we are all here to be loving, cunning change-agents who refuse to sacrifice our selfhood in the name of spiritual ascension. I believe we all have a bit of Witch in us, despite our inner puritan\u0027s best efforts to keep her hidden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are seven tiers of patronage, beginning at the\n\u003cstrong\u003eEnchanted \u003c/strong\u003elevel ($1/month) where you receive the monthly Moon-Milk article\ndiscussing the next lunar cycle, a recommended ritual, and practical magick\nrecommendations (Northern Hemisphere). At the \u003cstrong\u003eCharmed\u003c/strong\u003e level ($5/month), you\nreceive the monthly Moon-Milk along with Moon Things, a monthly Witch-curated\nreading list of books, free online content, and magickal tools aligning with\nthe coming moon. At the \u003cstrong\u003eBewitched\u003c/strong\u003e level ($11/month), you receive Moon-Milk,\nMoon Things, and Moon Prayers, a short (semi-autobiographical) story following the life and times of Morgan, an extraordinary Witch with ordinary problems . At the fourth \u003cstrong\u003eSpellbound\u003c/strong\u003e level\n($21/month), you receive all the Bewitched level receives plus an author\u2019s annotation for Moon Prayers (sometimes this will be video, sometimes text). At the \u003cstrong\u003eWild-Eyed\u003c/strong\u003e level ($49/month), you\nreceive all the Spellbound Level receives plus a signed copy of my new book when\nit is released in September and your Witchy questions answered once/month via\nemail. You will also have the opportunity to participate in the Launch Coven for the new book (Participation in this tier is limited). At the \u003cstrong\u003eMoon-Mad\u003c/strong\u003e Level ($99/month),\nyou receive all the Wild-Eyed receive plus a 10% discount on any training or\nworkshop I offer (including yoga teacher training) AND the opportunity to submit requests for Moon Milk article content or a Moon Prayers plot twist (Participation in this tier is limited) AND a signed copy of my first book \u003cem\u003eWoman Most Wild\u003c/em\u003e. Lastly, at the \u003cstrong\u003eHoly Heathen\u003c/strong\u003e Level ($499/month), you\nreceive all the Moon-Mad receive plus a monthly 1:1 chat with me about Witches,\nwriting, and whatnot AND an original painting by me (I also paint, mostly trees, moons, and Dark Goddesses).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
