    "summary": "Hello, my name is Hector Vera. On YouTube, I am known as Denoxkun. I created this patreon account in hopes to get support from the fans that enjoys my video to improve my content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to be able to afford a more professional camera, a room for my own studio and have a better computer dedicated for video editing so I can work much faster and bring better qualities to my videos. But of course all those things costs money and without a job, it becomes hard for me to get more expensive equipment to make the videos I truly want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to have a Elgato Video Capture Cards and other devices to help me make better game reviews to use my own footage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I work with what I have to continue making game reviews, vlog discussions and other content to help other people with great talents but very poor recognition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to do more giveaways but it is also getting hard for me due to the limited funds. I know that if I get enough people to pledge for me and help fund for equipments, I can generate better content for my fans and also give them special priviledges if they choose to pledge. I am not asking for much of course, you give whatever amount you want. :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon I will make a video explaining more in details what my goals are for Patreon. Until then, hope to hear from you all soon.\u003cbr\u003e"
