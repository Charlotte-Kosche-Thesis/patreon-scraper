I love it, especially those nights when I know what I do makes people smile and just for a few hours they can jump around and sing along to stuff they know and enjoy - it\u0027s the best thing ever and I\u0027m extremely grateful I\u0027m able to make my living making people happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am however a creative person and my own music has always been extremely important to me. I love making it and performing it and I\u0027m very blessed to be able to say there are people who love to listen to it. This patreon page is about me trying to be able to do more of my own music and to give people who are interested and want to support me a great way to do that in return for access to my music and extra special rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA huge massive thankyou to my supporters, you are absolutely wonderful and it\u0027s genuinely touching to receive your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope I offer excellent value for your pledges and if you haven\u0027t already then please become a Patron and you will get access to all my music for even the lowest level membership.\u003cbr\u003e"
