    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eI draw, paint, and print abstract artworks dredged from my own surreal mind and share them for all of us to\u00a0enjoy. I\u0027ve always loved drawing and painting but for many years I didn\u0027t think I was talented enough to follow that passion. One day I found a quote by E.B. White \u201cA writer who waits for ideal conditions under which to work will die without putting a word to paper.\u201d\nI realized that this wasn\u0027t just true for writers but for all of us in whatever we set our minds to. I realized that if I didn\u0027t start thinking that what I did was worthwhile no one else ever would. I still get the gut wrenching terror of thinking that I don\u0027t deserve to succeed, but slowly I\u0027m learning to appreciate not only doing art but what I create as well. With each new project I grow as an artist and expand my appreciation for what I produce. This campaign is a way to share that process with all the amazing people who support me. I am beyond\u00a0grateful\u00a0to each and every one of you for helping me to discover this part of myself again. \u00a0Through your support I can follow my dreams and explore this new and exciting chapter of my life.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck me out on Tumblr @ \u003ca href=\"http://surreal-dreams-on-paper.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://surreal-dreams-on-paper.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOr follow me on Instagram @\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/s.a.kehr/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/s.a.kehr/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also sell my artwork!

     "about": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHi, my name is Sean Kehr and I\u0027m a visual artist working in beautiful Portland, Oregon. I draw, paint, and print abstract images. I use found and recycled materials extensively in my creations. In fact many of my pieces are entirely made of salvaged materials including the frames. Giving new life to what would have been waste allows me to experiment and develop new techniques while making a positive impact. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy creative process is largely meditative and reflects my subconscious state rather than design and execution. I have spent years practicing a form of intuitive creation. I try to eliminate my intentions toward the art and instead focus on a conceptual state such as loneliness or isolation. I then allow my thoughts to become the actions of my hands and the result is my interpretation of those meditations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to my printmaking I work primarily in woodcut. Unlike most, each of my prints is an individually finished one of a kind artwork. Some incorporate painting, drawings, or even ink effects making them ideal for collectors of all kinds. Because of this I don\u0027t number my editions preferring instead to let each stand on its own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work has been featured in art publications, donated for charity, and is held in private collections. I\u0027m active online as well as in person and maintain many relationships with artists and enthusiasts around the world. While I hope to grow my national and international following I remain committed to the local art community that has so graciously welcomed me. I hope to continue developing connections and opportunities with Portland\u0027s many amazing artists, galleries, and event hosts. I rarely pass up a chance to collaborate or work collectively with my fellow artists and welcome inquiries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that art is a living process and that each artist learns from exploration and play. With that in mind I constantly try new materials, techniques, and styles. I\u0027m always on the lookout for new and exciting challenges and opportunities for my art to expand in unconventional ways. I take a very similar approach to promoting my art by looking for exciting new ways to make art a bigger part of our day to day lives. My essential goal is to find ways of enhancing both my life and the lives of those I have the privilege to meet along the way through art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a Tumblr for my art at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://surreal-dreams-on-paper.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://surreal-dreams-on-paper.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOr\u003cbr\u003eFollow me on instagram at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/s.a.kehr\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/s.a.kehr\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in the podcast I do check us out at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.philosophicalchaingang.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.philosophicalchaingang.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.philosophicalchaingang.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e",
