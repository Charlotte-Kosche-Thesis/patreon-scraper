     "about": "Daedalic Role-Playing Game System strives to bring the freedom of choice into your table top role playing experience. In Daedalic rpg a character is not forced to choose a class that dictates most of what you do. Instead you choose you a disposition, which makes it easier to take specific powers. From there characters choose from a plethora of powers that become available by having specific skills. With hundreds of power available your character truly becomes a unique hero in your campaign. In the initial setting characters find themselves on the planet Haurn, by the Arcanus Nebula. The nebula itself, is a source of great power, and is home to god-like beings. Characters get to choose from many different races, Humans, robots, beastail, insectoid, \u0026amp; mystical races inhabit Haurn. Each with unique powers \u0026amp; abilities to choose from. A blend of Sci-Fi and Fantasy gives your character access to all the classic powers and abilities you\u0027re use to, as well as new and unique choices. Powers are grouped into 7 base categories: Basic, powers that don\u0027t require and certain skill. General, powers that are not directly combat oriented. Combat, powers that are directly combat oriented. Proficiency, powers that focus on training with specific weapons, and/or armor. Magic, powers that allows you to manipulate arcane or divine energies. Tech, powers that helps you understand and use advanced technology. And. Psychic, powers that allows you to use your mind to gain various powers. Each group of powers, draw from different power pools. This dictates how often a characters can use there abilities. Skills dictates your access to most powers allowing characters to make unique characters. Amazing artwork, and a\u00a0eloquent character builder is on the horizon for Daedalic Rpg. With your support we hope to bring this new role playing system to you in the near future. Thank you for the support, and happy gaming!",
