    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Dan Harris, creator of UK indie comic books\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.atticstudios.website\"\u003eLou Scannon and Druid Investigations and co-Creator of Bruce Outback.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can pretty much be summed up in one image:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UADtE5KxJWg/WJueKoABU2I/AAAAAAAANoo/DdMSEMnOxjMjgAqv-KFxZMcANOE4m-PAgCLcB/s1600/meettheartist.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last few years, I\u0027ve been working as a freelance illustrator working on things ranging from wedding commissions to infographics for pharmaceutical companies to storyboards for tv adverts but what I would REALLY love is to spend more of my time creating comics. Working freelance is hard and sometimes you don\u0027t know where the next job is going to come from or how you\u0027ll get the money coming in during the quiet periods.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m on Patreon to bring you my exclusive-to-Patreon comic \"The Bunker: Tales of the Last Frontiersman\", the story of a young mans quest to explore whats left of the world 150 years after its gone to hell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of a few friends, the Frontiersman hopes to rebuild humanity and make the most of what\u0027s left of the world. Along the way, he encounters a lot of interesting obstacles. From mutants to tech junkies, if it\u0027s dangerous and doesn\u0027t like you very much, the wasteland has it! The story will be a comedy with darker elements as our hero tries to find people who can help with the upkeep of an almost empty Military bunker.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo starting from just $1 you can become a part of the team and get full access to the comic! Maybe at some point even getting to vote on choices the characters may have to make!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can make this comic a regular thing and hopefully you\u0027ll be entertained along the way!\u00a0Updated Mondays and Fridays, if I can achieve the support, I hope to update the comic even more frequently than this! You\u0027ll also have access to my sketches and works in progress and, if there\u0027s the interest for it, tutorials!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$3 Will get you access to the Bunker AND a series of one page comics that I do that will have a variety of themes! Examples of them can been seen at the lower part of this page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are the first 5 pages of \"The Bunker\" for you to get a feel for the comic:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1oi09UEIX5A/WItxYTBjvYI/AAAAAAAANl4/Sok5rcArxesRBzDh0vS-WqEnS_9Lca4uwCLcB/s1600/1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M5Vn1yQfluQ/WIty1u511hI/AAAAAAAANmE/g5NpU53WcZIQ_1zj56KclnqHOgfWnRlcACLcB/s1600/2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R8BaeFhPrAg/WItzFT6M6UI/AAAAAAAANmM/nXAjqpvN13ogoN7hGVVYLmrX3km8Gmo2gCLcB/s1600/3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-317UmR35tkE/WItzQ2_o3XI/AAAAAAAANmQ/jBfMkTv2ZAIH0eOnD19L-U-hXY-OvOeVgCLcB/s1600/4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U2P2fxd2A1Q/WItznXKc3jI/AAAAAAAANmY/N8qWVwONJ5gqNYBxi2tu0oEHLFZYEQS4gCLcB/s1600/5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like this, there\u0027s loads more to come!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some examples pf some of the one page comic strips that I do! these vary in theme and consist of things like the following examples:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Zi1_ScN-Li0/WIt3yDvLGOI/AAAAAAAANm8/OzjsrcZjubcsi94jZ6M76H-TAqPqaRFmgCLcB/s1600/gig%2Bcomic%2Bfinal.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e^^TRUE STORY^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2GFU49EfzEE/WIt2FG-AZDI/AAAAAAAANms/57geDi0UN-Iy_fAx_C3iWyqqk8zVLxTnACLcB/s1600/trek.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve all been made to feel guilty for being ill off work, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9rj4XM6WaT8/WIt2CsC5ThI/AAAAAAAANmo/qHZib7ht-J8wuE1q3u1couf_AqCprChGwCLcB/s1600/May.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople still aren\u0027t sure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kkQ6NgNWnDs/WIt2lppVatI/AAAAAAAANmw/ervVHmTD1cE09IOKw9HMOlK8k-7FsG5lgCLcB/s1600/inauguration%2Bday.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m... not a fan...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo \"The Bunker\" is exclusive to Patreon and won\u0027t pop up anywhere else online, outside of the 5 page preview above.
