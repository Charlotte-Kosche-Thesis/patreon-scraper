Patrons can submit questions and join the live stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3rd Thursday - (unlocked) - Blooper Reel - Did you know that there is stuff that is actually too silly, weird, or inappropriate to make it into our finished podcasts? We didn\u0027t either! Now you can experience these \"bloopers\" first hand in our monthly series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4th Thursday - $5,000 - New Series! If we can get to this milestone, we will produce a new monthly series exclusive to patreon! We are still kicking around ideas, but we are thinking a series of mini-series exploring all sorts of different stuff. The first will be a 10 to 12 episode series set in Mastwick under the rule of Pyre. Michael will run this canonical game set in Drunkeros, and will be joined by Nika, Tim, and Bachmann. After that, who knows?? We will likely have rotating GMs playing whatever game tickles our fancy at that moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about the months with 5 Thursdays you say?? If we can get this going, we will definitely make sure we do something special in March, May, August, and November!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for checking out our page, and we hope you consider becoming our patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The Drunks and Dragons crew"
