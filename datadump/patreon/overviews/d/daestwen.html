Up until now, I\u0027ve been working in studios, on team projects, but this year I am challenging myself. I am going to work on my own project. Entirely devised, realised, and executed by me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAnd this is your chance to help me out!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAfter debating for a while over what project I wanted to go forward with, I\u0027ve decided to run an illustration and short story project. The theme for this will be Tarot, and the idea is to create illustrations based on each of the cards, staring a completely different character for each card - possibly even completely different genres, time periods, you name it. Each Illustration will come with a short story, written by me, centred around that character and their world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy goal is to do at least 12 Illustrations and 12 stories - one every month - though I will be working hard to see if I can up that number. At the moment I am not planning on doing the entire deck, but if this goes well and people are interested, I will reconsider!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhat I am interested in, as an end goal, is having a compilation of images and short stories that could be combined together into a book.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tYou can take a look at some of my past work and my game and tv credits over at my website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.brittnewstead.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.brittnewstead.com\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t-Britt-Lise Newstead\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat kind of genres/time periods/subject matter will be included in the Illustrations?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will likely be focussing on fantasy, sci-fi and historic fiction, but I will be honest - I have a very broad selection of interests. The images and stories as a group are going to be tied together only by the fact that they are all drawn and written by me, rather than by subject matter. So one might be set in Ancient Egypt, the next in a near future asteroid base, the next in a hypothetical lava world where magic really exists. If you are really interested in seeing a particular subject matter, I\u0027ll be letting patreons suggest themes! My main goal is to get a \u003cstrong\u003elarge, diverse range of characters.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0And there will definitely be robots. And dinosaurs. And bird people...\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is the patreon money going toward?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMainly to keep me working and self sustaining without having to put the project on hold to do commercial jobs. If I can make enough doing this, I don\u0027t need to focus on anything else. I have a lot of project ideas outside of this one, so extra funds would go towards kickstarting those - like a fiction pod cast series, for example. Also, if I am making enough, I would like to use a percentage of the funds to \u0027pay it forward\u0027 and commission other artists to join in on the project. Wouldn\u0027t it be cool if the book could have many different art styles?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are you doing per Illustration, and not Monthly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt the moment I expect it will take me at least two weeks per Illustration / story, to get to the polish level that I want. But because for me the end result is more important than the timeline, I want to be able to take an extra week, if necessary, to really get it to shine. Also this means that if I have other jobs that take precendence, or require my attention, I won\u0027t feel like I am cheating people of their money. If I don\u0027t deliver, then you don\u0027t pay. It\u0027s that simple! That being said, if it turns out that I can regularly turn out far more than 1 or 2 a month, I will discuss with current Patreons whether they would prefer I switch to a monthly system.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWhat will the finished illustrations look like?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHere are two examples of my illustration work that resemble what I\u0027m looking to do with the current project.

I will do a character based on your likeness (but not your personality!) for one of the tarot cards. You will be able to suggest which card and what genre you would like best, but ultimately I will make the final decision, in order to make sure you get the most awesome card possible. You will get a high-quality poster-sized print of the card in question, as well as\u00a0Hi-Res Digital copies of every Illustration, Short Stories, access to Patreon-only content including Work In Progress images and stories, my ramblings, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e a bi-monthly postcard of your favourite illustration from that period, hand written and signed by me, as a thank you.\u003cbr\u003e",
