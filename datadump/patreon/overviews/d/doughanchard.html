    "summary": "Welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been involved in Crisis and Disaster Management for almost two decades. I\u0027ve supported and designed information and communications systems used in disaster events since 1998. As technology improved, so have the tools available that can be harnessed to support small and large scale disasters. There are constant demands placed on Crisis and Disaster Management government agencies and non-government organizations (NGO\u0027s). I and 5 others have decided to create a new non-profit organization - Digital Disaster Relief Support or DDRS. The organization will be headquartered in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Together with Kyla Matias (Philippines), Dominik Linge (Germany), Gerhard Jakel (Germany), Frederic Jakobi (Germany), Nguyen Ho (Vietnam) with volunteers in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Italy, United States we have begun a new journey that needs your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to advance informative news and technology used the disaster environment through education, virtual knowledge transfer, training, and documented lessons learned in crisis and disaster events that have occurred throughout the world. I do this through lectures and seminars held worldwide at special events and Training Academy\u0027s focused solely on Civil Protection. We publish, curate and write articles and post links on technology news and disaster events on Google Plus and Flipboard, that anybody can review, comment and read for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe often spend 25 to 30 hours a week researching white papers, online news portals, and specialty blogs which specialize in this field, then curate them into a single source location where professionals and disaster volunteers can read and comment on what we have found. We will be expanding into other important disaster challenges that need solutions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe group has decided to focus on four key areas of Crisis and Disaster Management; \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Crisis \u0026amp; Disaster Management - the environment\u003cbr\u003e2) Technology and Applications - Platforms, Software, sensors\u003cbr\u003e3) Disaster event - earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes\u003cbr\u003e4) Post event lessons learned - what did and did not work. Gaps \u0026amp; Analysis\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe crisis and disaster management experience is always unique and rarely duplicated. Every crisis or disaster has its challenges and scale of response. We learn from every one and attempt to recognize where obstacles and new approaches can solve problems.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe editorial, sorting and compiling of information is currently done in our free time. We have not accepted corporate or government sponsorship or advertising space in any of the the articles, papers and books that we have written and redistributed for them for free. We have received positive feedback regarding content, analysis and topics covered. But your help would be appreciated. By donating and supporting DDRS through Flipboard and our Google Plus Community blog, the publishing information can be analyzed and critiqued, allowing everyone to remain neutral and not be influenced or in conflict on any news article, event or technology analysis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe post 5 to 6 times weekly, often 3 to 4 times daily in the Crisis and Disaster Management Magazine on Flipboard and 3 to 4 times a week on Crisis and Disaster Management Education and Training Community site on Google Plus. We will create new applications, services and information delivery solutions using Open - Big Data in concert with new ways in understanding how to process and analyze content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have held Google Hangouts and interviewed numerous experts in Crisis and Disaster Management. We plan to do more and with your help, invest more time to offer extensive investigations and interviews with leaders in disaster response. With crowd sourced help, I believe we can deliver enhanced information, references, lessons learned, technology analysis and enhanced education programs that can support improved disaster response. Ultimately, it\u0027s about how we can globally improve disaster preparedness and response to save lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
