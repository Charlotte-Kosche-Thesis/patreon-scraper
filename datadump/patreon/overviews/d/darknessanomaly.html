As an artist / developer, I want to convey a message through this medium that is important to me. Through my game, you will walk the path of those who have been affected by violence, alcohol abuse, bullying, suicide. The impact such abuse has on the psyche of a child is unmeasurable. And yet, it happens every day in this world and the reasons and motifs are as complex and deep as the people who are affected by them. Victim or perpetrator, witness or accuser - more often than not we feel we know the difference between right or wrong.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBut the truth is always more complicated than it seems.Nothing is ever just black or white.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tYes, Darkness Anomaly is a horror game. But it\u2019s also so much more, as it gives me the opportunity to trespass into unknown territory; to present an immersive experience that makes you live through the story rather than standing by and watch.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tDarkness Anomaly doesn\u2019t rely on jump scares to create a threatening experience; the premise is paranoia and concern, the fear of the unknown. Following this premise, even daring situations are rarely solved with knives and bullets. Your mind needs to be razor sharp as your reflexes and curiosity is key - yet, you have to be careful to not be the cat that\u2019s killed by it. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThere\u2019s imminent danger and also very immediate threats you have to face. Things can go wrong, quickly, and most of the time your own actions are what leads to your own ascendance or demise. Make your own choices, unravel the mystery or chose to be blind and bash your way through - the path is open.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe choice is yours.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eQUICK FACTS:\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/b\u003e\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eGENRE: HORROR | ADVENTURE\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eGAMEPLAY: SINGLEPLAYER | VR SUPPORT | ACTION | RIDDLES\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eLENGTH: 20-25 Hours\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003ePLATFORMS: STEAM | GOG | WINDOWS STORE | XONE\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eLANGUAGE: ENGLISH | GERMAN | RUSSIAN | CHINESE (eventual)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eRELEASE DATE: TBA\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
