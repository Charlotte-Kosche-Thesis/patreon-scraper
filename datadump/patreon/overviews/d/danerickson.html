    "summary": "So for the last 20 years i have been writing. One wise lady once said that your first million words writing are rehearsal. I think I am into my third million.\u00a0 I wrote these words down and Behold! I became Bigsqueezer, writer of stories of fight and the sensual nature of wrestling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I pushed into stand up comedy, slam poetry and science fiction. Bringing all my thoughts and training of science and philosophy, desire and anatomy, theology and stand-up comedy, muscle and power, I bring stories about the things men discover while trying to understand their complex insistent urges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I am a creator evolving. For the last 20 years I have been a whitesmith with Dragonspawn Crafthall and the head of sales and manufacturing or corseted fashions at Xcentricities in Albuquerque. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve met me online, and at science fiction, anime, comic book, and adult conventions as I sold corsets. I probably tried to tie you in a corset. you saw me on stage at poetry slams and if you live in Albuquerque, you saw me doing so many things it gets hard to talk about it all. but right now I am again changing. This is the year i make it work and I have a plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your contribution of just $5 a month, what we\u0027d spend at Starbucks talking together you can help me get the work done. I have an editor and several connections to publishing houses. I am working on paying artists for cover art and paying that editor. If you can give me a year of support, I will bring you 4 books. I will also be posting commentaries and stories here that no other literate human will be able to see. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on this - let\u0027s get started!\u003cbr\u003e"
