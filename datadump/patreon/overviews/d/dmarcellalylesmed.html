I am also a certified in the areas of: Cuddle Party Facilitation, Our Whole Lives Sexuality Education, Triadic Model Approach to Surrogacy Partners and Professional Cuddling (one-on-one). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always pursued an interest in Human Sexuality and I find the topic \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003efascinating\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 I\u0027ve always known that I was a bit different than other people. As a younger person concepts like monogamy and treating those were are sexually different, seemed odd and often confusing to me. Sex was always something that I had an interest in knowing more from the logical and practical aspects. While people were discussing kissing and who they had slept with, I was far more concerned about their feelings and thoughts behind the sex that they were having. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up,\u00a0 sexuality education was accessible and accepted in my home. Many girls didn\u0027t know about their bodies and they would come to me to have conversations that their parents wouldn\u0027t have with them. It\u0027s easy to say that I\u0027ve been doing this work my ENTIRE LIFE and now Patreon is helping me create a way to make that knowledge accessible to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you join my Patreon you are getting well thought out, authentic and empowering conversations about sex and sexuality that you may not find anywhere else. I am sharing more than bits about bits. My commitment is that your thoughts, ideas and personal relationship to sexuality is transformed to bring healing, power and freedom by working with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that the work I\u0027m doing is important and it has value. There are Sexuality Educators who charge much more for their time, training and expertise. and perhaps one day I will. However, I know that healing the harm done in society comes by way of making sexuality education accessible, easy to digest, comfortable to participate in and available on demand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a wonderful platform for this balance. Your contribution to my Patreon allows you to save time, ask questions and learn while having fun. You are also providing me the support I need to continue developing the resources you want. It truly is a win-win!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not sure when you\u0027ll #JoinMyPatreon, I only know that when you do you\u0027ll become part of my community. A community designed to transform the world, one orgasm at a time. I look forward to working with you and making the world we live in happier, healthier and more sex positive, because we can! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove well and Live well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eD Marcella Lyles, MEd \u003cbr\u003edmarcellaylesmed@gmail.com \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
