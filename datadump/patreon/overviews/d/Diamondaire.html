    "summary": "Hello there, some of this may be quite hard for me to talk about but I feel that if you are willing to offer me money.. then you need to know exactly where the money will be going. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell as of lately, financially I am now unable to stream or at least stream as much as I would like. Situations at home are quite tough not only for me but both me and my Mother who I live with. Money is tight and we sometimes struggle to pay for the things that keep us ticking.. That being, Electric, Gas for heating and sometimes just to eat. Now some people might say why don\u0027t you two get jobs, well thats where the problem comes in...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mother has suffered from two strokes in the past meaning she is unable to work. So she can\u0027t earn more money than she is being given for not being able to\u00a0physically work. Then with me, I suffer from Anxiety and I can\u0027t do anything along the lines of work without becoming physically ill and making myself unavailable to work.\u00a0\u00a0So with these factors in place, its hard to sometimes get by and live out lives as we would like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow this is where things get a little hard for me to talk about as this is quite personal.. but I also suffer from mild depression. Now, me saying it is mild might not seem that bad but when situations get tough at home it makes it 100 times worse than it normally is. The current situation not helping that what so ever... Streaming my games whether that be speedrunning or just playing games casually, it takes my mind off everything that may be going on in my life. It cheers me up and brings me back up to the high spirits I\u0027m sure most of you have seen when you have tuned into watch. So by making it possible for myself to stream it will help me battle whatever may be going on at that current time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow this might just seem like I am setting this up so I can have \"fun\" and stream for the sake of streaming.. but that is far from the truth. Any money that I receive will be hugely and I mean massively appreciated. It will help us with all of what I have mentioned above and make our lives that much more better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do wish to give me money then I thank you will all of my heart, it would mean the world to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGareth Dunn / Diamondaire.\u003cbr\u003e"

Well I\u0027m a 20 year old who lives in the North East of England. I\u0027m currently studying Game Design in my hopes of being a game creator in the near future! I plan to go University to get my degree and see where that takes me! I plan to make projects of my own in the near future with some friends or even some individual projects. Mainly I\u0027ve been involved around sport my whole life. Growing up from a family who was involved in sport heavily and mainly in cricket. I played it to a high standard with the potential to go all the way and play for England. Unfortunately that did not happen but I still do play for my local club. My other main hobby is gaming. I\u0027ve always been involved with it one way shape or form throughout my life whether that just be playing casually, competing competitively, making videos and posting them to YouTube and lastly, livestreaming onto Twitch. That is what I mainly do now and enjoy doing so very much! Okay, this was quite long winded but hey, its pretty much all you need to know about me... So yeah!\u003cbr\u003e",
