I want to make work that helps people who feel lost and monstrous to be less alone, and explores strange, lonely, and fantastic futures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e You can read the first of these, Starship Heart,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thewomanwhowasthursday.com/comic/starship-heart-1/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e: it\u2019s about defining yourself by what you do, and feeling like there\u2019s a hole in your heart that\u2019ll never be filled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m excited to use this patreon to bring a lucky few behind the curtain of my developmental process with sketches, character notes, story ideas, and more. My next big project is \u003cem\u003eSomething Good\u003c/em\u003e. Stories about editing memories always end with a moral about how it\u2019s wrong and dangerous. This one doesn\u2019t end like that. What if we\u2019ve all been editing memories all along. A sci-fi story about 2 queer girls in a dark wood. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking Great Work By Queer Artists Even Better\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my solo work, I\u2019m also a dialog writer/copy editor. I\u2019ve worked with Alex Zandra on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://zandravandra.itch.io/squidmaids\"\u003eher Light Novel projects\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u2019m the editor for Bitmap Prager\u2019s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ashenprincess.com/\"\u003eAshen Princess\u003c/a\u003e, and Emily Riesbeck on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bluevalkyriecomic.tumblr.com/\"\u003eBlue Valkyrie\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy solo work is more like wild flights of fancy, but my copy editing is all about sound mechanics: I help find the right word for the right space, cut to the point, and trim off excess and confusion. There are so many incredible artists working in games and comics right now, and I want to support them however I can: your dollars get me closer to making a real career out of this, and let me off my services at a sliding scale for creators that can\u2019t afford standard rates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e...Okay, I\u2019m ready to admit I need help\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, most of my time is spent at the demanding job that supports my household and family: I\u2019m lucky to steal a few hours every week to work on my own projects. But here\u2019s the thing: I have so much more that I want to work on than can fit into those few hours. Every cent gets me closer to the point where I can make my work, and my interactions with my audience, the priority it deserves to be! More comics! More editing! And more cosplay photo shoots!"
