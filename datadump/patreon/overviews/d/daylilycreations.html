I love Art. I love teaching and inspiring others. I\u0027m a homeschool mom of four who is super excited that it\u0027s actually possible to set up my own online classroom and finally do what I love but be my own boss! No more proctoring for standardized tests! No more subbing for math class! No more lunch duties or carpool lines! Just Art all the time! Woo hoo!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nIn this classroom\u003c/strong\u003e, we will learn the fundamentals and beyond of Visual Arts. Topics that span many media, genre, skill and history will be covered. Each month a different topic/media/period of art history/skill set, etc. will be the focus. Each week a short lecture and an assignment will be given on Tuesdays. Each Thursday I will post follow up tutorials and helpful hints. You will receive an email notifying you of all of my posts. I will be available in the chat to comment on your work in progress or completed work. You will also be able to chat with other students building community and the all important critique muscles in a bully-free zone.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nWhat is offered here is meaty enough for full credits for homeschoolers, provided that you {the student} check your state credit requirements and fulfill the number of hours.\u00a0\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nLevels are divided for Middle School and High School students\u003c/strong\u003e. The High School level will start off assuming that the student has some basic knowledge and love for Visual Arts. If not, you can always start at the Middle School level and there\u0027s no shame! It takes humility and that takes a brave and wise person! The Middle School level will be taught on a beginning level. Think sixth or seventh grade. If you are a middle schooler who loves art and is a self-starter than you are welcome to challenge yourself in the High School class (just be sure to sign up for that one).\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nParents\u003c/strong\u003e, if you are interested in me providing a one on one 30 minute tutoring session each week and grading your students\u0027 work- that is available in the $45 per month bracket. At that level, I will work with you to make sure to offer what your student needs to fulfill your state requirement for Art/Elective. I will also offer college and career guidance and write college recommendations for your student provided that they have been on this level with me for at least six months, as well as your student having access to all other materials; lectures, assignments, tutorials and community feedback.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nFor parents who\u003c/strong\u003e just want to know that your budding artist is being challenged in a positive, encouraging environment but you still maintain all authority when it comes to your curriculum requirements- you will receive all lectures, assignments, tutorials/helpful hints and community feedback monthly for $10 per month. $10 for Middle School and/or $10 for High School.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for visiting this site.
