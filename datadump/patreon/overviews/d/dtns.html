He loves telling people the stories they need to know and bring together the insight and context to understand what it means. He leads a team of award-winning independent tech podcasters, including his Co-Host and tech veteran Sarah Lane, who love working with the audience to make the show better. If you want that kind of show too please consider pitching in. If everybody in the audience gives a nickel a show-- that\u0027s $1 a month-- we\u0027ll stay in solid shape. Give 25 cents a show, or $5 a month, and the show can really grow, improve, and add more contributors. Plus the people who can\u0027t afford the nickel don\u0027t have to feel bad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t the only way to help. Reviewing the show on iTunes and elsewhere, telling others about the show, just listening and emailing are other ways if you can\u0027t afford a nickel. But if you can, we hope you\u0027ll consider backing us here. Thanks for helping us make a\u00a0great show.\u003cbr\u003e"
