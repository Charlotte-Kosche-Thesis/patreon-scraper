     "about": "Delay In Block Productions was founded on November 26, 2011 by Michigan railroad enthusiant, Drayton Blackgrove as way to share his railroad videos and photos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFamiliar with YouTube and savy with social media, Blackgrove began uploading his railroad content under the YouTube Channel \u201cDelayInBlock,\u201d a name derived from the railroad rule that states: \u201cIf you stop or slow your train below 10mph, you have to be prepared to stop at the next signal.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Blackgrove\u2019s hometown of Jackson, Michigan, the Amtrak depot\u2019s platform had two Delay In Block signs, which remind the engineers on the Amtrak line of the rule when stopping to load passengers at CP Jackson. The signs were initialed \u201cDIB,\u201d which so happened to be Blackgrove\u2019s full initials. Inspired by the signs, Blackgrove decided to name his YouTube Channel after the rule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, Delay In Block Productions became a legally licensed company and is now a leader in the railroad and railfan media production business. Blackgrove\u2019s company emerged from a small YouTube channel, receiving about 300 views per day, to a massive media outlet, with over 24,000 subscribers and nearly thousands of Facebook followers. Delay In Block Productions is also the owner of the popular YouTube Channel \u201cTrainsForChildren,\u201d which receives over 1.5 million views every month (on averages based off of 2014).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, Delay In Block Productions is known for producing short, informative railroad documentaries on YouTube, while offering more feature-length content on their website, in the form of DVDs and digital downloads. Daily railroad photos are posted on the company Facebook\u2019s profile, proudly showcasing the work of over thirty professional railroad photographers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to YouTube videos, in 2015, RFD-TV plans on airing some of Delay In Block Production\u2019s upcoming railroad documentaries on their popular \u201cTrains \u0026amp; Locomotives,\u201d TV show. Stay tuned for updates in the news section on our website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDelay In Block Productions is currently offering media production services for several railroad companies in the Midwest.

Because of the increasing loss in revenue, it has become difficult to offer free content of such high production value on YouTube. However, in the digital age, railfans are not willing to spend $30 on the latest DVD release from their favorite production companies. However, we have discovered that our most loyal subscribers are willing to support us by making small, monthly contributions through Patreon. These contributions allow us to compensate for such great loses in revenue that is caused by YouTube\u0027s change in site algorithms and the frequent usage of AdBlock by our viewers. We appreciate your support and pledge to continue producing the highest quality railroad media on the internet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDrayton Blackgrove\u003cbr\u003eOwner, Delay In Block Productions\u003cbr\u003e",
