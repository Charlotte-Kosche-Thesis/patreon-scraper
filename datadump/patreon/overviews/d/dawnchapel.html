I used a domain name I\u0027d already registered for another project, and for a few years I was getting pretty good at it! \u00a0 I found that the stories I was telling were resonating with people in ways that I did not expect. \u00a0Soon I developed a method to do these comics with watercolor, a medium I\u0027m very fond of using.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eAfter completing a few short stories and a few one-off pages (some that have to my astonishment gone\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dawnchapel.com/2010/07/firefox-has-crashed/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecrazy viral\u003c/a\u003e), I decided it was time for me to try something more ambitious - to start building a world with continuity, and telling long-form, sweeping stories exploring that world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Way Back\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe first of these is a story centering on an opossum named Pedro, who just wants to take a nap.

You determine the amount you\u0027re willing to contribute per page, and select from the list of rewards below for signing up.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can set a monthly cap for your pledges, and if you\u0027re supporting several projects on Patreon, all of the pledges for projects you support are charged in one lump sum.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWhy are the pledges for this project set per page, instead of per month?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t always produce a page a week, and by pledging per page, if I don\u0027t post new material, I don\u0027t get paid.  I\u0027d feel pretty guilty if you pledged to support a month of comics and I let a week slip.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eIf I pledge $1/page and set my monthly cap at $1/month, do I still get all the stuff at the $1/page tier?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, absolutely.
