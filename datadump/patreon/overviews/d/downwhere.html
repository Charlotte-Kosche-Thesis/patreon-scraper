    "summary": "Hey everybody this is Downwhere. I have been thinking about\ntrying this for a while and I\u2019ve decided to give it a shot.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m not happy with how my life is going. I feel like I keep\ntrying to do what I\u2019m supposed to do instead of what would make me happy. The\nonly thing I\u2019ve ever been good at is creating things to make my friends and\nsometimes random people on the internet laugh.  People have told me that I need to find a job\nthat I enjoy doing, something that motivates me. I\u2019ve been making audio\ncommentaries and gaming videos for over ten years. This is what I like to do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are options now for people to make things like this\ntheir job, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to try to do. With patreon, you can donate\nmoney to someone in exchange for their work. First of all, whether this works\nor not I will continue making videos even if nobody decides to donate. I think\nthe first option for donating is 1 dollar a month. If every subscriber on my YouTube\nchannel donated a dollar a month, that would be about what I make right now\nfrom my job. Of course that isn\u2019t a realistic goal yet. I have no illusions of\nquitting my job and doing this full time anytime in the foreseeable future.\nIt\u2019s something to works towards and I feel motivated to attempt it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI realize that in the\npast I have not been good with a schedule of releasing new content. With the\nadded motivation of this being a potential actual job, I intend to not only\nhave a set schedule of when new stuff comes out, but to work on improving the\nquality of my videos by doing additional editing. I have always wanted to learn\nhow to edit videos better and I intend to do it. I think most of the stuff I\nwould want to do could be done in something simple like windows movie maker. I\ndabbled a bit in the past with things like this in some of my Witcher 2 videos\nwhere I censored the nudity with ridiculous images. That was fun and something\nI will be trying more of.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSince I am still working a full time job while I do this, I\nwon\u2019t have a ton of time to schedule for my videos. Depending on how this goes,\nI may be able to devote a lot more time to this. Here is my planned schedule\nthat I will be sticking to for now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTwitch streaming\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be doing Twitch streaming at \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/downwheretwitch\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/downwheretwitch\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTuesday 7pm \u2013 9pm\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWednesday 7pm \u2013 9pm\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFriday 7pm \u2013 9pm\u003cbr\u003e(Times are\u00a0United States central time zone)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI will record these twitch streams and upload them to YouTube.\nI will be able to talk to you guys in the chat while I\u2019m playing different\ngames. I have some games that I could play with the audience if there\u2019s\ninterest. Otherwise I\u2019ll just be playing a single player game like Deus Ex\nMankind Divided like I have been doing recently.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAsshole Edition videos\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsshole Edition videos\u00a0will be released every Sunday at \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/downwhere\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/downwhere\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with the Asshole Edition series I\nwill give you a short description. I play an RPG style game that lets you make\nmoral choices and I choose all the asshole ones. I usually call my character\n\u201cManshizzle\u201d which is a reference to a video I saw a long time ago from another\nYouTube guy called Black Hero. I have done AE videos for several games already\nincluding the Dragon Age series, Mass Effect series, Fallout series, and many\nothers. To answer your question, no I am not a huge asshole in real life. This\nis me playing a character and having a lot of fun doing it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWarcraft commentaries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf there\u2019s demand for it, I can start doing Warcraft 3 audio\ncommentaries again. That was how I got started doing this stuff on the internet\nand how most people discovered me in the first place. I made audio commentaries\nfor a website called wcreplays.com which is still around by the way. The videos\non my YouTube channel with the highest total views are all Warcraft 3 related,\nso maybe people still want those.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePeople have been very generous to me in the past and have\ndonated money to help me get better equipment like the PVR capture device I use\nto record my console gaming videos. I am extremely grateful to these people. I\nunderstand that everyone has bills to pay and probably doesn\u2019t have money to\ngive to a guy making wacky YouTube videos. That\u2019s fine. Like I said before,\neven if nobody decides to donate or become a patreon supporter, I will continue\nto produce content. If you feel like contributing money to help me do this,\nthat\u2019s great. This is the only thing I\u2019ve ever been passionate about in my life\nand I intend to finally try and pursue it as a job. Maybe it will work, maybe\nit won\u2019t. Either way I appreciate all the support you guys have given me over\nthe years. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
