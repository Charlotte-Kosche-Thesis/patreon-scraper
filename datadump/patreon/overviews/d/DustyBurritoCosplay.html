My very first costume was Kairi from Kingdom Hearts 2. I remember my mom driving me to Savers so I could purchase what I needed. Being the pubescent teenage girl I was, my excitement could not be contained though I had no idea how cosplaying would affect my life a few years later. 6 years later, I have made literally hundreds of friends that share my same interests and have developed relationships that I envision lasting a lifetime. Cosplaying and playing the part as a character, along with creating the costume, has become such an enriching and positive experience for me that its hard to believe that there is negativity in the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThat said, there is quite a bit of negativity in our community\u003c/h4\u003eThe sad reality is that we can\u0027t 100% erase that negativity, however, we can absolutely shed positivity on this vibrant and wonderful community. My goal as a cosplayer is to make sure everyone I interact with feels good about themselves at the end of the day, that they know that they are loved and appreciated for what they do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\"Those are pretty words and all, but what do you plan to do?\"\u003c/h4\u003eEvery week I will be uploading a video to Youtube that features a different cosplayer and highlights the positive things about them, including costumes they have worked on, their background in cosplay, achievements, and their social media links. I hoping to record and upload my first video by the mid April 2018 and go from there. Monthly pledges will be going towards video equipment such as a decent quality video camera and a mic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\"What else is my hard earned money going towards?\"\u003c/h4\u003eMy secondary goal is to start a tutorial series for cosplayers (makeup, armor, detailing, wig, etc). Funding will also go towards supplies (makeup, heat gun, craft foam/wonderflex/worbla, etc). At the moment I commission the majority of my costumes and would like to start creating my own, so pledges would go towards materials such as fabric and the obvious- a sewing machine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027m really excited about starting this new chapter in my cosplay career and appreciate every single supporter (both financially and emotional supporters). Any suggestions, advice or questions, don\u0027t hesitate to contact me! \u0026lt;3\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e"
