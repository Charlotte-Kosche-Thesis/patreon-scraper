    "summary": "Hey there friends and readers, tattoo clients, church people, collectors of my art, and random guy who clicked on the wrong link. \u00a0A lot of people who have read my various blogs and things over the years have encouraged me to write a book, and I\u0027m finally heeding their call. \u00a0I\u0027d like to get in the habit of writing every day so that I can eventually write the many books I have brewing in me. \u00a0I know what about 8 of those books would be, but I\u0027m starting with a daily devotional. \u00a0I\u0027m hoping to offer a unique approach to daily scripture meditation, reflection, and spiritual practice that helps people form their whole person, living their whole life as a prayer. \u00a0Too often we have separated \"prayer life\" from \"life\", but I believe that God takes our whole life as a prayer: how we shop, and exercise, and think, and create art, and play, and hang out with people. \u00a0It\u0027s all a manner of response to our Creator and our experience of ourselves as his beloved. \u00a0I believe God wants to transform every part of our lives into a more whole expression of his wild creativity, his compassionate heart, and his intimate voice to all of creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not the fastest writer. \u00a0I go deep. \u00a0I sit and stare at the screen. \u00a0I think and pray as I write. \u00a0I delete pages and paragraphs and start over. \u00a0I try to figure out how to bring things alive with stories from my life that are sometimes pretty hard to tell. \u00a0All of that takes time that I could be using to make money somewhere. \u00a0I\u0027d prefer to offer this out there for free, and in the collaborative space of the internet, so that I can engage with questions and comments from people. \u00a0So in order to do this right, I need some help. \u00a0Please consider supporting me in this effort!"
