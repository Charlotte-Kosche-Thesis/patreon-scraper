    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://www.the-whiteboard.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Whiteboard\u003c/a\u003e is, if you can believe it, a vaguely-paintball-themed webcomic featuring a grumpy polar bear with a penchant for malletry, an excitable raccoon who once converted a large portion of the local bar directly into beer using a homemade replicator, and an arctic fox who hooked a taser up to a bullwhip so he could keep unruly players in line. It also features zombies, an automatic refrigerator-crushing machine, several nuclear reactors and at least two characters that occasionally get stapled to the ceiling.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYeah, I know. And I produce it willingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is not, however, my Day Job. My day job is as a machinist, under \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.docsmachine.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDoc\u0027s Machine\u003c/a\u003e- that\u0027s right, I make custom paintball guns for a living.\nThe machine shop and the products I make pay the bills, but the comic is done just for fun. Which is where you come in- it would be very nice if the hours I spend on the strip, could \n\u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e help pay the bills. Patrons would in effect be helping support both aspects- the creation of more awesome comics, and the creation of more amazing paintball gear.\nUnlike many webcomic artists, I can\u0027t say I\u0027ll be quitting my job to do the comics full time, if the partronage got over a certain point. I enjoy both jobs too much to quit. But I will say that the more patrons join in, the more extras I can produce- like additional strips, more books and reprints of the previous ones, and more artwork in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
