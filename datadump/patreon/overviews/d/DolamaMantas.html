    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHello and thank\nyou for reading these lines. You probably already know me from my youtube\nchannel that I have had for about 9 years now.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nSo you probably remember me from a hardcore Simple Hermit living in the\nLithuanian woods with long hair and speaking about God and divine ecstasy. I\nwas about 20 years old back then and I was in a very intense spiritual search,\nmy search for enlightenment. I didn\u2019t care about anything else and I just\nmeditated, fasted and did different types of spiritual yoga while living alone\nlike a hermit in a village in a house of my grandmother and in the forest\nduring the summer and when possible. Meditation and practices I did were\ntransforming me from the inside making me understand many things about myself\nand life, remember things from my previous lives and have spiritual experiences\nand expansion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDo you remember of how much I wanted to go to the Himalayas and live in a cave\npracticing yoga? You knew I was serious, right? In fact, the reason I started\nout on youtube is because I wanted to go out so badly and I knew I will not\ncome back (to the world). I thought I would stay in some cave meditating for\nthe rest of my life and see no people anymore. That is why I wanted to give out\nand share my spiritual experiences and advices before I leave. This is why I\nstarted my YT channel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have not done many videos while I traveled around Himalayas in India and\nNepal because I didn\u2019t have a camera, I bought it later in Nepal. But, believe\nme, it wasn\u2019t easy to find my perfect cave in the Himalayas. Looking back then\nI sometimes wonder how I managed to stay alive because I was just too extreme,\nI was always ready to pay my life for whatever I felt right. People called me\nMountain back then because I was so much in love with them (mountains, not\npeople) that I gave me this name. My actual birth name Mantas, actually, sounds\nquite similar too. And while people were always forgetting name Mantas they\nwould always remember my self-imposed name Mountain.\u003cbr\u003e\nA phrase from these days \u00a8Mountain is on the mountain\u00a8 comes to my mind now as\nI smile. I used to spend my time in my mountains all alone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMany people do not know how to call me now. They knew me as a Simple hermit,\nthen Mountain, then Dolama, now they see me ending every email I write with\nDolama Mantas. So another question would be where this Dolama comes from? \u003cbr\u003e\nMy name Dolama is another beautiful story for me. Where should I start it?.. So\nbasically I was undergoing some spiritual changes within me while in the\nHimalayas. I was obsessed about my cave and being a hardcore yogi living to\nreach ultimate liberation. But everytime I would go with a decision to never\ncome back I would sense a strange pain deep in my being. I felt bad about\nleaving people.. I felt that world is suffering and that I can help it with\nlove I have learnt on my spiritual path. I actually felt like \u00a8being a mother\nthat wants to leave her children\u00a8.  I am\nno mom (I am a man) but this is how the feeling was. \u003cbr\u003e\n I felt kind of stupid about myself\nbecause everytime I would go to the mountains I would feel like I have to be\nwith people and shining my spiritual light to them. But everytime I would go\ndown and be with the people I would instantly crave to go to my mountains and\nmeditate for MY OWN ENLIGHTENMENT instead. It was balancing between two\nextremes and for me it was frustrating, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I came to the\nHimalayas and I am ready and wanting to leave everything behind and never come\nback, spend the rest of my life meditating alone or die from cold, hunger or\nbeing eaten by some wolves. I was perfectly fine with all that. But this inner\nfeeling would not let me go and do my thing.. \u003cbr\u003e\nIn the course of several months of this intense spiritual process I said to\nmyself \u00a8I have had enough\u00a8. I got a tattoo on my left arm saying \u00a8Dolama\u00a8 in\nTibetan. To make the long story short, Dolma for Tibetans is \u00a8a mother of\ncompassion\u00a8. I accepted to myself that I will not take my life just to get\nMYSELF enlightened but help others with my spiritual light too and this is what\nthe tattoo meant for me to remind. The funny thing (that was not so funny back\nthen) is that instead of Dolma the tattooist wrote Dolama, he did a mistake.\nThis is why I became Dolama.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe tattoo had changed my life. Mountain descended from the Himalayan mountain\nand found a Swiss girl traveler, fell in love and followed her to her country\nand later to South America where they had separated. \u003cbr\u003e\nPeople started to call Dolama Mountain a hippie-hermit because I would go and\nmeditate in the mountains for some months and then teach yoga and meditation in\nsome city, go traveling around South America this way without getting attached\nto anyplace and anybody. A lot of hitchhiking, meditating and being with a lot\nof different people. I have learnt to mix the extremes and sincerely, I LOVE IT!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI continued to evolve this way and learnt many things. I have studied and\npracticed shamanism and healing with Master Plants in Peruvian jungle and did a\nridiculously many meditation retreats in different places in the nature but\nalso spent a lot of time with different people and learnt how to deal with\nthem.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA big life changer was the birth of my son Kori. I stopped traveling and\nwandering like a hippie-hermit. I got established in Peru as a yoga teacher and\na guide on spiritual tours-retreats and yoga workshops.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd this is\nwhere I am today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, during all these years I have continued with my youtube channel where\nI would post from time to time something from my travels, meditations or\nwhatever I felt like sharing. This is how now I have about 800 videos on my\nchannel. Wow, that is a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI AM in love with my viewers and a lot of them are my great friends. Some\npeople had visited me or attended to my tours and retreats in Peru (where I am\nliving now). And from time to time somebody would donate me some money and that\nwould help me during my wanderings. It would happen occasionally but I would\nspend very not much money so I could go for a long run. \u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, being a dad is different and it requires more money. That is why the\nlast 3 years I was mostly teaching yoga in Lima, capital of Peru. Even though I\nwas-am making very little (money) I love my job, I love to see my students feel\nand be better. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nA few days ago\nI found PATREON and I said to myself \u00a8why not?\u00a8. If I helped somebody over the\nyears on the internet then maybe I could receive some help too to improve my\nfinancial situation?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo this is what I say to you\u003cbr\u003e\nMy brother, my sister. I love you. I am grateful that you have followed my\nlife. I am blessed that you have found my messages valuable. You are most\nprobably like me, a truth seeker. That makes you a good being. I have a lot of\ngreat beings around me! I am more than happy.\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, you DO can help me by donating me some money. That is not something\nyou need to do, but something that would definitely mean a lot to me. \u003cbr\u003e\nThere is a saying that when you don\u2019t have money you need to use time to buy\nmoney but when you do have money you can use them to buy time. Having more\nmoney would give me more time to create and make new videos, audios and writings\nto share with you. I would have more time to SPEND WITH YOU and those who need\nmy help. I could also afford myself an occasional meditation retreat again. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you very\nmuch for your time reading this. \u003cbr\u003e\nI do care about you.\u003cbr\u003e\nDolama Mantas\u003cbr\u003e"
