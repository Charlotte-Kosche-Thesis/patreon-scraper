On top of all of that, we also have\nthe language barrier (because as you know, anime and manga are in Japanese) and\nbesides the fact that we want to verify findings from first-hand accounts\nanyway, sometimes a translated version of something just doesn\u2019t exist. So to ensure\nthe authenticity of our research, we often have to do just that much more work\nto get it right when a source is only in its native language. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLanguage barriers\naside, sometimes it even comes down to purchasing actual \n\u003cstrong\u003ebooks\u003c/strong\u003e (yes, those\nstill exist) or other published materials that just aren\u2019t on the internet.\nThose cost money, and the fact (pun intended) of the matter is, though DYKA is\na labor of love and we accept the expenses that come along with it, we\u0027re\nhuman: we have day jobs, \n\u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027ve got bills to pay, and we\u0027ve got big aspirations\nfor growth\n\u003c/strong\u003e that resources like Patreon can help with in a big way! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nThere\u2019s more to DYKA than\nthe fact videos? ------------ \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIndeed! The factoids, interviews, and\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://whocaresaboutanime.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Who Cares About Anime\" blog\u003c/a\u003e are currently the other sources of content worked on by\nthe DYKA crew. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSometimes we even like to fan-dub or \"abridge\" things.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYoiJXrNr7Q\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe even have some exciting new projects (that we\ncurrently can\u2019t even talk about) in the works! All of this is happening \n\u003cstrong\u003enow\u003c/strong\u003e,\nwhile many other awesome ideas are only in the planning stages at the moment; but\nas we look to the future, we want to \n\u003cstrong\u003eexpand\u003c/strong\u003e to gradually become an all-encompassing\nresource of anime trivia for everyone and anyone who loves anime. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nDoes pledging mean\nthat the videos will come out faster? ------------\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, \n\u003cstrong\u003eno\u003c/strong\u003e. As\nawesome as trying to promise that might seem, we\u2019ve learned by now that there\nare just too many variables in the production process and we wouldn\u2019t want to put\nourselves in a position that potentially compromises quality. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKeep in mind that\n\u003cstrong\u003epledging doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll slow down either\u003c/strong\u003e. Each episode of the show is its\nown beast; sometimes one thing that was hard to do in a certain episode\ninexplicably winds up being relatively easy in another, and vice versa. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe rate of release for the videos will (for now)\nremain largely the same (bi-monthly, more or less). We do our best, plain and\nsimple.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nWill my pledge get \u2018X\u2019\nvoice actor/reviewer/etc? ------------ \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSorry, but that\u2019s not\nhow it works. The process by which someone ends up being a part of a DYKA\nproduction has many different facets to it, but ultimately some things are\ncompletely out of our hands. If we promised you a certain person was going to be\nin a video, and then they couldn\u2019t do it for whatever reason, that would be\nunfair to you the viewer.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNarrators,\ninterviewees, and anyone else we work with ideally has that special combination\nof ability, relevance to their associated fandom, and genuine desire to\nparticipate along with an observable record or indicator of past work and\ndedication applied to some facet of anime fandom. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically, everyone involved in anything we produce does so because they want to be a part of it,\u00a0(for fun,\nfor furthering education, for outreach to fans, etc.) and are kind enough to\nlend us (and by extension, you) their time and talent.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat is the endgame\nfor this patreon campaign? ------------- \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe would love to make\nthis our job. Jonny and I have worked very hard over the last year and a half\nto turn a dream called \u201cDid You Know Anime?\u201d into a reality; but to make THE\ndream happen, we could really use the support of \n\u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e, the dedicated fans who\nhave gotten us to this point.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is already because of all of you that we have\nhad a crazy pipe dream materialize into actuality, and for that alone you have\nour deepest thanks and\u00a0we will strive to keep producing top-notch content for\nall of you amazingly awesome human beings. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s a big world\nof anime out there, so there\u2019s a lot more work for Jonny and I to do! We\u0027ve got\na lot of exciting episodes and projects on the horizon, and we hope you\u2019ll be\nright there with us along the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you all so\nmuch!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSee You Space Cowboys\n\u0026amp; Cowgirls\u2026\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBang!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
