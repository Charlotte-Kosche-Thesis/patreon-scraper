    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHO DO I THINK I AM?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Drew! I\u0027m a musician, songwriter/arranger, and recording engineer living in the beautiful state of Colorado. I have a lovely wife named Kelly and a baby boy named Finnegan. We have two Beagle mixes named Link and Navi. Link chases squirrels and birds in the back yard, and Navi is simply terrified of traffic cones. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing music since I was about 9 years old when my mom had me start piano, and I have a passion for learning new instruments and pushing myself to record music diy. I attended college at the University of Denver for Trumpet performance and Audio Production, and then played guitar in a touring rock band for a few years after graduation. After my band broke up in 2013, I set out to completely remodel my basement into a recording studio, which took about a year, and now I\u0027ve been up and running and recording! Making music is one of my greatest passions, but it\u0027s very time-consuming. Sometimes it\u0027s hard to balance it with family time, jobs, etc... but I believe that my art needs to remain a big part of what I do. Unfortunately, it\u0027s hard to make ends meet by just posting videos on Youtube, so therefore I thought I would extend an invitation to fans, friends and family to join me in my musical adventures and become patrons of my art like the olden days (like, 1700s days)! I\u0027m really excited and thankful you made it to this page, and regardless of whether you are able to become a Patron, all of my music is on my Youtube channel, so feel free to check it out!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/drewsowell\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/drewsowell\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOK, SO WHAT KIND OF MUSIC?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI try to write and arrange in styles that inspire me. I mainly record rock, alternative, pop, and jazz, so most of my works are within and around those genres. I try to make them sound unique, so many of my covers will not sound entirely like the original, and my original songs may be slightly abstract, but hopefully catchy and intriguing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE DOES YOUR MONEY GO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Some of the revenue goes back to the studio. I use expensive equipment that needs to be maintained, and I would love to continually upgrade cameras, lighting, recording equipment, knowledge, etc... Anything to help me make my music better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. \u003c/strong\u003eSometimes I hire other musicians in the community (usually friends) to collaborate with me, so some of the revenue goes to them as an appreciation of their talents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I have a mortgage to pay ;). These videos each take days to make, and I need to try to personally recoup expenses. I do everything: Composing and Arranging, Writing, Setup, Recording, Mixing, Mastering, Capturing and Editing the Video, etc... I LOVE making music, and I can see myself improving a lot, which is very exciting. I would continue doing these even if I wasn\u0027t compensated, but those pesky bills just never go away! Anyway, the final portion of the revenue goes to me... if that\u0027s ok with you :).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eANOTHER THING:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is not a monthly pledge! I only collect when I post a work, and I will never collect on more than 4 works per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKEEP IN MIND:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is ever-evolving. Changes will inevitably be made, and I would love your input on how to make everything better. If you have a great idea for rewards or anything that would make things better, please don\u0027t hesitate to let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
