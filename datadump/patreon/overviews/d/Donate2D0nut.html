I honestly never wanted to do anything even close to this, but coming down on a lot of bad luck isn\u0027t giving me any other option. Recently, I tried to upgrade my computer so that way I could provide not only better quality content but give myself a more easy and accessible way to create that content and send it out to you all faster. In doing so, I put a CPU chip into my motherboard that was not compatible with each other and it ended up frying my computer all together. I can\u0027t even turn the thing on and it has just destroyed me. I have spent hours calling, messaging and searching for answers but all are requiring me to spend more and more money than I even have access to, and so I am coming to you.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI am asking for some money to help me fund the motherboard and (possibly) other parts I will need to get my computer back up in running. As of right now, I think my only required parts are the mobo (motherboard for short) and a new stick of ram, which again, I\u0027m keep simplistic. Together, they come to about $100 and that is all I can comfortably ask for anyway. If I ended up needing more than a mobo and ram, I would make a follow up post, but I think I can handle anything else on my own (hopefully). \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI have so many great songs I am working on, so many video ideas and content ideas, interviews planned and even more stream ideas that I really was so excited to get to share with you towards the end of this year, and it has all come crashing down. With the growth of my podcast, \"\u003cem\u003eThe Bakery w/YungD0nut\u003c/em\u003e\" and my stream recently gaining a bit more traction, I\u0027ve been so blessed to enjoy doing what I do more and more everyday, but now I just need a little bit of help. If you even read this whole thing, that means so much to me and I hope I can make it worth your time soon! Thank you all so much for any help you give and I wish you all the happiest of holidays!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003exo\u003cbr\u003e-YD\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
