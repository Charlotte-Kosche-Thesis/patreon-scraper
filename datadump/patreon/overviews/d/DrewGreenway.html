    "summary": "Hi! My name is Drew Greenway and I\u0027m an 18 year old guy who loves the Lord and enjoys\u00a0sharing His message of love, hope, and forgiveness through music. It\u0027s my hope that people will be encouraged by the message in the music I share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI record and share at least one new Christian song each week on YouTube where you can hear the entire song for free.\u00a0\u00a0You can check out my YouTube channel at \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk8-7bpncOqBKW73-XJlq9w\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/DrewGreenwayMusic\u003c/a\u003e where I have currently shared over 200 Christian songs. Most of them are covers of Christian songs you have probably heard on the radio but with my own acoustic spin.\u00a0 I also have several videos of original Christian songs from my first album I recorded in the fall of 2015 and also a new single I released in August of 2017. \u00a0I faithfully share a Christian song each week because I feel it is a ministry of encouragement to fellow believers and also a way I can spread the message of the gospel in song. \u00a0I have been amazed by what God has done through this simple YouTube page. \u00a0Not because my songs have been played over a million times all over the world but because the comments I receive from people about how God sent just the right song at just the right time to encourage them in their walk with Christ.\u00a0 I have even heard from people in other countries that don\u0027t have access to Christian music other than on the internet, and they are grateful I share Christian music there as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to start this Patreon page as a way for you to give back to this ministry and be a part of my journey\u00a0if you would like. Think of my Patreon page as a digital tip-jar. If you were to randomly pass me performing in the street and think you would put a dollar in my guitar case, then this is a digital way of doing just that.\u00a0 Tipping even just $1 per month gets you exclusive goodies such as free songs.\u00a0 It will also\u00a0allow me to have a platform so you can get to know me better in a patron only section where you will have access to pictures and\u00a0videos that will not be posted anywhere else\u00a0 such as a behind the scenes look into making\u00a0my videos.\u00a0It will also allow me to give back to you in the form of rewards and perks based on the level of support given.\u00a0\u00a0I think it sounds like a great idea! \u00a0You can check out the different levels of support and see which one suits you. \u00a0You can start for as little as $1 a month and you can stop at any time. \u00a0Any support you offer would be very much appreciated and will allow me to continue sharing these Christian songs each week. \u00a0It could even allow me to record another album in the future. \u00a0God bless you, and I hope you are encouraged by the message in the songs I share each week. Please also visit my website for different ways to connect me as well as a current concert calendar.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.drewgreenway.com/\"\u003ehttps://www.drewgreenway.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
