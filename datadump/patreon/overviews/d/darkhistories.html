    "summary": "Thanks for stopping in, I guess it means you listen to the podcast, so for that I want to say thanks! It\u0027s real fun to make the podcast, but much more satisfying knowing that people actually listen to it. When I started the podcast, I just started tossing episodes out into the internet abyss and now one year on we\u0027re currently ploughing into Season 2 and had some exciting changes, \nmoving from a solo show to working with a co-host. Things are all going up and everyone loves an upward trend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply put, we\u0027re on Patreon because no one likes ads. You guys don\u0027t like listening to them, I don\u0027t like reading them. They offer very little to the show and are a one way street. On the flip side of that, each episode takes me between 20-30 hours to produce and we are at a stage right now where we still have a few upgrades to our equipment etc. to create a show that sounds professional. All of those things are money unfortunately. Patreon, at least to me, seems like the best way to fix this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon gives us the chance to interact with listeners more consistently which is awesome and gives the show financial stability allowing us to focus on making the best episodes we can. We can offer a bunch of different pledge tiers that will hopefully suit everyone. You might think a dollar isn\u0027t going to go far, but if everyone who listened to the show gave just the one dollar, we\u0027d hit our highest Patreon goal over night and then some, so it really does all help. We appreciate every dollar and pledge and it\u0027s very humbling that there are people willing to help us out and make the best show we can, which is all I really want to do. Thanks for taking the time to read and understand why we\u0027re on Patreon and why we want it to succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Ben\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS. In regards to the show research notes, they\u0027re all handwritten, so legibility is dubious at times, please see them as more of a \"behind the scenes bonus extra\" kind of thing rather than any sort of launchpad for your own research. They\u0027re also incredibly idiosyncratic!\u003cbr\u003e"
