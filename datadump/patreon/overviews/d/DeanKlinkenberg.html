    "summary": "Mark Twain screwed up the Mississippi, or at least what\nwe think of it. We all think we know the Mississippi River, because we read \u003cem\u003eHuck Finn\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eTom Sawyer\u003c/em\u003e. What more could there be to know? Twain was a great\nwriter (and an even better marketer), but his books describe the Mississippi River\nas it existed 150 years ago. 150 years! If all we knew about medicine was what we\nread in a 150-year-old textbook, I\u2019d fear for our health.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo much has happened along the Mississippi River since\nMark Twain wrote about it. It\u2019s about time we started hearing those\nstories, too. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing: telling stories about the whole river and\nits long and fascinating (but complicated) history.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI fell under the spell of the Mississippi River when I\nstarted college in La Crosse, Wisconsin. I could bike to the riverfront in less\nthan ten minutes, which I did regularly. I was a moody college kid, and there was\nno better place to brood than next to the Mississippi. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe first time I put a canoe in the Mississippi was in La\nCrosse. My friend and I paddled upstream, because we were young and didn\u2019t know\nbetter. I have since learned to paddle downstream (most of the time).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe river captured my heart (and imagination) during\nthose years, but a lot of time passed before I dug into researching the cultural and historical significance of America\u2019s Greatest River. Now I spend much of my time writing and speaking about the amazing river that we often take for granted. (Or don\u0027t know nearly as well as we think we do.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003eI have an agenda. \u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYes, Twain is the reason so many of us know something\nabout the Mississippi, but our focus on Twain has left the\nriver vulnerable. When we think of the river, if we think of it, we think about\nthe river as it was, as Twain described it. Our communities, though, turned\naway from Twain\u2019s river, and we turned it over to engineers and a couple of big industries.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you paddle on the Mississippi today\u2014which you should\u2014the biggest hazards are man-made: engineering structures like wing dams that\nline the river and the barges carrying tons of cargo that those wing dams were\nbuilt to serve. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you think of the river today, you probably think of\nthose barges and not much else. Shipping interests have a pretty good PR\nmachine, and they do their best to remind people that the Mississippi is their\nriver. I\u2019m not against shipping, but in the absence of voices since Twain,\nwe\u2019ve let engineers and shippers define what the river is today. I\u0027m telling stories to remind us that of\u00a0a fundamental truth: that \u003cstrong\u003ethe\nMississippi is everyone\u2019s river\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eStories like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mississippivalleytraveler.com/far-north-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMinnesota has that funny top-hat shape\u003c/a\u003e in its northern boundary;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow Keokuk, Iowa\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mississippivalleytraveler.com/from-slave-to-emancipator/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCharlotta Pyles\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eescaped slavery and worked to free other enslaved people;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mississippivalleytraveler.com/farewell-third-street-deli/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estruggles faced by small businesses\u003c/a\u003e along the Great River Road and why we should care;\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe only\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mississippivalleytraveler.com/st-louis-riverfront-gets-little-respect/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elong-term solution to fixing the problems of the St. Louis riverfront\u003c/a\u003e; and\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe unintended (and potentially catastrophic)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mississippivalleytraveler.com/unintended-consequences/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econsequences of our attempts to engineer the Mississippi River\u003c/a\u003e into a more predictable shipping canal. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003eI want people to feel connected to the Mississippi\nRiver.\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs communities turned away from the Mississippi, the\nriver got dirtier. It was easier to pollute something that most people ignored.\nWe\u2019ve cleaned up the most visible kinds of pollution in the river, but there\nare other threats that we\u2019re having a hard time getting a handle on. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne of the biggest threats to the river\u2019s health, though,\nis that we forget that the Mississippi exists. We can\u2019t take care of something\nwe don\u2019t know about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I\u2019m not just here to entertain and educate with folksy yarns\n(although I hope to do some of that, too!). I I want to share stories about the Mississippi\nRiver--past, present, and future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories about the varied (and sometimes odd) boats that have floated up and down the river (and still do).\u00a0Stories about the river as the perfect place for a lazy summer Sunday afternoon or as an arena to test your endurance and figure out what you\u0027re made of. Stories about the river\u0027s role as both a source of freedom and a path to brutal enslavement. Stories about how we have venerated the river (and have sometimes treated it like a sewer).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you (and everyone else) to know that the Mississippi River exists, and that it\u2019s your river, too.\u00a0I hope to entice you to visit the Mississippi Valley, to look around and ask a few questions. I\u0027m out to convince you that\u0027s it worth your time to get to know this river better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eAbout the Mississippi Valley Traveler\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been writing about the Mississippi for over ten\nyears and maintaining a website about the river nearly as long. As you might\nguess, it has a lot of content now. If you aren\u2019t familiar with the website,\nplease check it out: \u003ca href=\"http://www.MississippiValleyTraveler.com.\"\u003ewww.MississippiValleyTraveler.com.\u003c/a\u003e I\u2019ve organized it into\nseveral sections: \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacts about the Mississippi\u003c/strong\u003e: Posts about the river\u2019s geology, plant and animal life, habit of flooding, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRiver Town Profiles\u003c/strong\u003e: These profiles include a\nlot of local history but they also include a few tips for travelers. I\u2019m not\ncreating a comprehensive travel guide, though. There are other places (with\nmore resources) that offer that. I write profiles to help you understand what\ndefines the river towns along the Mississippi and to give you ideas about how you\nmight experience it for yourself. I have posted profiles for every river town\nin Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, and about half of Illinois. I plan to add\nmore profiles as support grows, not stopping until I\u2019ve covered them all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic about the Mississippi River\u003c/strong\u003e: There\u0027s a rich musical heritage along the Mississippi River, more so than most people realize. Read a brief history of the musical genres native to the Mississippi Valley,\nthen scan through the surprisingly long (and growing) list of songs that are about the\nMississippi (currently over 1,000 strong!).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhoto Galleries\u003c/strong\u003e: Hundreds of pictures from\nplaces along the Mississippi Valley.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003eWhy I\u2019m Asking for Your Support\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFrankly, I\u2019ve reached critical mass. My readership is\ngrowing steadily (thank you!), which means it\u2019s more and more demanding to put\nin the time and money to continue to research and write about the river. I\ncan\u2019t do it well while working unrelated day jobs anymore. If I can\u2019t keep\nup with the work of creating new content, then I can\u2019t help people connect to\nthe Mississippi River. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your support, I can continue to add:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eMore stories about the amazing people, places, and events along the river.\u003cbr\u003eMore river town profiles (until I\u2019ve covered\nthem all).\u003cbr\u003eMore features about river music and musicians.\u003cbr\u003eExpanded coverage of the whole river, all 2,350\nmiles of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003eMy promises to you.\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe content at MississippiValleyTraveler.com is currently\nfree and will remain so. With your support, I\u2019ll be able to add more content,\nas I mentioned above. I\u2019ve also set some specific goals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOnce I reach $200 a month in Patreon support, I\u2019ll remove\nGoogle ads from the website. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eGet me to $500 a month in Patreon support, and I\u2019ll\nremove the Amazon affiliate links, too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf we can get to $1,000 a month in support, I will post at\nleast one new river town profile every month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBesides that, every month I\u2019ll create a blog or video post just for Patreon supporters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t thank you enough for your support (but I\u0027ll try!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we\u0027ll let the world know that there\u0027s so much more to this river than dreams about rafting and the transportation of bulk goods. This is our Mississippi, and all our stories need to be told.\u003cbr\u003e"
