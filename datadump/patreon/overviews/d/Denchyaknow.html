     "about": "\u003cdiv\u003eI\u0027m just a normal college student going into Computer Information Security for a nice stable career. My passion for game development started once I hosted my first wow server at 11yrs, should\u0027ve seen it, this one nelfy being all over me, people throwing bundles of plat at me... then I logged off and jumped on Halo. mmm not anymore CUZ XBONE ^(x_x)^. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLacking resources(-$1.20) and guidance(#daddyissues), it wasn\u0027t until 2014 that I was finally part of a Game Development team, my dream finally in my hands, and equipped with enough skills in my Backpack Of Holding(swagSOgood), weekdays I show up to school 3hrs before classes, I pull out m laptop and start up Unity2D and get right to it. Usually around this time I have about 2-3 cute girls sitting on my lap BEGGING me to carry them in this game and always trying to grab at my joysticks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA gamer since 4yrs, At first I loved playing games for that fading sense of \"WONDER\" I once experienced when I was just a lil\u0027homie with his Pokemon, forcing all the\u00a0Rattata into my balls of rooting. Turns out I was a really hyper active POS growing up(#DaddieIssues), my feeling of wonder that gmaes once gave me faded along with my attention span and imagination, if u gave me a rpg then 10mins later of impatiently spamming A, Id be reading about the latest games with PvP. When \"WONDER\" supply is low in a single player game I turn to PvP, I think PvP can alway be fresh, reaugmented, modular, and styled any way you can think of. Thats the kind of developer I want to be, so here I am on patreon seeing if my dev-skills can reach over 9000. If you think I can better the gaming community and want to see more of my work please feel free to tell me what you think here on patreon, support me if you want as ill often release assets for unity, beta invites, and game keys to my patrons. ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\"I will the pierce the heavens\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
