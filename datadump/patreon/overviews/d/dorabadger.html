    "summary": "My name is Dora Badger, and I spin my terrible life choices into comedy gold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy latest bad decision is taking in a pregnant stray dog who\u0027s very close to not being pregnant any more. For her, it\u0027s a great decision: we found her wandering back and forth across a busy four-lane street, and it\u0027s pretty evident that she hasn\u0027t had a decent meal in weeks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor us, it\u0027s a Boss Level Dumb move: we already have two dogs and our house is constantly under construction. We have room (sort of) for another dog but not the time, and we certainly have no way of accommodating the entire pack of dogs that this dog is about to become. But I literally pulled this dog off the street, she\u0027s bonded with me, and she\u0027s staying with me until she pops or my name isn\u0027t Fuckedupstiltskin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not a plea for dog care funds. Hell, by the time you read this I genuinely hope that Preggo Doggo has found a forever home in a nice family with 2.3 kids. This is an invitation to hang out and watch me make life decisions that range from silly to just plain awful. It\u0027s a front row seat to the slow motion train wreck that is my everyday life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShit goes sideways on me so often, it\u0027s a wonder I don\u0027t walk on an angle. Some of my commentary on whatever\u0027s gone wrong on any given day can be found on my social media feeds, but far more of it ends up in personal journal entries that no one has ever seen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m ready to open the vault.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou make bad choices and you want to be paid to...what?

It\u0027s a ridiculous thing to be ashamed of, but I am. I mean, I currently have about a thousand postcards and zero people to whom I send postcards and it is definitely becoming a hoarder situation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the other perks, you will receive a postcard with a handwritten note or a doodle. The note might be a thank you, a secret, a quote, a fake quote, or maybe just something I\u0027ve pulled from my random curseword generator. The doodle might be a random stick figure or it might actually look like the thing I am trying to draw. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027ll depend how much time I have and what kind of mood I\u0027m in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeeling lucky?",

You\u0027ll have access to a monthly livestream of me doing something I probably have zero business doing. Like, for example: as I write this, I have a stray dog in my home who\u0027s about to pop out some puppies. So some time in the next couple of days I will be helping this mama dog whelp. I have prepared for this by watching ten minutes of YouTube videos and hyperventilating every time she starts that nesting behavior the internet says is an early sign of Puppy Arrival. If I\u0027d set this Patreon up two months ago, I\u0027d have a camera ready so you could watch as she does what comes naturally and I freak the fuck out. I do not have time to get a livestream going for this thing, but you can watch as I have a shit fit over the next thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and you get the other stuff too of course, including the postcards. How cool is that?",
