You can even set a\n\"limit\" for how much to give me\u2014for example, if you pledge\n$1.00/month and set a limit of $5.00, after 5 months it will stop your\npatronage until you renew it again.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the additional perks and rewards of the tiers I have set up...read below!"
