Mainly due to you, my Patrons! \u00a0 I love gaming. I have a job that I love. But that job affords me free time. In which I can game and create videos for everyone to see and share! The more support we have, the better equipment I can grab and more games I can put out.\u00a0 So if you want to see better streams or videos and more games, consider becoming a patron!\u00a0 I watch Twitch and YouTube both. \u00a0I enjoy watching others struggles and triumphs! It\u0027s a great feeling to share in the excitement of the win and the times you are disappointed (not all of you) when the gamer fails. \u00a0Last but not least, I enjoy the feed back from the community! \u00a0You\u0027re thoughts on the game or play style is what makes gaming unique! \u00a0So feel free to watch and comment!\u00a0\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
