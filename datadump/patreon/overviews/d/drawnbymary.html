I\u0027m Mary, also known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/drawnbymary\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edrawnbymary\u003c/a\u003e on social media! I\u0027m a freelance illustrator based in Los Angeles, CA. I started illustrating on a regular basis about 5 years ago. In the beginning I was most inspired by meshing pop culture with everyday life experiences, which was super fun for me to conceptualize and create. Over time, I started sharing more about myself and my experiences as they were happening, and using art as a way to share myself, relate to others, and heal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more personal experiences I shared, the more my creativity blossomed. Now I create most pieces as a powerful tool to cope with and help heal from traumas I have faced in recent years, including 5 miscarriages and a breast cancer diagnosis. What a wild ride it has been in just a few short years! Thankfully, I get a lot of comfort from creating and sharing art with inspiring messages based on my real life. It brings me so much joy, and I feel such a warm sense of community from those who have resonated with the work that I create and so thankful for the positive feedback and loving support I\u0027ve received by my being completely vulnerable in this way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you will be a part of my exclusive community here! You will make it possible for me to create even more illustrations, and continue to inspire and heal through art, especially now as I navigate my way through several months of cancer treatment. As a way to show my gratitude, you can choose to receive early access to new illustrations before I post them on social media, illustrated phone wallpapers, behind the scenes images and videos showing my process, and even monthly snail mail from me in the form of a physical illustration and handwritten note!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith gratitude,\u003cbr\u003eMary"
