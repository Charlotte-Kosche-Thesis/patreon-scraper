However, I am looking forward to expanding my channel out beyond clips into full commentaries explaining my abstract ideas so that they are fully conveyed and able to contended with properly and with the support of a person like you I will be able to afford the time and resources to doing so as a full time gig.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e1) I intend on expanding this channel. so, I may travel both physically and virtually to Interview many profound thinkers in a more formal format \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) The support will aid me in the hiring of someone to split that work load that will inevitably start piling up as I take on new projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) The original content does take a great amount of time and with the support that will allow another person to be hired on. I will be able to split duties and work more effectively and efficiently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that with your support I will turn these visions and goals into realities. \u003cbr\u003e"
