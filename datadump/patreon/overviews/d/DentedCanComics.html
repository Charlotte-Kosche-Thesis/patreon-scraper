    "summary": "Hello, All!\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, I\u0027d love to thank you for visiting my Patreon Page of Wonders or becoming a part of the Dented Can Comics Family. It truly means a lot to me that there are people out there that value my mind vomit, and help me make a living off of my creativity. In essence, do that in which I love, I loof, and I loufe.\u003cbr\u003eWhat IS Dented Can Comics, you may ask in shock and awe. What on Earth did you get roped into?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWell, never fear. You can stay seated. Those porkchops are still yours. And, Your answer awaits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDented Can Comics are the optimal visualization tools for me to display the reason I\u0027m chuckling in the corner of your room, laughing maniacally on a traffic jammed highway, or placing suitcases in trees. Simply put, they are the conduit into my often nonsensical,\u00a0 absurdist, and perpetually creative mind that sometimes can be gravid with deep thought or metaphorical gesture. They star me, Ryan Miller, in a universe all my own; a stratosphere of sorts, unchained from inhibition. Twisted and sometimes dark, yet light and undoubtedly formed with my own sense of humor, they follow their own narrative and are the outlets that keep me sane (because if I exist within a creativity-less void, I fart inverted rainbows and buckets of whale tears.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey\u0027re always hand drawn, hand inked and hand colored. Sometimes, I even draw, color and ink my own hand to get extra handy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn either case, I hope you enjoy and can find a place where you can unwind a bit. Sit back, and relax. And, if you find that you are just a little off, too... remember there\u0027s always room in the aisle, with the rest of us Dented Cans.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Welcome to the D20 Tiers... and congratulations on becoming a part of the most elite D4 Edition. You have become one of the champions of the Patreons, and in doing so, garnered the attention of a long-forgotten deity (and subsequently, the longest tier name) : The Condensed Condiment Fairy Lord and Patreon Saint of Courteous and Belligerent Tube Sock Puppets! Created by the coagulated and discarded remains of fast food and diner condiments that melted and reformed atop a Metallica Master of Puppets CD ironically encased within a withered tube sock puppet, this summon-able and odorous force found new purpose in life, and shall find it yet again by your side! With it, it brings the jaded yet polite army of sweat soaked, flaccid-bodied, button-eyed, and left-to-rot tube socks of the world bent on subservience and stained with crushed dreams. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDEITY TIER BOOSTS: This special D20 tiers\u0027 attributes come from the coagulated condiment sweat of this deity and include EXCLUSIVE admittance into a yearly streamed DnD game for the fate of your fellow Patrons, wherein I, Ryan Miller, shall serve as DM. Your Failure or Success (and level of such) will decide on additional perks for the whole of the DCC community, as well as give you an increased perk. All Four members will have an option to play.\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, that is right, you are the now one of the DCC Community Champions. I wish you well.\u003cbr\u003e\nAdditional Boosts: \u003cbr\u003e\n-Members of this Tier will have recurring characters modeled after them written into the series, as well as access to Digital HD copies of signed versions where they appear. \u003cbr\u003e\n-Personal, Hand-Made Birthday Cards mailed to them every year with an original picture of their character signed by me.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Access and a chance to be Moderator to a half hour monthly Live Stream Q\u0026amp;A or Draw By request (decided by votes), as well as an HD Digital Copy of the picture/pictures with all the names of the streams participants written on it in commemoration.\u003cbr\u003e\n-Access to both monthly and non-monthly wallpapers for ye computing devices.\u003cbr\u003e\n-A metaphorical shipping container of gratuitous thanks, an official golden stamp of awesomeness placed forever upon my heart and mind, my love for five millennia, the possible appearance of something JUST FOR YOU (aside from your recurring character), and Access granted to the Early release of the comics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n**Sgt Genitals Recommendation: Please do not wait for this Deity to show up in physicality. He is very conceited and likes spending his days taking long walks on the beach surrounded by a harem of tube sock puppets. He really only likes being summoned into verbal existence, text-based tangibility, as a usable force in the realm of DnD or very seldom, as a visible form draped in pen and ink. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, it has been scientifically confirmed that the tier boosts produced from his sweat are 100% accurate and accessible, except where otherwise noted.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n",
