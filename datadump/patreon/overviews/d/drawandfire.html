    "summary": "When I started making work specific to Draw and Fire about a year and a half ago, I didn\u0026#8217;t realize that it would become as big as it has been for me. While I\u0026#8217;m still very small potatoes, I have done more drawing in the past 18 months than I think I have ever done in my life and it\u0026#8217;s been absolutely amazing. This past year, most of my drawing has been commissioned drawings. While I enjoy making special one-off pieces for people, and am extremely grateful to those who have spent their hard earned money for my work, I am in a bit of a quandary. Generally speaking, I use whatever I make from art sales to make ends meet (insert starving artist joke). Most of the work I do takes a lot of time, and doing it on top of working a full time day job makes any and all free time very difficult to come by. I have so many ideas for drawing projects that I have been wanting to do, and that I think people that like my work will love, but I have had to put those ideas aside because I can\u0026#8217;t really ignore commissioned work opportunities when they presents themselves. I realize that everyone and their brother has a Patreon page but I have decided to give it a try and see if I can get enough support to free up my time to do these ideas that I have been wanting to do. I want to continue to push myself and my abilities like was doing when I started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal is to be able to give every one of my Patreon supporters something unique to Draw and Fire. Because I\u0026#8217;m essentially making products, I will have the ability to actually send my supporters unique items and pieces of art. Along with the ability to have more free time to work, I have some long term goals that I\u0026#8217;m hoping can be met in time. One of my big goals is to get my own etching press. Having my own press will allow me to not have to depend on studio access at the local university to make etchings. Small presses aren\u0026#8217;t terribly expensive, but getting one that isn\u0026#8217;t a piece of junk could be. If I can do this, then my Patreon supporters will get dibs on actual printed works more often. Another long term goal is to get a new computer. My mid-2010 Macbook pro is about on it\u0026#8217;s last leg and eventually I\u0026#8217;ll have to get a new computer to replace it. While I don\u0026#8217;t use it like a lot of artists/designers do, I do rely on it for work related purposes and some photoshop work. Another goal is to by a decent quality camera so that I can document my work better than I am currently doing. Another HUGE long term goal, is to possibly be able to get to take my work and set up at SHOT show or possibly the NRA show in 2018. Because the focus of Draw and Fire is firearm and shooting related art, I feel it would be a huge advantage to make my work seen at these shows and hopefully make connections in the industry. \u003cbr\u003e"
