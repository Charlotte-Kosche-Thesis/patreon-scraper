There are always wonderful foods featured in Disney movies, whether it be the spaghetti from Lady and the Tramp, the grey stuff from Beauty and the Beast or the ratatouille from Ratatouille.

We will only do the movies made by Walt Disney Animation studios and Pixar Animation studios (with the possible exceptions of a Halloween and Christmas special and also the exception of the Goofy Movie, which was made by DisneyToon studios, but I love that movie).  See below for the list. We are both very excited about this project and wanted to share it with everyone. So follow us as we explore and create the lovely Disney meals.\u003cbr\u003e",
