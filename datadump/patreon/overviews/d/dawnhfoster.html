    "summary": "If you\u0027re here, you probably read me regularly or see me rowing on television with your least favourite right wingers. I have a fortnightly Guardian opinion column, and contribute to other parts of the paper and several other publications, But I also want to write things that don\u0027t quite fit elsewhere, longer pieces on culture, literature, television and theology/religion. I want to review more, and am not a tenured professor in his fifties, unfortunately. I want to write about television, but I tend to watch things decades after they first air. And be able to respond quickly to current affairs and political news, instead of traipsing through a succession of editors and only publishing days later once the climate\u0027s changed. I also want, not to podcast regularly, but record some conversations with friends and experts I know about subjects I care about and find intellectually fascinating. So I\u0027ll carry on writing publicly, but put subscriber-only posts, articles and audio here. I don\u0027t want the barrier to be high financially, but I\u0027m a freelance journalist with earnings that never really go up because editorial budgets shrink every year, and magazines cut space as well as money."
