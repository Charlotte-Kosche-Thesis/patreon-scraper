Our goal is to start small and work our way up over the years to be a stable studio. We currently produce three web-shows. \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PavelHall\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePavel Hall\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TrialofLeaves\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTrial of Leaves\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl7t9dXnr1o787d_Bg8BUMw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Escape Pod\u003c/a\u003e. Our resident musician \u003ca href=\"https://nyro.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNyro\u003c/a\u003e. And web-comic \u003ca href=\"https://tapastic.com/series/necrosis\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNecrosis\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of stuff, right? It takes a lot of time and effort to make all of these, and for most of them, we do not see any money back. The Patreon allows us to make money every month off of the work that we do so that we can keep making things. Most of us have a full time day job and/or school so it is hard to focus on work that we don\u0027t wanna do and work we want to be doing for the rest of our lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eHelping us through Patreon will allow us to put out content faster, have better production quality, be able to do new things, and be able to eat/pay rent. As of now, we have a few ideas we wish to produce into either short films, feature films, or series, but don\u0027t have the dough to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the money that goes to this Patreon either goes to budget for projects or payment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also run a show that uses Fair Use all the time, and since YouTube is a broken piece of garbage, we don\u0027t make money on a lot of episodes because of Copyright Claims. Helping us on Patron will help out when we can\u0027t make money on a video we spent ages on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat do I get for being a Patron?\u003c/h2\u003eFor right now our biggest reward is the ability to see things early right here on Patreon, but with more Patrons helping us, the more we will be able to give out some kick ass rewards such as physical rewards. All reward tiers also get their name in the credits of what we make. Every film, book, and album we produce under your stay will have your name. You also get the chance to prove that you don\u0027t need a big studio and big money to make art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll we need is you.\u003cbr\u003e"
