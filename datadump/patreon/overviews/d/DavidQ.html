    "summary": "Hey there,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nhardly ever post personal information online, but I\u2019d like to invite you\ninto what God is doing in my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis\nfall I\u2019ll be enrolling at Covenant Theological Seminary to pursue my Master of\nDivinity Degree \u2013 a three-year program at one of the top seminaries in the\nworld. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePastoral ministry is a calling, not a career, and I have felt called to\nbe in ministry for several years. This is one step closer to fulfilling God\u2019s\npurposes for my life, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\ngood news? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwas awarded a scholarship that covers 100% of tuition. The scholarship is\ncalled the Strategic Church Development Award - an award given out \u003cem\u003esparingly\u003c/em\u003e every year to a few minority\nstudents who are called to pastoral ministry. The award is only given after\nmany interviews, assessments, and a five-page essay that describes my calling.\nIt was almost a two-year process and . . . I can\u2019t believe it, but they picked\nme.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nfirst day of class is August 22. I\u0027ll spend 40+ hours a week studying, in classes, and interacting with professors\nand students alike, trying to increase my competency and get training,\nall-the-while staying 100% committed to the local church. While I can work\npart-time, it is strongly recommended not to work the first year. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow\nwill I pay my living expenses? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m\ndeveloping a team of friends who would be willing to support me through prayer\nor financial giving. So here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to ask you: Will you prayerfully\nconsider financially supporting me during my first year of Seminary? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m\nonly raising financial support for one year. I\u2019m looking to raise at least\n$1,500 a month. The finances are primarily for my living expenses (rent,\nutilities, groceries, etc.) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost\nSeminarians raise support for three or four years, but I feel compelled to ask\nfor only one year. After August of 2017, I will no no longer raise support. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo\nthat means I\u2019ll be raising financial support from August, 2016 \u2013 August, 2017. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(Click \"Become a Patron\" to support now)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s\nworth noting my calling once again because I want to emphasize God\u2019s work in my\nlife. He chose me, not the other way around. And I want you to partner with me\nnot just because I ask, but so that you can participate in what God is doing.\nAfter all, I\u2019m going to Seminary to better serve the church \u2013 to better serve\npeople like you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMaybe\nyou give $25, $50, or $100 a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr maybe you just give one-time payment. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo\namount is insignificant. And please don\u2019t feel pressured into giving. I welcome\nyour friendship as a prayer partner during this season of my life, regardless\nof whether you give financially. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give, just click \"Become a Patron\" now. It\u0027s quick, it\u0027s easy, and it\u0027s 100% safe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank\nyou for praying for me and for prayerfully considering to financially support\nme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDavid\nQaoud \u003cbr\u003eBlog:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gospelrelevance.com/\"\u003egospelrelevance.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEmail:\n\u003ca href=\"mailto:dqaoud@hotmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edavid@gospelrelevance.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eP.S.
