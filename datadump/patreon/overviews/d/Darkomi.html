I\u0027ve always dreamed of putting something out that people would like to see, and look forward to, I just have never had the time, or the money to focus on something so big. So I decided to give Patreon a go, and see where it takes me. I have a lot of stuff I\u0027d love to work on, but I\u0027d like to finish my owed commission art first, and i\u0027m hoping that Patreon will help me with that goal.",
