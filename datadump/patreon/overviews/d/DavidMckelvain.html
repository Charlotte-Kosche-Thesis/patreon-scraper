    "summary": "You have not pledged a dime yet, but I am grateful for your taking the time to look at what I am doing.\u003cbr\u003e I am three chapters into my book, \"The Souls of Our Travelling Shoes\". I have included the first chapter in the post you will find on this page. The human heart and soul has always been my passion and the source of all my seeking. Not everyone you meet will fit neatly into a comfortable little spot that makes you feel comfortable. Some people will downright challenge your understanding. Some will be bigger than life, but appear ordinary on the surface. Some just need to be heard. I have not met a single person on this earth who was unworthy of or undeserving of being understood. I have never met a person that I couldn\u0027t walk away, better in some way for the experience.\u003cbr\u003eMy heartfelt desire and dedication is to the telling of as much as I am able, of this world and the experiences it will share with me. There is no place I will veer away from, and no fear that will possess me as I proceed with the work of my heart, and the miles that must pass under my travelling shoes.\u00a0All of this involves expenses that I am not able to readily meet in a timely manner. Please scroll down to the posts, or click on posts,at the top of the page, for a sample from the book.\u003cbr\u003eAll I ask is that you read the first short chapter, and decide if it is a journey you wish to travel beside me on. You will make the difference, if you so choose."

You and I will learn of the happy children; possibly the marriage conducted in the adobe church that day; the departed laid to rest among the white crosses of the graveyard; the struggles, and the passions of these people... forgotten before, and forgotten since. Their story calls to me from that image, and telling it has been a consuming passion for years.",
