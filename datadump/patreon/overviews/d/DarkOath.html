Here, you can support my efforts as a (beautiful) budding artist looking to create interesting art for interesting people, or boring people, no judging here! The main goal is to one day purely focus on my story and universe for the masses, which means quitting my side job. I want to build a community, because I love interaction, and artists always seem to be far away from there audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main project is Dark Oath, a large expansive comic / novel of creatures and mystical fantasy. I was inspired by the many languages of Tolkien in the universe of my story. Hints of elvish can be found everywhere in my naming schemes. The story follows a young willow fox, Elawen, and her friends as she seeks to find out how an ancient curse has returned to the land of Annungil. The first book follows Elawen, along with \nher fellow tribe of canines, who discover something that should have \nstayed hidden. Along the way she will endure horrors and the manipulation of those around her that will irreversibly change who she must trust. I warn that the story is unforgiving and not a lovely tale of a hero, but rather the unfortunate story of friendship and sacrifice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the basic rundown of things. Every bit of help to keep this story going is much appreciated and I hope I can help entertain as many people as possible."
