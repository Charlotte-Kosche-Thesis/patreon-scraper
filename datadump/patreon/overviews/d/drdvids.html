I\u0027m Derek, or better know as Dr.D in the DDR community. I\u0027ve been an avid DDR player since 2003 and have always strived to improve myself since. I launched this patreon page back in 2015, but now in 2016, I have a more clear picture of the direction I\u0027d like to take.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDDR is something that has been a big part of my life and I don\u0027t see that changing anytime soon. It is very rewarding to play, especially when I have the chances to interact with other players in the community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst let me make this very clear, only support if you are able and willing. I have played and uploaded content long before I made a patreon and will continue doing it whether you support or not. With that said, why should you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, it is a big help that goes a long way. By becoming a patron, not only does it ensure a monetary benefit to playing at the rate I\u0027d like, but it is a motivating factor. Knowing that their are people around the world who support what I do inspires me to create more content for my fans and try harder to improve as a world-class player.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gyazo.com/4f3865138a32d4fa11e369e0a9de3c75\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/4f3865138a32d4fa11e369e0a9de3c75.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that through donations and patreon supporters I can keep doing what I am doing with a clear mind. Again, to be brutally honest, playing DDR is expensive... Please keep in mind unlike most game streamers who purchase a game once and play it again and again, I pay for every round I play. The costs alone of me playing DDR each week is scary to say the least. With the new DDR A version with faster load times, which is a good thing, comes at the cost of extra credits in a session. On average, I spend about $15-$25 each session I play at the arcade. I play at the arcade 3-4 times a week on average which makes a week of play $60-$100 per week. To go even further, the arcade I frequent is quite far away, nearly 90mins through public transportation. Using that transportation adds about an extra $6 each day or around $20 per week. And... on top of all that, I need drinks man. Though not extremely expensive, bottled water, sports drinks, and energy drinks add up another $20-$30 dollars on average per week.\u003cbr\u003eOk, I think you can see the actual cost of playing new mixes at the arcade can really be. I post this very detailed and intimate info so you know exactly what I do. Again, to be clear, whether or not I received any supporters I would continue doing what I am doing though maybe not at the rate I would like. Like I said, any supporters who help lighten my load will at the same time help lighten financial burdens that are on my mind to keep playing the game I love how I want while providing content to my viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/1320cf9a077c5d508396b75e9b03b8e7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I know a lot of patreon pages I\u0027ve seen before focus on goals, usually with hardware purchases down the line. Well, not me. I basically already have all that I need for now. I\u0027ve recently built a new powerful PC rig to help out with video editing, a brand-new powerful laptop with the focus of streaming, a nice condenser microphone for voice work, 2 separate capture cards for simultaneous video capturing (check stream videos), etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m trying to get at is I\u0027ve already invested a lot into making sure that the quality of the content I make is good and at the same time am always looking at how I can improve things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am thankful for all of my fans and who have took the time to visit my page and give it a read through.

However, they are also big collector items! Many people collect the different styles and types there are. You may not be a collector yourself, but you will have something unique that they wouldn\u0027t, one signed by Dr.D with any other personal message you want transcribed as well. Please provide shipping details if selecting this option. I will always try to find unique cards if I am able.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e(All lower rewards are included)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

A chart breakdown is exactly how it sounds. Give me a chart you are having trouble with (reoccurring each month).
