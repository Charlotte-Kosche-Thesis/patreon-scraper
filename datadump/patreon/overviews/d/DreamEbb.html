The inspiration for my art comes from the struggles I\u0027ve gone through in life. Taking a bad experience and representing it through beauty is healing in it\u0027s own kind of way. Art is like my therapy. It would be awesome to have the means to do it more often, be able to try new mediums, and stock up on supplies that I run out of regularly. I live pay check to pay check so often times buying food comes before buying art supplies.\u00a0",
