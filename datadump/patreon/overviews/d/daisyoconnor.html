I\u0027ve long dreamed of a place where I could share my deepest work with the folks who care about it most, and Patreon is that place!\u00a0I have hundreds of unrecorded songs to share, plus I\u0027m writing a new one every week. \u00a0I can\u0027t keep hoarding all this bounty!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love that today \"we the people\" decide what art gets made. The patron system allows independent art to be created and shared without being owned by a record label or corporation. Whether you pledge $3 a month or $300- you are helping create music for the people, which will be available worldwide to anyone with an electronic device. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I work on the next big album project- the follow up to LIGHTCHASERS (no pressure)- I\u0027m excited to share exclusive songs with my folks on Patreon. Many of these songs are up for consideration for the next album, and patrons will have the first listen and vote.\u00a0\u00a0Here\u0027s how it works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatrons pledge = I write songs!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou pick the amount and donate once a month, for as long as you want.\u00a0I get to write songs and share them.\u00a0The world gets more Daisy music.

While this isn\u0027t how I planned to spend 2017- the year of my first big album release- I\u0027m thankful to be here and to get to continue my work. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you TEAM DAISY for helping me live the dream, and for helping create a safe place to share my new songs. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eDaisy"
