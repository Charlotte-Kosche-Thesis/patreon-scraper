You will be assisting us in making the books, the merch, going to conventions, and other events to meet our supporters and grow as company spreading the humble word of Eccentricity in Gaming.\u003cbr\u003eWhile this project of ours will happen no matter the amount of support we get on Patreon, it\u0027s still costly.  The more support we get, the faster we can release our first project. It\u2019s a lot on the shoulders of our team who must put ourselves out there every time something like manufacturing costs comes up. Patreon money will go towards web hosting fees, equipment upgrades and maintenance (a lot of us are working on aging computers and surprisingly enough, Adobe InDesign takes some serious hardware to run), software, as well as hiring out when need be (like the jackass proofreading this). This money will also help us with advertising on websites and at conventions to help us reach our key demographic, You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s With Some of these Goals and Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our Slogan suggests, Dead Tree Studios is run by a group of crazy eccentrics. No really, we\u0027re trapped in a Haunted Insane Asylum (send help!). While we are professionals, we do enjoy letting our more eccentric side show now and again. However, if someone does actually sign up for 1 million$ a month *Cough* BillGates *Cough* we will seriously fly out all our Patrons out to a country where hookers and blow are legal and have one hell of a party. I mean, why not?\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, if you have something else up your sleeve, other than a Patron, feel free to drop us a line at \u003ca href=\"mailto:Info.deadtree@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInfo.deadtree@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e .  We\u0027re more than willing to work with you and are always looking for ways to improve our company. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s After Fallout: Equestria PnP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGlad you asked! For those interested, Fallout Equestria isn\u0027t our bread and butter. While we do love this game, and will work to the bone to make it a success, we have a slew of projects we are wanting to do afterwards, all our original IP, to actually pay the bills. The list includes games based on: Thugged out Knights, Hot Promiscuous Monster Girls, and what would happen if we put DnD/Pathfinder Races in blue/white collar jobs. There\u0027s also ideas for card games and few other crazy goodies we\u0027ve been batting around. So keep an eye out after the release of Fallout: Equestria PnP: it\u0027ll only get better!\u003cbr\u003eFor more in-depth information on our company, as well as frequent updates on our progress, please visit us on our website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.projectdeadtree.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.projectdeadtree.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to browse our Perks for donating, and thank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003eDead Tree Studios\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
