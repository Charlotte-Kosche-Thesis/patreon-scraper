    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://drawittoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q0.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ramny and I make YouTube drawing tutorials. \u003cstrong\u003eOn my channel I help artists-in-training develop their drawing skills by showing them how to draw their favorite characters from movies, TV shows, cartoons, comic books, or video games.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been doing YouTube for the past year and a half. Prior to that I was a former schoolteacher who taught middle school English, Math, and Science. I have lived in four countries and currently I live in the USA with my lovely wife and spunky daughter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://drawittoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q1b.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to draw. I love comic books and movies. I love talking about nerdy things. I love to teach. And I have been very fortunate to be able to combine all of these things into one YouTube art tutorial channel. To be able to do what I love to do while simultaneously helping to inspire aspiring artists has been a dream come true. I am grateful for all of the support from my fans, and I am doing my best to create quality content that anybody with an imagination and basic drawing tools can enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever as you probably know, \u003cstrong\u003eit takes a lot of time and a lot of resources to create content, both which require money\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn average, I publish about 40 videos per month. That\u0027s a little over one video a day. Filming tutorials, editing, uploading, and optimizing videos -- these all take up a lot of time. Add to that the hours spent managing social media, doing research, creating rough drafts, making colouring pages, and building the website -- that amounts to about 40 hours a week of work. It\u0027s a full time job!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to eventually support myself financially with \u003cem\u003eDraw it, Too!\u003c/em\u003e, but I\u0027m still far from that point. I want to make this channel sustainable, and I also want to grow and improve the quality of my content. Patreon is a way that I can work towards these goals -- with your financial help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://drawittoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically Patreon allows people to support their favourite creators financially. Think of it like a monthly subscription fee, like Netflix. But while Netflix provides television shows as entertainment, I provide educational drawing tutorial videos! Patreon is there to ensure that your favourite creators are funded, so that they can keep making the stuff that you enjoy.\u00a0In my case you will be directly helping me in creating more and better YouTube tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately it would be better for me to be funded by my fans than to be funded by advertisers. Getting advertiser funding means I must adhere to outside companies\u0027 needs and wants. I have zero input in the relationship between advertisers and YouTube, and I have no control over what ads appear in my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of all that, YouTube continually makes changes to its search algorithms, which directly affects my channel\u0027s view count. These changes create fluctuations. Some months are great, but other months are not so good. YouTube\u0027s advertising revenue is no longer something that content creators can reliably count on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current \"Adpocalypse\", in which many of YouTube\u0027s advertisers are actively pulling out of YouTube, is greatly affecting creators\u0027 revenues. All across the board, many YouTubers\u0027 revenues are plummeting, my channel included. \u003cstrong\u003eThis has been damaging, most especially to small YouTube channels like mine.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://drawittoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-05-at-22.20.16.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Beginning late March 2017, my YouTube revenue has dropped to about 60% of what it once was, despite my channel\u0027s increase in subscribers and views.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe better model would be to get funded by you, my fans, because it is you whom I directly serve!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry it\u0027s not all about me. By supporting me on Patreon, \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e also get rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://drawittoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the right side of this page (or below, if you\u0027re reading this on mobile) is a list of all the tiers and rewards. Simply choose what tier or reward works best for you. The higher the tier, the greater the reward! Here\u0027s a rundown of all the tiers, but for full details check them out in the \u0027Rewards\u0027 section on this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe lowest tier is the \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSUPER PATRON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. For $1 per month (or $12/year) you have access to my Patreon feed where I post exclusive content, including behind-the-scenes photos, inking videos, and invitations to private livestreams. Plus you get a bonus tutorial video of the comic version of \u003cstrong\u003eDeadpool\u003c/strong\u003e! A lot of extra perks that those YouTube doesn\u0027t get a chance to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext tier up is the \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSUPER MEGA PATRON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. For $3 per month (still less than the price of one Starbucks coffee a month!) you get all of the SUPER PATRON rewards, plus access to even more downloadable and behind-the-scenes stuff, including my action figure photography! Also you get your name in the credits of my tutorial videos. How cool is that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne more tier up is the \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSUPER MEGA ULTRA PATRON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. For $6 per month you get all the rewards from the previous tiers, plus I follow you on your social media. You also get access to my action figure related videos, And you also get a birthday shoutout. And a birthday postcard from me with a custom message!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fourth tier is the\u003cem\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eSUPER MEGA ULTRA HYPER PATRON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. For $12 per month you get all of the rewards from the bottom three tiers, plus\u00a0you become an official member of the Draw it, Too! Advisory Group. This is a group of individuals who help me in deciding which characters to draw and when. Basically, I ask for your input when I plan out my video tutorials. Also, I draw your tutorial request once a year, aaand you get free art prints and a free shirt!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last tier is the \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSUPER MEGA ULTRA HYPER ULTIMATE PATRON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e! For $25 per month you get ALL of the previous rewards, plus I coach you on how to be a better artist and a better art YouTuber! You also get all my art prints for free (even the future ones), and you get a birthday present from me! Plus I get to do two of your drawing requests per year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, for details on all the tiers and rewards check out the list on the right of this page or below this post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the left side of this page are my \u003cstrong\u003eGOALS\u003c/strong\u003e. For each financial milestone that this Patreon reaches, I will provide an exclusive, Patreon-only tutorial video! When we reach the $50 per month milestone for example, you will get access to an \u003cstrong\u003eEzra Miller Flash\u003c/strong\u003e tutorial way ahead of the Justice League movie coming in November. Reaching $75/month unlocks \u003cstrong\u003eBat-Fleck\u003c/strong\u003e, $100 unlocks \u003cstrong\u003eAquaman\u003c/strong\u003e, $125 unlocks \u003cstrong\u003eCyborg\u003c/strong\u003e, and so on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://drawittoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q4.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar I get enables me to continue creating drawing tutorials for aspiring artists. \u003cstrong\u003eBasically, it comes down to this: the more financial support I have, the more time I can devote to making more and better YouTube videos for you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as you probably already know, equipment is expensive. Your contribution helps me to purchase drawing tools and office supplies like paper, pencils, Copic markers, erasers, and the like. It will also go towards upgrading my equipment -- I have an old Nikon D5100 I would ultimately like to upgrade, and I want to get a better microphone than the one I have now. Your contribution will also help me maintain\u00a0my monthly subscription services, mainly Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop), P.O. box fees, and website hosting. Plus it will go towards making sure that my production levels increase for a more professional look.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it will also free up some of my time to do more important things in life, like spending time with my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://drawittoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s okay! \u003cstrong\u003eYou are by no means obligated to support me financially.\u003c/strong\u003e Please don\u0027t be a patron if you can\u0027t afford it! I will continue to make free videos for you to enjoy. Don\u0027t forget -- liking, commenting, and sharing my videos also helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you for your continued support! Even though it is a lot of work to maintain this YouTube channel, it\u0027s meeting and hearing from people like you that make \u003cem\u003eDraw it, Too!\u003c/em\u003e worthwhile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHappy drawing,\u003cbr\u003eRamny"
