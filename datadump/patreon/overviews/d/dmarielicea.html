It can be described as a play on the \u9b54\u6cd5\u5c11\u5973/magical girl genre, though over the course of its story it will dip into a variety of subjects, including nostalgia, coming-of-age themes, LGBT themes, mental illness, hero worship, and many others. In the past I have summed up Phoenix Flair as a story about \"girls with powers and problems.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://36.media.tumblr.com/5e96de38b3530589f77ddeb15094b89b/tumblr_o3d1ibIDDC1qggjmro1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://dmlicea.itch.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ed Marie on itch.io\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/dc5ef3b89132e4750833478444a7a20e.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to Phoenix Flair, I have several smaller stand-alone projects, mostly prose- my itch.io is where I host most of them!
