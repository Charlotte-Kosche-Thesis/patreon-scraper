I have\n over two-dozen \u003ca href=\"http://dulemba.com/index_books.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebooks\u003c/a\u003e to my\n credit, including my debut novel, \u003ca href=\"http://dulemba.com/ABirdOnWaterStreet.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Bird on Water Street\u003c/a\u003e, \nwinner of 13 literary awards, including Georgia Author of the Year.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I grew up in the American south where I received a BFA in Graphic Design from the University of Georgia. I just completed an MFA with Distinction in Illustration at the University of Edinburgh and am currently a PhD Researcher at the University of Glasgow (Scotland). In the summers I travel to Roanoke, Virginia where I am Visiting Associate Professor at Hollins University in  the \u003ca href=\"http://www.hollins.edu/academics/graduate-degrees/childrens-book-writing-illustrating/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMFA in Writing and Illustrating Children\u0027s Books\u003c/a\u003e low-residency program.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I taught Illustration at the University of Georgia, and writing and illustration classes at various workshops around the country. I spent several years as Illustrator Coordinator for the southern region of the \u003ca href=\"http://scbwi.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSociety of Children\u0027s Book Writers and Illustrators\u003c/a\u003e and as a Board Member for the \u003ca href=\"http://www.georgiacenterforthebook.org/index.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGeorgia Center for the Book\u003c/a\u003e. Through these volunteer roles I created annual Illustrator\u0027s Day conferences, gallery shows, regional awards, and scholarship programs, connecting the local community and helping hundreds of up-and-coming creatives on their journeys. Before going freelance, I was a corporate Art Director and in-house illustrator for several child-related industries (such as Snoopy) as well as packaging and communication firms. You can learn more about me at \u003ca href=\"http://dulemba.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have always tried to do things that help people along their own creative journeys or bring them joy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While this exciting world of social media has made it possible for me to share my artwork with more people, it has also made it more difficult to get paid a living wage. Payments for book and freelance illustrations has remained the same or even dropped from what it was in the 1980s, while publishers demand more and more marketing efforts from the creators. This means artists have to spread themselves very thin to cobble together a living, which takes time away from creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have so many picture books and novels to share with you, many of which are well-along in the creative process. But I also need to make a living. Hence, the studying and the teaching and the speaking, which I love, but which also limits my creative time.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This year marks my 11th of sharing \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://dulemba.com/index_newsletter.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ee\u0027s news\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://dulemba.com/index_ColoringPages.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eColoring Page Tuesdays\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n with you. Somehow, amazingly, I have never missed a week in all that time. If \nyou\u0027ve enjoyed what I share, if it\u0027s added value to your life, as it has added to mine to create them for you, will you please consider becoming a supporter? Giving is \nlove and will allow me more time to create more \u003cem\u003efor you\u003c/em\u003e. Your support means the world to me. THANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e"
