I wondered if I could boil the history of Western art down\nto its essentials, providing in a few hours a framework that would encourage\npeople to explore fabulous artworks that have been created over thousands of\nyears. Answer: Yes! I\u2019ve done it by focusing on a handful of innovations that\ngave artists greater power to make viewers like you and me stop, look, and\nthink about art. I offered \u003ca href=\"http://diannedurantewriter.com/innovators-in-sculpture-kindle/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInnovators in Sculpture\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e as a walking tour of\nthe Metropolitan Museum in 2010, and published it as a Kindle book in 2015. \u003cem\u003eInnovators\nin Painting\u003c/em\u003e, which also began as a walking tour, has been on the back\nburner because I haven\u0027t had time to rework the draft. I plan to publish \u003cem\u003eInnovators in Painting\u003c/em\u003e in Kindle form, then\npublish a combined print-on-demand version that will include sculpture and\npainting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n2. \u003cstrong\u003eArtist-Entrepreneurs:\nSaint Gaudens, MacMonnies, and Parrish.\u003c/strong\u003e In the late 19th and early 20th\ncentury, the most capitalistic era in American history, it was considered\nnormal that the immense popularity of Augustus Saint Gaudens, Frederick\nMacMonnies and Maxfield Parrish should earn them substantial wealth.\nMacMonnies\u0027 annual income in the mid-1890s reputedly reached $300,000 (about\n$7.5 million today). In 1925, one of every four American homes had a print of\nMaxfield Parrish\u0027s \u003cem\u003eDaybreak\u003c/em\u003e. This talk gives a brief overview of the\nlife and notable works of Saint Gaudens, MacMonnies and Parrish, within the\nhistorical, political, economic and philosophical framework of the period\nbetween the Civil War and World War I. I\u2019ll be giving the talk at the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/172009640082042/\"\u003eCordair Arts \u0026amp; Wine Weekend\u003c/a\u003e in July 2018, and will release it afterwards as an audio and/or a\nbook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n3. \u003cstrong\u003eGreek\nArt\u003c/strong\u003e: print and ebook versions of a series of ten lectures I gave in the\nearly 1990s. The Greeks developed a skill at depicting the human form that far\nsurpasses that of the other peoples of the ancient world, and has seldom been\nequaled since. They also showed man as a heroic being, which is even more rare\nthan anatomical accuracy. This book will put Greek art in the context of\nhistorical events and of changes in philosophy in the broadest sense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nPROJECTS\nCOMPLETED \u003c/strong\u003ewith the support of Patreon subscribers (thank you all!):\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThree-volume set on Alexander Hamilton\n(details \u003ca href=\"http://diannedurantewriter.com/archives/4870\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehere\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eCentral\nPark: The Early Years\u003c/em\u003e (details \u003ca href=\"http://diannedurantewriter.com/archives/4704\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehere\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMORE\nPUBLISHED WORKS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can see my approach to discussing art in the books and\nessays I\u2019ve published, listed \u003ca href=\"http://diannedurantewriter.com/books-essays\"\u003eon my website\u003c/a\u003e and on \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dianne-L.-Durante/e/B001JS9VDO\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmazon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e."
