    "summary": "Dyskinetic is, above all else, a conversation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a singer/songwriter and disabled person. I\u0027m also known for playing an extraordinary, futuristic instrument known as MiMu Gloves. The brainchild of Grammy Award winning genius Imogen Heap, I\u0027m the first disabled person to use them as an accessible instrument. I\u0027ve toured all over the world as a solo artist, performing with the gloves. Along the way I\u0027ve had an amazing conversation about music, technology and disability. I soon realised that the conversation *around* my work was bigger and more important than anything I could ever do alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis conversation needed to amplified, and it needed to be an entity to itself, so Dyskinetic was born. I knew I wanted to make new music, a new kind of music. It struck me that no-one ever seems to make rock and metal with high tech instruments, so Dyskinetic is a return to my heavy roots. I\u0027m busy working on a new album, and I\u0027m really excited about it. I also have ambitious plans to explore the conversation in ways that songs don\u0027t serve. First up will be a podcast, with guests from different parts of the music/technology/disability conversation. I\u0027ve got some great guests provisionally lined up, subject to time and expense. There are also plans for a YouTube channel and visual artworks (another return to earlier roots, I spent 3 years in art college) - it\u0027s going to be a wide, loud, living breathing thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy career is going well, at least in live performance. I make a living performing with the gloves, but since the gloves adventure started, I\u0027ve spent little time in the studio. There\u0027s a few reasons for that, but one big fact is that it doesn\u0027t easily sustain itself. I still have to pay rent on my studio, buy/replace equipment, and I need the financial freedom to actually spend time in the studio. Unfortunately it\u0027s been hard to prioritise digital content as a result, but I\u0027m hopeful that being on Patreon could help level the balance. I know a lot of people really care about the work I\u0027m doing, a fact that I\u0027m forever grateful for. Hopefully, this will give those people a chance to support and therefore accelerate the project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, I\u0027ve got some really cool Patreon-only perks planned. I\u0027ll add tiers and ideas gradually, but first up is a new webdoc series. All Patrons will have access to these 5-10 minute documentaries, of which I\u0027m aiming to release 2-3 per week. I\u0027ve spent the last few weeks streamlining that process, and there are two episodes available right now when you sign up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a good chance that if you\u0027re reading this, you already have an interest in what I do. For that I\u0027m eternally grateful. Your support would bring things like the podcast to fruition faster. The podcast is definitely a project that needs a budget. Moving me and/or guests around costs money of course, and I\u0027m keen to record them all face to face. There\u0027s a few more surprises up my mimu gloved sleeves, so if you\u0027re keen to see/hear/experience more, please do consider becoming a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy humblest thanks,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKH"
