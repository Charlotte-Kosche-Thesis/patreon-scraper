    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eHullo! As you are likely aware, I\u0027m Dary, and I\u0027m a writer. Specifically, I write\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.orphicphantasia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOrphic Phantasia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a long-form serial that demands an awful lot of my time but, at present, little in the way of monetary compensation to make up for it. I\u0027m here on \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e because I know people like to support the creatives whose work they enjoy, and it provides a nice, easy way for them to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, some of you are likely wondering just what this \"Patreon\" is, or, indeed, crowdfunding in general. To put it simply, it allows you to donate\u00a0a specified amount of money to people like me at a regular interval. For example, an artist might allow you to offer a dollar for every piece of work they complete, or a vlogger for every video. I\u0027ve set my campaign to accept monthly donations. You set the amount you want to donate, and that\u0027s what I get at the end of every month. And lots of little donations add up! It\u0027s like getting nibbled to death by ants, only nothing like that at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. Moving on.\u00a0My plan here is to raise money that I can put towards supporting my work, first through covering hostage costs and later by commissioning artists to provide exciting things like character portraits and chapter illustrations. I\u0027d also like to put some money towards hiring a full-time editor; at present, I\u0027m lucky enough to know one who can look over my work in her spare time, but it would be nice if I could pay her a wage for it! And, who knows, maybe one day we can think about publishing Real Actual Books you can hold and everything ... but let\u0027s not get ahead of ourselves XD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you\u0027re already familiar with Patreon, you\u0027ll notice I\u0027m not offering much in the way of \u0027rewards\u0027. This is for two reasons: one, writing what I already publish already eats up a lot of my time, so adding an extra burden of \u0027exclusive backer content\u0027 is just asking for STRESS AND PAIN; and, secondly, because I don\u0027t want to force people to pay up just to read some \u0027exclusive backer content\u0027. I will update the stream from time to time, especially if it involves news related to Patreon goals, but I would rather keep the majority of what I produce Avaliable For All.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, hopefully that clears things up. \u003cem\u003eNow it\u0027s your turn!\u003c/em\u003e Anything you can contribute would be much appreciated and will go a long way towards helping me turn this writing of mine into something that can actually sustain me on a financial level. So what are you waiting for? Dive, my Hawkmen! \u003cem\u003eDIIIIVE\u003c/em\u003e!\u003c/div\u003e"
