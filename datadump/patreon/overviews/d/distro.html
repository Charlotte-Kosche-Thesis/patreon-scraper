I\u0027m currently working on a game called Pixel Ripped (\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://pixelripped.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://pixelripped.com/\u003c/a\u003e ) that will launch soon! Mostly, I like developing stuff that makes people\u0027s (and mine\u0027s) lives easier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis project started when I bought my actual PC, and it came with a copy of Borderlands 2. I saw some tutorials on how to play it splitscreen, and thought it was just too much configuration/too hard to make it everytime, and I wanted to automate everything.\u003cbr\u003eThen SplitScreen Tool was born. Renamed a ton of times, I\u0027m just trying to avoid being confused with anything else, so I got into Nucleus Coop (Nucleus is the name of a game engine I developed with a friend some time ago). I saw potential to add more features and more games, so I just kept on going. Let\u0027s make the entire library of PC games split screen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI love working in the game I\u0027m working, and I love working on Nucleus Coop. I would do everything for free if it was at all possible, but I need to eat and pay rent. I can\u0027t justify right now stopping to work on Nucleus Coop based only on donations; though they helped me a lot it\u0027s really unstable. If I would calculate how much time I spent working and breaking my head on this tool, to what I earned it would be less than a dollar an hour.\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to\u00a0(and wont) monetize this, as I\u0027m all in for open sourcing everything (as I already did) and just really helping the community and people have some good times with whoever they want to play their games with.\u003cbr\u003e"
