We will show the visceral, beautiful, complicated city of Detroit through the eyes of artists in ways that go beyond what can be accomplished in a 90 second news spot. We share a collective story and that story needs to be heard. We will tell it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur vision follows a mission \u201cto create a space and provide resources to educate, empower and inspire communities through accessible communication technologies.\u201d Our goal is to establish a renowned, digitally accessible center for the Detroit artistic community.
