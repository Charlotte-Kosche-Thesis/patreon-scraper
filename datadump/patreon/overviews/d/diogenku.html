    "summary": "Why hello there! My name is Artemis. I am a recent college grad with a BA in English. Art and writing have been my oldest hobbies--basically since I was able to hold a pencil--and I would like to have the freedom to create more. That\u0027s why by becoming my patron, you guarantee me a small income that I can use to pay off student loans, pay rent, and buy food without having to worry so much about my next paycheck, and giving me more time to create!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy writing fantasy, sci-fi, and pretty much anything with a strong emotional heart to it. I love exploring concepts through painting and drawing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals are to finish and publish my zine, \u003cem\u003ePhantasmagoria, \u003c/em\u003ewhich is a collection of poems, prose, and artwork done by our multiple system describing system life; I am also looking to purchase better equipment and software in order to improve my art and create process videos and weekly streams; my biggest goal is to create an art book and publish my first novel. More than anything, I want to have the time and energy to put out content you want to see, and do it quickly. Thank you for supporting me on Patreon! It means more than you can imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind me on twitter @ange_system, on ao3 as diogenku, and on tumblr as navelgazed to learn more about multiplicity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne last thing--you may be asking what it is I\u0027m doing with the income I get? Well, right now, it could go to one of several places: first, I will spend it on necessities, like food and bills. If those are taken care of, the money will go to savings, where I plan to save money for when I graduate from college and move out of my living situation. After that\u0027s done, it it will likely go to saving up for new and better equipment, like a tablet that isn\u0027t falling apart or a computer that isn\u0027t slow as molasses. I will also be using the money to put together certain rewards and giveaway prizes, and using it for projects that require deposits or printing fees. You can rest assured I will be using my funds responsibly!"
