    "summary": "We ask all of our anime and manga friends \"If you ever had a problem with anime and manga of today what would you say would be that problem?\" \u00a0Very often the answer is \"they don\u0027t feel connected to anime anymore because it has been the same formula for years.\" Haven\u0027t you felt so attached to manga and anime since you were a kid but after a while there seems to be a disconnection? We believe we have figured it out. \u00a0Look at what has become of anime. Conventions, cosplay, figures, fandom, games, you name it. \u00a0The problem is that there haven\u0027t been new ideas in the manga world. New characters. New designs. We are aspiring to change that. \u00a0We are a team that can truly say that we have explored at least a small portion of anything manga or anime related and used that experience to formulate a solid new type of manga that our readers will assuredly enjoy. \u00a0Wed are not asking for charging of our works. \u00a0We just need support in making this dream a reality. This manga exist. This idea that has been thoroughly crafted and produced something that our readers would be glad to support. \u00a0We want to show you what the power of the Densetsu no Mangaka is. \u00a0We ask our fans, and friends to help us by giving a small amount of support by donating to this cause. Even a dollar donation is like buying a Marvel comic back in the 80\u0027s. \u00a0Even a dollar for each comic helped Stan Lee become the icon he is."

     "about": "We are Unlikely Heroes!! \u00a0We are artists aspiring to make a manga by the name of Densetsu no Mangaka!!  Life is boring! No not the actual idea of life, just the part where you haven\u0027t figured out what to do with it yet. Boring only to those that are ambitious. Given one skill set and an almost unfathomable love for anime and manga it\u0027s hard to be interested in anything else. This is the case for Aren Alex. Though he possesses the skill in illustration that most would kill for, his interest in pursuing the craft professionally are not there at all due to lack of motivation. An unexpected encounter with a mysterious relic however transports him to a foreign world. In this new world the whisper of one called \"The Creator\" is held high in the legends of old. However, evil is afoot and is rising in power, threatening to take over the land from the shadows in the name of one called \"The Leader\".  Who is this infamous \"Leader\" that everyone speaks of? More importantly how does Aren intend to get back home? Join him on his travels to distant lands, meets new friends, faces new enemies and have more adventures than one can shake a pencil at in this timeless story of friendship and courage as he strives to become more than he has ever imagined he could be on a mission to save the world!!! Don\u0027t forget!!! We will be debuting the manga this year. Follow us to become a part of the fun and catch each release as it happens",
