    "summary": "Hello dear\nguest!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is\n\u003cstrong\u003eDarkPassengerGM\u003c/strong\u003e and I am the creator of the adult game \"\u003cstrong\u003eAngels and\nDemons\u003c/strong\u003e\". You can take the role of a young guy who is full of strength,\nambition, desire and goal to discover the secret of the disappearance of his\nfather, who worked for a major financial company in the city.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe game is\nactively developing, both in the breadth and in depth with every update. Now\nthe game is created mainly for Russian-speaking users, but also noticed the\ninterest of English-speaking users who translate the game through online\ntranslators. As a result, of course the quality of the text suffers, as well as\nsome features of the game itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures of\nthe game.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince I\nmyself am a fan of various games on a similar theme, I initially laid down some\nmandatory parameters that are very important for me:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. \u003cstrong\u003ePASSING.\u003c/strong\u003e\nHow do you sometimes get tired and get lost, what to do to advance the story?\nSearching for forums re-reading a lot of pages is extremely tiring, but you\nwant to just relax in the evening. For each character there are hints on the\npassage, as well as the most important character. Somewhere they are very\nsimple, and somewhere of course a little more complicated. If there is no\nfurther content, you will be informed about this and there will be no need to\nwaste time searching for nonexistent.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2. \u003cstrong\u003eSAVES\u003c/strong\u003e.\nIn many games, every time you update, you have to start all over again. If the\ngame has a lot of versions, then again and again one and the same pass begins\nto annoy. In this game I try to create updates in such a way that I can just\nadd updated files and continue from the previously completed ones.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n3. The rest\ndoes not make sense to list, you yourself can estimate playing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFrom the\nsecond point follows the reason why when using different online translators, can\nlead to the translation of differently different game variables. As a result,\nthe game simply can not be updated normally and will have to go through\neverything in a new way every time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I\npropose?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\nliked and you would like it to exist and develop further, there is an\nopportunity to support the game by joining the Dark Passenger Club. Members of\nthe club receive the latest updates and my thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlso, with\na delay in version 2, the game goes free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eTranslation\nof the game into high-quality English?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnfortunately,\nnow I do not have the opportunity to translate the game into English. The only\npossibility is the use of machine translation. If the interest in the game will\nbe among users, then I will definitely look for opportunities to translate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does the Dark Catcher work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a minimum payment of $ 3, you will get the last published versions, as well as a new one that will be released. The newsletter will be on the e-mail indicated in your profiles.\u003cbr\u003eExample: In free access 0.3, you get 0.4 and 0.5, as well as 0.6, 0.7 when it is created.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you\nfor attention. If you have any questions write, I will definitely try to answer\nthem. I will be grateful for any support.
