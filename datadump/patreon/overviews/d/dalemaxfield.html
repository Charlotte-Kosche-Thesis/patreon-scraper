    "summary": "My name is Dale Maxfield and I am a movie reviewer and video producer. \u00a0My main series right now is a written and video movie review series featured on my web site,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dalemaxfield.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edalemaxfield.com\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0I take my friends to see as many movies as we can every week and we do a video review in the car. \u00a0The written reviews and the first segment of the videos are spoiler-free. \u00a0The remainder of the videos are a discussion of the movie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea behind these reviews is to treat the camera as a friend that we\u0027re pitching the movie to. \u00a0We talk about who we would recommend see the movie. \u00a0On the written review, I also include a handy box that shows if the movie in question is available to stream or purchase. \u00a0This allows you to read and watch older reviews and then go straight to your favorite source and see the movie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you might imagine, taking 2-3 people to several theatrical releases every week is pretty expensive. \u00a0Beyond the ticket prices, there are other kinds of content people have asked me to consider making including classic movie reviews, television and video games. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m not trying to quit my day job.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I just want to be able to allow people who *want* more content from me to have the chance to get it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI want to allow people who like my work to be able to support me any way they want. \u00a0My movie reviews will stay the same: free to read and watch and released as quickly as possible. \u00a0(In most cases, new movie reviews come out early on the same Friday that they open!) \u00a0With Patreon, you can give me a couple of bucks a month and directly support the show. \u00a0Whether that\u0027s $1/month or $100/month it\u0027s you directly supporting the show you like, without putting an advertiser in the middle who neither of us really care about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy not Patreon? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re broke and can\u0027t afford to help financially, that\u0027s completely fine! \u00a0I respect everyone\u0027s time and financial situation. \u00a0If you want to help the show for free you can always leave comments, tell your friends and suggest movies. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you change your mind\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0you can always turn off your subscription. \u00a0If you can\u0027t afford it or no longer like what I\u0027m doing, there\u0027s no obligation to continue. \u00a0You can even change your amount month to month if you want to give me a boost or your wallet a break. \u00a0It\u0027s completely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your interest and for checking out my Patreon campaign!"
