    "summary": "The Dukes have been creating podcasts about board, card and role playing games since August of 2014, and that\u0027s not going to change. We\u0027re going to keep creating awesome content, free of charge. However, we\u0027d love you, our loyal listeners, if you\u0027re so inclined to support us in whatever way you feel is appropriate. Initially, your support will go towards defraying the costs of maintaining the servers for the website and podcast. With additional support, we may be able to defray the costs of review copies of games. With even more support, we\u0027ll have funds to upgrade or replace hardware as it become necessary. Eventually, we\u0027d love to see the level of support grow to a point where you could help send the Dukes to major gaming conventions, to provide amazing, on-scene coverage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind that the Dukes are slowly branching out into video as well as our audio podcast. This Patreon campaign is only for the audio podcast. We produce our show weekly on Mondays, so in a given month that would be four pledges. There would be the occasional month with a 5th Monday, where your number of pledges would increase. Please keep that in mind, and consider using the \"maximum\" pledge option if you want to avoid any unexpected amounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting the Dukes of Dice. We realize that all the growth we\u0027ve experienced is thanks to you, our awesome fans. Game on!"
