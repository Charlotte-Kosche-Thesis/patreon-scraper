All of the terrible products you\u0027d expect from The Worst Things For Sale, laid out in videos that show how terrible they really are. The money from this goal will go towards leasing/buying equipment to allow for video production as well as hiring a camera operator/sound tech so it looks and sounds as good as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to create, at minimum, a weekly five-minute episode of several Worst Things For Sale. Let\u0027s make it happen.",
