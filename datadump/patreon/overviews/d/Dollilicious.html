    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MxF8eH3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello,\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Dolly and I go by Dollilicious! I\u0027m a 22 year old who just graduated in May 2017 with a Bachelor\u0027s of Science degree in Fashion Merchandising and Design focusing in Design. I currently live in Boston, MA but I was originally born in Sydney, Australia! No I do not have an accent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began cosplaying and attending conventions since I was 12 years old. I started making my cosplays when I was around 15 which is also when I began to fall in love with sewing and fashion. I\u0027ve always been into things that have been considered nerdy or geeky since a very young age. Cosplay I feel like it allows me to confidently express that side of myself while also helping me improve on my art which is also my career. Cosplay is very innovative and I\u0027ve learned so much from just making cosplays and bettering my skills as a seamstress. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish to eventually become a costume/fashion designer or conceptual artist for movies and tv shows such as The Flash and or Guardians of the Galaxy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy personality I would explain as very quirky, outgoing, energetic (unless I am food deprived, I love food), I make a lot of strange faces and noises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/w9fapR2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to be able to give back to you guys who support me! \u003c/strong\u003eI have found that patreon has allowed me to connect to my supporters on a more intimate level because with this you are physically joining me/ helping me on my journey to get to the final goal in my life. So it is incredibly important that I make you guys feel appreciated as I possibly can and with patreon I feel like I can do so. Cosplay is super expensive and majority of them especially my bigger and more detailed ones are all handmade by myself. The expenses can add up very quickly, like to even just put Rikku from Final Fantasy together she cost around $250 to make! Larger and more detailed cosplays can cost upwards of $500. So I am truly thankful for patreon and each and everyone of my current subscribers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uCwCwwi.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qwsYJB2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotographer: Athel Cosplay Photography\u003cbr\u003eSword made by: Ganjafett Studios (Bottom Left Photo)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jGyoxTF.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get to see, if I sign up?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDepends on what tier you sign up for!
