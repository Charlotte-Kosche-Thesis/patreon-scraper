I love writing, like borderline addicted to it, and for the\npast two years, I\u0027ve been providing the community with plenty of\nstories from a pretty wide range of genres, writing commissions and\ntrades here and there as well.  I also enjoy reading, playing video\ngames, and listening to Classic Rock to no end.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned above, I love to write. \nWith every letter I type, I put my all into producing stories with\ninteresting genres, plots, and characters that I hope everyone in the\nerotica community will want to read again and again!  There are few\nthings that give me greater joy than writing something I know that at\nleast one person will greatly enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to read my work or\ncommission me, check out the links below. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e-\u003ca href=\"http://doubleosnake.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e-  -\u003ca href=\"http://aryion.com/g4/user/DoubleOSnake\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEka\u0027s Portal\u003c/a\u003e-\u00a0-\u003ca href=\"http://aryion.com/g4/userpage.commission.php?id=DoubleOSnake\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCommission me\u003c/a\u003e-\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I Start a Patreon and Why\nShould You Donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWhy?
