    "summary": "My name is Drew Montgomery and I\u0027m a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my writing these days is science fiction and fantasy, but I like to dabble in other genres from time to time: horror, sports, adventure, thriller, even a little mystery. I write a lot, almost daily for hours at a time, and have pages upon pages of unreleased material. On top of that, I have a day job in an industry I\u0027m super passionate about doing something I enjoy (although not as much as writing). There\u0027s more extraneous information I can give such as how much I love video games and sports and trying new beers and working out, but that\u0027s beside the point. We\u0027re here to talk writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I am a writer, there are a lot of things I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not an artist, and I don\u0027t try to be. I\u0027m an okay editor, but as someone who works in quality assurance, I know firsthand that it\u0027s terrible practice to test your own work because it\u0027s so easy to overlook your own mistakes. I\u0027m not a marketer, and if you check my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dmontgomery008\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e, you can see that I\u0027m not exactly a social media expert either (or consistent with my posting). My Amazon\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amazon.com/author/drewmontgomery\"\u003eauthor\u0027s page\u003c/a\u003e speaks for itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSelling a book is as much about presentation and experience as it is about the narrative. People do in fact judge a book by a cover, and things like typos, inconsistencies, and bad grammar will lead to bad reviews. Marketing gets the word out and consistent social media presence draws in potential readers. Currently, I have none of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s where you come in. Commissioning cover pieces, professional editing, buying ad space - none of this comes cheaply. While I\u0027m not trying to quit my day job with this, I want to bring up the quality level of my work to a point where book sales may one day make it feasible to do so. Not having the money to put forth a quality presentation is the biggest reason I haven\u0027t released anything publicly in several years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get by joining? A unique level of access in my writing process along with the exclusive content that comes with it. New short stories before they\u0027re released in any public forum. Early drafts and exclusive excerpts of works in progress. Glimpses into my worldbuilding and notes process. Blog posts about writing and other general musings. Private Q\u0026amp;As where I\u0027ll answer almost anything. Once I am able to commission artists, this will be the first place those works get posted.\u003cbr\u003e"
