That\u0027s a lot of all-nighters and lots of caffeine. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal has always been just to tell a good story and hone my craft as a cartoonist. \u00a0As such, \"The Draconia Chronicles\" has been and will always be, first and foremost, a labor of love, and will continue to be produced regardless of what you\u0027re willing to pledge. \u00a0There is a lot of time and energy spent on the comic, though--almost as much as a second full-time job in an average week, though with none of the compensation of a \"real\" job. \u00a0By pledging your support here on Patreon, you\u0027ll be helping me with development of new merchandise, equipment maintenance, supply replenishment, occasional convention trips, and perhaps even an eventual expansion of the comic\u0027s staff to bring about more frequent updates and maybe even expand into new media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for your pledge of support! \u00a0Take care, my fellow Draconiacs, and thanks for reading!"
