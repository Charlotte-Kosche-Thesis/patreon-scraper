    "summary": "What started off as a collaboration between mutual friends to start a soft rock band quickly morphed into a journey to create heavy metal. Hector Gonzalez and Michael Hudon brought Colby Brown on board before Day of Rest formed in 2015, and after a couple jam sessions the group knew they wanted to play metal. Not only were the jam sessions way to heavy to be considered soft rock, but they also sounded good. The combined effort between the three created a sound that could only be described as heavy metal. Hector, Michael and Colby broke off from the soft rock venture to pursue heavy metal. Day of Rest worked through trying to find a rhythm guitarist and drummer for nearly a year before Michael committed to playing drums and performing lead heavy vocals. For the next year the group worked on their self titled EP Day of Rest. During that time, the three grew to become friends. In 2017 Day of Rest began gigging in Central and Western Oregon. They released their EP in July 2017 and look toward their first full length album. The group remains independent and is unsigned. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe group is named based of the concept that there is no real day of rest from this life until departure through death. It\u0027s recognizable similarity to the religious phrase for the sabbath or holy day is no coincidence. Each member either grew up in a christian or catholic church. That influence carries forward, but in a individual way for each member - as it should be for any belief. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDay of Rest has been described as wizard metal, or as another listener described \"it made me think of the dark ages.\" Others have named the group\u0027s music as heavily technical, without one piece of the group overpowering the other. Regardless, Day of Rest aim to produce heavy metal that will invoke involuntary head banging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a way to support us while we make our music. Thanks for reading and supporting!"
