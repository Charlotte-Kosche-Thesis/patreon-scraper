I\u0027m a rock/metal guitarist in NYC who also has a passion for video games and is hugely inspired by composers like Nobuo Uematsu, Koji Kondo, and Inon Zur, as well as guitarists like Van Halen, Aj Minette \u0026amp; Dean Herrara, Mark Okubo, and Dimebag Darrell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my YouTube page a few years ago and casually released videos every few months, but since becoming a full time musician, composer, and teacher, I\u0027ve decided to kick it up a notch and start releasing video game cover songs (and other videos) on a regular basis (monthly at first, hopefully more frequent as time goes on.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read this and visit my page. I hope my tunes bring you at least a couple of minutes of joy when you listen to them, and whether or not you decide to become a patron, I look forward to making music for you :)"
