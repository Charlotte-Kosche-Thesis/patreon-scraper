    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Doc, a writer with the dream of publishing and distributing her own original works. I am also a novel length fanfiction writer, the author of Reign Down, Arts and Sanctuary, and Rolling Away. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been writing fanfiction for about 11 years across multiple fandoms. At the moment, I focus primarily on fantasy fanfiction with a specific focus on Harry Potter. I enjoy working on these stories and greatly appreciate the fanbase I\u2019ve managed to obtain that love these stories as much as I do. Most of my fanfiction follows a similar theme, a darker more gritty alternate take on characters and scenarios with a heavier focus on cultural and magical themes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use these works to sharpen and test my skills and writing ability. Fanfiction has been a great and enjoyable past time to practice my unique style and narrative. I\u2019d like to use Patreon as a space for those who enjoy my style to read updated works, addendums, and upcoming fiction here first (often two-three days before the work is uploaded to public websites). This will not impact my desire to upload my writing to Ao3 or Fanfiction.net, and my fanfiction will still be uploaded there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patreon supporter will give fans hungry for more content the ability to see it first or watch, live time, when I begin to work on my fiction, along with the ability to see content not yet posted to fanfiction.net, other pieces of fiction that may become (and possibly remain) Patreon content only. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will also become a space where I will update and alert those who enjoy my writing on the original story I\u2019ve been working on since 2014, the story I\u2019d like to get published or serialized someday (genre: urban supernatural fantasy with a focus on otherworldly creatures).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon campaign is meant for those who wish to donate and support all aspects of my writing and have a greater impact on the works I may release in the future (in the form of polls or short story challenges). I tend to write between 5k-10k per chapter or short story for any of my works and while I want to provide exclusive fun perks here my fanfiction writing will always remain free. One can expect that I would update and provide my writing between 1-4 times a month, with donations only being accepted once the final edited piece is uploaded to Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support and interest in my development as a writer. \u003cbr\u003e"
