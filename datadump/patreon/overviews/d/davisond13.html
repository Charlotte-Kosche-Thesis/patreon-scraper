    "summary": "If you don\u0027t already know, my name is Derek, and in addition to freelance work and occasional appearances on Alhurra TV, I write a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://attwiw.com\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e called \"and that\u0027s the way it was.\" You can also follow me on Twitter:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dwdavison9318\"\u003e@dwdavison9318\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"and that\u0027s the way it was\" is dedicated to helping people make sense of the world, especially but not limited to the Middle East. I\u0027ve spent several years studying American government and foreign policy, and several more learning about and working in the Middle East, and one of the things I\u0027ve noticed is that it\u0027s hard for most Americans to get a good handle on these places. That\u0027s partly because our media is frequently more concerned with tracking Donald Trump\u0027s Twitter feed than it is with covering very serious stories that happen every day all around the world, and partly because we tend to confine expertise about distant places and foreign peoples to specialized academic fields, with little of that knowledge ever filtering out of those niches. This makes it very easy for our foreign policy to be hijacked by forces that want perpetual war, a massive military state, and the continued forcible expansion of American empire. People can\u0027t fight back against something they don\u0027t know is there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying to change that. I write about the history of the Middle East, North Africa, and elsewhere in a way that I hope is accessible and enjoyable and helps people understand the context behind what they might hear in the news. I track international news all day and compile it into nightly digests for people who want to know what\u0027s happening but don\u0027t have time to seek out the world news that\u0027s too-often buried under an avalanche of domestic news (and noise). I look for other perspectives on world events and U.S. foreign policy that can\u0027t necessarily be found in the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e or the \u003cem\u003eWashington Post\u003c/em\u003e and try to bring those perspectives to you. If people naturally fear the unknown, then the antidote to that is knowledge. If ignorance breed apathy, then the solution is less ignorance. That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do this work at my blog, which is free to anyone because if my goal is to inform people then it would be counterproductive to lock that work up behind a paywall. But I need your help to keep going. If you read this and think it sounds like something worthwhile, please support it with an ongoing monthly contribution. Even $1/month helps. And I don\u0027t come empty-handed! For $1/month you get access to my weekly \"ask me anything\" feature here at Patreon, where I answer your questions about anything, as long as it\u0027s something I actually can answer. For $5/month you get to request a longer-form essay on the topic of your choice. I try to write one of these per week but I confess that\u0027s more a goal than a reality; but I do get to everybody\u0027s requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $3/month you\u0027ll get access to the attwiw podcast, which recaps and contextualizes the day\u0027s main story or stories from around the world. I record them as time allows and events dictate, so we\u0027re not on a regular schedule (yet) but as you\u0027ll see they go out fairly frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy new goal is to take some of the writers whose work informs attwiw, and maybe even some who are doing good work in entirely unrelated areas, and bring them to the blog directly. I won\u0027t do that unless I can offer them some compensation for their work, so this is my plan when the Patreon crosses the $2000/month threshold. Beyond that, who knows? A major website redesign? A more user-friendly and interactive way to get to the good stuff? With your support all these things can be possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to those of you who have already contributed! I hope we can continue to grow this effort into something that can truly change the way Americans see the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e"
