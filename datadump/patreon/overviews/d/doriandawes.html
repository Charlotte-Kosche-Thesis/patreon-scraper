    "summary": "Contact Info: doriandawes@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s often been said that horror is the primary means by which we can vicariously experience and confront our fears. Indeed, the best horror has been known to take things that we are truly afraid of that extend beyond the mere monster of the week and into the monsters of our brains, anxieties, social issues, and other such terrors of the human condition. Unfortunately, within the mainstream horror has long excluded LGBT+ and queer individuals from many of these narratives. As a queer writer and horror aficionado, I\u0027d like to work to change this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLGBT fiction is predominantly filled with tragic melodramies, romcoms, and sad coming out stories and while each of these are valid they do not make up the whole of the queer experience. We experience horror and fears in our daily lives just as much as everyone else, and like every individual group, we bring our own personal terrors to the table. My goal is to create horror fiction that is both imaginative and terrifying that also features queer people at the forefront.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur stories are not limited to melodrama, and we have every right to have a chance to gaze into the face of the dark abyss, or save the world from an alien menace. We are superheroes and victims, monsters and humans, just like everyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help me in fabricating stories of LGBT people not commonly found within the mainstream. Horror and dark fantasy fiction that goes beyond the traditional coming out narrative and explores the full breadth of human experience that we share. Together we can create entire tapestries and worlds not yet seen before.\u003cbr\u003e"
