I also love art and often draw, take pictures, or paint. Having my kids, I became a stay at home mom, which I love. I wanted an outlet, however, for my desire to work with animals as well as a way to express my artistic side, thus DBB and Friends was born. My vision for DBB and Friends is to have a comical, family-friendly, educational, fun channel that everyone can enjoy. My husband, kids, and cousin are a HUGE part of what DBB has accomplished so far and I could not be realizing this dream without them.  We work together for each and every video to make it become a reality. It has been a great adventure so far and I look forward to creating more videos and spreading the joy that is pets and family. Please join us in our journey, we would love to have you!"
