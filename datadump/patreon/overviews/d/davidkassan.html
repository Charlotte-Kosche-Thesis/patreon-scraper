In January\n2017, I traveled with videographer Chloe to Los\nAngeles from NYC to meet with eleven Survivors of Auschwitz so that we could\ntake my current series of paintings of Survivors of the Shoah to the next\nlevel. This newest painting will be a life-sized representation of all eleven\nSurvivors of Auschwitz and will be approximately 18 feet long and 8 feet high. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDocumenting. \u003c/strong\u003eChloe and I have been filming interviews with all of the Survivors in\nthe series in order to document their lives and inspiring words. We are also\ngoing to film each step of the process in the creation of this large painting in\norder to educate about the artistic journey as well as the journeys of the\nSurvivors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI need your support. \u003c/strong\u003eWorking through a two-year project like this is risk for an artist and for this\nreason I need your help to make this happen. This painting is not a\ncommissioned painting. There is no guarantee of its sale, only a guarantee of\nits impact. The scale, complexity and meaning of this painting will make it a\npiece of art that cannot be ignored. When completed, there will be a painting\nas well as a film that will educate and inspire. At this moment, I do have\nsome funding from the USC Fisher Museum of Art and the USC Shoah Foundation as well as an Exhibition planned for\nthe Spring of 2019 at the Fisher Museum. In these early stages I have been running into a lot of\ncosts that I hadn\u0027t considered in advance; crating, shipping, video editing,\nweb site development, writing, travel and lodging expenses. Your support will\nhelp me to make all of these expenses disappear! Most importantly, your support\nwill let me know that you believe in this project and that you want to be a\npart of this meaningful and timely initiative. In the spring of 2019, we can\nall celebrate together at the Fisher Museum of Art opening, you guys are all\ninvited!!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeeting with Survivors of Auschwitz at the Museum of Tolerance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://edut.davidkassan.com/bw.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ephoto by Andy Romanoff\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the digital painting thumbnail for composition purposes.

These mediums place a barrier between the\nviewer and the subject, whereas the richness and tactile feel of a painting\nbreaks through to us as humans. These works are handmade, imperfect, life-sized\nand speak to what the survivor has been through, what they\u2019ve overcome, and the\nhard work in their lives after the atrocities. These paintings speak to us in a\ndeeply connected way and inspire with each survivor\u2019s strength. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking on \"Love and Resilience, Louise and Lazar Farkas.\" oil on panel, life-sized. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://edut.davidkassan.com/love.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe number of survivors from the war\u2013both who simply lived through it\nand those who suffered at its most terrible expressions\u2013has dwindled to the low\nhundreds of thousands, and that number shrinks daily. The stories of Holocaust\nsurvivors, their suffering and the lives they\u2019ve carved out for themselves,\ndeserve to be told. They remind all societies to counter not just\nanti-Semitism, but all forms of intolerance. This intimate face of the\nHolocaust teaches us how to protect, promote and defend human rights in today\u2019s\nworld. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Connection.\u003c/strong\u003e In 1917, a young Murray Kassan immigrated to the United States, escaping ethnic\ncleansing on the border of the Ukraine and Romania by the Cossacks. Murray was\nmy grandfather, and his story of survival is a vague unfocused legend in my\nfamily for many reasons. When my father was fifteen years old, Murray was\nestranged from the family and my father never saw him again. He passed away\nwhen I was very little and I never got to meet him, his story of survival is\nnow only fragmented memories. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPainting for me is also my way of understanding the world around me, my way of\nconnecting, and my excuse to interact and learn. In this project, it\u2019s my\npersonal way of connecting to my grandfather\u2019s lost story. With every survivor\u2019s\nstory that I hear and record into a painting, I feel that I move closer to the\nconnection with my grandfather that I never had. My brush paints a link between\nus.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThese paintings represent the perseverance and the strength of the human\nspirit. I endeavor to respect and show the dignity of each survivor and tell\nhis or her story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://davidkassan.com/edut/supporters.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://davidkassan.com/edut/supporters.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://edut.davidkassan.com/supporters.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://sfi.usc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUSC Shoah Foundation\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.jerrygoldsteinfoundation.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fisher.usc.edu/\"\u003eUSC Fisher Museum of Art\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Jerry Goldstein Foundation\u003cbr\u003eThe Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.museumoftolerance.com/site/c.tmL6KfNVLtH/b.9052747/k.BEE4/Home.htm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMuseum of Tolerance - Los Angeles\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
