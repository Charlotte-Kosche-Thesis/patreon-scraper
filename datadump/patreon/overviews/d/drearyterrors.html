    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/9aWBeY3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Justin Coates, and I\u0027ve been writing since I was old enough to clumsily clasp a crayon in my grubby toddler fingers. When I was 18 I joined the United States Army as an Airborne Infantryman and marched off to Afghanistan. Five years and two combat tours later, I\u0027m a published horror anthology author living with my wife, kid and annoying chihuahua in the Metro Detroit area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeployment experience gave me plenty of inspiration for the two genres I\u0027ve loved since I was a kid: horror and military science fiction. I grew up on \"Starship Troopers\" (the book, the movie and even the TV show),\"Hellboy\" comics, and anything written by Stephen King. Currently I\u0027m reading the most excellent work of authors like Daniel Arensen and David Weber.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to create stories full of hardcore military action mixed with hefty doses of terror. I want you to feel the heat of the .50 cal barrel as its operator guns down a horde of shrieking monstrosities, smell the scent of gunpowder lingering in the air after a ferocious firefight in the bowels of some abandoned research facility, and feel the same rush of adrenaline that a Special Forces team leader feels as he leads his team into combat against beings that have no right to exist outside of a nightmare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, all the stories that you\u0027ll read take place in the exact same universe. The world each tale takes place within is quite similar to our own...aside from the horrors lurking on the other side of reality and the organizations and individuals dedicated to stopping them. You\u0027ll become familiar with the secretive D.S.R.D, the tireless works of agents like the mysterious John Hauser, and the wise-cracking undead infantrymen of Project: REVENANT.\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/G6Gsgzz.jpg\" style=\"width: 336px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become one of my Patrons, you get in on the story before it hits Amazon or anywhere else. My goal is to eventually publish a collection of these stories, and when I do, I\u0027ll include shout outs to all my patrons as well as a free copy of the collection for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m much obliged to you even stopping by my page. If you don\u0027t want to enlist, feel free to stick around and read/comment on my blog posts (which are always free).
