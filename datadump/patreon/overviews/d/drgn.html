    "summary": "Hi. This page is a way for you to offer support for my work, based closely on the actual content I create. This is different than a donation via PayPal or something like Kickstarter; rather than a one-time donation, you can give based on a per-creation or per-software-update basis. (And don\u0027t worry, you can put a monthly limit on it, in case I were to ever go crazy and create all the things.) That also means that if I don\u0027t release anything for a while, you\u0027re not donating during that time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuick backstory:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nstarted learning how to hack SSBM because of a particular [as of yet unreleased] Melee related project. It was quite a different scene then, and I quickly realized two things:\n1) that there were many processes that were surprisingly unrefined and tedious, and 2) that\nI could certainly do something about it. So I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo what do I do?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the most part, I\u0027ve been working on a\nfew programs to help myself and others quickly and easily mod their copy of Melee. The most\nprominent of which are -\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://smashboards.com/threads/new-tools-for-texture-hacking-update-dtw-4-2-released-32-bit.373777/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDAT Texture Wizard (DTW)\u003c/a\u003e: A program for\nreplacing files and textures. Texture hacking was an involved and slow process before\nthis. Needless to say, it\u0027s a definite game changer. Follow the link to see\nscreenshots and more explanation of everything it can do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://smashboards.com/threads/melee-code-manager-easily-add-codes-to-your-game.416437/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMelee Code Manager (MCM)\u003c/a\u003e: This provides a\ngreat amount of management, simplification, and debugging aid to both amateurs\nand pros alike for ASM coding. Exemplarily nifty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve also been using my programming experience and\nunderstanding of the game to tackle other various kinds of hacks and expand on\nwhat\u2019s possible. There are a good number of things I\u2019ve discovered, written\nguides for, and shared. For example, my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://smashboards.com/threads/official-melee-texture-hack-thread.361190/page-72#post-20892475\"\u003eUnique Closed Ports\u003c/a\u003e hack (which\nallows you to use a different -and higher quality- texture for each port). There\nare multiple unique aspects of that hack that open up a lot of potential\nin other areas of hacking the game. Increasing/reducing the amount of space available\nfor a texture or other parts of a file structure, and changing textures\u2019 sizes/types, are a few examples.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther examples of my non-programming related work include my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://smashboards.com/threads/official-melee-texture-hack-thread.361190/page-113#post-21638786\"\u003eIce Climbers Combat Uniforms\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://smashboards.com/threads/official-melee-texture-hack-thread.361190/page-80#post-21109218\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFrost Kong\u003c/a\u003e costumes,\u00a0CSPs (for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://smashboards.com/threads/the-complete-csp-compendium.380315/#post-18154046\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eZelda/Sheik\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://smashboards.com/threads/the-complete-csp-compendium.380315/page-3#post-18248055\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSamus\u003c/a\u003e), and SSS cursors (see packs\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://smashboards.com/threads/official-melee-texture-hack-thread.361190/page-56#post-20285272\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://smashboards.com/threads/official-melee-texture-hack-thread.361190/page-67#post-20637784\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e). You can seem more costumes I\u0027ve made on my Modulous page,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://modulous.net/profile/DRGN\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. And I often help others with their texture hacks. But the donations you provide would really only be for large updates to my main programs or bigger things like the Unique Closed Ports, not small stuff like costumes/CSPs or even small program updates such as for bug fixes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do all of these activities have in common,\nbesides being awesome? Time. They unfortunately take a\nlot of it. DTW alone is over 10,000 lines of\ncode, and that and MCM are certainly not everything I\u2019ve written for Melee. Many in the\ncommunity wish we could do this stuff as our job, but of course there\u2019s not\nquite that much demand for this. So instead I have a full-time job, as well as\ngo to school, and still deal with friends/family and life demands, which doesn\u2019t\nleave much leftover time. I\u2019m actually taking a few less classes now, so I have more time to invest in projects such as these. It would be great if I\ncould actually get a part-time job instead and have more free time. That is my\nhope!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy supporting me, there\u0027s something else\nthat you\u2019re giving besides a dollar amount, something that\u2019s hard\nto describe, but amazing nonetheless. It\u2019s the realization of just how much my\nwork helps and means to others. I didn\u2019t expect some of the thanks and responses I\u0027ve gotten, but it\u0027s really pretty cool, and motivates me to keep making new things. Ultimately, I mostly do these things because of you guys out there.\u00a0So seriously, thank you!"
