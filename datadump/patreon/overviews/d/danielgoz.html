    "summary": "Economy Week has the potential to become \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0go-to source for airline economy class comparisons. With the time and expertise, I can do back-to-back trips comparing the world\u0027s biggest and most interesting airlines. The only obstacle? Money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. If you value Economy Week and the knowledge you will gain from it, I would be incredibly grateful if you could help support the show and help make it sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you and as always, you guys are the best!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHow much can you help?\u003cbr\u003eAny level of donation is greatly appreciated. $5 can be enough for a snack during a short layover, $15 can get me an Uber to the airport, and $100 will pay for a night of much-needed rest between back-to-back economy flights. Of course, the total will ultimately go toward paying the flights.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy not just get a sponsor?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027d love for my favorite travel brands to eventually support Economy Week in some way, I do not want to become like some large aviation YouTubers *cough* who are uploading entire videos to promote products they don\u0027t even use or dedicating two minutes in the middle of a video to promoting something.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eHow come you can\u0027t use the miles you pay for business class on these economy flights?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMany airlines do not offer mileage redemptions through the programs of other airlines, and even if they do, rates may be outrageous. In the cases where it would be possible, this would mean the elimination of my premium reviews. Nothing brings me more joy than shooting those videos and getting aspirational use from my miles, so if I had to choose between Economy Week or continuing to redeem for premium flights, it would be the latter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can economy class flights cost so much?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you look at a standard round-trip between Europe and the US, it\u0027s usually around $400 nowadays. To compare three different airlines, that would make the cost at least $1200 + hotels, transport, and food. Costs rack up quickly as I noticed with this first series!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
