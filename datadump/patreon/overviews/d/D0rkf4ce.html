I\u0027ve created hundreds of works of art ranging from drawings, to paintings, to comics and mixed media. I used to be in a band a few years ago named Take Back Your Hero. That really brought me alive when it came to music and being on stage. It was a beautiful experience! These days I have been performing solo and I took up the guitar to back up my vocals. I\u0027d like to make recordings for my list of songs and what I have dubbed, liquid poetry. I\u0027d like to finish my album and make it readily available to the public. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I was lucky enough to be a part of my friend Wes Cole\u0027s movie project, \"Playing Warhol\" and I helped to provide music thoughout the movie. It was such a fun and exciting experience! ^_^!\u003cbr\u003eYou can see the preview for it here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JxRH4KKJwY\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JxRH4KKJwY\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is some of my comics series:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw4GrGCXxjg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw4GrGCXxjg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...music:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBiQU16DbWQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBiQU16DbWQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and music videos:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEsWa6hRMSc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEsWa6hRMSc\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need help to fund masterpieces of art that I have never had the opportunity to create.
