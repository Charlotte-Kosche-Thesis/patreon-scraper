While I love me some good thrillers, I grew up devouring all sorts of sci-fi, space operas in particular. I used to run around my Mom\u0027s kitchen yelling, \u003cem\u003e\"I\u0027m givin\u0027 her all she\u0027s got, Captain!\"\u003c/em\u003e Or, when I\u0027d finally snapped her last nerve and she was heading at me with the \"shoe\" Warp Factor 10 I\u0027d yell, \u003cem\u003e\"Beam me up, Scottie!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eIt\u0027s a \u003cem\u003eNew Frontier\u003c/em\u003e for me! So, naturally with all those show in my head, I figured I\u0027d been trained properly to write in the genre. I can\u0027t tell you how excited that I had this epiphany! I love writing my thrillers, twisted in hidden historical facts that I just love digging up, but, come on! We\u0027re talking sci-fi! I\u0027m a kid, all over again and I hope you take this journey into the \u003cem\u003enot-so-final frontier\u003c/em\u003e with me! Read on to see the details.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sJVRX5P.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing new to the genre, most of my thriller fans aren\u0027t interested in sci-fi space operas like I am. I still shed tears over the cancellation of Firefly\u2014and don\u0027t even get me started about Dark Matter! It seemed like once I found an alternate universe I could live in, those danged Producer\u00a0Gods would take it away! Star Trek and Star Wars just don\u0027t put out often enough to keep me happily buried in the stars!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI needed a world that I could escape to, and count on being there. What better way to do that than to create my own?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of scaring away my thriller fans who really love Jack Elliot, I thought it would be a great idea to find some new peeps that were onboard with my quest, who really enjoy a good romp in space. Patreon seemed like the best place to launch that ship!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4ZzGg2z.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted this to be \u003cem\u003ehella-affordable\u003c/em\u003e for readers that join my journey. As a Space Cadet, you\u0027ll get to join the Scarab Reign for $2.50 a month! You\u0027ll be able to read the entire trilogy for just $10!\u003cbr\u003eThis is a journey, not a space \u003cstrong\u003epirate hit\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you come along for the entire space flight, the total of the three books will end up costing you $10.00, over 30% savings when the books actually launch elsewhere at booksellers! And if you are quick to check my rewards section and get in before a limited number of people, you\u0027ll have a good chance at getting your name in the acknowledgments page of the books ANDa copy of all three personalized paperbacks for FREE! That\u0027s $45 worth of paperbacks for the cost of $10!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eI\u0027d buy that for a dollar!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eCnR23p.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be officially launching The Scarab Reign Trilogy in the Spring of 2018. Once that happens the trilogy journey of this series will be over and it will come down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all goes well and you guys like the new world I\u0027ve created, I\u0027ll be doing another 3 books that same way I did these, so my patrons will get to continue in the world. \u003cem\u003e(Remember what I said earlier about needing an escape? Help me do it! I promise not to leave you hanging.)\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I will publish a \u003cem\u003enew chapter each week\u003c/em\u003e up until mid-April. After that point due to Amazon\u0027s exclusivity program I\u0027ll be required to take this trilogy down. If all goes well here, I can take it out of the program so new cadets can sign up and experience the journey you\u0027re about to go on, instead of paying full price at Amazon. But for you guys that have already joined, you can look forward to the next saga!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Xg9q5CF.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve started using a wonderful service called Bookfunnel. They offer just any format you can think of so you\u0027ll be able to read The Scarab Reign on whatever device you normally read on. Don\u0027t worry! The Peeps at Bookfunnell are super helpful if you have questions, which I doubt you will. The process is really simple, seriously. The spell it out for you and off round-the-clock support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1Ga0oMo.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are a few reasons. I\u0027ve been kicking this idea around the stars for quite some time. The problem was I didn\u0027t have a project that would fit nicely and benefit readers until now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, as an author I\u0027m mainly exclusive with Amazon. This is a common author thing that most of us are trying to break. Amazon, while being one of the greatest buy options for readers and also a good platform for writers, it can be frustrating for reasons I won\u0027t bore you with. I\u0027ll just say that we\u0027ve all had that \u003cem\u003e\"boss\"\u003c/em\u003e in our careers that we wished we hadn\u0027t had! I know all you hard-working folks know what I\u0027m talking about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd...this is just plain old fun!!! I\u0027ve really enjoyed doing this and I hope you really enjoy participating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHappy Reading Everyone! I\u0027ll see ya in The Scarab Reign!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

I\u0027m really good at creating covers and art, but, \u003cem\u003e\u0027I\u0027m a writer Jim, not a graphic artist!\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0so I think it\u0027s best to leave this to the pros.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fun part for you as a patron is that you\u0027ll have a direct hand in helping create a cover that has a potential of reaching thousands of fans when the book is officially launched.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a \u003cstrong\u003esuper\u003c/strong\u003e huge reward for a bunch of lucky space-faring patrons, I\u0027ll be mentioning their names in the acknowledgments page of both the ebook and physical copies. You\u0027ll be in print out there in the world forever!\u00a0\u003cem\u003e(Unless they don\u0027t want the recognition that is, of course! Totally up to them!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eCheck out the rewards section - these spots will go \u003cem\u003equick\u003c/em\u003e! I\u0027m not sure how many more I can do once the program is underway, so don\u0027t miss out! Some will be able to get copies of ALL three books! It\u0027s a NEBULA of a deal!\u003c/div\u003e",

I can\u0027t begin to tell you how hard it is to try and edit something that you\u0027ve written. My brain skips over the mistakes to make the read quicker because it\u0027s already in my head! \u003cem\u003e(Thanks for the help, brain!)\u003c/em\u003e It\u0027s quite frustrating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that doesn\u0027t mean I won\u0027t polish the work as best as I can get it.
