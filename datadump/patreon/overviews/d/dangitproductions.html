The goal of this channel is to provide entertainment for everyone with a diversity of content, as well as keep my friends and I from splitting apart with our film shoots. I hope that the videos on the DangITPro channel will be able to reach and touch as many people as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat (is the channel about)?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDangIT Productions is\na YouTube channel first created by me, Justin. Inspired by my favorite YouTube channel\nat the time, the content on DangITPro originally consisted of only video blogs (or \"vlogs\" for short) and skits.\nThe channel further expanded with the experimentation of different genres\nof video, adding \u201cRandom Videos\u201d to our repertoire of content (In other words, we\u0027ll put something out there that doesn\u0027t necessarily adhere to what the channel normally posts). When one of our\nvaluable members on the team left for his Mormon mission, we added podcasts to\nthe list in order to keep the remaining members together, not just as a team,\nbut as friends. Later down the line, I decided to try out reaction videos,\nwhich has greatly contributed to DangITPro\u2019s popularity, however the reaction videos have been discontinued due to legal reasons and because of our disinterest in creating them. Then we included\ngameplay into DangIT Productions\u2019 bag of video content and we hope to add more\nvarying types of videos further down the line!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhen (did you get into making video content and when did the channel start up)?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI got interested in\nmaking videos back in 2011 when I took a multi-media class on the basics of\nfilm making. Taking the subsequent course after that one and graduating from high\nschool, I collaborated with a few friends of mine at the time and formed DangIT\nProductions in the summer of 2012. We\u2019ve been making video content ever since\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy\n(support DangIT Productions)?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eGood question! Why? Well if you do support us, not only will you receive the rewards, the recognition, and a lock of Gabriel\u0027s hair (Wait a minute, I don\u0027t remember writing this...), but you\u0027ll also be part of something that you can say you\u0027ve been a part of with your donation. You\u0027ll see the continue rise of the channel and know that you helped with that growth. Think of it like the first time you grow fruits or vegetables in your obligatory digital garden. A wonderful feeling of accomplishment when you see them after everything they\u0027ve been through, yes? The only difference is that we actually talk instead of wait to be devoured. Okay, maybe not so much think of it as food...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow (will my money be used should I donate to DangITPro)?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money you donate as a patron will be used to fund future projects for the channel. We\u0027ll use it to purchase more equipment like cameras, microphones, lighting, etc. that will help out in all of our future filming projects. We will also use the money to purchase props and costumes for future skits and parodies. In addition, your money will help us afford the games that you, the fans/patrons, ask us to do Let\u0027s Plays of. In short, your donations will allow us to take our video ideas to greater heights and make them a reality!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eOne last thing...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen making the decision as to either donate to us or not, remember this: No matter what you choose to do, the videos on DangITPro will always be available for viewing (restrictions, privating and deletion explanations aside). We will never force you to pay for the content on DangIT Productions (Unless you\u0027re watching from YouTube Red, which is a monthly subscription to all YouTube content as a whole). Also DON\u0027T support us if you don\u0027t have to funds to afford it. One should only donate to DangITPro if you truly enjoy the content and don\u0027t mind spending a dollar or two to help our cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
