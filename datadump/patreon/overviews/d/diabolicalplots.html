     "about": "Diabolical Plots has been publishing nonfiction since 2008, reviews and interviews, best of podcast lists, con reports, and such.  In 2013, we expanded to offer the Submission Grinder, a tool for writers to find new markets, to learn response times of markets, and to track their own submissions.  In 2015 we are expanding into exciting new territory: publishing original fiction. \u00a0 The first story is already published,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.diabolicalplots.com/dp-fiction-1-taste-the-whip-by-andy-dudak/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Taste the Whip\" by Andy Dudak\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what we publish, or you like what the Submission Grinder does, please consider donating either through Patreon or PayPal.  One-time donations are great, but recurring donations are more important \u00a0At the start of this campaign we have enough recurring PayPal donations to balance our hosting costs, but not to balance the costs of publishing fiction or to pursue bigger and better things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first goal is to reach a level where we can sustain the publication rate we are publishing now. \u00a0Other goals will expand that fiction in volume and in formats--expanding to a podcast and ebooks as the levels go up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are still working on \u00a0goals and donation incentives.  Feel free to suggest any that we might be able to provide.  Thanks so much.",
