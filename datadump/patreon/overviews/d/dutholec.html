Why don\u0027t you help them get their own apartment?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eDuth Olec\u003c/strong\u003e (on the internet, anyway). I\u0027m the author of the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://dutholeccuckooland.wordpress.com/about/about-the-cloudy-cuckoo-cosmos/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCloudy Cuckoo Cosmos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, a series of humorous, adventuresome stories of a scale so grand that it could be used to weigh trucks. My goal is to write novels, write short stories, write weird things, and it would be a whole lot easier if I could live off it so I wouldn\u0027t have to spend time doing boring lame things like answer phones to get an income. Wanna help me out?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides being focused on \u003cstrong\u003ehumor\u003c/strong\u003e, my stories all have elements of \u003cstrong\u003escience fiction\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003efantasy\u003c/strong\u003e, because they\u0027re in \u003cem\u003eanother univerrrse\u003c/em\u003e! ... \u003cem\u003ewithout humaaans\u003c/em\u003e! Everything in the stories are from my own mind--the worlds, the cities, the \u003ca href=\"https://dutholeccuckooland.wordpress.com/cloudy-cuckoo-cosmos/species/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecreatures\u003c/a\u003e, the events, the \u003ca href=\"https://dutholeccuckooland.wordpress.com/cloudy-cuckoo-cosmos/characters/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echaracters\u003c/a\u003e (more or less...). Some of them also have quite a bit of \u003cstrong\u003eadventure\u003c/strong\u003e to them, as well. You can see \u003cstrong\u003eall the novels \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve written so far on my \u003ca href=\"https://dutholeccuckooland.wordpress.com/cloudy-cuckoo-cosmos/novels/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027m a big fan of \u003cstrong\u003efree stuff\u003c/strong\u003e. Who isn\u0027t? So my novels are made available in two ways. Your patronage will fuel the first one, which is the early and free postings--every \u003cstrong\u003emonth\u003c/strong\u003e I will post the next section from my next novel or a short story, basically releasing them as a \u003cstrong\u003eserial\u003c/strong\u003e. As I release one chapter a month, patrons can give me money each month. That money will help me pay for, well, life, but it will also help me pay for expenses related to the stories, such as the second way they\u0027re available: \u003cstrong\u003ebooks\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe chapters and \u003ca href=\"https://dutholeccuckooland.wordpress.com/cloudy-cuckoo-cosmos/short-stories/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eshort stories\u003c/a\u003e I post online are edited thoroughly by myself and sometimes given to others to look at ahead of time. When I finish stories to be sold as \u003cstrong\u003epaper books\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ee-books\u003c/strong\u003e, though, it goes through a \u003cem\u003eprofessional editor\u003c/em\u003e. And that\u0027s not cheap, y\u0027know, so you\u0027re helping make these books more \u003cstrong\u003eamazing\u003c/strong\u003e! These paper books and e-books won\u0027t be free, but all patrons will get a code for free copies of the ebooks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Cloudy Cuckoo Cosmos is more than just novels and short stories, though--or, at least, it will be if we can make some cool \u003cstrong\u003emilestones\u003c/strong\u003e. Right now this includes... well, \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e novels and short stories, but as things kick into higher gear I\u0027ll be able to do some cool stuff like a \u003cstrong\u003eCloudy Cuckoo Cosmail Comic\u003c/strong\u003e where characters from my novels answer e-mails you can send in. I hope to come up with more ideas as time goes on. There\u0027s also \u003cstrong\u003ecool stuff\u003c/strong\u003e just for patrons, including free copies of books and weekly updates on whatever it is I\u0027ve been working on that week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreating fun things\u003c/strong\u003e is my favorite thing to do in all of space and time, and if people \u003cstrong\u003eenjoy\u003c/strong\u003e it, that makes it all the much better. Even if you don\u0027t \u003cstrong\u003ebecome \u003c/strong\u003ea patron, I thank you for dropping by and giving me a look. Unless it\u0027s a nasty look. I hope you like the writing I \u003cstrong\u003edo\u003c/strong\u003e, though, and there\u0027s always more to come. I\u0027ll keep writing. I won\u0027t \u003cstrong\u003elet \u003c/strong\u003eeven \u003cem\u003edeath \u003c/em\u003estop me there.\u003cbr\u003e"
