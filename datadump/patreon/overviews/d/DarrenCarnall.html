I was a financial advisor many years ago, advising people on their savings and life insurance (yawn) ...when out of nowhere my childhood epilepsy came back with a vengeance... and in an instant I lost my driving licence, got signed off work.... and didn\u0027t know what to do next. I spent the next ten years of my life pretty much doing nothing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankfully this made me take up art again as a hobby, and slowly.. over the years... I\u0027ve managed to build it up into \u0027what I do\u0027 for a living. I\u0027ve gained a bit of a name for myself with my repaints, and my work is in collections all around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe epilepsy was the best thing that ever happened to me.

No new drawings, no new paintings, no new sculptures... no new anything. And \u003cem\u003enew art\u003c/em\u003e is what I want to do *alongside* my existing commissions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve also discovered that you guys LOVE my painting tutorials. So Patreon gives me a perfect private platform to record and produce full length painting tutorials specially tailored to what you guys like! Real time, unedited videos showing every single minute of me painting these commissions. Some people want to learn from me, some just enjoy watching me paint.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got so many ideas in my mind of new things I want to do...
