     "about": "An avid fan of Billie Holiday and Mazzy Star, Dani Mari was born to sing. Her music is fueled by personal narratives embedded in the craft of classic story telling and the emotional insight of a most unlikely \u201cold soul\u201d. Audiences across the United States and throughout Europe have gravitated toward her beautifully haunting voice and the simplistic elegance of her lyrics which transcend our current snap shot of popular music.  With nothing more than her instrument and stories of her life experience, her songs merely hint at Dani Mari\u2019s desire to transport listeners the world over to an era of nostalgia which exists within the depths of her soul. \u003cbr\u003eShe has been featured on NPR, BBC, MTV, WXPN (including the Gene Shay Folk Show on WXPN) and Brooklyn Vegan and has collaborated with FEAR CLUB from Paris, Sun Glitters from Luxembourg, Brooklyn Shanti and was formally in the dreampop duo, Lockets.  Dani Mari performs solo and with Will Hanza as the dark-folk duo Owl and Wolf. She also collaborated with Reverend TJ McGlinchey in the folk-pop duo Lovers League and released an EP with award winning producer Bill Moriarty (Lotus, Dr. Dog).  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDani Mari is the founder of Female Frequency, a music collective dedicated to empowering women \u0026amp; girls in the music industry through the creation of media that is entirely female generated, with I Am Snow Angel and Claire London.  They are currently creating an album made entirely by women with Kiran Gandhi and other female producers.  Dani Mari is also in the process of producing her own album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe has performed at SXSW, CMJ, The Philadelphia Folk Festival, Musikfest and many other festivals and venues across the world.  In addition she has performed with acts such as Sylvan Esso, St. Lucia, Mr Twin Sister, Exitmusic, Widowspeak, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Mates of State, Patti Smith, Edward Sharp \u0026amp; the Magnetic Zeros, Of Montreal and more.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\"Mari\u0027s vocals seemingly casting a spell.\" - WXPN\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u201cDani Mari\u2019s angelic vocal sweeps over its accompaniment, sometimes mildly distorted in its layers it adds a wash of mystery.\u201d - The 405\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u201cGive a lot of credit to Dani Mari\u2019s vocals, soft enough to evoke that whimsical innocence and strong enough to stand out against the sky-sized, sun-drenched melody.\u201d - A Cosmic Soundscape\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u201cDani Mari\u2019s narrative, story-like songs are ear-catching and unusual to hear in this day and age.\u201d - That Mag\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u201cDani Mari can hold her own with the best indie/folk singers.\u201d - The Swollen Fox\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Voted \"Top 50 Women of Indie Music\" by \u003ca\u003enonhollywood\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Interviewed with Veruca Salt featured on \u003ca\u003eLADYGUNN\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDani Mari is the founder of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.femalefrequency.com\"\u003eFemale Frequency\u003c/a\u003e (a musical collaboration created entirely by women),\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.brookladelphiamusic.com\"\u003eBrookladelphia\u003c/a\u003e (curated live events with the idea of encouraging creativity, community and collaboration of the arts in multiple locations) and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.payformusicday.com\"\u003ePay For Music Day\u003c/a\u003e (Pay for Music Day is Every Day.
