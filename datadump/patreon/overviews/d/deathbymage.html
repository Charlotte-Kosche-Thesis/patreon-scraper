    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eHidden below the archives of the arcane sanctum, down the winding stairwell, through the cobwebbed corridors; a lonely lich resides, forgotten by time until now. It speaks of ancient proverbs, vile wisdom, and benevolent\u00a0rants. It promises death for those willing to heed his words and exercise his schemes. Welcome, brave scholar for you shall learn how one suffers death by a mage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eGreetings and salutations!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Death By Mage, a crazed scholar of the gamemastering arts, here to bring advice for beginners and veterans in the secret art of storytelling. Stories are an important part of our history; we have been telling stories before the invention of written words. In the lovable hobby of tabletop roleplaying games, storytelling is a fundamental part of the experience. There is always a lead storyteller, a Dungeon Master or Game Master that crafts the world the other players (or storytellers) play and interact within. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe skill of crafting and weaving such a story requires time and patience. But in a growing world full of up and coming storytellers, there is a great need for more masters of the dungeon! Masters who can fabricate worlds and universes, wear the shrouds of allies and villains, provide captivating challenges and obstacles, but most importantly, inspire their fellow players while displaying an ease of execution and operation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, I\u0027m getting carried away, aren\u0027t I?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eMission Statement\u003c/u\u003e:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ePlainly, I wish to help Game Masters/Dungeon Masters/Storytellers improve in their craft.

What sort of podcast do you ask? I plan to develop an informative podcast talking about the RPG community, tips and tricks on gamemastering, and how I do worldbuilding. I have reached the limits of what a blog can allow for me to achieve; I wish to reach a boarder audience with my podcast, serving as an RPG radio talk show of sorts. Your support will help make this dream a reality a lot sooner.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhere can you find me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eYou can find me on the Internet:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite/Blog:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://deathbymage.com\"\u003e deathbymage.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/adventuresofteambaja/\"\u003e Death By Mage\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwitter:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/deathbymage\"\u003e @deathbymage\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/kaito_asuke\"\u003e @kaito_asuke\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eBackstory\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been playing roleplaying games for over 14 years. I started roleplaying as young as 5 when some friends and I\u00a0played renditions of Disney\u0027s The Lion King, and I always played Scar. I have played Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons for over ten years along with dozens of other RPG systems including World of Darkness, Savage Worlds, Gamma World, Exalted, Dread, Legend of the Five Rings, Mutants \u0026amp; Mastermind, to name a few.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn August of 2015, I started the Death By Mage blog primarily as a creative exercise for doing narrative recaps for our mutual friends in my D\u0026amp;D playgroup. When I joined the D\u0026amp;D Twitter community, I started voicing my opinions and advice for game masters. Within a few weeks, I started writing blog columns dealing with a variety of topics from advice to homebrewed content to be used by the masses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m happy to say that after a couple of years, I\u0027ve reached heights I never thought possible. I have met and befriended some amazing creators and sages within the community.

I love making content, I love talking about the game, and I want to continue to do it without the strain of worrying about my finances. It\u0027s a long road to achieve, so it\u0027ll be something to look forward. I just want to have the financial capacity to do more for you (the Patrons) and provide better quality content as equipment and software cost money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eCan\u0027t support my Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eNo problem!
