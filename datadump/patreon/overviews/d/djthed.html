I often go by DJTHED, my online screen name. I\u0027m an amateur 3D Animator, Modeler, Rigger, etc., etc. Basically I\u0027m an amateur Blender user... But really, I\u0027m mostly a passionate 3D Animator at heart. That\u0027s what drives me to do what I do, and to do what I love, if you know what I mean.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yeah, Patreon! Welcome! I won\u0027t get too in detail about my personal situation, but I\u0027ll just say that in order to continue doing what I do at the pace I\u0027m currently working at, I\u0027ll need some help. Without help, I\u0027ll have to start spending more of my time working at a real job (the horror!) instead of working on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://therealdjthed.deviantart.com/\"\u003eanimations and models\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny little bit of money can help, no matter how small, of course. But if, like some impossible miracle, I receive a ton of donations to the point where I have a lot of extra money, I\u0027ll be putting most of that towards upgrading and improving my PC to decrease the time it takes to render my animations and increase efficiency and quality. I may even build more PCs to create a mini-render farm for myself if enough help comes my way. Blender is an amazing piece of 3D software, but it requires a heck of a machine to render even just a single high resolution image, let alone dozens of high resolution images to create animation. And if I had multiple machines with top of the line Nvidia GPUs inside, what would take me 4 hours to render today could take maybe only about a half hour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my recent work can be found on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://therealdjthed.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt Page\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0I recommend you check it out if you aren\u0027t familiar with my work. Once this Patreon has launched I\u0027ll of course start providing rewards to patrons. I\u0027ll start off simple by releasing certain types of content exclusively for patrons a week or so early, though everything I release here will at some point get released everywhere else. If anyone has any more ideas for what I can do to rewards, I\u0027ll be sure to consider them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig13.deviantart.net/aafe/f/2017/117/4/c/the_mane_attraction_wip_7_set___background_detail_by_therealdjthed-db7a46b.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis image shows what is currently my primary goal with my 3D endeavors. Some of you may recognize this stage from a certain episode of MLP. Yes, I plan to recreate \"The Magic Inside\" scene from the Season 5 Episode 24 \"The Mane Attraction\" in 3D. I would not be doing what I have been doing for the past few months if it wasn\u0027t for my motivation to create this full animation project. The song that plays here has become my favorite song of all time for me. By a long shot. It was one of the many pleasant surprises that MLP:FiM  sprung into my face and exceeded my expectations when I first started watching this show in July of 2016. Again, by a long shot. This is something I really want to do, and the more help I get, the chances of me getting this done will increase. It will require as much spare time as I can get to create all the assets needed to pull this off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, if you\u0027ve read this far into this page, let me just say that I appreciate that you took that time just to see and understand what my ambitions are, whether or not you decide to become a Patron. That alone I can\u0027t be grateful enough for. But to those who chose to donate... Well I lack the vocabulary to describe how I feel, but I\u0027ll try to anyway. When I first started this project, I didn\u0027t think it would gain a whole lot of attention. I never thought that I\u0027d be getting financial backing from something like this, but I still went on ahead knowing that because of how much I wanted to get this done. And here we are now. A lot of people seems to really love what I do, which surprised me because I was, and still am, in the very early stages of this project. The fact that you are helping me, even if it\u0027s just a dollar, is just... Unbelievable. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNShZ0WlFEPJCJ1WZYAKcmA?\u0026amp;ab_channel=DJTHED\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://therealdjthed.deviantart.com/\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://djthed.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/YTgduc\"\u003ePaypal Donation Link\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "I exclusively work in 3D. I\u0027m an amateur 3D Animator that also is working on becoming better at 3D modeling and rigging. I have no professional experience with 3D Animation, and I have not received any schooling at all for it either. I know what I know because I constantly observe how things move in real life, and why things move the way they move. I do the same for any theatrical release of a 3D Animated film when I watch it. And I experiment with what I\u0027ve observed from all that all the time in Blender. I\u0027ve picked up a lot of things over the last couple years on what makes animation look good, and I can usually identify what looks bad in an animation and come up with a possible solution. With that said, due to my lack of professional experience and lack of schooling, I\u0027m sure my animation workflow is lacking in solid fundamentals. I still struggle to approach certain types of movements in animation, even what would seem like pretty basic things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary 3D software of choice is Blender. Blender is capable of so much, it\u0027s nearly at the same level of capability as its paid counterparts. I may end up using other pieces of software at some point if I ever get into this professionally, because for as far as I know, Blender isn\u0027t used often in the professional world, but Maya is. But even if that does happen, I doubt I would ever not use Blender as my \"At Home\" primary 3D application.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo I will not use SFM.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s using a video game engine from 2003... And really it\u0027s even much older than that since Source was built from the Quake engine if I recall correctly. That shit is ancient. But really, the main reason I don\u0027t use SFM is that I feel that it\u0027s very clunky, lacking in features, and doesn\u0027t fit well to the fluidity of my workflow. And I suppose as I am someone that has been using Blender for 7 years, I find Blender infinitely more intuitive.",

If I do \nreach this goal I will release them earlier so that everyone can finally\n use my models before I finish that project. When releasing early, some \nparts of my rig might not be 100% complete or polished, though. Expect \nversion numbers and revisions to follow afterward, and and feedback I \nreceive on how the model or rig works and how to improve them I will \nconsider in future revisions.",
