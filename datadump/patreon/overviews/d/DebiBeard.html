This campaign will raise money for each video that I create and help me to expand my content to room decor and field trips to estate sales, thrift stores and flea markets. My goal is to get enough support to launch the \u00a0Up-Cycled house Project! When I reach this goal, I\u0027m going to rent a tiny house and move in with nothing but my camera and my clothes! Step by step, week by week we will decorate it together, I\u0027ll take you with me as I hunt for dishes, furniture and lighting, we\u0027ll dig through the trash, go to flea markets and yard sales. you \u00a0can help me decide what to build, which colors to paint and how to make curtains! It\u0027s going to be a wild fun adventure and I can\u0027t wait to get started! \u00a0Below, you will find a list of pledge amounts that you can commit to donating per video and the rewards that come with each pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Debi\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eI want to donate but what if you start posting a ton of videos and it busts my budget?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eno worries you can set a limit to how many videos you want to help me make. right now I make 4-6 videos per month and My Tuesday Takeover videos don\u0027t count because I don\u0027t make those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
