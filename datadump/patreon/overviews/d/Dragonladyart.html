Every culture as far back as we can study have believed in Dragons. They had different meanings to different peoples, but always they are there. Some created the universe and our world, some created the lakes, rivers and oceans that surround us, and others the mountains and landscapes we call home. Yet still others sought to destroy, and became Gods of chaos or even death. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Religion, philosophy, myth and even history all carry shadows of the Dragon. In our days the dragon still has a firm grip on our waking and sleeping minds.

A LOT of dragons. Both majestic big dragons, and adorable cute, little dragons...all the time. It\u0027s my love, and there is nothing in this world I would rather do. Using pencil and watercolor I create the dragons that flit, flutter, and fly through my imagination. I have been drawing and painting fantasy as far as I can remember, and have specialized in dragons for the past 15 years.

     "about": "I am Carla Morrow, owner and artist of DragonLady Art studio. Using pencil and watercolor I create the images and worlds that exist in my mind, and bring them to the light so that others may share and enjoy the dragons and other creatures that I see. I have been drawing and coloring for as long as I can remember, and have always been interested in the worlds and creatures that occupy the fantasy realms. While other children were eating their crayons, I was putting mine to the walls, and while they were out playing in their yards and streets I was perfectly happy to sit alone for hours and draw. I can now draw a woman running a marathon much better than I can run one myself. When teachers asked us to draw \u201cwhat you want to be when you grow up?\u201d I always drew pictures of myself drawing...very M.C. Echer, right?  As a child I enrolled in every art class I could, which wasn\u0027t many. The few that I did manage to get into I enjoyed to the fullest. I also would sneak BACK into the school building during lunches to play Dungeons and Dragons...2.0, with THACO. None of that \"off campus\" garbage during lunch for me! I was a uber geek, but at least I wasn\u0027t alone. Once out of high school I attended college, but the strain of wanting to stay home to do art during college parties was too much, and I dropped out quickly to pursue my own study. I have since spent the past few years seeking out all the info I could on painting, drawing, and anatomy studies. Thank goodness for YouTube and \u201chow to Draw\u201d books!\u003cbr\u003e",
