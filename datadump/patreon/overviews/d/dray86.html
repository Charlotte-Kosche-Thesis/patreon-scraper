For me, the goal was NOT about making money... the goal was to create memorable videos. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn order to do this, I needed to find the right\ntype of music. Unfortunately the majority\nof the music I felt were right for my videos were also copyrighted. But I didn\u2019t\ncare. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI sacrificed any chance of making money from\nYoutube in order to help tell my story. Music is so important. It creates a\nconvincing atmosphere and can strike an emotional chord with your audience. For\nme, this was way more important than making a little bit of money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",
