I\u0027ve been in a very blessed situation where I could take the time to build the comic from the ground up and start drawing it, but I need support to keep doing this in the future. Right now, I\u0027m looking at commissions as my only income, and to keep that up, I might not be able to keep both comics running in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you loyal fans and great people come in. For as low as 1 dollar a month you could help me continue making you guys happy.
