    "summary": "Welcome.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been at this\nYoutube thing since 2015, putting my gaming knowledge and apparently pretty compelling voice to work.\u00a0 My\ncontent ranges from analysis videos about gaming news to speculation to even a\nfew Let\u2019s Plays way back in the day!\u00a0 Though you may know me best for my signature series \u003cstrong\u003eChallenger\nApproaching\u003c/strong\u003e, which creates detailed Super Smash Bros.\ncharacter concepts for characters who haven\u0027t yet joined the fight, but might in the future!\u00a0 From aesthetics, to playstyle, to stats, movesets, and everything else, I strive to make each challenger feel true to their identity and authentic to Smash\u0027s style!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy time on Youtube has had\na big impact on me.\u00a0 I\u2019ve learned so much, and\npicked up so many skills along the way in writing, voice work, graphic design, video and sound editing, you name it!\u00a0 I\u2019ve learned how to network and spread awareness\nof my content, and it\u0027s made me a better communicator and more confident in my abilities.\u00a0 Who knew I had it in me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just wish\nit was under better circumstances.\u00a0 Things in real life have been tough for me for a long time--chronic pain and spine problems limit my ability to do conventional work.\u00a0 At its worst, the pain is intense enough to keep me from doing\u003cem\u003e anything\u003c/em\u003e until it dies down, and it makes it very difficult to find a \"normal\" job where I wouldn\u0027t randomly be dead weight for hours on end.\u00a0 Carving out a niche on Youtube is beyond difficult, but in my current state, it\u0027s the best chance I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s where you come in.\u00a0 With your support, I can finally stop\nstruggling and fighting against the odds, and start moving forward.\u00a0 With the

the closest thing I have to a career in my current condition, something I can actually do despite the pain.\u00a0 Working from home gives me better means to manage it, and without having to worry about a traditional job that I\u0027d be unable to do at complete random whenever the pain becomes too intense to manage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWorried about a paywall?\u00a0 Rest assured, you
