On these blogs, I will post a variety of types of posts - everything from reviews for movies, games, and books, as well as highlights, commentary, and analysis of my various other interests and hobbies, such as Dungeons and Dragons, politics, art, and really any number of other creative pursuits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf that sounds unfocused, I suppose it is. If I am supposed to sell you on something to gain your support, then I am not so much selling you on a specific genre or type of material, so much as I am selling you on myself, my writings, and my peculiar perspective and experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003eI love writing about media of all kinds.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI love the art of storytelling, and I enjoy dissecting it, examining where creators succeed and where they fail. I also love talking about the people and events behind that media, and I love speaking my mind about them and about current events. Over the past years, I have built writing skills and blogging experiences that I want to use to share my thoughts with the internet audience. \u003cbr\u003eUp till now, my reviews and blogging have just been a hobby. I would write when I had the time, but as finances and responsibility demanded, I put it as a distant second or even third.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter having run this Patreon for a while, it .\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI want to turn my hobby as a reviewer, blogger, and commentator into a full time job, and this Patreon is my vehicle for that goal.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \"Druidan Media\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\"Druidan Media\" currently consists of a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://druidanmedia.weebly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHome Website\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://druidanreviews.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReviews Blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://druidan.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommentary and Interests Blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e with ambitious plans for growth and expansion.
