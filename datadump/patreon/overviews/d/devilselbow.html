Thanks for visiting our Patreon page. Patreon allows creators to connect with their community, and gives the community the chance to help produce the work. When you become a patron, you will join an exclusive community and get access to extra recaps, horrific swag, and much more.\u00a0We love this work, and we\u0027re so grateful that you love it too. Thanks for coming along on this roller coaster ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Devil\u0027s Elbow podcast is created in cooperation with the Devil\u0027s Elbow\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pointhorror.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecap website.\u003c/a\u003e In each episode, Wing discusses the recent books and movies recapped on the site, answers reader and listener questions, and brings in recappers and other guests. Recapped media includes:\u00a0classic and relaunched Point Horror books, the Nightmare Hall series by Diane Hoh, the Goosebumps series by R. L. Stine, the Graveyard School series by Tom B. Stone, numerous other YA horror and genre fiction, and two special features on horror movies from the 80s, 90s, and today. Plus more surprises to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Devil\u0027s Elbow website and podcast are work we love, and we will continue to provide our recaps and podcast episodes for free no matter what. However, if you love the podcast and want to contribute to its creation, the money will first go toward the time and resources we put into creating and hosting the podcast and upgrading podcast equipment. If we get enough subscribers in the future, we\u0027ll be able to pay recappers for their work, add more podcast episodes, and offer you bigger and better (and more horrifying) rewards, including live shows, convention appearances, author interviews, and book giveaways.\u003cbr\u003e"
