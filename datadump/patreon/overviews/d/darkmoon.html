     "about": "Born in a small Irish town outside of Akron, Ohio, Mike Finkelstein \nlived a peacful life in his early years. However, during the impending \ndoom that was the Y2K scare, Mike was abandoned, at the age of five, in a\n sporting goods store. There, he was raised, as one of their own, by a \npack of inflatable rafts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese years spent in the retail life, living on cans of beans, \nlearning to read by hallogen, being taught to float by his new family, \nare among Mike\u0027s most treasured.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTragedy struck, though, when Mike was 17: his adopted mother (a blue,\n two-person Saturn) fell on a box of sharpened pencils. Thankfully, she \ndid not suffer -- deflation was almost instantaneous. The funeral was \nsweet, with friends and family saying few words, only the occasional \nrubber squeak.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTaking the lessons learned in the store, and the money he earned \nworking in the stockroom, Mike paid his way through college, earning a \ndouble major in Private Investigations and Dental Hygenics. Educated and\n ready for a life out in the world, away from sharp, pointy objects, \nMike joined a traveling circus. Here, he was billed as \"Mr. Raft\" and \nwowed audiences with his ability to endlessly float.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHis time in the spotlight, though, was shortlived. When traveling \nacross the country (during his third year with the circus, it should be \nnoted), Mike discovered his next calling: whitewater tour guide for the \ndyslexic. Here, too, his ability to float came in invaluably, although \nhe was ever watchful for vengeful rocks and freshwater swordfish (rare, \nbut evil).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt was here that the Mike gained notariety, being one of the few \npeople to save Lassie (and not the other way around) when the intrepid \ncollie fell into the river and Mike was the one to save the pooch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTaking his life experiences, Mike eventually settled down to write a \nloose interpretation of his story as the RPG \"There\u0027s a Game in this \nBook\". He currently lives on a private island in the Bahamas, having \nused his money made from the book to buy the island and have a mansion \nbuilt on the property. One day the Author hopes to be able to buy the \nmoon. He\u0027s already close to having a down payment.",
