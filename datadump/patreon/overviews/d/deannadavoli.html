    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by my Patreon Page! My name is Deanna Davoli, and I am a gothic fantasy artist. I have been selling my art professionally for over 12 years, but\u00a0have been creating art since I was in middle school. It is my passion, my heart and soul and I cannot imagine my life without it. I have been in love with the fantasy world ever since I was child. I had a wonderful childhood growing up in the country where my imagination went wild. I had the simple pleasure of collecting wild strawberries, walking across logs over creeks, listen to the snow gently fall (because there wasn\u0027t another sound in the air), building my own tree fort and so much more. This upbringing allowed my imagination to blossom...that, and an older brother who loved comic books and got me into Dungeon and Dragons. I have always been mesmerized by beautiful things, with a dark twist and I welcome you to follow me Down the Rabbit Hole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Patreon pledges help keep my business flourishing. Patreon allows me to connect and interact with people interested in my art beyond my social media platforms. I will show you not only my artist process, but also show you personal highlights of my life too.\u00a0 There is a lot of behind the scenes work that goes into having your art business, such as; running all of your online sites, sales and social media, photographing all of your products, applying for and attending shows, maintenance of hardware (printers, computers, software, etc), furthering your craft, supplies, research and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore VIdeos\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI enjoy making time lapse videos very much. However, they are time consuming and do interrupt my creative process. Your Patronage will help provide me with the interest and resources to continue to make these videos for you. They will also open the doors to future video possibilities of step by step tutorials, posting tips, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUlC_npkO3g\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI appreciate each and every one of you.

I love nature \u0026amp; anything fantastical as it give me a sense of spirituality. I try to express that emotion in my artwork.
