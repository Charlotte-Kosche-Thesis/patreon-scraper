    "summary": "Is there any doubt that cryptocurrency is the future? The industry as a whole has grown by over 100% every year. In 2016 crypto outperformed bank issued currency. I could go on and on about the stats of this emerging industry but I\u2019m sure many of the things I\u2019d tell you already know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003edeCentral is your roadmap for a decentralized world. We break down cryptocurrency issues into four categories. \"\u003cstrong\u003eNews\"\u003c/strong\u003e looks at the newest developments\u00a0in blockchain\u00a0technology as well as the acceptance of it. \"\u003cstrong\u003eFinancial\u003c/strong\u003e\" examines the cryptocurrencies and market trends that allow us all to make educated\u00a0decisions and profit from the exchanges. \"\u003cstrong\u003eLegal\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0focuses on the regulation of blockchain tech. \"\u003cstrong\u003eOpportunities\u003c/strong\u003e\" gives user-friendly\u00a0and easy to understand breakdowns of how regular people can use cryptocurrency to their advantage.\u00a0Finally \u003cstrong\u003esecurity \u003c/strong\u003efocuses on how to stay safe while on your crypto journey. This is a new industry to most and we won\u2019t sugarcoat it; there\u2019s still plenty of scams out there. We want to embody the ideals of mutual benefit and self-reliance\u00a0that crypto exemplifies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe plan to play a significant role in educating our public. If you\u0027ve landed on this page we probably don\u0027t have to stress how important an educated population is to you.\u00a0 Financial literacy is something sorely lacking in our society.\u00a0 Crypto offers unique opportunities not previously available to a significant\u00a0portion of the population. These opportunities can move many of us toward financial freedom in a way that is independent\u00a0of centralized power structures.\u00a0 All of us play much more of a deciding factor.\u00a0 It\u0027s called \"consensus-based\"\u00a0for a reason.\u00a0 Signing up as a patron makes you a deCentral subscriber.\u00a0 Each issue comes out the last week of every month.\u00a0\u00a0Patrons will get early access to deCentral\u0027s articles and video.\u00a0 We also will have a daily trading analysis that will be sent out to higher level subscribers. \u00a0In addition you\u0027ll have more direct access to our editorial staff. \u00a0Trust me, we love hearing from you. \u00a0Keep checking back as our rewards and goals will evolve with us. \u00a0Don\u0027t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.\u00a0 Thank you all for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFOR ADVERTISING\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0We want to bring our readers the best opportunities. As an advertiser, you would be one of those opportunities.Our pricing is more affordable than any publication you\u2019ve seen. This is because we don\u2019t want to limit our advertisers to only being those with huge budgets. Just like we want to make the information available to all we want to make the advertising just as accessible. We only have 3 tiers of advert space. Half-page ads for $10. Quarter page ads are $5. Finally, we have a classified section where 2 sentence text-only ads run for $1. You can send us a premade ad or use our design service for an additional $5. Our reader base is growing by the day. Contact us to get represented in the next issue. Space is limited. Please\u00a0email us at keepingitmoving247@gmail.com."
