Thanks to Patreon, I am able to commision work, offer services, and give exclusive behind the scenes details until my major work is published.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from being a writer, I am also a mother of two pretty darn cute kids, and a full time student. I keep up with many social media platforms and a blog. I\u0027m busy busy busy! That is why you\u0027ll see some of my higher tiers are limited to 1 or 2 patrons a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me know if you have questions, especially about my book Apparent Power!!\u00a0"
