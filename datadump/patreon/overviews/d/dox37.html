I have plans and ideas for better integrating discord with Electric Eye, making easier and more practical to use some of the bot\u0027s functionalities and make new ones viable, but all that takes time for coding and learning. So, while Electric Eye and all the tools I made for UD will remain free, even the smallest pledge you can make would be greatly appreciated and would help a great deal with the hosting fees!\u003cbr\u003e"
