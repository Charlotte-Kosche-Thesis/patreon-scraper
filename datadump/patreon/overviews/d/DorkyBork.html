You can pay different amounts of money to see more of my things sooner. Why should we pay you with our hard earned money? you ask.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m honestly really hoping to eventually make a living out of making art. To do that, I need to keep improving, and I need to get supplies I need to be able to work to the best of my ability. This is what I want to do, so it\u0027d be pretty grand if you want to help me. either way, I hope you have an excellent day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRock on, my dude!\u003cbr\u003e"

This is my patreon, in which you can pledge a certain amount of money per drawing to me for early access to art, more streams, and even giveaway art just for you! If you want to do this, but are unsure about how much money you\u0027re willing to spend for this, then you\u0027ll be happy to know that you can set a limit to how much you pay per month! Then you can enjoy my art, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be paying the amount you want!\u00a0I focus on creating art with pencils and watercolors, but sometimes I might use colored pencils or charcoal. And now that we\u0027ve covered the basics, I have one more thing to say; thank you. Even for just checking out my patreon. You\u0027ve already dedicated some of your time to me, and that\u0027s more than I could ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRock on, my dude!",
