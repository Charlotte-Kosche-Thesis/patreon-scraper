In this future, the female population on Earth was decimated due to a strange virus dubbed the Umbra\u0027s Disease, which appeared a century prior to the events in Love Eden.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTechnologies such as cloning and artificial wombs have allowed the species\u00a0to continue to survive, but female births became less and less common as they all suffered the disease and died, making all the babies born as male a necessity. After generations researchers are still working on finding a way to permit the female population to once again survive on the planet, but still no solution has yet been found.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe last female-born woman died in a high security lab in 2124, giving birth to her precious baby girl in a world that she feared she would never experience, destined to be locked behind a glass wall for her own protection.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Boys of Edengates\u003c/h2\u003e\nPlay as each male characters before the first day of school and discover their personalities. Get to know them better before you go out and face this new life full of romance and suspense.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eGame Features\u003c/h4\u003e\nThe game features and mechanics in \n\u003cem\u003ethe Boy of Edengates\u003c/em\u003e are not the same as the ones that will be integrated in \u003cem\u003ethe Last Woman of Earth\u003c/em\u003e. The goal of this prequel episode is for you, as a player, to discover who the other students of Eden Academy are. Unlike a typical visual novel, you \u003cstrong\u003eDO NOT\u003c/strong\u003e get to choose what the boys do within the prequel episode as their story might end up influence the story of main game and that\u0027s not our\u00a0goal for \u003cem\u003eTBoE\u003c/em\u003e. Our goal is for you to get a opportunity to learn more about the boys\u0027 habits,\u00a0their behaviors as well as what they might think about each other and maybe even discover a few of their secrets in the process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Last Woman on Earth\u003c/h2\u003e\nIn this 25 episode game series, play as the last woman on Earth and discover your new life at Eden Academy.

You will have\u00a0decisions that may even be fatal for certain characters. Other features and mechanics like the 360\u00b0 environments we want to give you to immerse yourself in and animated character expressions are only a few examples of level we are trying to make for our game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFAQs\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nIf you play as the Last Woman on Earth, why does James have a mother?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eJames\u0027 mother is a transgender woman.
