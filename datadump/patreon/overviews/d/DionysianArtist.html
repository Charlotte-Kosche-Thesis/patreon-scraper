I\u0027m a polytheist artist, public performer,\ndevotee of Dionysos and amateur historian. I don\u0027t live like \n\u003cem\u003enormal\u003c/em\u003e people\ndo, I don\u0027t own things, I don\u0027t drive, I live in a former bank, I\u0027m a pragmatic\nascetic, I don\u0027t even get paid a wage. I subsist solely off donations from the\npublic for producing artwork on the streets.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tArt is a costly venture in itself. I often give my art out for free use, I\u2019ve\nallowed it to be published in pagan/polytheist books, pagan\u00a0gatherings/festivals, fundraisers, websites and other publications for free.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe secondary aspect of my time is writing for the polytheist community\nincluding publications via my\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://dionysianartist.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, various related\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://polytheist.com/dionysianartist/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecommunities\u003c/a\u003e, I offer free\ntuition to new-comers of Hellenic polytheism by social networking and email too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI am dyslexic thus writing does not come naturally to me, at times it can take\nme days, weeks, to write an article published for this community -again-\ntotally for free. These publications are often shared amongst peers and\nthroughout social media, while I appreciate that at least *someone* is reading\nmy work, I wish I could do more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo why am I doing this? Why do I commit so much\ntime, support and effort into this cause? I can think of no other purpose to\nexist than honouring my gods. I do this in various ways. It is my goal here to\nfirst see a developing cultus of Dionysos, and an active community around which\nwe create and venerate the beauty that has been stripped from us. I am a mere\n\u003cem\u003espoke \u003c/em\u003ein a semi functioning wheel, and for this wheel to gather momentum it\nneeds support from all other \u003cem\u003espokes\u003c/em\u003e. From spiritual specialists, artists, to\nthe laity.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, as I mentioned, I make a living off donations\nfrom the public, what is called busking. Much of the art I produce is\ndevotional in nature and even if the public is unaware of that they still\nsupport it. If complete strangers on the street can support my work, why not\nthe people whom I direct my work towards?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo here I offer an opportunity to my fans, admirers\nand the polytheist community to contribute to my work. To enable me to provide\nmore free art and services for our developing communities by becoming a patron.\nBy contributing to my patreon you are engaging in devotional work equal to my\nown.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePatreon Plans\u003c/h4\u003e\nSo what are my plans here? What do I want to bring here that merits support?\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, apart sponsoring work I\u2019m already doing, I have a couple of ideas of Patreon exclusive content including: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDevotional education and essays \u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eArt lessons, \"how to\u0027s\" and trade secrets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eExclusive previews of work in progress\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBehind the scenes images and discussion\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI also would like to strongly encourage an active community where patrons may feel free to ask questions, offer suggestions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaybe a simpler means to pay for commissions.
