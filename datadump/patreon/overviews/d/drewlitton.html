Thank you for stopping by and checking out my Patreon Page!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhether you subscribe or not, it\u0027s appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I have some really big plans for the future and Finnegan and I are asking you to be a part of it all.\u003cbr\u003eOur intention is to create brand new Colorado themed cartoons on a regular basis. For 27 gloriously fun years I drew 5 cartoons a week in a feature called \"Win, lose \u0026amp; DREW\" in the sports section of the Rocky Mountain News. I don\u0027t have to tell you how much the newspaper business has changed\u00a0 since the Rocky closed it\u0027s doors in 2009. Though I do a fair amount of freelance work in the Denver area, most of it comes out out once a week or once a month and the revenue streams are not anywhere close to what they were. I miss drawing cartoons about the day to day and ever changing storylines found in Colorado sports.\u003cstrong\u003e I believe Patreon gives me the chance to embrace the road ahead, produce the kind of content I did for the Rocky and interact with you in a new and exciting way.\u003c/strong\u003e I believe it can help to subsidize my creative time and allow me to focus on producing the cartoons I so love to draw. \u003cstrong\u003eI am so incredibly blessed to have fans like you! I hope you will consider joining me and Finn in the journey here on Patreon!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e."

     "about": "Hi! I\u0027m Drew Litton and I\u0027m a cartoonist. Rumors have it that I was dropped on my head from a very high place at a young age which led me down this path. I personally think it had something to do with being subjected every fall to watching one of the worst college football programs known to mankind. Regardless, I became a guy who liked to doodle on book covers and walls as a kid and I ended up here. A cartoonist.\u003cbr\u003eSome have heard of the demise of the American Daily Newspaper. I can attest to you that it is indeed a real phenomenon. I worked at the Rocky Mountain News in Denver Colorado for 27 years until it met it\u0027s untimely death in 2009. Since then I\u0027ve freelanced for places like ESPN and the Chicago Tribune as well as a bunch of daily papers who are currently in Intensive Care on Life Support.\u00a0 So, suffice to say, the dynamics have changed as a cartoonist. One of the things I miss most about the Rocky (besides the people) is drawing locally based sports cartoons. That\u0027s where you come in. I\u0027m inviting you to join my exclusive Patreon page which will allow me to create more of the content so many of you enjoyed when I was drawing \"Win, Lose \u0026amp; Drew\". I\u0027ll be drawing other stuff here as well and providing you with some behind the scenes and exclusive content not available anywhere else. In a nutshell, I\u0027m inviting you to join my fan club and contribute as a patron of the cartoons to allow me financially to create content without the pressures of feeding the freelance beast. Come on along!! I promise it will be a homer to left field. Or at least a ground rule double!",
