     "about": "My name is D.M. Galloway. I am 22 years old and I\u0027ve been doing Stop Motion on YouTube weekly for over 6 years. For 6 years I uploaded high quality stop motion animation videos like no one on YouTube ever has before . These videos include episodes of my hit shows NYX Wrestling, Justice Assembled (A Marvel and DC Comics Crossover) and Mega Powers (a Spoof of the 1980s WWE). Also fighting animations such as Batman VS Michael Jackson, Superman VS Terminator, and more fan picked battles. These videos altogether have added up to over 32 MILLION VIEWS. I am a college graduate and I\u0027ve sacrificed time with friends and family to make films and do YouTube for over 7 years. This has been my only job for 7 years and helped pay my bills.\u00a0I am making this patreon in hopes to continuing these amazing videos that brought smiles to people and children of all ages for the past 7 years. As of 2017, I created my first Live Action short film \"A Bird in the Shadow\" starring Former WWE Superstar Paul London. The film has great reviews and is available for free on Amazon. Also, on Christmas Eve I produced a fun stop motion animation with WWE Hall of Famer The Smackdown Before Christmas. However, thanks to YouTube\u0027s new rule we were unable to monetize the video.",
