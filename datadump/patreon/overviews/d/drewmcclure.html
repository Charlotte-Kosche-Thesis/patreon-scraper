This was not what was promised to me in college. I was supposed to change the world. I was supposed to live an adventurous life. I was supposed to be doing what I love and loving what I was doing. Oh and I was supposed to be healthy and happy too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWell there was one problem\u2026\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...I was given promises without preparation. I had a magnificent and terrifying mountain to climb with no clue how to actually summit a mountain like that. There was an incredible vertical distance between what could be and what actually was. I had passion and desire for all of those things but no clue how to attain them. To go further up the mountain I had to go on a journey and I had to ask for help A LOT along the way. I have not arrived, but I am not stuck anymore. I am happier, healthier, and more effective at doing my work in the world than I have ever been.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAt some point in your life\u2026\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2026you will hit your max altitude and establish your new normal. You will go as high and far as your natural giftings, personality, relationships, habits, and approaches to life will take you and then you will slowly build a life there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHere is the problem with that\u2026\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2026you know you were meant for a higher altitude.\u003cbr\u003eYou know you were designed to continue to grow, conquer, and cultivate.\u003cbr\u003eBut instead you are stuck, stagnant, and in a soul-numbing repeating cycle. You seem to waffle between failed attempts to pick yourself up and go higher or give up and give in to life always being like it is. There is a 3rd option. You could try finding new guides, new friends, and new tools. If you do that you might just find the real you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo one has \u201carrived\u201d here but we are on a journey to go higher and might have some things that can help you. Oh and what\u2019s at the top you ask? I believe its the truest you, the most fulfilled you, who is doing the most good you could do in the world. So come on friends, lets go up together.\u003cbr\u003e"
