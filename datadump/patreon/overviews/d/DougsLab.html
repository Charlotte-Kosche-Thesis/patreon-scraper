    "summary": "As you might know, I make educational chemistry videos for Youtube. Anyone in the hobby chemistry arena knows that this is by no means a cheap hobby. So far, I have survived - flourished even - on donations made by chemical companies, universities, and thousands out of my own pocket. Unfortunately, I cannot do this forever. I find myself having to rely more and more on my own funds to make more sophisticated videos. If you like my videos, it would mean the world to me if you gave a little bit so I can continue to do what I love, and in return I can give a little something back!"
