    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Here: \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eHey friends, family, and followers! If you\u0027re here I\u0027m assuming you know who I am and what I do. I\u0027ve created this page because I\u0027d love to keep doing it. After the birth of my second baby, I\u0027m faced with a reality that\u0027s been culminating rapidly over the last two years: I can\u0027t afford to be a freelance writer. The sleep, money, and time deficit that comes from trying to juggle a 2 month old, 2 year old, and blossoming writing career is widening. I don\u0027t have the resources to commit to how many pieces I\u0027d have to write to support my household, and my family\u0027s needs have more urgency than waiting months for a freelance check allows. I\u0027ve realized that I\u0027m going to have to do this the nontraditional way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For You: I\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ewrite in the crevices and cracks between toddler tantrums and newborn needs. If I can dedicate that time to writing what I want as opposed to what will make me hardly enough money to function, I can deliver better quality work. I\u2019m hoping to write a monthly newsletter delivering pieces of writing via e-mail to all who subscribe here. The sign-up link will be posted privately here. I will sometimes write more than that, sometimes less, and I may publish some of the pieces on Medium eventually. \u00a0If only 2% of my following on Medium were to subscribe at $5 a month, I could completely sustain my writing. I\u0027ve written more about why I choose this model\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/in-defense-of-self-publishing-907e0d33fc29#.xlajmz26w\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0and it\u0027s only become more valid for me as my responsibilities mount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You Should Support My Work: \u003c/strong\u003eI write raw. I open myself to the internet, ugliness and all. I don\u0027t sift out the parts I\u0027m ashamed of. I do it because I want people to see the things they\u0027re taught to be ashamed of honored. I do it because I want people to feel empathy. I do it because there are many things exclusive to my intersections of Blackness and womanhood that are  under and misrepresented-- and I want them represented honestly and accurately. I do it in service to the humanity of people who struggle with the things I struggle with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bullshit.ist/if-you-value-marginalized-voices-in-media-then-support-us-f696c3d1aa2b#.zbgd2w40b\"\u003eIn this political climate, it\u0027s often repeated that we need marginalized voices in media to boom louder than ever.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eBut there\u0027s little support for us, fewer opportunities, less pay, more abuse, and a more prevalent lack of the resources it takes to succeed in this industry. You should support my work if you believe marginalized voices in media should stand a fighting chance. You should support my work if you value it, if you believe it\u0027s important. You should support my work if you want to settle the scores a bit when it comes to compensation for the labor I provide. You should support my work if it means anything to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is an avenue for compensation. This is for people who  have learned from, benefited from, profited from, or used my work. This is also for people who want me to keep going, who want to invest in my ability to keep going. The support would mean I could do the work that matters most to me without the weight of sacrifice. It would make a massive difference for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Would Go:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI would use the money for sporadic childcare, to afford the solitude to think and to create. I would use the money to pay rent, to buy groceries -- to free up the part of my mind that is constantly trying to figure out how to get those things done. I would use the money for so much coffee (am I right?). I would use the money to take better care of myself when the feedback from racist trolls in my e-mail inbox reflects the deprecating voice of my depression. I would use the money as a catalyst to keep going."
