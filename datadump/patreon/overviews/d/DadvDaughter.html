    "summary": "We showcase board games in a two-player setting between a Dad and his daughter. We do this by playing through the game on camera and then giving our review at the end. Nothing is scripted, so what you see is an honest and spontaneous exchange while we play the game, just as if there were no camera filming the play. You won\u0027t know what to expect because neither do we!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur channel was born on September 1, 2014. We had just attended another Gen Con (a huge gaming convention) and after the con, decided to start creating content. While at Gen Con, we had given a demo of a game to a fellow unknown gamer when he asked if we knew how to play the game and if we would teach it to him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have had several subscribers and fans of our channel ask how they could help support us which is why we are launching our Patreon page, simply to give those who wish to support a means to easily do so. Any support we get goes right back into the channel to either get more games to showcase, attend more conventions to give our viewers more insight into the board gaming hobby, or upgrade our equipment and software so that we can create even better looking videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are glad you enjoy our videos and witness the interaction between a Dad and his daughter. It truely is a great way to spend time together. Know that any support you wish to send is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDad \u0026amp; Daughter"
