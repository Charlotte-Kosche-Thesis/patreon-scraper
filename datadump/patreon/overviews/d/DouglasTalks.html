In my case, I am creating Christian videos for kids. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDouglas Talks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDouglas\nTalks is a video series meant to help parents and teachers explain\nBiblical truths to their kids in a way that is fun and easy to\nunderstand. These videos are for sale as digital downloads on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.worshiphousekids.com/producers/463/Little-Grig\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWorshipHouseKids.com\u003c/a\u003e, and I also sell DVDs on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://douglastalks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDouglasTalks.com\u003c/a\u003e, but I want to make them even more accessible, especially to families. So all of my videos are available to watch for free online on Youtube. \u00a0Click to visit:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Douglastalks\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDouglas\u0027 YouTube Page\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now my videos have been viewed more than 100,000 times, and in more than 185 countries!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nwould love for you to \u003cstrong\u003epartner with me in spreading God\u0027s word\u003c/strong\u003e to kids\nall over the world.

Whether it\u0027s $1, $10, or $100, \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eyou get to decide\u003c/strong\u003e exactly how much to pledge per month. Just pledging $1 per month might not seem like it would help very much, but that\u0027s literally 1,000 times as much as I make per view on YouTube! So if you are a fan of Douglas and of this ministry then\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eshow your support\u003c/strong\u003e because every little bit helps.

For\nexample: if you pledge $10 per video, you would also get the rewards\nfor the $5 and $1 tiers. The description of each pledging tier and it\u0027s rewards are on the right side of this page (unless you\u0027re on mobile, then there is a button that says \"rewards\" on the home page).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\nrewards are a cool incentive, but there is really no adequate way to\nthank you for your support. Because of people like you, I am able to\nhelp spread the Good News of Jesus Christ to kids all over the world through the gifts God has given me,\nand I truly cannot thank you enough for that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod bless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-JJ\u003cbr\u003e"
