Unfortunately, the cost of these new projects are much higher than those we\u0027ve previously produced in-house, with additional costs for writers, editors, artists, cartographers, and layout. In order to continue to produce content, we need to pay the individuals involved a reasonable rate - but we need to make sure we\u0027re doing this in a sustainable manner instead of losing money with each new release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo accomplish this, we\u0027re seeking a steady set of patrons who will support our upcoming releases so we know how much is safe to budget to writing, editing, artwork, and layout, and how big of a release we can really afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach PDF supplement we\u0027ll release will initially be planned for 8 to 12 pages. If we get higher funding, we\u0027ll expand the size of the release. The bigger the book, the more it will cost to pay the writers, editors, and layout, and the more graphics we\u0027ll need to acquire.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigher-tier patreons will be able to vote on which project should the next for release.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date, we have released multiple products thanks to Patreon funding, including:\u003cbr\u003ePsionics Augmented: Soulknives I, II, and III\u003cbr\u003ePsionics Augmented: Living Legend\u003cbr\u003eSteelforge: Book 1\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pick these up from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dreamscarred.com/product-category/pathfinder/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDreamscarred Press\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/744/Dreamscarred-Press\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDriveThruRPG\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.opengamingstore.com/collections/dreamscarred-press\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOpen Gaming Store\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paizo.com/companies/dreamscarredPress/discuss\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePaizo\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eUpcoming Projects\u003c/h1\u003eSo that you know what projects you\u0027ll be supporting (and potentially voting on), here are the current list of projects we have in the works (in no particular order):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAkashic War\u003c/em\u003e - a crossover supplement of the Akashic Mysteries and Path of War systems, this release is for the pharaoh class, which blends veilweaving from Akashic Mysteries and maneuvers from Path of War.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDivergent Paths \u003c/em\u003e- with the release of Path of War and Path of War Expanded, there are additional options players seek using this combat system.

This will be a series of releases providing psionic options for the psychic classes from OA, as well as psychic options for the psionic classes from Ultimate Psionics.
