For the last several years, I\u2019ve been a freelance commercial photographer in Honolulu, Hawaii, shooting everything from lifestyle swimwear branding to editorial landscape photography. However, over the past couple of years I\u2019ve reignited my passion for cosplay, and have not only started making tons of new costumes for myself, but I\u2019ve also begun working with amazing cosplayers from all over the world to create memorable images in my vibrant signature style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently in school for fashion design, with the eventual goal of becoming a geek fashion designer, so while cosplay photography isn\u0027t specifically my job, it is complimentary to my goals and a lot of my professional time goes into it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount of support from people who enjoy my work is infinitely appreciated! There\u0027s no special reward tiers and no monthly physical products, etc. - just early access to my latest projects as a thank you to my wonderful patrons."

     "about": "Dallas Nagata White was born and raised on the island of Maui, Hawaii, and spent her youth gallivanting around the slopes of Haleakala volcano and endlessly doodling in her notebooks. She moved to Oahu in 2004 to attend the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where she majored in Studio Art with a focus on both painting and photography. After graduating, she spent a year assisting a local fashion photographer, then branched out into being a full-time freelance photographer herself. Dallas continues to live on Oahu with her husband Ed and their dog Kodachrome, shooting a little bit of everything\u2014landscapes, fashion, portraits, editorials, occasional events, and travel photography whenever possible. When she doesn\u0027t have a camera in her hands, she enjoys drawing/painting, cosplay, writing, playing video games, speculating, and having grand adventures that involve things like lava, high places, and other things her mother is not too thrilled about.",
