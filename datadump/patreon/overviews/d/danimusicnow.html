I write and sing soulful, passionate, transcendent music that is either really sexy or really dreamy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI moved to New York City from England with just a guitar, a suitcase, and a pocket full of charms.\u003cbr\u003eMy time in New York has been an action packed emotional journey of highs and lows. I remember moving 8 times in the first year here. In that time, a fire almost destroyed everything I owned, someone tried to mug me in the elevator and an ongoing battle of bedbug problems. Once I did find a place to live, I turned to renting out my pad to make ends meet and bounced from job to job to try and support me and my craft.\u00a0All this whilst playing shows around NYC, working with a couple of Grammy award winning producers and doing my best to stay afloat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have shifted into the next phase of my life. After recording a number of collaboration pieces, I now want to record my own musical vision. I would love your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon you ask?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nPatreon is a platform where I can release my songs, videos, poetry and art, whilst receiving compensation regularly. Technology and platforms like these are now allowing so many innovative ways for artists to show their craft. You may contribute what you wish on a monthly basis, and can cancel your subscription at anytime.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYour money will provide the utmost support in funneling resources that will allow me to fully immerse myself in the musical creative process without worry or stress:\u003cbr\u003e70% will go to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecording Music. $$ will stream towards recording music at home and in a professional setting. It will help me with musical equipment such as a new guitar, speakers, microphones and software. It will also allow me to pay producers to record new professional tracks which is the ultimate joy and goal!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBusiness Education for Marketing my Music. I am learning as much as I possibly can to get my music out there, whilst I do things solo. I am in the process of speaking with music managers and developing my dream-team, but in the meantime, it doesn\u2019t hurt to soak in as much information as possible to help support me in my musical climb. I\u0027m constantly hungry for new cutting-edge information that will help me be the best I can be.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n10% always goes to Patreon for hosting me\u003cbr\u003e\n10% will go to self-employment tax as this is an official business\u003cbr\u003e\n10% will go to myself to have a small cushion in case I need to cover anything that would unexpectedly arise\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI will be updating you on a regular basis through posts mainly on the site, and when I purchase new equipment or make a new recording, you will be the first to hear about it! I will keep you in the loop as updates and communication are of paramount importance when it comes my Patreons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Music\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic has always been my saving grace through which I can most fully express myself... The beauty of allowing one to truly experience a song in all of it\u0027s vulnerability, is to surrender to the journey into existential bliss. It is not unlike a secret treasure waiting to be opened, a single charm on a bracelet, or deep in a locket gifted from a dear friend. Someone who perhaps knows you better than you know yourself. Close to your heart. In your heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are headed into the unknown... but I believe this will be a magical place where we can create a charmed existence. My dream is to be able to make music with ease and grace and create my musical empire and golden tribe with which you will be a big part of. The freedom to create my music at my own pace and in my own pleasure has been a desire of mine since I can remember. This I am asking you to help me with, and in exchange you come along for the ride on the way to success!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI invite you to come and dance with me and join me in my sweet commune of poetry and play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You, Thank You, Thank You,\u003cbr\u003eWith Luminosity,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDani\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
