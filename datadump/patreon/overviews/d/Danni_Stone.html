I\u0027ve been drawing for the majority of my life and in recent years I\u0027ve expanded into game concept art and design. I\u0027m always trying to learn more and better my craft. I love to draw funny, cute, romantic and/or creepy artwork, it just depends on the creative juices at the time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs for how I\u0027ll be using Patrons\u0027 support to keep creating content, I\u0027ll be using it for art supplies and towards upgrading my computer hardware/software as I\u0027m mainly a digital graphic artist. My goal and dream is to be paid to do artwork, but until that time I will continue to create artwork with portfolios in mind as well as completing projects such as comics, art books, games, etc. In turn, I will share with my patrons my creative process and artwork, some of which I will not be posting anywhere else online.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve always wanted to become more active with those interested in my artwork to create friendships and share artistic techniques and knowledge where and when I can. Ultimately, I want to create artwork and projects that will emotionally move the viewer whether it is to laughter or to inspire fellow artists as so many awesomely creative people have done for me. I want to give that back as much as possible.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can\u0027t put into words just how much I appreciate anyone who supports me here on Patreon but even if you don\u0027t, I\u0027d still be honored and grateful if you watch me on \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://danni-stone.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e \"Like\" and share my artwork on \u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/DanniStone01\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e Facebook \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, or come follow me on\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SuperDanniStone\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAffiliates! - If you would like to become an affiliate please send me a message!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig09.deviantart.net/147e/f/2017/015/e/8/dividerbar2white_by_danni_stone-davl3ne.png\" style=\"width: 968px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
