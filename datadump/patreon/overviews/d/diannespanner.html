I mostly take photographs of dusty old museums, tiny hidden spaces and tender moments I like to capture forever whilst travelling, or when I\u0027m out wandering.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.diannetanner.co.uk/shop\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI then make them into cool things\u003c/a\u003e. I make a range of limited edition, handmade pouches and purses using all vegan, carefully selected fabrics - with my images printed on them. Like a functional piece of art you can carry with you to use and enjoy, every day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1495/24392351279_13b5da55b8_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe problem is - I have A LOT of films to process.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve finally found a really good, affordable, trustworthy lab to send them all off to - and I have a large backlog of films to get through. At \u00a38 average cost per roll, I need a little help to be able to get through all of these.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhats in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I plan to process batches of 3-5 films per month (starting in March 2016) to clear through the fridge-films. This will allow me to catch up on processing and eventually start process at the same rate as I\u0027m currently shooting. I\u0027ll actually have a reason to get out and keep shooting - it\u0027s hard to muster the motivation to do so when your photographs don\u0027t see the light of day for months after they are captured.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1573/24464484990_7dda5df5d8_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e Other than my undying gratitude - you\u0027ll get access to exclusive content via the Patron Mailing List and a variety of rewards based on how much you choose to pledge. Rewards like store discount codes, monthly releases and print packages. You\u0027ll get to weigh in on what photographs of mine you\u0027d like to see become more than products, you\u0027ll get to see things first. Plus I\u0027ll send you treats in the post. I love sending treats.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eSimple. You sign up, choosing the amount you wish to contribute to each batch of film I process. I then process a batch of films each month, and share the best pics via the mailing list with you, and a small update here. You are charged monthly based on the number of updates I post on Patreon, which I hope to be once a month - but it really depends on how often I get my shit together. You\u0027ll continue to get rewards for as long as you continue to pledge and you can edit your pledge amount or cancel at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet pledging!
