I travel at least a couple times a year for writing, have at least 2 side-gigs that are affiliated with writing (both as contributors to other people\u0027s projects), a few storytelling gigs a year, and a ton of editing work for others. This is to say nothing of writing itself which easily takes up about 50-60 hours per week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, life in general has put me way behind schedule on my writing - some of you who have followed my work\u00a0 since the beginning have been waiting FOREVER for Wolfsong Beloved. I need is more time and flexibility to focus on my writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe trouble is that, in order to make enough money to to things like pay bills, I often have to sacrifice writing in order to take advantage of money making opportunities - ie full time work and side-gigs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the thing - My best stuff comes when I go out into the real world and meet people or take on exciting new challenges like going back to college and giving the commencement address or traveling to South Africa for a couple months and working in radio. All those things broaden and deepen my work substantially.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon support will give me many more opportunities to write and expand on my craft. That means more books, more short stories, more social commentary, and so on - more of everything, in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCool story, bro. What do you want?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you, my fans, to invest in my writing so that I can be more productive. With your help, here are the things I\u0027d like to accomplish in the next 2 years: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinish my novel \"Wolfsong Beloved\" (Spring 2018) and memoir \"The Loudest Voice\" (Fall 2018);\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite and share MANY more short stories and compile a second short story collection;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite and share more side-stories set in the \"Wolfsong\" universe including TONS of lore and backstories I have been developing over the last decade;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet started on my next novel project, the sequel to \"Wolfsong Beloved\" tentatively titled \"Firewalker\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTravel more widely to do book promotion, interviews, storytelling events, conferences, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI want writing to be my day job. Rather, writing IS my day job. And the pay is, essentially $0.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s your goal?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1000/month. This would constitute a pretty big pay cut but it would free me up to take advantage of more opportunities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example: I was invited to Madagascar to spend a month there as a guest radio host to talk about politics and culture. And, while I could have made the trip work, I would have returned home penniless. I had to turn them down. The money from Patreon will not only free me up to write and share more, but it\u0027ll also help open doors for other enriching opportunities like Madagascar and Mexico City and Toronto and Montreal and Portland and Denver and St. Louis and so forth - all invitations I have had to turn down in the last 3 years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTL;DR - The goal is $1000/month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons from the $5/month level and up will get access to exclusive content released on a monthly basis. This content will also be available for digital download.  At least once per month you will receive \u003cem\u003eat least\u003c/em\u003e one of the following:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA test or draft chapter from one of my of forthcoming novels;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA new short story, or a \"lost\" story I\u0027m actively reworking.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA chapter from a serialized \"Patreon Only\" story (of which I have 9 chapters at the ready).\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of these will eventually become novels or other such things. Some will be things just for Patreon supporters. I\u0027m going to focus more on producing good stuff and feel things out as they go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to contribute more than $5/month? Cool. I\u0027m adding some stuff that will be exclusive for people who contribute at higher levels -- videos, thank you calls, signed copies, readings and so forth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need more time and opportunity to write and write well. $5/month from you, dear reader, will go a long way toward that. In exchange, you will get access to content exclusively for Patreon supporters including draft chapters from upcoming work and some cool \"behind the scenes\" look at my work and my process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh. You also get the warm fuzzies that come along with supporting the arts. So. There\u0027s that \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-- D. John Guinness Habersang"
