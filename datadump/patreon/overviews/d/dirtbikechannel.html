I simply couldn\u0027t relate to their skill level and their focus on the motocross side of the sport.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Slowly, I started to make a few videos highlighting some of thing things I was learning along the way and in the process, Dirt Bike Channel was born. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince two of my other \u003cstrong\u003epassions were photography and video\u003c/strong\u003e; riding dirt bikes, taking pictures of my surroundings, and filming seemed natural to me. People are constantly asking me to continue to create more content and to review many different dirt bikes and products for the benefit of the dirt biking community. \u00a0All of this is very exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere where you come in. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI have to buy the dirt bikes and gear I\u0027m reviewing out of my own pocket. \u00a0Your support on Patreon will allow me to review more of that gear for our community. \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIn short, you can help me to continue to bring this content to the community without bankrupting me in the process :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- I normally upload a new video about every 3 days (sometimes more, sometimes less)\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027m asking for a monthly pledge with various rewards\u003cbr\u003e- If I\u0027m not living up to your expectation, you can fire me and stop your pledges at any time\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time and support. \u00a0It means more than you know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/96664600@N06/30827276831/in/datetaken/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"240\" src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5530/30827276831_20fb262b0f_n.jpg\" width=\"320\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
