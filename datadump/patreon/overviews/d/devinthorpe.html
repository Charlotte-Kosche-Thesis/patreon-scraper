    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI do a web-based, interview show with changemakers, published on YouTube and shared at YourMarkOnTheWorld.com, MySocialGoodNews.com and GoodCrowd.info, in addition to Forbes.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://YourMarkOnTheWorld.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblogging\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0in earnest three years ago and launched my Your Mark on the World Show two years ago, I envisioned journalism as something I would do as a sideline to my career as a speaker. Here\u0027s the thing. I spend about 80 percent of my work time on journalism, including\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://forbes.com/sites/devinthorpe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eForbes\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0(which doesn\u0027t pay) and my\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/devinthorpe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eshow\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, and about 20 percent on speaking. While I love speaking and I\u0027m still amazed that people pay me to do it, I can\u0027t really make a living if what I do 80 percent of the time doesn\u0027t pay. In fact, I\u0027m paying for hosting, tech support, administrative support and a variety of technologies that make my work possible or more efficient. Bottom line: my show costs me money and I\u0027ve got to start making money. I\u0027m grateful to some generous sponsors who have stepped up to help, but their sponsorships don\u0027t yet cover all of my expenses for the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I left my last job, I was blessed with a generous severance package. That was almost five years ago and that money is all gone. The magic well of money that has supported my efforts to change the world and solve its big problems by championing the work of real leaders who are doing the heavy lifting is gone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust today, I was reminded that my work really does matter. When I was in Ethiopia last year doing polio immunizations with Rotary, I met Bob Cairns, who had joined our group after visiting Kenya to deploy tablet computers in remote classrooms with no access to the internet using affordable technology and donated databases. It was amazing. So, I wrote about Bob and his work in Forbes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat was nine months ago. Today, he sent me this note:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe article has done wonderful things for me. I have connected with people all over the world and have helped people set up raspberry pi/RACHEL in the Philippines, Guatemala, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali and India. I have also formed networks with people interested in education and helping in Kenya. I am working on a Rotary Educational Global Grant in Kenya now because of the article. Thanks a bunch.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027m not usually the one vaccinating children, installing clean cooking stoves in huts in remote villages or otherwise doing the hard work of helping people and solving problems on the ground, I am sometimes. But most of the time, I\u0027m writing about them or hosting them on my show to encourage them and help them. And that does make a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me make a difference, too, by supporting this campaign. If you are a social entrepreneur, impact investor, philanthropist or nonprofit leader, I\u0027m already creating this content for you. It has always been free and it will continue to be free. If you choose to support this campaign, however, I\u0027ll have a few perks just for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, help me make a difference for you.\u003c/strong\u003e"
