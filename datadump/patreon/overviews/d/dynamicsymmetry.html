    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Sunny Moraine. I\u0027m a writer of science fiction, fantasy, horror, and generally weird stuff who\u0027s published stories in places like \u003cem\u003eTor.com, Clarkesworld, Lightspeed, \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eShimmer,\u003c/em\u003e and additionally I\u0027ve written a number of novels (full credits at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://sunnymoraine.com/\"\u003emy author site\u003c/a\u003e). Eight years ago I made the questionable decision to become a graduate student in sociology, desperately trying to finish up a doctoral dissertation that focuses on extermination camps (I swear I\u0027m almost done, I \u003cem\u003eswear it,\u003c/em\u003e DON\u0027T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT). Occasionally I essay, and yes, that\u0027s a verb now because I say. I do freelance editing. I also write, narrate, and produce a serial horror drama podcast called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gonepodcast.podbean.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGone,\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e which releases episodes every other week and just wrapped up its first season. The response has been beyond what I expected and I\u0027m excited to keep it going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\u003cem\u003e also \u003c/em\u003ea fannish creator (mostly in a weird little shipper corner of \u003cem\u003eThe Walking Dead \u003c/em\u003efandom), when I can be. I make \u003ca href=\"http://dynamicsymmetry.tumblr.com/post/134034211961/fic-books\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebooks of my fanfiction\u003c/a\u003e, which\u00a0are available at cost to anyone who wants them. I run \u003ca href=\"http://keepsinging.podbean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea podcast\u003c/a\u003e for the fandom\u00a0which (ideally) releases two episodes a month, plus sometimes mini-episodes of individual fic readings - mine and others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short: I make a tremendous amount of stuff. I do it because I love getting excited and making things. I do it because it\u0027s fun and it makes my life better, and I like making other people happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m here\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI do all of the above because I love it, and I would do it anyway. But all of the above takes time and energy, and in significant quantities. When I launch a new project - such as the podcast or the books - it can require me to teach myself a new skillset. It can require me to spend money out-of-pocket. It\u0027s always worth it because I always get use out of it, but the time and labor is there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I said, I\u0027m working on getting a PhD and I\u0027m working on building this writing thing into an actual career. I\u0027m getting income where I can but funds are tight at the moment, and the life of an Artistically Inclined Person is always somewhat precarious. I also have a couple of cats, one of whom is suffering from IBD/small cell lymphoma and requires regular medication. I have my own recurring health problems, and even with insurance those bills can pile up. Basically, I\u0027m looking for something to lighten a little of the financial weight and make it easier for me to keep creating the things I love and that people seem to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo anything you contribute is awesome, and I\u0027m massively grateful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you get stuff, too. Check out the rewards on the side. You can get access to fiction at various lengths including short and long previews of Works In Progress and also fanfic for those of you who follow me for fandom reasons, audio goodies concerning topics of your choice and also Dramatic Readings of some of the stuff I\u0027ve written, writing and audio from the universe of \u003cem\u003eGone\u003c/em\u003e while we await the second season, such professional writing wisdom as I have to offer, and even some baubles and trinkets. Baubles and trinkets are especially nice, don\u0027t you think? At any rate they\u0027re super fun words to say. If you want to know what those look like when I make them, here\u0027s a sample of the general aesthetic (sometimes simpler, sometimes more complex):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/f1974a01d0f7cde9578e867b45ca63eb/tumblr_nvd61ozth31ronbrao2_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously, folks. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
