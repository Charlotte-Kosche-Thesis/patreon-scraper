    "summary": "Music producer, composer, painter, writer and solo artist. I am a person who makes all types of music including classical, jazz, pop and various instrumentals. My artist name is Dark Flower which I have had since the age of 14 when I painted a picture of a flower in the hand of Hindu deity Krishna. Also I discovered recently my parents said I used to call Clubs the Dark Flower when I was attempting to do card tricks at 7 years old wow! I have been making music for many years and find it is a good way to express how I feel as I am quite shy and introverted. I love to paint, and regularly sketch things for music I have made, most of it is digitally done as I\u0027m starting to use some free software which I\u0027ve really developed a passion for. I usually do a lot of speed painting or quick sketches which you can find on my YouTube channel ( mostly music). With each video I always write some sort of poem or text to reflect how I felt or why I made it, if you look close you might find it!"
