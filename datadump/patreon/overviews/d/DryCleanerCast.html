There are a lot of myths, misunderstandings and mis-information about \"the war on terror\" and its legacy, so I felt it was about time to take a new look at it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast has grown and your support and enthusiasm for our podcasts keeps the show going. I just want to thank our listeners worldwide for your support. I have joined Patreon so I can connect better with you, grow the show and hopefully create a more rewarding listening experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to increase the quality of our podcast to the level of shows such as \"This American Life\", \"The Bob Cesca Show\" and \"War on the Rocks\". To do that I will need to upgrade some of my audio equipment. It actually won\u0027t be too hard to get us to that point on a technical level. I also need to buy myself more time per month to do research for the show so I can keep attracting quality guests and engage with them on a meaningful level and give you the best and most informative show possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do this I have created two tiers of support for now, $2 and $5 dollars. For those who can pledge $5 you\u0027ll get access to a new show I will produce quarterly called \"Need to know\" starting in July.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your continued support. It means a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris Carr\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConnect with us on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/drycleanercast\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eYou can listen to the podcast here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/drycleanercast\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDryCleanerCast\u003c/a\u003e"
