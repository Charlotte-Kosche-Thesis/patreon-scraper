    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHello! My name is Lilly and I make a webcomic called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.darkwhitecomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDark White.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Dark White?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n Dark White is a\nfantasy horror comic that takes place in the world of Faya. There are no humans\nin this story, just a bunch of fantasy creatures. Some of these we\u2019re familiar\nwith, such as werewolves, dragons, fairies and elves. I\u2019ve also the four\nhorsemen of the apocalypse and an army of demons mixed in there to cause some\ntrouble.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u2019s this comic\nabout?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDark White is about a good old fashioned apocalypse set in a fantasy setting. Demons are sick of being stuck in the underworld, the\ngods are at war with each other, and the elves are unhappy in general. Our story\nfollows a small group of miss-fits as they try put aside their differences and\nsave their world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow often do you\nupdate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have a full time job, so my comic updates 3 times a month.\nI\u2019m not bi-monthly, but I\u2019m not quite weekly either.  I want to move to another planet that has\nmore hours in a day, so I can draw\u2026. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI let people know ahead of time when an off-week is coming\nup.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat day of the week will\nyou post the new page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI used to post a new comic on the homepage on Sunday.  But I\u2019m changing things around a bit. Time zones\nare roughly Pacific Standard Time\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSunday night: I\u2019ll post the comic page here first to Patreon\nmembers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThursday evening: \nI\u2019ll post the comic page to the webcomic homepage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe following week: I\u2019ll post the comic page to DA one week\nbehind my webcomic home page, like I always do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a way for people to sponsor the artists that they love and support their work. Grateful artists give back different perks to\ntheir patrons for helping them out. Unlike other funding sites, which tend to\nraise for a big event and stop, Patreon is ongoing. Think of it as a monthly\ntip jar. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are you starting\na Patreon page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt makes me so happy that people are reading, enjoying\nthis story, and sharing it with their friends. I appreciate that by itself and\nit means the world to me. This Patreon page is for those kind folks out there\nwho want to give me a hand, and for me to give something back to them in return.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow do pledges work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince I updated 3 times a month and not weekly, you\u2019ll only\nbe charged for weeks I post a new comic page. You can cancel or change your pledge\namount at any time, or set a monthly cap for pledge amounts. You can set how\nmuch money you want to give each month in your account settings. If you\u2019ve\nreached your cap, you will not be charged beyond that for the rest of the\nmonth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou can pay by credit card, debit card, or by a PayPal\naddress.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSince my pledges are per comic page, you will see a \u201cpending\npledge\u201d in your account settings (This has not been charged to your card yet.)\nPatreon processes payments at the end of the month, your pending pledge will\nmove from \u201cPending\u201d to \u201cCompleted\u201d pledges at the end of the month. This is\nwhen your card will be charged.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIs Dark White going\nto become a Pay-to-Read comic?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo. I want to make this clear; I am not hiding this comic\nbehind a pay-wall. You\u2019ll still be able to read the comic just like always. The\nmain website isn\u0027t going away. The only diffence is I\u0027ll update the main page on Thursday. That\u0027s it. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you have more questions, please look at the\nPatreon FA Q page.  \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003ehttp://www.patreon.com/faq\u003c/a\u003e"
