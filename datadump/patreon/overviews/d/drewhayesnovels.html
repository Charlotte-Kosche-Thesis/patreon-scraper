He graduated from Texas Tech with a B.A. in English, because evidently he\u0027s not familiar with what the term \"employable\" means. You can read more of his growing work at his website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.drewhayesnovels.com,\"\u003ewww.drewhayesnovels.com,\u003c/a\u003e send him mail and movie offers at Novelistdrew@gmail.com, or just follow his twitter: DrewHayesNovels. Drew has been called one of the most profound, prolific, and talented authors of his generation, but a table full of drunks will say almost anything when offered a round of free shots. Drew feels kind of like a D-bag writing about himself in the third person like this. He does appreciate that you\u0027re still reading, though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDrew would like to sit down and have a beer with you. Or a cocktail. He\u0027s not here to judge your preferences. Drew is terrible at being serious, and has no real idea what a snippet biography is meant to convey anyway. Drew thinks you are awesome just the way you are. That part, he meant. Drew is off to go high-five random people, because who doesn\u0027t love a good high-five? No one, that\u0027s who.\u003cbr\u003e",
