    "summary": "Thanks so much for being an audience for my hard work and dedication. \u00a0The work comes from years and years of being a kid and enjoying it, trips to the toy store and humming along to our favorite cartoon shows on lazy weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings and hot summer bike-rides down to the local comic shop with my brother. \u00a0This passion grew into a career for me: drawing from what I knew and experienced as a kid to create worlds and characters on paper and digitally through freelance illustration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my tip jar. \u00a0With or without a pledge, I\u0027ll still be cranking out the artwork, but any little bit of support is a wonderful push to keep going, and encouragement to push the limits and boundaries to that kind of work. \u00a0Every little bit helps, and the higher the individual pledges go, the more bonuses you get in return for your much appreciated support. \u00a0Thanks so much for inspiring me to keep going with what I love doing and for keeping these characters alive and hope you can share appreciation for old and new characters alike! \u00a0Looking forward to meeting you all through the art that gets shown here and sent out to you! \u00a0:Donny"

Check out my site to view galleries of character, environment, storyboard and graphic design work. I draw from my experiences growing up and discovered classic art through school in central Pennsylvania, living and painting in Rome, Italy, working in Houston, Texas as a studio concept artist and freelancer and finally arrived in San Francisco, California in early 2010. I am excited about the opportunities to participate in the massive creative community that thrives here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI watch tons of film and television, visit galleries, study comic books and graphic novels, video games, photography and draw from my relationships with people I meet and the places I visit [or aspire to]. I build miniatures I design. I love creating tattoo art for friends. Logos and branding excite me. I aspire to be a chef on the side. I don\u0027t get bored and fill silences and spaces. I want to do everything, and though I\u0027m not great at all of it, I am good at what I do for a living and more importantly, I enjoy it. I want to go everywhere, but I\u2019m perfectly happy here, at my desk, creating worlds, designing characters, meeting new people and learning as much as possible about my craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecialties: Digital Painting, Comic Book Art, Concept Art, Character \u0026amp; Environment Design, \u0026amp; Illustration",
