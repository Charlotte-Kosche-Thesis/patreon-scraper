    "summary": "Hi everyone. This Patreon account is all about my way of \u003cem\u003egiving back \u003c/em\u003eto the GSRD (gender, sexuality, relationship diversity) communities in which I both live and work. I already do, profoundly, and this is hopefully a way that I can viably continue to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany already know about my \u003cstrong\u003ePay-It-Forward scheme\u003c/strong\u003e, to part-bursary fund therapy sessions (psychotherapy \u0026amp; counselling) for the less privileged, whether by sexuality, gender, relationship, ability, race or the intersectionalities therein. So my less privileged clients pay what they can, and the bursary fund (\u0026amp; me) makes up the rest. So past and present clients and others who publicly support my work, have contributed when they can to enable others to receive therapy. To be honest, this work has been coming out of my own pocket more often than not, as donations to the fund - as gloriously generous as people have been - have been sporadic. So fundamentally I\u0027m hoping that by having a base of Patreon investors that this work can continue to be provided, and take less food from my own table!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cstrong\u003emission \u003c/strong\u003eis to take therapy out of the oft-criticised realm of a \u0027wealthy leisure pursuit\u0027 and into the hands of those who truly need it, most especially in these times where the world can be so challenging for any person of difference. This work is about recognising those with the least privilege in our society, and offering them an often much needed helping hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCurrent Offerings:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://dkgreencounselling.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/pay-it-forward-2/\"\u003ePay-it-Forward\u003c/a\u003e (Article on my blog \u003cem\u003eabout \u003c/em\u003ethe funding scheme for part paid bursary places for therapy)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.dkgreen.co.uk/\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e (Psychotherapy and counselling; overdue to be updated!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DKGreenCounselling/\"\u003eFacebook Page\u003c/a\u003e (Counselling FB Page)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne example of the educational work that I do (via the link below) of a presentation I gave for the Pink Therapy Annual Conference \u0027Beyond the Rainbow\u0027, on how as a therapist to discern whether kink or bdsm activity is healthy or unhealthy for a particular client.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/QLFjMi\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvmrfvUIdJg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlongside this important therapeutic work, I am widely known for giving workshops and lectures and sharing knowledge of diversities of gender, sexuality, relationships (including LGBTQIA+, Polyamory, Kink, Tantra and more), having lectured at 5 national universities and held or facilitated workshops in literally hundreds of events since the \u002790s, both smaller and larger national events (organising director of Kinkfest 2014), and giving workshops and keynote speeches for everyone from Tantra4GayMen, Pink Therapy\u0027s Annual Conferences, Polyday, the Unitarian Church youth leaders training weekend and many more). This work invariably takes time out of my limited earning schedule and mostly comes out of my own pocket!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo PLEASE consider supporting my work. I will endeavour to create an inspiring and heartwarming monthly newsletter to keep people updated on all the good work that I\u0027m doing, to share results of this Patreon fund with you, my supporters.
