If you just stumbled upon this page then I will give you a quick run down. I mostly do Anime Reactions but I plan to add additional content once my equipment is upgraded a bit and I can give everything a polished look and production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be using this page to host my blog and Anime film reactions. Don\u0027t worry though it won\u0027t be exclusive content so you do not have to worry about missing out on anything just because you are not a patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll funds will be going towards improving the quality, production and speed of my videos for all of you.
