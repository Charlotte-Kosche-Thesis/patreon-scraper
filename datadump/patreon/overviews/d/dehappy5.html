Last year, we were able to overcome their terrible eczema and allergies through a strict diet. Currently we are slowly getting back on our feet, bringing our boy to life from autistic abyss. We have started to create a SOCIAL MEDIA content since, mostly to inspire people and to share our happiness with others.\u003cbr\u003eWe are delivering daily You Tube videos Mon-Fri, and also we create a content for our blog, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur resources in last years have been our savings, some small income from past business and family help. Our current financial support is still at the bottom. We are on a pretty tight budget but we really want to pursue this mission. With your help it can be easier. Doing this makes us very happy and gives a purpose in life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why we would like to ask you for your support in exchange of what we are doing. If you simply just want to support us, because you believe it is a good cause or if you feel like you benefit from our videos and other things that we create, please take a look at the pledges and contribute what feels comfortable for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much. We are helping other people, please help us to continue."

     "about": "Hello EVERYONE! As you all know more than a year ago we set out on a journey to heal our kids. Thanks to sunshine, good fruit and more relaxed lifestyle we were able to save our daughter Maya. Today her skin is 100% healed and she is just a happy girl. I think you might remember our child who was utterly exhausted about two years ago. Not only that, both of our boys also had similar problems with digestion and eczema, and on top of that we had to deal with Travis\u0027s autism ... The story is long ...\u003cbr\u003eWith perseverance, hard work and endless faith we have finally succeeded. Today all three of them are constantly getting better, even Travis joins us more and more often and surprises us with his wonderful personality, sense of humor and positive changes. Slowly we are getting back on our feet and rebuilding our life as a family.\u003cbr\u003eAll this time we have devoted to our children, leaving what we love far behind us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDuring all this time Ullenka has discovered her unusual passion that she really loves to do - Fruit Inspirations. We all want her to pursue this in order to draw attention to a very important aspect, the impact of food on health and the possibility of curing diseases just by changing the diet, the diseases that seemed to be incurable. She has already written a guide for people with eczema and have had begun to work with a group of people suffering from this disease to help them do the same transformation as Maya.\u003cbr\u003eOur family at the moment has not an easy financial situation for several reasons: first of all, those are our beginnings in this field and we still have a lot of work around children, dealing with their education and care daily with no external help. Currently, we are focusing on promoting healthy lifestyle and approach towards life by creating videos, guides, blog writing, and conducting other social media. It is still work in progress and does not translate into more financial support for our family. However, we are receiving so much positive feedback, to continue what we have started, that we truly believe it has become our important mission. \u003cbr\u003eWe have great results so far, a lot of people inspired by our family can live today normally, and eczema is only a memory to them today. It is for us the greatest joy and motivation to continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
