I am currently relocating across New Zealand and my van has broken down, probably beyond repair\u003c/strong\u003e. This has somewhat stopped me in my tracks in producing content, costly on my time and finances to have the van repaired and wait. Add that and my current mindset has lead me to asking for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have currently been relying on the support of commercial brands, tourism boards, agencies and image licensing\u00a0for income. But these streams of revenue are sporadic and infrequent for a number of reasons. I could of course sell out and earn money by promoting products or brands I don\u0027t believe in. But that\u0027s not me and not what I stand for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have now reached a tipping point where I cannot financially sustain what I create. \"Hey, we love your images, can we have them for free?\", \"you can do our activity for free if you post a photo of it on Instagram\" are what so many publishers and companies say to me. Upon realising they have to pay they don\u0027t want it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not financially sponsored by any company. I\u0027ve tried to get an agent to help source me projects but non have offered up opportunities. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe amount of time and resources I put into creating media doesn\u0027t give me the financial return to keep going. Having pitched projects to so many companies and nothing coming to life I now feel mentally burnt out. Most of my energy now goes into email and managerial chores instead of actually creating media. I don\u0027t even have time to reply to comments and messages because I feel like I need to spend more time talking to companies for the potential of funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography for me started as a hobby using my own personal funding and doing it because it felt rewarding. I made it into my full time job, but recently the managerial side of it has been getting on my nerves. Every day myself, friends and random strangers help to create photos and videos so that you (The Fans!) can view them for free. Unfortunately there isn\u0027t enough time in the day to capture and edit content that doesn\u0027t support me financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy giving your support through Patreon, I can continue delivering inspirational content that will promote happiness in your life. \u003c/strong\u003ePursue on hundreds of creative ideas I\u0027ve been forced to forego because funding didn\u0027t support the time and resources put into photographing, editing and living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, providing your support means you get to see more content of the highest quality, while I get the creative satisfaction of being able to deliver even more amazing media on animals, travel, how-tos and community. As well branch out into educational pieces to teach you how you too can surround yourself with wildlife and spend more time doing what you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on a TON of amazing projects for you guys. Weekly videos so you can follow the journey on @daxons Instagram gallery or Youtube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to CorridorDigital for the structure and help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and above all, thanks for reading!"
