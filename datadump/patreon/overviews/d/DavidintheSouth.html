    "summary": "I\u0027m\nplanning on recording an EP. Right now I have tons and tons of songs that I\u0027ve\nrecorded by myself in my room. I want to start recording as many of them\nprofessionally as I can. I only have one professionally recorded song right now\n(which you can hear on my website; it\u0027s called \"Come July\", I\nactually had one of my guitar students sing back up on it) and it had cost a\nFORTUNE! (And I even got a deal on it!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can listen to my\ndemos on my soundcloud, and if you like them, it would be awesome for you to\nhelp fund their recording. Though I\u0027ve got an idea of what songs I want to\nrecord, I don\u0027t know exactly which ones will happen. The ones I have in mind at\nthe moment on my soundcould are: \"You\u0027re So\nSpecial\" and \"When I Die\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere is the link: \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/david-dorenfeld\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/david-dorenfeld\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027d love to record all of\nmy songs right now, but I\u0027m thinking 4 or 5 isn\u0027t a bad number to start off\nwith. I\u0027m planning on recording rhythm tracks (guitar, bass, and drums) with\nlive tracking, so in other words not all by myself. Though I\u0027ll be over dubbing\nmyself later in the recordings, I may be getting other musicians aside from\ndrummers and bass players to jump on (violinists, upright bassists, maybe pianists...and maybe\nkalimba..nists?!)\u003cbr\u003e"
