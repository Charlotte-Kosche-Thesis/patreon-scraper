    "summary": "Hello and thank you for checking out my Patreon page, listening to the music I make, becoming a patron and for just generally being awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Dayle, and I am a singer/songwriter/actress originally from Toronto Canada, and I\u0027ve just moved to Brooklyn from L.A. I create folk music that is inspired from a love of poetry, nature, a life of living vulnerably and story telling. I also make creative, independent music videos for my songs as well as short films.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created a Patreon page to take my music to the next level and welcome fans into my creation process. I write, perform, record and produce the music myself using only my Logic Pro Software and a Compressor mic. I am comfortable and happy as a writer and a performer, but the recording and mastering process is unnecessarily long and arduous as this is not my forte. My vision of the future includes hiring talented musicians to play on my records, and pay inspired people to produce and master them for a more polished and interesting sound. The money that I make on Patreon will also go to acquiring new and better sounding equipment for live shows, busking, and most importantly...way better YouTube videos!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited that you\u0027ve found my Patreon page and are interested in joining my close-knit community of folk loving patrons. Becoming my patron means that you will have exclusive access to original songs that I\u0027m working on, free mp3 downloads of cover songs that are made especially for you, and behind the scenes footage of the making of my new E.P and music videos.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThank you so much and I can\u0027t wait to see what we create together!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and Love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDayle\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
