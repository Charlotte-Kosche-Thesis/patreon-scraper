Patreon is actually our most stable source of income, specifically because one dollar coming from a hundred people is less likely to disappear than a hundred dollars coming from one person. Every dollar helps make that foundation stronger, and allows us to spend\u00a0more time on writing, producing, and editing bigger and better videos.\u00a0We literally couldn\u0027t do this without you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you\u0027re unfamiliar with our work, check out what your money can help create on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Qubbie\"\u003eDoor Monster Youtube Channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"height: 0;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgBySAs6MVw?list=PL0u5ZHidq4X5VkNLv_qRF-flw0eRaQQ8Z?ecver=2\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDon\u0027t You Get Money From Youtube Ads?\u003c/h3\u003e\nYes! And the amount of money is growing. But there are a couple of problems with ad revenue. For one, ads generate a relatively small amount of money. For our first viral video,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCe3tVbg058\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDoor Monster\u003c/a\u003e, we received a grand total of $198 for 750,000 views. It takes a long time to earn any real income from ad revenue alone, and there\u0027s a lot of work that goes into sustaining it. The second problem is that even when we do sustain it, the amount of money we get is entirely dependent on what advertisers are paying, and sometimes they don\u0027t. During the month of one site-wide controversy that had nothing to do with us, our ad revenue dropped by half. So in summary, it\u0027s great when we get it, but it\u0027s extremely unreliable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat If... I Don\u0027t Want To?\u003c/h3\u003e\nThat\u0027s fine! You live in America or some other country that\u0027s just as good regardless of what Americans say! You\u0027re perfectly free to continue watching our videos and enjoying our work whether you fund us on Patreon or not. Our audience is what makes our work possible and worth doing, so whether you\u0027re supporting us financially or giving us views, you\u0027re a valued member of our community!\u003cbr\u003e"
