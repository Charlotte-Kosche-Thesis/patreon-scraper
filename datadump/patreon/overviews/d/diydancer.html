    "summary": "{ DIYdancer } began as a website that featured dancers writing about and responding to their own art form. Soon, we began filling a need in various communities around the country for considered dance coverage and broader arts criticism: from New York City to Los Angeles, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Denver, and more. In 2017, we launched our print journal with \"Issue 01 | collaboration + time,\" and we re-emerged as a resource for connecting dancers and dance makers, photographers and writers, and various dance communities, both nationally and internationally. We are committed to celebrating dancers as the whole people they are, possessed of a voice and unique story. To that end, we are working hard to elevate our arts coverage to include more first-person narratives from a diverse range of working artists as well as elevate the design and presentation of our stories\u2014whether online, in print, or audio\u2014to better reflect the rigorous aesthetics of the artists. We look forward to connecting with new subscribers via Patreon, and to fulfilling our potential as an independent media organization. Thank you for stopping by, and for your support! Any amount at all helps us move forward."
