I remember my modest channel back in the early 2000\u0027s, \u003cstrong\u003edarkfool99\u003c/strong\u003e. The little channel that could met an untimely end at 670 videos and 2700+ subscribers. In a time where the Youtube ad revenue system was in its infancy, some casualties occurred and I was unfortunately not spared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s 2017 now, and armed with a passion for media and the desire to share my passion for gaming with you, let\u0027s rebuild. DarkfoolDave marks the genesis of a bustling media empire, where limits do not exist. We\u0027re talking a potential future with dynamic new formats, including live-action skits and well-researched analyses! There is so much we can all accomplish together and any support you can provide on this journey is greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is nothing more than a tip jar.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI consider myself fortunate to have your viewership behind me, so I will never charge or expect compensation form you. Rather, I\u0027d like to leave the ball entirely in your court to donate as you please. So if you want to support current and future projects, feel free to leave a tip! If not, it\u0027s all good, and I hope you continue enjoying!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a great day, and thank you for your support!"
