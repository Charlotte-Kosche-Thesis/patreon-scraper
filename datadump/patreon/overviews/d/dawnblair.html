    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eA bit about me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to tell stories.I spend a majority of my free time writing and working on my audiobooks. When I have time, I paint and work on my comics. I have several children\u0027s stories which are written and just need the illustrations to go with them. I believe in magic and the beauty that this world has the potential for if we could all seek out our own personal courage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why is all this important to you?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I want to share what I do with you. A writer\u0027s job isn\u0027t done until someone else reads the work. An artist\u0027s job isn\u0027t done until someone views the work. Hopefully both experiences make the reader/viewer feel something or think about something in a new way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u0027s part\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to create no matter what. It\u0027s what I do, and what I\u0027ve always done. I literally can\u0027t stop. Patreon becomes a way that people who love my work can help me while getting extra goodies. This is a brilliant day and age we live in and the Internet has opened up so many possibilities. But the idea of patrons supporting artists is a concept that goes back centuries. It\u0027s a great blend of the old meeting the new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow what?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI encourage you to look at the different levels of support which you can offer me. The very basic one helps me continue posting fiction every week on my blog and keep it free for everyone whether they pay me or not. Your generosity is truly bringing art to the world, much like paintings which hang in museums today and are coveted as masterpieces were created by artists working for their patron. You are part of that tradition. From there, the levels and the rewards to you go up. See which one entices you the most and meets what you can afford to contribute. Sign up for a patron account if you don\u0027t have one, and start supporting today. Easy as pie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you. Thank you. Thank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very grateful to have many readers who have become friends over the years. I write a story and get to have a wonderful experience. Then a reader comes along and tells me what their experience was with the same journey and it\u0027s always enlightening to me when I see an angle of the story from their point of view. I enjoy answering questions (as long as I can refrain from giving spoilers since I really want the reader to have their own adventure). I can\u0027t complete my cycle without you, the reader. If you are willing and able to support my writing, I am grateful for what you do. A journey taken with no one else to share it with isn\u0027t any fun. Thank you for being part of my adventure."

While the lower tiers and those getting it for free only have it for a week, you will get it for a longer period of time. (This is a work in progress section, but my thoughts here is that you will have access to a piece of fiction for the entire time that it is being posted. For example, a 3-part novella you would have access to for at least 4 weeks. A 30 chapter novel you would have access to chapter 1 for at least 31 weeks, but you might only have chapter 30 for a week. This gives you extra time to read earlier chapters, get caught up if life tries to knock you down, or let\u0027s you re-read it if you wish. I will do my best to let you know a story is coming down sufficiently in advance, but I won\u0027t claim to be perfect. That\u0027s why this is a work in progress.)\u003c/p\u003e",
