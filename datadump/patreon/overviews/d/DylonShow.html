    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m Dylan, but most of you probably know me by \"Dylon\".\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make videos every once and a while and I used to be a co-host on the primarily Rooster Teeth-staff dominated Internet Box Podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow-a-days I\u0027m creating gaming content like streams, funny gameplay videos, let\u0027s plays, etc as well as music covers, and hopefully more stuff related to music in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePRELUDE:\u003cbr\u003eChapter One: Gaming\u003cbr\u003eEver since I was a wee lad and got my N64 I dreamed of playing video games on TV. I would always imagine a 30 minute show with 2 commercial breaks where me and a friend/my sister/or just myself, would play through a game that I loved and just talk over it and hang out. Back in the day that would\u0027ve been Paper Mario, Legend of Mana, any Digimon game on PS1, Mega Man, etc. \u003cbr\u003eAround 2006 when I discovered YouTube I tried to find ways to make this dream come true. I would look up \"how to capture gamecube games\" or \"best cameras to record tv\" almost every day when I\u0027d come home from school. Now that I\u0027m an adult with a job, I can dump extra money into making this desire a reality. I currently own an Elgato HD60 Pro Capture Card, a Yeti microphone on a scissor arm, and many games that I love that I want to playthrough on YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter Two: Music\u003cbr\u003eA few years back my two friends were playing a show at a Toronto-based Rooster Teeth convention. It was amazing to see such two great talents come together and then the unimaginable happened. They asked me to come on stage and sing Payphone by Maroon 5 with them. While it wasn\u0027t my favourite song in the world I did know the lyrics so I jumped on stage and sung, beatboxed, and had an overall good time. When I got home I wondered why all of a sudden I was so interested in music! I wanted to sing, I wanted to pick up an instrument, and most of all I wanted to perform on stage again. The chance came at the retitled Toronto UnConventional (Great name btw. Bring it back!) where the guitarist of the duo asked me to come on stage yet again but this time a few weeks in advance so I had time to practise! From rehearsal to performance-it was a blast! Now with no more excuses to get up on stage I wanted to try and learn and practise more. I picked up guitar, started singing in my free time, and now I\u0027ve started taking vocal lessons! In between teaching myself and taking vocal lessons I put out three videos in my musical cover series \"Songs on the Toilet\" and now that I\u0027m taking professional lessons I\u0027ve started releasing them again! It\u0027s taken a lot to build the confidence to play for a few hundred people online to potentially thousands or millions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCONFLICT:\u003cbr\u003eWith big dreams comes big sacrifice.. ok maybe that\u0027s a bit over dramatic. What I want to do isn\u0027t free, and the improvements I\u0027ve made haven\u0027t been free (or cheap!) I\u0027ve invested into better recording equipment, for both music and gaming content. Lights and a green screen. And I\u0027d like to continue to improve the shows I make with a better camera, even better lights, a better green screen, better audio equipment, etc! That\u0027s what leads me into the final part of my story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRESOLUTION:\u003cbr\u003eWe all know what Patreon is about. Supporting content creators of all kinds, doing the things they love and more importantly the things YOU love! \u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support me with monthly donations that are taken at the beginning of every month, YOU CAN DO SO! \u003cbr\u003eWOOHOO, I LOVE MONTHLY DONATIONS THAT ARE TAKEN AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY MONTH!\u003cbr\u003eYou can donate small (or large) monthly amounts to help support me in my dream to turn my hobbies into a part-time or maybe even one day, FULL-TIME job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCONCLUSION:\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time in reading this and your support if you decide that\u0027s the road you want to take.
