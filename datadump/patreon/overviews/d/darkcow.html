An organization that I created to bring the community together through the development of game modifications. I\u0027m also a long time mod developer and indie game developer. With over a few hundreds mods under my belt and a few small indie game titles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is it you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy main job is to image, design, and create modifications to games. This includes everything in the process from the initial documents, to the code, to the assets, and the final product itself. Making amazing creations free of charge for all to download and enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do what you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved working with my hands and bringing ideas to life. This first started with creating toys and electronic contraptions as a kid. As I grew I eventually found programming and the art of producing modifications for games. However, it wasn\u0027t just the work I fell in love with but what it does for the world. Each mod I make fills a hole in the community and brings joy to others. Seeing others happy drives me to make better and grander creations. Nothing else in life compares to making something others enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have no love for money; honestly I could care less for the stuff but I do love bringing my ideas to life. This takes a lot of time, love, and elbow grease to create even the simplest of things. Even though I\u0027m willing to slave away to produce what I love the world demands my time. It asks I give up what little I have to earn money to stay alive. To pay those bills that never stop marching forward, always asking for more. With this demand I must give up time I could have used for working on my projects. Time that could have been spent making your favorite game or mod better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
