Thanks for checking out my Patreon page! If you are here now, I would assume you came here from my \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/pianosheetmusicfree\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. As many of you might already know, with the help of Synthesia software I make piano covers on newly released songs, particularly those trending on Youtube and the Billboard 100 chart. In my leisure time, I also do another thing that I am very passionate about, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://downloadpianosheetmusic.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etranscribing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, creating the covers requires enormous amount of time. I could spend hours a day just to think of the arrangement of the cover, practice, record and edit it, let alone for creating piano sheets. Often, due to the offline work load I have, I cannot post new videos on a regular basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I decided to join this wonderful platform called Patreon.\u00a0 I\u0027m really excited about this platform since it gives me a channel to which I can stay connected with my loyal fans. If you enjoy \nmy music, like my covers and tutorials and would like me to create videos and piano sheets on a regular basis, \nplease consider giving me a dollar (or however much you like) per music \nvideo that I upload to YouTube! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Patreon, a pledge is usually per video I upload. As a conservative estimation, I plan to make 3 - 5 Synthesia piano covers in a month. Suppose you pledge $1 per video, that is about $3 - $5 a month (or more \ndepending on your pledge). The cool thing is you can set a \nlimit to the amount you are willing to pledge per video. So if I happen to get mightily inspired and create tons of video covers in one month, you won\u0027t \nend up poor and bitter. So\n you don\u0027t have to worry about going over your budget no matter how many\n videos I end up making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge, you will become my patron supporting me and my projects. In return, you will get \u003cstrong\u003ePatron Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e for a specific amount of money you pledge. I have listed all of the awards below, so please check it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI completely understand that often things are tough and life is just turning upside down. So if you cannot pledge, that\u0027s fine and you\u0027re still awesome. Don\u0027t worry, my channel is still free for all and I will always continue making videos for you.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for helping me do what I love. I am eternally grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, by the way, before becoming my patron, please kindly read the FAQs below. Thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. By being a patron today, could I get the download access for past rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince you were not supporting the videos (obviously because you are not a patron yet), you would not get the access for the rewards (sadly to say). If you become my patron today, you are going to support my videos in the month you start to become my patron, for which your pledges are charged by Patreon.  You will get all of the rewards in the future as long as you are my patron. That being said, if you are a 5th tier patron, you get the access to all available sheet music and MIDI files I\u0027ve ever created. More about it later in the reward section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. I am not a 5th tier patron and I really want sheet music (or MIDI file) of your previous video. Can I still get it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure! You still can get the item from previous rewards by donating to my PayPal account, \u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/uEp07j\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://goo.gl/uEp07j\u003c/a\u003efor the sheet music and \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/donatemidi\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://bit.ly/donatemidi\u003c/a\u003e for the MIDI file\u00a0- one item per title per single donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTell me the title of the sheet music or MIDI file you want me to deliver in the transaction note. I will send the sheet music or MIDI file of your choice to your PayPal email address ASAP (usually within 24 hours).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. How should I set the monthly max budget?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou need to set max monthly budget to 4-5 times of your single pledge per video to be eligible for the rewards. More about this will be portrayed in the reward section below. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. When will I get the rewards for the video that I support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards for patrons will be sent in the beginning of the following months, directly to patron\u2019s personal inbox. So, if I created some videos in June, I will send all of the rewards related to the videos early July, around 7th or 8th. This is because Patreon charges all of the pledges in the beginning of the following months. Usually, Patreon will have finished charging the pledges by 6th of that month. This way, I can determine which pledge is valid and thus deserves the rewards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease also kindly visit \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200359925-Patrons\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/2...\u003c/a\u003e for more info. \u003cbr\u003e"

Reaching this milestone means a life long dream comes true. It will mean having the opportunity to do what I love most; creating piano covers and transcribing, full-time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we hit this milestone, for every cover I publish, I will publish it in 2 versions. \nOne is the usual intermediate/advanced version and the other one is the \neasier one for those of you who are just starting to play piano or in the elementary level but want to play \npiano solo of your favorite song.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd one more thing. When we hit this, let me tell you one thing. I am nothing special. I have no hidden powers or super talisman in my drawer. It\u0027s you who are so special. I just make a very small step each day and you are the ones who help me get here. So, I want to give extra little thanks to every special person who supports me here! I will compile all of the piano sheets I\u0027ve ever published in a single ebook (pdf format) and send it to all patrons. I will make sure that this is not just an ordinary compilation. It will have fancy cover design and nice illustration in some pages. I will also include each of your name listed inside the ebook. This ebook will be exclusively dedicated to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReaching this milestone will also unlock the next milestones. Thank you for your huge support. I am eternally grateful.\u003cbr\u003e",
