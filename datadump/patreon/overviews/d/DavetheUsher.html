I\u0027ve been a You Tube content creator since February of 2008. My content over the years has mostly been video game related. More specifically, walkthrough\u0027s: playing a video game from beginning to end with my personal commentary. Since\u00a0I have aspirations of voice acting, it\u0027s also been a personal preference of mine to read any and all dialog, especially from RPG\u0027s. \u00a0Over the years, I have also used various streaming websites to livestream video games and at one point streamed my personal favorite cartoon shows all while providing my commentary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also occasionally create other videos such as exotic meat videos where I cook and eat unusual and sometimes controversial animals such as Camel, Zebra, Kangaroo and Lion. I do product unboxings of various items, record and share my personal travelings whenever I leave home, and share various aspects of my life on my social media pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183,221,232);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(146,205,220);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(183,221,232);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(146,205,220);\"\u003eWhy do I have a patreon account?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSince 2008, You Tube and the internet have been evolving. Evolving into a business. As someone who has loved doing what I do, even before You Tube became a business, I must too evolve with it. I\u0027ve been a You Tube partner for awhile now. Overall, it has helped out. It helps with the bills. It helps me buy the games I play for you, it helps me buy the meats I cook for you. It helps me continue what I love to do for you. It helps fund my passion for my \"DavetheUsher\" side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYears pass and personal priorities change. \u00a0I usually put out around 40 You Tube videos a month. This requires a lot of time and effort daily to keep up. Not to mention the recording, editing, uploading, creating pictures.... you see where I\u0027m going with this. It can really eat up a lot of time. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard it before, \u003cem\u003etime is money\u003c/em\u003e. Unfortunately You Tube is becoming a harder and harder place to have a second business, (job) on the side. It makes it that much harder to keep up the workload with what is your passion/job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(146,205,220);\"\u003eWhy should you sign up and support me here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is where you come in.
