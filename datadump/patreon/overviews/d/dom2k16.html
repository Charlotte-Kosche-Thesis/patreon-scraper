    "summary": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My name is Dominique Willis (Known by Dom2K on the internet). \u003cbr\u003eI have now been on YouTube for nearly three years, and I just recently restarted a month ago because I needed to refocus my life and channel. So far, I`ve gotten a thousand subs in that month, and have created some new NBA content including NBA mixes, and just videos about the NBA in general, some involving NBA2K.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am on Patreon because I am looking to get funding for better equipment so I can produce even higher quality content. In my first stint on YouTube, I was producing actual video series (one called The Three Kings of New York, the other called Golden), these were episodic content that I enjoyed making, but ultimately didn`t have the equipment to take those series where I wanted.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I`m currently 20 years old at a top business school (Rollins \u003cbr\u003ecollege), so every penny basically goes to that right now. My Laptop I produce on isn`t all that powerful and is aging, and my gaming headset I`m using to record is breaking as well. I would like to use patreon to help fund those items, and whatever else I need to produce high level content, and to one day get back to producing the video series I had to abandon because I didn`t have the resources to improve them.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For example, there were many times where I wanted to create moments in my series using After effects, however my laptop just isn`t powerful enough to efficiently create anything with that program, these are obstacles I can get around with funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any kind of donation would mean the world to me at this point in my life and with my channel, as I am at peace with what I am creating now, and just want to do it better.\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
