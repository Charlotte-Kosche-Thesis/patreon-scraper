A fabulous question in which I strive every day to truly understand.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I am just your average guy with dreams of creating fabulous art and touching the lives of others in a positive way, through the change in perspective I may provide them through my art. This is, Demeshots a young artist who believes that life can change through the lens. A once dead and abandoned building can be brought back to life through the art and science that is photography. An individual with body image issues, anxiety, depression, any disorder you may think of has the opportunity to find a new perspective from the outside and truly learn to love themselves through the feedback and appreciation of others who they may never have heard from if it weren\u0027t for a singular image. A new perspective, a new chance at life. I believe that it is my duty as someone who struggles with things in my own life to help others get through the difficulties in their own. This world is beautiful and bountiful, if only we took a moment to see it, understand it and appreciate it. That is what we as artists try to do. As you look down at these images from your phone or a computer screen, I encourage, better yet I implore you to also look up, as you may be missing something great in the world around you in that split second.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is utilized as a catalyst in creation. With your help and generosity, each of you are aiding in the creation of further art and expression. In helping me reach each goal you are helping fund the evolution that is Demeshots photography and each and every model\u0027s chance at a new perspective. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough every contribution, you as a Patron have the opportunity to see the work first hand and appreciate what you have helped create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those curious as to what you may find on my Patreon page, it is an elegant blend of boudoir photography, artistic nude, nature photography, and urban exploration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach model I have worked with thus far in my journey has expressed that before they had the opportunity to work with me, that they struggle with body image issues or other issues. Each shoot has brought a smile, tear or thankful embrace. And for that I am truly grateful. I hope that as a patron, you experience that same feeling of aiding in progress, reinforcing the genuine emotion that goes into each piece.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor just $2 you can become a Patron. This provides you access to a sample set from each shoot for you to view and appreciate\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe $5 tier is the Enthusiast, for those who truly wish to see how the full shoot turned out, who genuinely enjoy viewing beautiful work and expression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe $15 Pick a Roid Tier allows you to not only receive everything up to this point, but also gives you access to a special Polaroid taken from the shoot, delivered to you at your door. For those who enjoy limited edition items and having 1 of 1 copies, this is the choice for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext we have the $50 Tier, Poster your Favorite shot, in contributing at this level you receive the Enthusiast level and Patron level benefits, as well as receiving a Custom Printed poster for you to frame and show to the visitors of your home. These are also limited editions as you are picking which shot was your favorite from the set for your personally signed poster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly is the Collaboration Tier, this tier is $100 and allows you the Enthusiast and Patron level tiers as well as the ability to provide an idea which you wish to see become reality. We will discuss one on one how to make your idea exactly what you envisioned. From attire to scenery, whatever I can do to make your dream come true. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who took the time to read all of this, Thank you. It is individuals such as yourself, the patient, committed, and passionate who make this journey worth embarking on.

     "description": "If I reach this goal... oh man if I reach this goal. I wouldn\u0027t even begin to be able to express the impact. I could finally have the funds to rent my own studio, my own space to create. I use the world around me because it is free and that is what I can afford. Each and every one of you who help me get here, each of you are the brick and mortar to my dream. \"To be able to create a haven for an artist like myself in which individuals may seek my services and share in the creation of art, imagination and realizing dreams\". \u00a0Each of you who have gotten me to this point, you will not be overlooked, your effort is noticed and from the bottom of my heart, I thank you.",
