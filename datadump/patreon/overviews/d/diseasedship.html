    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m launching a podcast in July, and\nI hope you\u0027ll be joining me for this epic 12-episode journey.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI didn\u0027t go looking for this story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDidn\u0027t set out to dig up dirt on my town\u0027s\nesteemed forefathers. Didn\u0027t sign up for a headlong plunge into Cape Cod\u0027s\nshadowworld, either, or volunteer for an excoriating overhaul of my entire identity.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFresh out of cancer treatment, all I wanted was to wander aimlessly and wonder\nat the mysteries of this fragile existence... Which is how I ended up haunting\nan old cemetery in my childhood neighborhood. And how I fell into an empty\ngrave, the same way Alice tumbled down the rabbit\u0027s hole.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I discovered in the course of that trippy descent into the dark recesses\nof my quaint little hometown was a story buried two hundred years ago\u2014one so\nmonumental you\u0027re going to wonder how it could ever have stayed hidden for so\nlong. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything about this story is big, from the tall ship skippered by\nElijah Cobb\u0027s enormous ego to the colossal human tragedy left in its wake. But\nthis is not a tall tale about the triangle trade. It\u0027s a straight-up,\nstranger-than-fiction history of complicity that got buried alive back in 1819.\nAnd it\u2019s something we need to talk about, because the Diseased Ship is still\nleeching its \"subtle poison\" into our sandy soil even today. And it\u2019s\nmaking us sick.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreepier than our best local ghost stories, The Diseased Ship belongs to a genre we might call Northern Gothic. Combining the methods of investigative journalism\nwith the narrative modes of literary memoir, I am hoping to change the way you\nthink about Cape Cod\u2014for good. Beyond describing a series of unfortunate\nevents having befallen the population of our particular peninsula centuries\nago, this gripping tale offers universal lessons on such useful notions as how not to\nspread a plague\u2014whether we\u2019re talking yellow fever or white supremacist\nthinking.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou know how they say that if you don\u0027t know your history it\u0027s bound to repeat\nitself? This is what they\u2019re talking about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been telling the story of The Diseased Ship in libraries and historical\nsocieties across the Cape for months now. And I\u0027ll keep at it, because there\u0027s\nnothing I like more than getting people together in the same room to talk about\nwho we were, who we are, and who we want to be. But this story can\u0027t be\nsummarized in an hour, and its significance can\u2019t be reduced to a handful of\ntalking points. I have now spent a few hundred days pursuing answers, and still\nI find myself a couple ports short of home, hoping for a favorable wind and a\nfollowing sea. To properly chase down The Diseased Ship, I\u0027ve realized, and to\nconnect all the dots of its transatlantic trajectory, I need the wide-open\nwaters of a long-form storytelling medium. And I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nConvention would have dictated I start with a book. As captain of this story\u2019s\nvessel, however, I\u2019ve opted to sail the traditional route in reverse and first launch\na podcast\u2014a far more protean form that will allow me to play out this process\nin public and invite participation. By the time a book is published, I hope the\nacknowledgements page will include your name, alongside those of many others.\nBecause this isn\u0027t just my story\u2014it\u0027s ours.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo will you join my crew? Will you chip in a few dollars and lend me your ear?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nClimb on board, mates. I can promise you an unforgettable journey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nthank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMeadow\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://capecodblackbox.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/podcast-header-launch.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
