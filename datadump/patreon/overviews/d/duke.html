I\u0027ll be producing more than just convention music videos. From non convention based music videos, studio records, interviews, comedy, let\u0027s play and just anything else topical or interesting we want to create and share with the community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRather than offer special tears, rewards and so on at different levels for each individual video. It\u0027ll simply be what ever you feel like giving per month for every video we release. Even if it is only one dollar, every little bit helps!\u003cbr\u003eWhat does it go towards? Hopefully some new equipment, actually don\u0027t own a video camera just yet. Props and anything else that can go into more entertainment for you.\u003cbr\u003eBesides, doesn\u0027t showing some support for your fellow artists give you that warm fuzzy feeling inside? ^_^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe perk of being one of my Patreons?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll have a say in what I and we put out. From song choices, to voting on upcoming video topics. To exclusive Q\u0026amp;A and live streams. I\u0027d also love to some some competitions and give away for those who support me.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll even get to see videos earlier before they are released to the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGIVEAWAYS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right! I\u0027ll be giving away something every month. Normally a T-Shirt or something along those lines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you all like what I do enough to pledge a bit a month. Would mean the world to me!\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, thank you for enjoying the content and I look forward to producing more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuke\u003cbr\u003e"
