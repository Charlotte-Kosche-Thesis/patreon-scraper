    "summary": "Matt MacDonald and Nate Henry met each other in 2006 while touring the country in their respective bands (The Classic Crime and Sherwood). Over the years they\u0027ve kept in touch, mostly because Nate would call Matt on a regular basis to discuss the meaning of life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTowards the end of 2015, Nate was looking for a new creative outlet, and noticed that Matt spent way too much time being opinionated on Facebook, so he suggested that Matt start a weekly podcast with him. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey settled on the name \"Don\u0027t Feed the Trolls,\" as they hoped the podcast would steer them (and whoever cared to listen) away from the endless, spite-filled arguments on social media, and into the more reasonable realm of vocal conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are 100% D-I-Y (which means we can\u0027t do-it-without you!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePodcasts are free, and we are committed to remaining sponsor and ad-free.
