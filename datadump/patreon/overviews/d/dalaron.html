I think creativity is my stronger side so beside it I am trying to improve my knowledge and skills. That is why I am studying Fine art on faculty. Beside that I am studying online. So to be able to earn for both of them I have to work which isn\u0027t allowing me to have a lot of time to paint or draw my own things and I don\u0027t feel very happy about that. So by pledging as much as you can you could help me spend the time I work for others - on my own pieces which I hope you will find amusing. I have a whole world created in my head, started to write the lore, but again, because of the limited time it is going pretty slowly. It would really help a lot if I could have some more free time, so thank you in advance. I will make sure not to disappoint you."

     "about": "I am a 21 old student. I\u0027ve always wanted fantasy art. Probably mostly inspired by books and video games. Since I was a child I enjoy drawing and painting illustrations and concepts for fantasy worlds. In facts I have created a few worlds of my own which I visit frequently in my thoughts. What you could expect to see from me is big worlds with magical creatures, beautiful architecture, wizards, soldiers, epicness, drama and tragedy...Because I want to share these worlds I\u0027ve started drawing and painting. But \u00a0because becoming an artist isn\u0027t easy I have to study and practice a lot. And because of that I have to work so I can afford it. And as a consequence I don\u0027t have much time for working on my own pieces, which is the primary motivation for everything.... So I am in an unwanted situation. Hopefully, I will be able to get out of it thanks to you.",
