Throughout the years they put out daily news, reviews, interviews on the website but didn\u0027t stop there. They also created a podcast network and most recently have launched the Kickstarter for their first comic, Hollowed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal with Don\u0027t Forget a Towel is to always be evolving and always be entertaining to our loyal followers, the Towelites.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dontforgetatowel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Patreon-What-do-you-do.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe here at Don\u0027t Forget a Towel started the website with one vision: To deliver news, reviews, interviews, and all things geekly to our fans, The Towelites. We are very passionate about giving each of our contributors a forum where they can be an individual and get their unique voices heard. We put out daily content and amongst having \"real\" jobs, it can be quite the task!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love what we do and only want to make it better, and get it out to more people; and that\u0027s where you come in. Becoming one of our Towelite Patrons enables us to keep doing what we\u0027ve always been doing, just on a bigger and better scale.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to our website, we want to grow a the multimedia and comic book content sides. We\u0027ll continue to keep things geekly and keep putting out the stuff that you love. We\u0027ll be talking on our podcasts, delivering video content so you can see us with toys reviews and interviews, and keep you involved in the journey of creating our new comic book line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dontforgetatowel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/patreon-why-patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love the ideals behind Patreon. Its fantastic that you can support your favorite artist and contribute to their cause and watch them grow. It feels good to be a part of something from the ground up and know that what you volunteer, directly benefits someone. We want to be able to be as interactive with our fans and offer them benefits for helping us become a better brand!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dontforgetatowel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/patreon-updates.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe update the site on a daily basis and currently work to put out at least four podcasts a month. The comic books we\u0027re working on are going to be updated once a week as well. Our goal would be to put out more podcasts and start doing video content as well. We\u0027d love to interact with our fans on a weekly basis to keep them up-to-date with what we\u0027re working on before we launch it. If it\u0027s a new review, you read it first. A new podcast? You get the topic and the show notes. We have pages from the comics? You take a look at them before anyone else. This will help us get better as you can give us your input and let us know what you like, what we need to work on, and influence our content directly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dontforgetatowel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/patreon-thank-you.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar that we receive from you will go to make us a more polished brand that brings DFAT to a wider audience. We can make better podcasts, shoot better videos, hire comic book artists and update our website with even better content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
