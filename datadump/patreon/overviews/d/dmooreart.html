I\u0027m a mail carrier by day, freelance comic illustrator by night. I\u0027ve had the luxury of working with a decent amount of people, indie creators and small press companies alike, but I\u0027ve set out on my own journey as a creator.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current story is my own dive into the superhero genre titled \u003cstrong\u003eTezla\u003c/strong\u003e. The first issue has been funded on Kickstarter and currently published under Short Fuse Media. I\u0027m so excited to show this world what I\u0027ve created. But I don\u0027t want it to stop there. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve come to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As a comic creator, I wear many hats in the process, majority of the time as writer, artist, promoter and financial backer. Sometimes though, I\u0027ve halted progress when I simply can\u0027t pay for the things I need. Having a family of 4 (soon 5) on a fixed income leaves little room for creative endeavors such as this. Kickstarter is nice to get the ball rolling, but it certainly isn\u0027t a model for sustaining a creative during the process of creating. That\u0027s where you patrons come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and monthly contributions, I can start to build a more sustainable model for not only creating \u003cstrong\u003eTezla, \u003c/strong\u003ebut other works I have in mind for the future. Every dollar goes towards its production, whether it be for supplies, hired work, or printing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eBut What Do I Get in Return, Dimitris?\u003c/h1\u003eEasy. Every month you contribute to my Patreon\u00a0you get early access to everything. For as little as $1 will get you access to updates and you\u0027re on your way to getting content. The more you contribute, the more you get monthly, and the more you help me out, which in turn means I can create more. Win-Win, if you ask me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for dropping by my page. I look forward to creating for you all!"
