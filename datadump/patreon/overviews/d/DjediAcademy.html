     "about": "Musician, Film Maker, Graphic Artist, Cosplay Costume and Prop Designer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn in Ontario, raised in BC, a true Canadian Spirit is within me. Growing up in a small western BC town based in the arts and culture has truly left it\u0027s mark upon me.\u00a0Having so many excellent artists and mentors over the years have left me with a plethora of creative skills and ambitions to bring to the table. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e10 years as a live musical performer on 3 different instruments, along with over 5000 hours of recording and production experience - A graphic designer by trial and error for more than 12 years now, often lead and inspired by the best in the biz - A costume and textiles designer and Cosplayer for over 5 years, specializing in props and leather work accessories - And all along I\u0027ve handled video production and editing to promote all of my works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve traveled many places throughout Canada and the US as far south as Phoenix AZ, and clear up to Dawson City of the Yukon Territory. I\u0027ve been to gatherings which helped people become familiar with their creative and innovative hand skills, which has played a HUGE role in my ability to become more resourceful throughout the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, in my 30th year on this planet with you all, I wish to combine all my skills into a focused effort of both creativity and philanthropy. For also in my years I have experience first hand what it is like to be homeless, helpless, and feeling what it was like coming close to my wits end. I had lost my hope of being an artists as there was no return from it on so many cases... Until one day, a few years ago now, a man named Trinity walked up to me on the street corner and offered me a role in a film he was producing entitled \"Of Saints and Outlaws\" - Of which he offered me the lead role! I was homeless, helpless... but somehow he saw the potential for a great performance in me. Even the character he cast me into was a reflection of everything I was going through in life, and it added a marvelous authenticity to my performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCast as the Inspector General \"Xavier Dorie\" - This film truly added it\u0027s mark to my ambitions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CDCnx-Ozxb4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eThe film screening at the Canadian International Film Festival went on to win us the Royal Reel Award! Visit our website here - \u003ca href=\"http://www.ofsaintsandoutlaws.com\"\u003ehttp://www.ofsaintsandoutlaws.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was truly one of the MOST inspirational times in my life, and most insightful of experiences - which in turn led me to offer this torch to others on my journey. The project is an effort to reach out to those who have lost that creative drive, to restore hope in their lives, and help them share that unique perspective of life that each individual carries like a diamond in the rough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so with all of this in mind, and with the financial disadvantage that I am at with all of this, my goal here with your pledge is to share all that I know, and do all that I can, with and for those who have lost their way in our society, or who have perhaps never been granted the opportunity to become a part of something inspirational and creative in a group setting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your pledge, I, and those working with me on this project, will be better equipped to change the lives of many, and blow the wind into the sails of those floating off the ends of the Earth. It is all too often, from what I have come to understand in life, that it is those folks who live the more questionable lives, and endure the more dis-favorable experiences in life that go on to tell the most compelling and diverse stories about our common experience here together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith hope, I wish to combine the Stories of any and all who wish to be a part of this tale, and so if you wish to contribute some content and / or character to be a part of a historical documentation, that too is a pledge towards the cause of this project. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you ever so much for your time, and May the Force be with you all.... Always \u0026lt;3",
