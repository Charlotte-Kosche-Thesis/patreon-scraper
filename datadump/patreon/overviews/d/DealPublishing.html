    "summary": "Macon Community News was founded in July of 2013 as a free monthly print newspaper with a mailed circulation of approximately 12,000 households by Doug Deal and his wife Lauren Deal. The print run was 6 months and ended December of 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mission was to focus on the positive aspects of Macon and the surrounding area by running stories solely about local people, businesses and events, basically to focus on what isn\u2019t printed in any newspaper that simply reruns the same wire stories one can find in any paper. Our goal was to create a venue where people of Macon and Middle Georgia could write about their neighbors, their neighborhoods, and their interests and then share it with others, without the gloom and cynical pessimism of the paper of record.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree years later, the newspaper was relaunched as an online news blog. After great success and increasing likes and followers to over 6,000 Facebook users, we restarted our print version in August of 2017. The publication is currently published once a month and mailed to approximately 4,000 households with additional 1,000 papers delivered by alternate means. The paper is free, and entirely paid for by advertisers and patrons from the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone has a story, what\u2019s yours?
