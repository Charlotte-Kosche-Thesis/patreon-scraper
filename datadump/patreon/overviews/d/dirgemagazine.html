They invite each other to hang in exhibits.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are publishing fiction. Starting an imprint. Starting a podcast. We have an independent lifestyle brand. We are growing and evolving all the time, as more people come on and say \"Yes, this is my tribe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s because Dirge isn\u0027t just a magazine. It\u0027s a cultural hub for people like us. It\u0027s so much greater than the sum of its parts. If we did things any other way, we couldn\u0027t do it the way we are. If we focused on clicks, we couldn\u0027t focus on community. That\u0027s why we need your help."
