    "summary": "Hello folks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, I would like to \u003cstrong\u003ethank\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ewelcome you\u003c/strong\u003e to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003eI am Don Giani and I make video guides and tutorials on this wonderful game called \u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t Starve Together\u003c/strong\u003e, developed by Klei. I simply love this game, I think you can notice it through my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started to write some guides on Steam with screenshots explaining a few mechanics I discovered in the game such as the \u003ca href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1117480529\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePig Skin farming with the Developer Graveyard\u003c/a\u003e. My objective was to only talk about tips and tricks that people didn\u0027t showcase on YouTube yet as I wanted to be \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e reproduce the same content than the other dudes. I respect all the DS/T YouTubers and I would never copy any existing content! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realized after writing a few Steam guides that I could make videos instead as I have a little experience in editing. Started to post a few videos and then I created a series called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpygQKOs7wkdU1vNcoDNz1jwEX6PY2bPw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSeven 7ips\u003c/a\u003e (tips) where I would give 7 tips about one thing\u00a0 in Don\u0027t Starve Together. I posted the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMFyMHNw7RI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e7 Base Locations instead of Pig King video\u003c/a\u003e and people seemed to like it! After that video, \u003cstrong\u003eeverything started for me\u003c/strong\u003e. The subscribers kept growing so I decided to spend more time on the editing, perform my english (this is not my native language, I am french), try to offer better content video after video and upload more frequently. I also created a Steam Group where I can discuss with my viewers and directly ask them for feedback. This is crucial for me to know what you guys think so I can improve my videos in terms of quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am monetizing all my videos with ads right now but I have a dream : being \u003cstrong\u003eonly\u003c/strong\u003e paid by the ones who love my videos! It would be amazing if I could totally \u003cstrong\u003eremove the ads\u003c/strong\u003e on my YouTube videos, that\u0027s my supreme objective. \u003cbr\u003eI also have the project to start a\u003cstrong\u003e Dedicated Server\u003c/strong\u003e where we would play together, \u003cstrong\u003ebetween all the Patrons\u003c/strong\u003e! With your help, I would be able to slowly buy a new computer to be able to set a \u003cstrong\u003escheduled quality stream\u003c/strong\u003e where I would play to Don\u0027t Starve Together with my viewers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeel free to check the 4 goals at the left!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank all of you, for all your comments, likes, shares and feedback! You guys are the best, I swear. I read every comment and pay attention to each of your requests since the first video I made. I\u0027m really surprised every time I check the number of subscribers in my channel, I will always be grateful for this, thanks a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think my work is worth your money, \u003cstrong\u003ebe my patron! \u003c/strong\u003eLet\u0027s make \u003cstrong\u003eour\u003c/strong\u003e project big and create a true DST \u003cstrong\u003ecommunity \u003c/strong\u003ewhere the \u003cstrong\u003erespect\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cdel\u003egriefers\u003c/del\u003e \u003cstrong\u003efriendship\u003c/strong\u003e will be honored.
