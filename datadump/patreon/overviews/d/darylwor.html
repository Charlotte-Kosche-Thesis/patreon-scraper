I want to help people, not stroke my own ego or be \"popular\" as so many people out there are fixated on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Really. I seriously don\u0027t get the \"popularity\" thing.

Much of Dark Shadows fanwork over the past four decades creates an alternate universe or anything goes material and also tends to pair up the iconic protagonist, Barnabas Collins, with either Angelique Bouchard, Dr. Julia Hoffman, or an original character. This work does not. It is an interruption series. I began the creation in text before the 2012 film came out and discovered the creators of that saw what I saw, a reincarnation of Josette Dupres for Barnabas Collins.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have researched heavily for this series in both interrupting and following the story line of the Dark Shadows day-time drama of the 1960s as well as the films \"Clue\", \"Psycho\" and the shows \"The Ghost \u0026amp; Mrs. Muir\", \"The Munsters\", \"The Addams Family\" along with a slew of others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately in the last ten years people have become very silent toward creators of free material and so after spending so much time, effort, and thousands of dollars to continue this series I\u0027m hoping the people who enjoy it can simply donate and perhaps we\u0027ll all be relieved.",
