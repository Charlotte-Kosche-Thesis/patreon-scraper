    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my world ! My name is Gabby Graham (33) I have decided to take a new step with my art by starting my Patreon account . I am hoping to use this as a way to share my life as an independent artist and as a mother with a disabled child . As I get accustomed to the ways of Patreon I will\u00a0 be posting progress videos of my mixed media artwork as well as in progress tattoos. This will be my attempt to show everyone a glimpse into my home studio and also\u00a0 why I do what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I will be creating coloring pages for people to purchase and print out for personal use as well as sharing in progress art pieces for people to put their own spin on, a kind of collaboration if you will. \u003cbr\u003eMy journey from my home country of Venezuela to the United States has been a series of ups and downs but I wouldn\u2019t change what I have learned along the way for anything. My homelands of Venezuela are in dark times and I hope to use any profits made on here to help out my family who still lives there. \u003cbr\u003eHopefully I can show you some techniques that will help you better your own work or at least entertain people interested in similar activities. I know I personally get lost in and fall in love with watching people draw, paint, sculpt, tattoo and all the other crazy ways of artistic expression . \u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your interest in my world, it means so much to me for you to take time to view and or donate to my lifestyle.Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
