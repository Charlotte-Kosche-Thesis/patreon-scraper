During that time, besides reading a lot of material, I taught students,\nboth adults and kids; researched a collection of artwork by kids from various\nschools and how they were taught (the collection is gathered by the Institute\nof Art Education during the last century); and finally researched the\nconnection between art education, psychology and the physiology of visual\nperception. Doing all that I was able to structure my knowledge into my own\nview on art education, which I now express in my videos. And, of course, I keep\nlooking for better and easier ways to explain art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was lucky and received a great education. I studied\nfor 7 years at an academic art school, where professional artists were teaching\nkids how to draw. They had built an education system based on the best Russian\nacademic art school traditions. After ten years in my school, I continued my\neducation at Stroganov Art Academy and later as a PhD student at the Institute\nof Art Education of the Russian Academy of Education.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWherever I was studying, the situation was the\nsame - enthusiasts are practically the only reason why art education still\nexists. But each year old masters are fading away. So the knowledge of Russian\nArt school educational methods is fading away.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to keep this knowledge available to\nthe world, because it\u2019s the knowledge which allows others to learn how to speak\nthe language of art, how to create poems with paints, how to be a conscious\ncreator instead of a living photocopier. And I would like to add to it my own\nfindings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd I know that most people in the world will\nnever have a good painting teacher - they are too rare, both for children and\nadults. And I know that written materials are often not good enough or not helpful\nwithout video.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s why I\u2019ve created my own series on\npainting and drawing. I would like to create a full course, covering most of\nthe important themes so that professional art knowledge can be accessible for\neveryone, even for kids in a small town. It will never be as good as a real-life\nart teacher, but I know from the feedback to my videos how important having\nsuch lessons is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShooting a good\nlesson is a challenge\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSometimes to write a 5 minute video scenario I\nneed to find a full day or more. I need to write content so that it is\nstructured and brief. I need to think how to explain things better. Sometimes I\neven need to understand physics to be able to explain why something should be\ndrawn one way or another. After that I argue with my friend, an artist, about how\nto present the material better, that also takes hours sometimes. After several\nhours of work the knowledge is easy to understand, interesting to listen to, and\nvery concise to save my viewers\u2019 time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter that I search for locations and objects to\nshoot live examples. I look for paintings to use as examples. Sometimes I construct\nexample objects myself, or buy them in a shop.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnly after that can I move to the shooting\nstage. It\u0027s also really hard sometimes \u2013 the resulting five minutes can take\nseveral hours of shooting from me and a cameraman. Postproduction also requires\nhours to make videos short and vivid.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen I need to write subtitles to translate\nvideos, check them with a native speaker and dub the episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn a nutshell, you can image how much time all\nthis takes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI wish some parts of the work such as subtitles\ncould be made by someone else, so I could just focus on writing and shooting\nnew lessons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor a dollar you get a new pro-video lesson\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI wish to be able to shoot videos more and with\nbetter quality and be able to create the full course - that\u0027s why I am on\nPatreon. For you that means that not only can you benefit a good cause, but you\nalso get professional art lessons with a small fee due to crowdfunding, which\nwould cost a hundred bucks if you bought them as a paid course.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow it\nworks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you become a patron, each time I post a new\npaid video post here, I\u0027ll get the patron support fee from you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am not going to create more than 3 paid videos\nper month. This model allows me to shoot videos when I have time and my patrons\ndon\u2019t have to pay till the video is ready to air. This way I am sure that I\nhave a budget and they are sure to receive new videos.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you become a patron, you\u0027ll be able to set a maximum\nper month on your confirmation page.

     "about": "\u003cem\u003eRecently I\u2019ve been interested in the question: how to paint so that the painting would give such strong feelings as the music of Bach or Schnittke? It is the problem I try to solve when I paint my pictures \u2013 how to fully express with paints the things that give rise to my emotions. How to express the full variety of these feelings turns out to be what is most difficult. It can be silent contemplative joy, nervous waiting or union of beauty and dramatic effect. That\u2019s why beauty and convergence with nature for me are only some of the means of expression and the revelation of the image.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHave you noticed how weather influences your mood, how objects hold memories about what they were associated with, how the world around us influences our emotions, senses, feelings? Compare your mood when warm sunbeams wake you up with when the whole sky is clouded over and rain is pattering on the windowsill. In this sense nature is a splendid figurative method. All I have to do is use it right and to combine it with all the other, no less significant expressive methods, that I control, which will help me to convey exactly what I want to share. I want to deal with such paintings, in contact with which a wave of searing pain will rise to the throat or feelings of joy or peace will overflow; that a viewer, seeing my picture, will live through it with me as its author and performer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cu\u003eBiography:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eDaniil Belov was born in Moscow, 1987.\u003cbr\u003eHe is a member of International Federation of Artists \u0026amp; national Artist\u2019s Union of Russia.\u003cbr\u003eDaniil is ph.d. in art education.
