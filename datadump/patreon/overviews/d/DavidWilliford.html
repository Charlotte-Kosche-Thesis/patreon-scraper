    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my patreon page! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to know where to start, the goals driving this project are so powerful! \u00a0A lot of my latest work has been scriptural commentary on my new page,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thejesusprojects.com/\"\u003ehttps://www.thejesusprojects.com/\u003c/a\u003e  and video on my YouTube channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMjdgP8RDv6UYEvusfMZEdQ\u00a0 (Help me get 100 subscribers, so we can get a link that\u0027s more than a jumble of letters and numbers!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this project is about far more than what I\u0027m doing online. \u00a0I\u0027ve traveled the country over the past three years, getting to know both people in all walks of life, learning about their challenges both spiritual and seemingly not. \u00a0I\u0027ve been drawn to where I can be of highest service, both in healing myself and helping others. \u00a0I endeavor to take the best lessons from my travels and long, varied life experience and be open about them in a way which serves the healing and spiritual growth of all I meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the goals is to kickstart centering prayer groups within churches. \u00a0I dare to ask the question, what if \"Christians acted Christ-like?\" but realize the challenge is understanding the mind of Christ, as thoughts and feelings precede action. \u00a0Hence, the goal of bringing centering prayer, a traditionally Christian meditative practice into the mainstream. \u00a0I believe doing so will help revitalize the church and give younger church goers inward peace lost in the noise of today\u0027s world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this is not simply a project for Christians, I work with people from all walks of life and meet them where they stand. \u00a0Pushing people in preconceived directions only pushes them away as agendas cannot help but be baldly apparent. \u00a0God is the All-In-All and shines in the heart of everyone if we only cleanse our Spirit to the point of this perception. \u00a0The love of Christ enfolds all. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me to spread that love -- and understanding which leads to it\u0027s greater activation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support. \u00a0Without my supporters I could not be doing this work. \u00a0Every little bit counts, and I encourage you to just chip in a dollar if nothing more. \u00a0Even knowing you stand behind this work heartens me and energetically encourages this love to spread.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
