They crashed a lot but eventually I managed them to fly. When that happens, I recorded it with dramatic music and to showcase it\u0027s capability to fly. Over the time, the simple showcasing evolved to cinematic video with a bit of storytelling and much destruction.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and why I should support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nThink of it as a \"Tip\" jar, next to a guy playing some violin or other instrument in a street. Except the guy\u0027s doing a show and telling a story. Patreon is a website that allows people like you who enjoy other person content to support them by giving a monthly donation. There\u0027s zero obligation and you can stop at any time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am very grateful to all my YouTube subscribers for your support and feedback. This is my chance to turning my hobby into a career, and It can become a reality only with all your support. Being a graduate students, I am still looking for full-time jobs while doing some freelance works and creating more Besiege machine and videos at the same time.\u00a0Right now I\u0027m trying to convert this hobby into full time job and I have to convince that this kind of job pays well to my family.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYoutube monetization alone was not enough yet, it\u0027s not that dependable and the ad-rates are fluctuates.\u00a0 And it will slashed any revenue it gain whenever it got flagged by the faulty Content ID. You can even get flagged from using public domain or royalty free music.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWill this channel become exclusive to paid viewers?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nObviously not! I\u0027m completely understand that not everyone can support me financially. And everything will always remain free.\u00a0My hope is with your patronage, I  can spend less time on worrying what to do next with my life and make more videos for your enjoyment.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAgain, this is optional. Only for people who wish to support my channel. Anything you give will help me in these ways:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTime:\u003c/strong\u003e Donations received would make it so I wouldn\u0027t need to have a job, giving me more time to focus to this channel.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHardware:\u003c/strong\u003e Currently, my setup is good for gaming but not for \n\u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 300; background-color: initial;\"\u003eBesiege-gaming\u003c/em\u003e. With enough support, I can buy new hardware and get the CPU with highest processing power available here to remove the lag and frame rate drops I get a lot in Besiege. This means I can include more machine and create more epic battles.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic: \u003c/strong\u003eSome of my videos used free music and some videos that aim to represent other games and movies, did not. I use music from said games or movies to build the same atmosphere and feels. Some videos are flagged by the Content ID obviously, and all the money from ads goes to their respective owner and that\u0027s completely normal. Until now, I always checks whether it will flagged or not and I usually cancel that project if that\u0027s not worth the hassle. With your support, I can let them claimed and monetized by the original owner and I can create more variety in content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
