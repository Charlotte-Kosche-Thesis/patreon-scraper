It\u2019s also a story about fantasy RPG video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThomas McLean grew up being told a simple formula: do good in school,\n go to college, get good job, meet good girl, succeed at life. Steps 1 \nand 2 were no problem \u2013 but good jobs are scarce, the girl moved on, and succeeding at life doesn\u2019t seem possible while stuck \nfeeding grumpy tourists at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in order to meet a skyrocketing rent. \nDisillusioned and afraid that he\u2019s wasting his 20s going nowhere, Thomas\n spends his nights wishing he could just escape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut when his wish is granted and he\u2019s flung into a world that is \nremarkably similar to the video games he plays, he begins to question \nhis own priorities. And so, with the help of the people he meets there, \nit\u2019s up to Thomas to face monsters, magic, mayhem and the specter of his\n own doubt to save the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Makes This?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Renee Calvert and I\u0027m an animator/illustrator currently \noperating out of Vancouver, BC.  After 3 years in the animation industry\n (and 7 more doing illustrations and graphics for a small consulting \nfirm), I\u0027ve worked on projects such as Disney\u0027s Captain Jake and the \nNeverland Pirates, DC Super Hero Girls and Dreamworks\u0027 \nDawn of the Croods. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should I Donate?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI work full time for an animation studio and supplement my income with freelance gigs, and thus my time to work on the comic is limited. At the base rate, the comic updates once a week, sometime around Monday evening. But with your support, I will have the time to update more frequently. Additionally, your support will enable me to create fully-animated 2D \"cut scenes\" at key moments in the story, and maybe even hire professional voice actors and composers to do the audio (I\u0027ve got a great guy lined up for Thomas already). You\u0027ll also get some nice Patreon-exclusive perks like wallpapers, posters and even a chance to appear in the comic yourself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps! The Epic Odyssey is a labor of love for me - it will eventually be created. But with your generous support, that \"eventually\" can be bigger, grander and sooner! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
