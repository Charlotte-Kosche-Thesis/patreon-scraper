    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is \u003cem\u003eDark MsStress\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDark MsStress began as an online adult webcomic in \u003cstrong\u003e2001\u003c/strong\u003e. The continuing storyline followed Donna Simmons, a once overweight, and unattractive pharmaceutical employee who accidentally creates a powerful drug called \u0027\u003cem\u003eSynthetic Estrogen\u003c/em\u003e\u0027, which makes her slim and beautiful.\u003cbr\u003eEven more shocking was her discovery of the drugs effect on males, which transformed them into mindless females for 24 hours. \u003cbr\u003eThe story was a sexy, satirical fantasy I had created as a hobby, that allowed me to depict just about every kink \u0026amp; fetish I could think of, created in Poser software, and DAZ models and props.\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t know it at the time, but it turns out that I was a \u0027\u003cem\u003epioneer\u003c/em\u003e\u0027 in producing what turned out to be a huge niche genre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI took a break from creating Dark MsStress for about 10 years. During that time it always amazed me how many people told me they had actually had seen the web comic, and remembered it. It\u0027s kind of humbling to realize that something you created so long ago was enjoyed, and (strangely enough...) actually influenced so many people all around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMachinima\u003c/strong\u003e was a new form of \u0027real time\u0027 animation I had been experimenting with since 2009, using the virtual world of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003esecond life.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e My equipment at the time wasn\u0027t ready to handle the processing power it needed to produce a video that I was happy with. Fortunately, Once I had gotten some better computers, I was able to produce machinima videos that I was comfortable with sharing. In 2013, Dark MsStress made her return in avatar form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow with a growing \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003echannel, Dark MsStress is created using the virtual world of Second Life as her immersive playground, and continues her adventures with new machinima videos. I can\u0027t make the material as visually explicit as the old comix were. However, while Dark MsStress still appeals to a niche audience which enjoys TG transformations, many new viewers have discovered her videos, and enjoy the satirical references, as well as the humor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist, I enjoy the process of putting these projects together in ways that I could never have when creating the webcomic. In addition to the challenges of using second life for storytelling (finding animations and locations), I create and compose the musical scores in GarageBand (with the occasional license free tracks, if I want something different). I also enjoy putting together the foley (sounds \u0026amp; ambience), which really helps to bring the images to life. Finally, all of the editing is done in iMovie, making Dark MsStress a completely \u0027Do it Yourself\u0027 project, as it has always been.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2001, I have never received money for creating any Dark MsStress material. I\u0027ve never asked for money...The only thing I\u0027d ever asked for were comments \u0026amp; feedback from fans. A number of fans have asked me if there were a way to show their support by tipping me, and while I appreciated that, It was just too much of a hassle for me to set that up.\u003cbr\u003eNow with \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e it seems this will be a method where supportive fans who wish to contribute can do so. So let\u0027s give it a try!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to keep it simple. \u003cstrong\u003e$1 $3 $5\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003epledges. Since people always ask me for the original Dark MsStress comix, that could be a reward to all $5 pledges, as well as other special and exclusive images.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always...\u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003c/strong\u003e to everyone for following my efforts for all these years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e~Midnight\u003c/strong\u003e"
