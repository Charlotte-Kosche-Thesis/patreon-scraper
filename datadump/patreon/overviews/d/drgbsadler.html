There are excellent commentaries on the \u003cem\u003ePhenomenology\u003c/em\u003e available in book form. There are even some great videos out there about parts or aspects of Hegel\u0027s thought. But, until now, there has never been a digital series providing in-depth but also down-to-earth commentary covering the entire work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually, there still isn\u0027t, at least not entirely! Right now, after nearly two and a half years of solid work, I\u0027ve produced over 125 half-hour videos covering the first 320 paragraphs of the work - so we\u0027re getting close to the halfway point! You can see what I\u0027ve done by going to \u003ca href=\"http://halfhourhegel.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Half-Hour Hegel blog\u003c/a\u003e, where I\u0027ve started curating and arranging the videos, anticipating a lot more content to organize over the next several years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s where you come in\u003c/strong\u003e - if you\u0027d like to support an innovative educational project that will provide a valuable resource for generations to come. I do all of the planning, shooting, teaching, editing, and uploading for this series - and a lot of time, work, and thought goes into each video. I\u0027m actually all right with that - I enjoy reading and teaching about Hegel, and viewers watching and learning from the videos say they get a lot out of them - but I\u0027d love to be able to make at least a portion of my living sharing my knowledge and my passion for this work. So, I\u0027m looking for patrons who\u0027d like to support this long-term project - if you see the value in this work, you\u0027re exactly the kind of person I\u0027d like to have behind me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m committed to seeing the entire project through, all the way to the last paragraph (#808) of the work. I\u0027ve already put in one and a half years of work, and at the rate of one or two videos a week, I\u0027m expecting the entire project will demand another 3 years from me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
