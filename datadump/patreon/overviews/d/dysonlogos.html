I love drawing old school pen-and-paper dungeon and fantasy adventure maps. I also love making adventures with them, but I draw a lot more maps than I make adventures. But drawing these maps doesn\u0027t pay the bills around the house... and even with winter finally winding down, it is only a matter of time before I have to pay to keep myself warm again (not to mention the whole rent and food thing).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is your chance to get involved in my mapping. You sponsor my map drawing, and I can afford to keep drawing maps! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/header2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI generally post 2 maps a week to the Dodecahedron, and throw in an adventure every now and then.\u00a0\nYou will only be paying for my own original maps and adventures - not for the other posts I put up on the blog (such as Kevin Campbell\u0027s excellent maps, or my various bloggings about the games I\u0027ve played, new character classes, house rules, random tables and so on).\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will attempt to maintain my current rate of map posting (minimum of 1 map per week, maximum of 2). Adventures are much more rare, with a few showing up on the blog every year.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will not be posting more than 2 maps a week and 1 adventure a month as \"Content\" according to the Patreon model. This makes it so there is an absolute maximum of 10 releases per month. If I somehow start producing more content than that, I will still release it, but won\u0027t list it as \"content\" according to Patreon, so you won\u0027t be charged for my exuberant indulgences in cartographic awesomeness.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"text-align: center; background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #3f3f3f;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/header3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nAll maps released through this Patreon campaign are released on my blog (which is free to read and for personal use), you don\u0027t need to back me to get access to the maps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThere is no guilt here\u003c/strong\u003e.

So if I release only 4 maps one month, you will be billed 4x your per-unit pledge. If I fail to release maps, you will not be billed.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you cap your monthly pledge below 5 times you per-content pledge, then you won\u0027t be eligible for all the rewards of that pledge level. For example, someone pledging $5 with a max of $5 per month is actually pledging a lot less than someone pledging $2.50 with a max of $25 a month (or no max). Basically, divide your max monthly pledge by 5 to see what patron category you actually will belong to.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e"

However, the constraints of capitalism require that I somehow \"earn a living\" in order to pay rent and eat and access the internet. If we hit this goal, for every map that I get $300 or more for I will also release that map completely into the public domain so you can do whatever you want with it. This will apply to every map that reaches that level of funding (as the funding per map goes down as the month progresses) up to a maximum of four maps per month (because I often post maps that are already licensed to other publishers, so I can\u0027t release all my maps commercially every month).\u003cbr\u003e",
