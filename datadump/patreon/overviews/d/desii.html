The cost of hosting is\u00a0quite expensive, anything you can provide to cover these costs helps greatly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo, I bet you\u0027re wondering who I am. Well, I\u0027m Desii, simply put. Jokes aside, I am a 15-year-old\u00a0student with ambitions of being either a developer or a writer, though this is purely a hobby at this time. I started programming in May of 2017 purely because a friend of mine on Discord had started creating a bot as well. I had them teach me the basics and from there, I started work on my first ever project; Godavaru. Godavaru was in alpha (pre 1.0.0) for almost 6 months, and at the time of making it v1.0.0, I was happy. Ever since around December of 2017, I started to dislike how the codebase was, so I created Kumiko as a way to make something new. For a while, I pretty much dropped Godavaru\u00a0until I picked it back up in February of 2018. By the 7th of March, I had created rewrite version 2.0.0 and released it to the public. As I am writing this, I just completed version 2.1.0 and I am finally happy with how my bot\u0027s codebase is. I do plan to make many more changes and maybe even a lot more rewrites, and I am actively creating Godavaru\u00a0\u0026amp; occasionally Kumiko. Well, that\u0027s it for my life story :p\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Comments\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you do decide to donate, I will be extremely grateful, even if you can only afford to pay $1. All donations will go towards the future of Godavaru.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can join the support guild for my bots here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/ewvvKHM\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/ewvvKHM\u003c/a\u003e"
