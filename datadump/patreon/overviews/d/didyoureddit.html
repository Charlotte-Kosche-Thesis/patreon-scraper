    "summary": "Dear Sweet Boys and Girls of the Internet,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Internet is a magical, mystical, confusing, and incredibly terrible place that we here at DYR love more than life itself, and nowhere else on the Internet exemplifies all the best and worst (which is simultaneously the best) parts of said Internet like Reddit. So in 2016, we three curious kittens that we are, decided to start a podcast dedicated to making half-baked attempts at understand the many fascinating subcultures of the Reddit by way of the many strange subreddits and and subcultures they\u2019re about. Since then, myself (u/itsyerdad), u/dogboobes, and u/myfreeday have recorded nearly 60 different episodes trying to understand the world behind different subreddits. Or at the very least, share some of the reasons why we\u2019re excited about them. We don\u2019t claim to be experts on any of them, because apart from r/adultbabies and r/weirdeggs, we are just curious enthusiasts excited about the anomly of the Internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u2019s the thing - we\u2019d like to be more of experts at it. Or at the very least, we\u2019d like to get more experts on the podcast so that they can explain the minutia of things like oh I don\u2019t know, r/elsagate, or r/researchchemicals, or heck even r/adultbabies could use a real adult baby on the pod, so we can discuss the finer points about diaper chaffing or whatever it is that concerns those strange(ly endearing) people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point is, with some contributions from our fans, even the slightest bit, we\u2019ll be able to do more to accomplish what we started this thing to ultimately do - share our love and endless curiosity for the most intriguing subcultures on the Internet, and dare I say, life? Yeah, I dare say. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo where will your cash be going if you send it to us (other than Dogecoin that is)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePromotion:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e We\u2019re constantly looking for new ways to get the word out about our show, and in the increasingly flooded pod market, this means we need to invest in more ads, and other cool things to show people that we exist. You know, stuff like\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMerch:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e You\u2019re goddang right mother fudgers, we\u2019re getting into the merch game. What kind of merch you say? The kind of stuff that strangers will look at and say \u201chey what the heck is that thing you\u2019re wearing/holding/tweaking/sucking (we don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll do with our merch)\u201d. In which case, you can say stuff like \u201chey person, it\u2019s this cool podcast about Reddit you should listen to!\u201d or \u201cBuzzoff bozo, none of your beesnuts!\u201d You get the idea. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore guests, more designs, more time:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Despite the fact that podcasts pay bazillions of dollars (they don\u2019t), the three of us still have day jobs to keep our butts warm. But, the pod is a lot of work, and will be a lot more work when we start pulling in more interesting guests and experts to discuss some of the subs and topics we\u2019re most excited to know more about. So, with that little bit of Patreon skrilla, we can justify spending more time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGet on the road: \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe thing about Reddit is that while there\u2019s plenty of Internet philosophizing to be done, it\u2019s a pretty visual place. Podcasts aren\u2019t visual, so we get by fine without the vis, but in the ideal world we\u2019d like to share the visual part of Reddit too. This could mean upcoming visual pods, but what we\u2019d REALLY like to do is take this thing live. That\u2019s right, some IRL Internet coming to you...eventually...if we can afford it and think it won\u2019t just be us and our moms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s what\u2019s up. We love doing this podcast, and are so lucky to have people who enjoy listening to it every week. Hopefully with your mad earned coin, we can grow this thing bigger and better than ever, and you can say \u201cyeah, those chill DYR peeps are flippin homies bro. They sent me a shirt and sword.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, here\u0027s a video of a dog flying with balloons. Don\u0027t overthink it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqvaVpZzc7Q\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInternet4lyf,\u003cbr\u003eu/itsyerdad\u003cbr\u003eu/dogboobes\u003cbr\u003eu/myfreeday"
