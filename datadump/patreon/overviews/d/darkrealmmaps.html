    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! First off you should know that\nI create fantasy roleplay game maps and adventures centered around said maps.\nThese tend to be focused on one story and could be called dungeon guides or\nroleplay modules. I spend a lot of time creating maps, which I publish for\nfree. These go onto my posts page here on my Patreon and can be clicked and\ndownloaded. You can also follow their progress on twitter at @DarkRealmMaps\nwhere I am an active member of this RPG content generation niche. Yes, Dark Realm Maps is the name I go under because\nI find real names are so boring, incidentally just so you know mine is Toby which\ndoesn\u2019t really say exciting adventure map does it now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA bit about me (if we must). I am a professional\nillustrator and artist. I have an MA in Fine Art and am currently studying a\nDoctorate in Creative Arts. I live in England and have a family; three kids and\na wonderfully tolerant wife. This creating is part of what supports us\nfinancially and no sob story here, we have food on our plates, but if you do\nsupport me I can buy more pens and new shoes for the kids (wink).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, there\u2019s a whole bunch of free content I like to push\nout there for peoples\u0027 enjoyment and most importantly for them to use in their\ncampaigns or imagine they are exploring. This also includes the occasional free\n\u2018map and adventure pack\u2019 with well-crafted text and narrative. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nStop there! Yes, free maps and adventure stuff too, plus\nyou get to see them being made through twitter. But there is more. If you do\ndecide to become a supporter through Patreon you\u2019ll gain access to my Patrons\u2019\nPosts Stream. This is where I publish my One Page Dungeons, ready with text and\nmaps to use in an instant. I push one of these out a month. I also add another monthly\nmap here which, although you can follow its development through twitter, is\nonly available on the Patrons\u0027 Posts Stream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can also get you hands on the originals of my maps\nand can request specific designs, more on this below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is important for you guys to know that I thrive on creating\nthese maps and stories because I like to image myself there exploring and being\npart of the event. Your support allows me to be there in that space where I can\nfind room to create loads of maps for the community. I am offering up places to\nexplore, stories to create and worlds to be part of and with your help I can\nsustain this, so they can become richer and the stuff of legend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese map\nsheets and adventures are Copyright \u00a9 UK protected under UK and international law.\u003cbr\u003e"
