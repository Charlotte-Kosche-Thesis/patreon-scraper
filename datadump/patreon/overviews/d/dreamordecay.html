The other survivors each had to take one of the titles to replace their fallen predecessors; the Goddess of Forgiveness became the Goddess of the Earth, the Deity of Color became the Deity of the Air, the God of Darkness became the God of the Stars, and the Goddess of Immortality became the Goddess of the Nullity. With safeguards in place to prevent another calamity, they hope they can protect their world and all the mortals that live in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMillennia pass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e***\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBea of the Earth is sick with an illness stemming from nullity itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMargaret of the Ocean has been lost at sea for over a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAngel of the Air is struggling to believe his heritage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoldie of the Stars desperately wants to escape this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsh of the Nullity has spent two years living on the streets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is something growing in the void beyond the universe, and these five mortals and their friends have no way of knowing what it means. There is discord among the deities. There is darkness upon the world. Will the calamity return? And if it does, will life persist? Or will all living things be wiped out for good?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e***\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHI! I\u0027m Carter, and I\u0027m a writer. I\u0027ve been writing since I was a kid. In the past, I\u0027ve mostly written fanfiction, and now I\u0027m expanding into original works as well. This patreon is to fund a project called CALAMITY, as well as any other original projects I might undertake in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCALAMITY\u003c/strong\u003e is a collection of creative works about a world that was nearly destroyed by a calamity. It is still in development. The main story, as it were, is planned to take the form of a twine game. While I work on that, I\u0027ve been working on a number of short stories and a smaller twine to expand upon the universe and get myself more used to the characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project is a lot of work! I have friends who want to contribute, and I want to be able to pay them for their work. Because it\u0027s so early in development, a one-off crowdfunding campaign isn\u0027t ideal. I decided on a Patreon campaign for long-term funding and to motivate me to produce content on a regular basis. I will be posting updates at least once a month, but probably closer to once a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Some of it will go to paying my own expenses, and the rest will go to paying contributors! I can\u0027t give the exact numbers as to how much will go where.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all I\u0027ve got so far! I\u0027m excited to be starting this out!\u003cbr\u003e"
