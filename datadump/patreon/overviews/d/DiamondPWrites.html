I am currently working on two main projects: \"The Fairies Series\" - a five book novel series about a teenage girl named Topaz who discovers that she can transform into a fairy and must deal with life as an average girl with extraordinary powers. The other is an animated series called \"Rhythm and Poetry\" which takes place in a fantasy land where each kingdom represents a musical genre. \"Rhythm and Poetry\" follows Princess Melissa as she grapples with the fact that she cannot sing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth series prominently feature Black and Afro-Latina characters as well as other mixed race/Black women. Rhythm and Poetry in particular seeks to comment on social issues, including colorism."
