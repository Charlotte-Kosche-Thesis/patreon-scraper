    "summary": "Hi, there. I\u2019m Devon Michael Dundee. I\u0027m a pastor, blogger, techie, and uncle to the coolest kids ever. I started a little blog six years ago, and in that time, it\u2019s grown into something really special. Every week, I share an article with friends and family in hopes of encouraging them and inspiring them to live full, compassionate lives. My articles tend to focus on faith, culture, technology, and how all of these things are forming us into who we are. If that sounds like something that might interest you, I\u2019d love for you to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://devondundee.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echeck it out\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, this sort of work isn\u2019t free to make. I put a good deal of time and effort into my articles each week, and I also pay annual fees for hosting the content. Up to this point, I\u2019ve never tried to make money off of my blog, but I think the site has hit a stride in terms of content and following. I\u2019d like to use any funds raised through this campaign to offset the cost of hosting the site and further invest in the quality and distribution of my articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, I\u2019d like to use this as an opportunity to invite you even further into the process of creating this blog. Anyone who gives will receive a thank-you on the website, and if you\u2019d like, you can pledge a little more and choose the topic for an upcoming article. If you have other ideas for rewards you\u2019d like to see on this campaign, feel free to send them to me! I\u2019d love to know how to make this as engaging and rewarding for you as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those who already support me by reading, sharing, and offering feedback each week, thank you. I hope you\u2019ll consider continuing to support me in this new way. And to anyone who does decide to give, I\u2019d like to offer a special thanks. I don\u2019t take your support and generosity lightly, and I\u2019ll do everything I can to make it worthwhile for you. Thank you for considering supporting my work! It means a lot."
