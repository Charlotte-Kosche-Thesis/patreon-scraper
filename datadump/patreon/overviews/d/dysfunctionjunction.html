We are a podcast in progress! Soon I will be launching my very own podcast where I share my experiences raising my tribe! I am mom to 5 kids, ranging in age from 2y to 20y. And of course they are all unique in their own way. The things that drive me the most crazy are same the things that make me love them so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs every mom will tell you, it\u0027s almost impossible to find a free second to yourself. Kids are almost like an infestation. They are in your bathroom, in your bed, in your stuff, in your FACE. I needed and outlet, something just for me. A place to go to vent my frustrations,like when your daughter goes in your nightstand and sees stuff that she will eventually talk about in counseling, or boast about my accomplishments, like when I get to tell my daughter what she found in my end table was used for (tee hee). Maybe next time she will listen when I say, \"STAY OUT OF MY ROOM!\" ( I wonder who play me in the made for tv movie on lifetime she will some day write).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a Mom is hard! And sometimes it helps to hear another mom say, \"I have been there girlfriend, You\u0027re doing a good job, It will work out\". And if that doesn\u0027t help, then its also nice to hear another Mom say, \" Kids SUCK! They are mean, nasty, sticky, smelly little beasts! Not to mention, SCARY. They are very, very, very scary. Bottom-line, we are all in this together, and you don\u0027t have to be a perfect parent to raise great kids! I really hope you enjoy spending time with me and my family, we look forward to getting to know you!! If nothing else you will definitely feel a lot better about your own life once you hear how messed up mines is!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0#lbgtqmom #autism #adoption #controlledchaos #dysfunctionjunction"
