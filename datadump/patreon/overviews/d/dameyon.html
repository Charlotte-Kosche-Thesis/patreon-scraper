    "summary": "In 2013 I began forging a path in prevention of suicide, more specifically Indigenous LGBQTI suicide and more broadly Indigenous suicide. In 2014 I began working for myself to do the work that I saw that was needed, and to do it without restriction. It hasn\u0027t been without it\u0027s challenges, but it has been very rewarding. Not just in terms of my own sense of achievement - in 2016 I was the recipient of the\u00a0Dr. Yunupingu Award for Human Rights (Indigenous LGBQTI Suicide Prevention) - but also in the recommendation that \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Indigenous people identifying as LGBTQI should be represented on all Australian Government and other Indigenous mental health and suicide prevention advisory forums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethis is from the \"\u003ca href=\"https://dameyon.com/atsispep_final_2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSolutions that Work: What the Evidence and Our People Tell Us, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Suicide Prevention Evaluation Project Report\"\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSocial media, Twitter in particular has been my greatest asset to elevate the unmet needs of Indigenous LGBQTI people but also how racism and poverty need to be addressed to make a dent on overall Indigenous peoples\u0027 deaths by suicide.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am overwhelmingly thankful for the support of every day Australians. But saying thanks is not nearly enough. Minority groups at highest risk are most often those absent from the co-design solutions.\u00a0Therefore I pledge to continue the honesty and activism in the pursuit of Global Citizenship in the Prevention of Suicide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds raised will assist me to attend speaking engagements that I am not funded to attend and in May 2017 attend the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues to chair the first ever international discussion on Indigensou LGBQTI inclusion in our health and wellbeing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, Dameyon\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
