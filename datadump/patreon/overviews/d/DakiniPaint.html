It\u0027s what I\u0027ve self identified myself as for years. Decades, even. Through High School, College, first, second, third jobs, career changes, moves, relationships, ups and downs. I\u0027m an artist. I make art. I make messes that are pretty. I fail at art and then I try again. It\u0027s the one constant thing in my existence: the deep driving need to make pretty things, meaningful things, artful things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUntil very recently I haven\u0027t had the balls to\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/DakiniPaint?ref=l2-shopheader-name\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etry to sell my art\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve given it away, or sometimes had people offer me money for something I\u0027d done, which always blew my mind. I mean, yeah, I\u0027m an artist, but it\u0027s not like I\u0027m any good. I see the flaws, the failures, the goofs and screw ups and it never reached my personal standard for \u0027good art\u0027. And then my kids informed me that they\u0027re bad at art too. That they see the failures and bad bits and because of those, because of that flaw, they think they\u0027ve failed and can\u0027t draw or paint or do art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTalk about a kick in the pants.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is a process, it\u0027s a pathway, it\u0027s not supposed to be done. There\u0027s always a way to make it better, to improve your skill, technique, materials, mindset... It\u0027s the walking of the path that makes it meaningful. And if you don\u0027t step out and step up and try again, fail again, fail better, then you\u0027re stagnant. The idea of my kids being stagnant, afraid, not even trying! So I\u0027m setting an example. This is the example.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI learned to paint in High School.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mean, I learned how to work in oil paint at a day seminar in High School, outside of formal schooling. I didn\u0027t take Art, or classes, or lessons. In fact, other than that day seminar, I\u0027ve literally never had an art class. Totally self taught artist here. I learn from books, from videos I find online, from looking at finished work by masters of the format. And I learn from failure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFailure is good.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not failing, you\u0027re not trying. So I love to fail. I love to try a technique that might be out of my reach, and see how it turns out. I adore making spectacular messes and screw-ups, because it means I made the attempt. Fear of failure paralyzed me for years. Well, that and Major Depressive Disorder. The combination is toxic, gross and deadly, and kept me from progressing, trying, failing, and living for over a decade. I lost time to the demons in my brain, to messed up, undiagnosed mental issues and paralyzing fear of failure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m inspired by a few key themes in my art.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a woman, therefore I\u0027m a feminist. Female issues, themes, motifs, and feminist thought show up a lot in my work. I\u0027m Buddhist. You\u0027ll see a lot of Buddhist inspiration in my work. I practice shamanic witchcraft, so expect nature, animals, spiritualism, and reverence for the ecosystems of the Earth to appear a lot. I\u0027m an animal lover and rescuer. You may not see my critters show up, but the respect and love I have for our furry companions underlies a lot of the causes I support and the art I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI work in watercolor, ink, pastels, acrylics, and charcoal.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd gouache. Oh, and colored pencils. Mixed media is my favorite, so quite a lot of my work features a mixture of materials and techniques. I love fine detail on small paintings, and big sweeping swathes of color. You can expect to see lots of animal studies, still life paintings, feature studies, stylized Sanskrit and Buddhist symbols... In a truly stunning wide array of colors, mediums, and sizes. Who knows, I might find a nice place to store a canvas out of the way of animal fur and pick up the oils again.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBasically, welcome to my Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you like my work, because I\u0027m having a lot of fun creating it. Help me show the kids that you can fail better and defeat your fears. That you can dream big and reach your goals. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you.\u003c/em\u003e"

I make art; I paint and draw, sculpt, craft, sew, crochet, knit... I make spectacular messes. I\u0027m a woman, a feminist, extremely progressive and so far to the left on the political spectrum that I make most Democrats question their progressiveness. I\u0027m Buddhist, I work with an animal rescue to save small furry dogs and make their lives better, I love to cook and bake, and I like to garden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got two kids, but they didn\u0027t come out of me. I\u0027m gay. I\u0027m queer, and odd. I\u0027d love to be able to support myself by making art all the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a self taught artist. Watercolor stymied me for years, because I learned how to paint with oils. If you know anything about watercolor and oil paint, then what I just shared is hilarious. I\u0027ve been working in watercolor and pencil for the last month and I\u0027m really happy with how things are turning out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy motto is \"Fail Better\", from the Samuel Beckett quote. It\u0027s a guiding theme for my life, because it reminds me to at least try. And then try again. It doesn\u0027t matter if I fail, so long as I try.",
