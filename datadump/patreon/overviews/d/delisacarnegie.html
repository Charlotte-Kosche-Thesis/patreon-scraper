That means I work with Spirits \u0026amp; Otherworld beings to create things infused with energy, spirit messages and magic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love helping people connect to their own Creative Centers, their Genius. Their own Muse Wisdom. It\u0027s not only for artists.

Art is how I earn my money.\u00a0 Patreon helps me pay my bills. The shear joy of having any amount of regular monthly income is practically orgamsic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy dream is to one day have an art studio/office space that isn\u0027t also my bedroom, to host painting workshops, and taking care of my family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow do you get the goods?\u003c/h3\u003e\nSimply decide what amount of money you would like to pledge and pledge it. Pledge a dollar. Pledge a 100 dollars. Any amount is awesome and helpful. No guilt. No blood sacrifice or first born children required. After that, Patreon will automatically charge your preferred payment method for each month . You can pause or cancel your pledge at any time. \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWho am I?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u0027m a practicing hermit \u0026amp; Browncoat.
