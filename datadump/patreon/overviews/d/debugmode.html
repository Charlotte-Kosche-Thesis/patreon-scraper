    "summary": "Hi there! Have a seat. Care for some tea? I\u0027m Andy Astruc, the creator of Debug Mode. I deep dive into video games of all kinds, looking for that special magic that makes the medium what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, I\u0027ve written about how\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://debugmode.io/2016/01/31/of-orcs-men-and-menus-in-mordors-shadows/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShadow of Mordor\u0027s menu system reinforces player motivations\u003c/a\u003e, whether\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://debugmode.io/2016/01/08/witcher-geralt-and-the-monster-of-social-anxiety/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Witcher\u0027s Geralt suffers from social anxiety\u003c/a\u003e and why Sniper Wolf might be\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://debugmode.io/2016/02/05/codex-personae-the-quiet-life-of-sniper-wolf/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMetal Gear\u0027s most complex and tragic character\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe writing ranges from tongue-in-cheek to deadly serious, but the aim is always to look at games from a different perspective than the usual industry journalism may provide. Peer beyond the veil, so to speak. How do games create emotional moments? What makes a mechanic or design choice work so well? Why is one game\u0027s story awful, while another is a masterpiece? I think games are fascinating, and I want everyone to be able to join in discussions that go beyond whether the graphics are nice or the combat works well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://debugmode.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/shadowOfMordorFeature.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the critical discussion, DM also includes a complete (but ever-updating)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://debugmode.io/ludoglossary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eglossary of terms\u003c/a\u003e used in the analysis and deconstruction of video games. I wrote it myself, and it\u0027s free to use or link to by anyone as a handy reference or learning opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMoney?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting these pieces takes time, and they have to be researched, edited, goats sacrificed, etc. Your support allows me to focus more on writing and less on non-gaming work. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve ever had children, but you have to feed them EVERY day. It\u0027s ridiculous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds also go towards maintaining and growing the site, including the ludoglossary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s no secret that interesting gaming content and \u003cem\u003eprofitable\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0gaming content are entirely separate ideas. Debug Mode was always built with the knowledge that it wouldn\u0027t house the sort of writing that would bring in clicks or take advantage of trends; for that reason, and because I personally think that plastering the site with advertisements would undermine the learning and explorative aspects of the project, DM won\u0027t ever have ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a site wanted to sustain itself without ads, the options used to be extremely limited. Now, with something like Patreon, I can create and you can absorb, with no barriers in-between. Everyone gets a load of free, high-quality content thanks to the efforts of the generous few who are willing to give just a little.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCost?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can decide how much to pledge, and change it at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporters pay per article, and at this stage I write one article per week on average. My aim is to increase this as support grows, at which point we\u0027d reevaluate the system. You can use the monthly limit option on Patreon to set a maximum pledge amount per month, so you\u0027re always in control.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://debugmode.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lost-Odyssey-Kaim.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAddendum?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was once a normal games journalist, until I was caught inside the explosion radius of an experimental gamma bomb. Now all my spare energy goes into Debug Mode. I don\u0027t get any press copies, free swag, insider information or nuclear launch codes. All my writing is done after playing games I bought myself and played on my own time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDebug Mode also hosts the odd article from other talented writers - professional or undiscovered. They volunteer their work just because they are so blooming nice. I don\u0027t charge for these. I am seeking a way to pay contributors going forward, and I\u0027d welcome any feedback on that!\u003cbr\u003e"
