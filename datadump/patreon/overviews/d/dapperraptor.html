    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Dapper Raptor?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDapper Raptor was born out of my desire to start actually turning my life into an experience I want. I was sick of working jobs just for money, and after reaching management twice in two separate employment roles I didn\u0027t actually want to do, I decided to take the plunge and start actually working in game design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing around with coding and mod-making since the original Quake, and have had a lot of experience in several engines, including Quake, Half-Life, Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 Arena, Unreal Tournament 3 and a few other bits and pieces. When Unreal Engine 4 hit, I was hooked instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays, I work a part time job, care for my ill fianc\u00e9e and try to work in some UE4 development where I can. Dapper Raptor is the moniker assigned to my development work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a fair question - why should you give me money when my products are sellable items?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort answer? I guess you shouldn\u0027t.\u00a0You are totally able to buy my packs, and in time, will be able to buy my games, as they come out to the public, just like everyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, as I mentioned, I currently care for my fianc\u00e9e and try to manage a part time job. This doesn\u0027t leave a huge amount of time for development - so my ideal situation here is to lose the part time job and be able to work from home, creating more and more great content. If you like what I\u0027ve done with packs such as the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/survival-game-template\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSurvival Game Template\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/quest-map-and-waypoint-system\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQuest Map and Navigation System\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/survivor-vision\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSurvivor Vision\u003c/a\u003e, and would like to see more, as well as non-specific UE4 tutorials, my own game ideas put into action and so on, then that\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a LOT more ideas for compelling UE4 content for the marketplace, as well as some awesome (at least in my mind) ideas for games of my own, but the process of making these is going to be slow without some funding. I am currently also looking at taking on more UE4 contract work - but again, this will slow the process down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have no money, or don\u0027t want to give it to your greedy hands!!!! But I\u0027d still like to show support...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s fine! I honestly don\u0027t expect this to become a large source of income - but it never hurts to try! If you\u0027d still like to show some support, then the best thing you can do is jump on my social links and give a follow/subscribe. Check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/apoisonedgift\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e and follow me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/dapperraptordev\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e. It might sound clich\u00e9, but stuff like that really helps me know I\u0027m doing the right thing by you guys and that you want me to keep it up! And things like subscribing on YouTube can even help to unlock special marketting tools and the like! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, even the fact that you got this far and read through this all is great! Thank you so much for that :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I know you aren\u0027t just going to take my money and run away to Rio?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, you don\u0027t! But I honestly don\u0027t expect to be getting enough from Patreon to be going down the road, let alone overseas XD But even if it does work out - perhaps a couple of testimonials from some of my clients can help put your mind at ease? Other than that, I think Patreon might delete my account if I do something like scam you all XD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eMy company bought the \"Quest Map and Navigation System (QMaNS)\" plugin and I had the pleasure to be the one working with it. Besides the fact that this is a super nice plugin, we had specific needs for our game that were including some changes inside QMaNS. It was kind of impressive how fast he was responding to my questions and how relevant were his answers. And all this with 11 hours difference between our countries! I would honeslty recommend his products to anyone who search for quality and awesome customer service.\u003c/em\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Charles Pelletier\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eExcellent product. Easy-to-follow blueprints. Great starting point for newer developers like myself trying to get a handle on so many interrelated systems. Also, developer has been extremely helpful and prompt. Highly recommended!\u003c/em\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Craig Colby\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eFirst off..... We purchased [the Quest Map and Navigation System], and have to say the developer is the most responsive and helpful we\u0027ve found on [the marketplace]. [He] really cares about his products that he puts on here. So if you\u0027re thinking about buying from Mike, you can be assured it works. 10/10\u003c/em\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- PWSI\u003c/div\u003e"
