To make Disney vacations the best they can possibly be.\u003cbr\u003e3. To provoke interest in evaluating and improving lifestyles.\u003cbr\u003e4.

Your dreams, they\u0027re shining deep down inside you, because that, my friends, is where the magic lives.\" \u003c/em\u003eEver since I was a kid I have heard these words, and my heart has yet to doubt them once. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComing to Disney as a child, it seemed like this mystical far off place that I could never get enough of. I never imagined that I would one day be working for the company myself. When I grew up, and this lifelong dream came true, I began to realize that Disney\u0027s messages are timeless and universal, and I internalized all the things Disney has ever told me about following my dreams and trusting my heart. I have found that the grown up word for \"dreams\" and \"wishes\" is \u003cem\u003evision\u003c/em\u003e. Let\u0027s think back to Walt Disney\u0027s quote: \u003cem\u003e\"If you can dream it, you can do it.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Defining it this way makes me understand what a remarkably strong force \u003cem\u003evision\u003c/em\u003e is in pursuing a life you are passionate about. It is a blazing fire that feels like nothing you\u0027ve ever felt before. This describes my intense emotional connection with Disney\u0027s timeless stories, their superb guest service, and their dedication to the magic. Since the company and I have been through so much, and had our time together, it has grown my heart for people. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd now, I have a vision of making other people\u0027s Disney experiences more than what they ever could have imagined\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a current entertainment Disney Cast Member, with a lot of respect for preserving the icon that is Disney, in regards to projecting positively\u00a0on the company, and maintaining the integrity of the magic. In my time here, I have become passionate about sharing my knowledge on the Disney College Program, and helping people make their Disney vacations the best they can be. \u003cstrong\u003eI am happy to provide helpful tips, tricks, and advice on how to make the most of your Disney experience\u003c/strong\u003e, whether it be working for the company, or enjoying it as a guest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also enjoy writing on other lifestyle topics such as the Christian lifestyle, and finding the best you you can be in today\u0027s society, in regards to productivity, goal setting, and swimming against the current in a culture that many people fail to question. After I started journaling in my freshman year of college, I have grown really perceptive to the world around me. I love observing patterns and people. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd I love taking those observations to analyze and objectify lifestyles, with the intent to propose strategies that can improve them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have grown a new love for writing and helping people with any information I can share. Your contributions are greatly appreciated, and allow me to prioritize blogging and vlogging, while I am still working for Disney. \u003cstrong\u003eMy ultimate dream is to gain enough support that I can start a travel blog/vlog, where I can produce content about Disney parks and other destinations all around the world!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I would love to have the freedom to create more content for your viewing pleasure, because I have a lot of really good tips and thoughtful analysis to which I can offer you access. And as a proud and well indoctrinated Disney Cast Member, I love sharing the magic and helping dreams come true! Thank you for joining me on this journey of growing an informed community of blogging and Disney lovers. Let\u0027s make the magic happen together!\u003cbr\u003e"
