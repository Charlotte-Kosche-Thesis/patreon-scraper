    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m honored that you would consider supporting me and my work. Let me tell you about myself and why I\u0027ve created a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently a graduate student in Sociology at Northwestern University. I was born in Buffalo, NY, one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States. Most of my research work is on understanding how urban spaces are shaped by the realities of our settler colonial present, the genocidal erasure of indigenous people, and the chattel slavery of African descendent peoples. This work is deeply political for me and is rooted in my upbringing as the son of Pan-Africanists.\u00a0Growing up in Buffalo was also huge in nurturing my desire to understand urban segregation and eventually settler colonialism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most of you know me via Twitter @DecolonialBlack. Although I spend quite a bit of time bullshitting, I put in multiple hours each week talking about current events, sociological theory, settler colonialism, African liberation, with a healthy dose of nerd culture (read: Dragon Age lore shitposting). I generally try to provide starting points for people to grow in their political knowledge so that we can collectively fight for a more just world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Projects/What Patreon Funds Will Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m starting this Patreon as a mean to help support a number of projects and resources that I\u0027ve been wanting to develop. Patreon fund will go towards paying for expert labor (designing, editing, etc), paying people to contribute to these projects, and ongoing hosting/support costs for them. Here\u0027s what I\u0027m currently working on:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRebel Researchers Collective: Blog and Slack discussion board that provides space for scholar-activists to connect with each other and collaborate on projects that contribute to social justice and resistance struggles both inside and outside academia. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDecolonized Tech: A blog focused on exploring the anti/post/decolonial politics of modern technology, video games, and nerd culture. Instead of fawning over consumer tech or the graphics of new AAA games, DT explores the social and political significance of these objects from a(n) anti/post/decolonial perspective. It\u0027s a space to consider and imagine other technological worlds that are not tied to current colonial cisheteropatriarchal capitalist values and norms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntro to Settler Colonialism for Black People Project: This is my most personal project born of the 100s of hours of online and offline discussion, study, and debates I\u0027ve had about the relationship between Black people and settler colonialism on Turtle Island. This is currently planned as a series of written guides paired with explainer videos that detail what settler colonialism is, how it operates in the United States, and how Black oppression fit into that structure. Unlike other projects that address/teach settler colonial theory/history, I also address specific issues/concerns that diasporic Africans on Turtle Island have about our relationship to this theory and structure. I\u0027m doing this to increase the general knowledge among Black people of indigenous genocide and ongoing oppression and to give us terms to discuss it in relation to our own history of oppression. I hope this project facilitates more opportunities for Black and Native people to connect and build solidarities that will lead to the destruction/abolishment of this settler colonial society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEthics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is more of a personal accountability thing for me than anything. Being that I want to contribute to decolonization, part of that is supporting oppressed people directly. Taking inspiration from Marissa Johnson and Leslie Mac and their wonderful work with Safety Pin Box supporting Black femmes, I\u0027ll that all the funds I spend from this Patreon on services (design, video, writing) for the below projects will go to Black, Native, and other POCs first. This is my way of paying it forwards to my brothers and sisters as we collectively try and survive and surpass this world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading all of that and whether you contribute to my Patreon or not I hope you take some time and energy to consider how you can support oppressed people who exist in spaces you occupy. Change won\u0027t happen unless we all put some skin in the game and take risks to create a new world. I\u0027d be forever grateful to those of you who trust me enough to take a risk on me. Thank you!"
