    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eFirst of all, welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me: I\u0027m a cat person, though given the way I was raised I don\u0027t think I ever really had a choice.  The high water mark was seven cats in one house, which isn\u0027t as bad as it sounds if you take into account the ratio of cats to people (7:5, if anyone was curious).  Currently, I live in a house with four, though only one of them is mine.  It doesn\u0027t keep the others from  \"helping\" me with my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of what I write, the majority is LGBTQIA+ romance, because I am a sucker for happy endings and there need to be more of those for queer characters.  I enjoy writing Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Historical fiction as well, though all these genres are by no means mutually exclusive.  At least the way I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first novel, tentatively titled\u00a0\u003cem\u003eContemporary Draconic Hoarding Practices \u003c/em\u003ehas been accepted for publication (!!!). \u00a0It\u2019s about Clayton Cooper, a sleep-deprived third year Art History grad student who figures out the works he needs to support his thesis are in the hoard of the Magic Department\u2019s most famous professor, Syralis the wise, a dragon.  Shenanigans ensue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working on a new novel, with a working title of\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Rules of Fair Play to Not Apply. \u003c/em\u003eIt\u0027s about a superhero who is approached by his arch nemesis, looking for help.  Overload, a super villain who possesses the power to manipulate electricity, has apparently fallen in love, and knows his boyfriend wouldn\u2019t approve of his day job.  He figures if he can get to a point where Zephyr, his nemesis, thinks he\u2019s redeemed himself, his boyfriend will be convinced too.  Zephyr doesn\u2019t trust Overload, but it\u2019s too good a chance to pass up. \u00a0The catch?  Zephyr\u2019s alter ego, Sebastian, is dating a man named Peter.  Peter, who discovered Zephyr\u2019s secret identity, and thought dating him would be the best way to gain the tools to completely destroy him.  Only Overload didn\u2019t count on falling for his enemy in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal, is, of course, to do this for a living. \u00a0Or at least, to cover the expenses I\u0027d like to incur to do this right. \u00a0Every little bit helps, and thank you so much for even thinking about becoming a patron!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
