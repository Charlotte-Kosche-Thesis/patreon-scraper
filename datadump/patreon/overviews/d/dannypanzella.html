    "summary": "We have all seen the youtube videos of people claiming to have cured cancer with marijuana, but is there any truth to it? Danny Panzella brings you the film that the pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t want you to see containing information vital to the health of you and your family.\u003cbr\u003eDoes Pot Cure Cancer? tells the \u201canecdotal\u201d stories of several patients using cannabis to \"cure\" their diseases while backing those stories up with medical science right from the pages of the studies; told through interviews with scientists, doctors, medical administrators, and the patients and families afflicted. The film also sheds light on how these patients are curing their diseases, documenting the exact protocols they are using.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe film\u2019s Director Danny Panzella\u2019s mother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and given 2 years to live with chemotherapy. A year into her treatment Danny was convinced that it wasn\u2019t just the cancer, but the chemo drugs that were killing his mother and it was then that he began his journey to research alternative cancer treatments. Down the rabbit hole he went delving into research about diet and nutrition,  and eventually cannabis. That\u2019s when he discovered there have been tens of thousands medical studies which evidence that the cannabis plant can be utilized via different methods to eradicate cancer cells, but only a handful of clinical trials have ever been conducted which is why mainstream medicine largely rejects cannabis as a cancer cure. This film will bring to light this research that the media and medical science have just begun to talk about publicly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI can\u2019t bring my mother back, but I can honor her memory by offering the public important information that she didn\u2019t have so they can make the best and most informed decision possible about their treatment.\u201d  said the films creator Danny Panzella \u201cWe are almost at a tipping point when the media, medical establishment and even the Federal Government are beginning to back away from their position that Marijuana is a dangerous drug with no medical value. I am excited about this film and spreading information that can bring those afflicted with cancer closer to hope and a cure.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e        To watch the powerful movie trailer and donate to the Does Pot Cure Cancer?
