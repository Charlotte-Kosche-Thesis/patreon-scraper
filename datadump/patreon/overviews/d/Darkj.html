I was unsure how to reward the people that decide to donate money to support my dream of being a content creator and making others smile with that content. So after thinking long and hard I have decided to use Patreon to give you the chance to get rewarded for your support. Not only will you receive Discord Roles for donating but you will also receive exclusive content and updates on Patreon as well get the front row seat to my channel\u0027s evolution and a 1st look into upcoming content. I thank you so much for your support and every dollar. I do want everyone to know that its not about the money for me when it comes to making content, its about using that money to make better content and to reach my goal of making people smile for a career. Thank you for your continued support!"
