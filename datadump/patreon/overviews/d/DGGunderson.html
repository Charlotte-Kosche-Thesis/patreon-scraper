    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my work and I sincerely \u00a0hope you will consider becoming one of my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the profile picture isn\u0027t really me but you guessed that. That little girl is the reason I am putting my work on Patreon. Jessica is severely autistic and every father\u0027s nightmare, an utterly adorable little blonde who will quite literally walk away with anyone who is nice to her. Imagine a child who does not and cannot know the difference between right and wrong, she is a true innocent and it is her father\u0027s job to protect and support her. The day job is doing that so far, but Daddy can\u0027t \u00a0be around forever, Jessie needs a legacy, and I am hoping that my novels will support her long after I am gone. Becoming one of my patrons gives you a stake in Jessie\u0027s life, and you might actually enjoy my novels and short stories. If I can make this a full time profession I can write more and give away more. In addition to my novels I have shorter stories to tell about life on submarines and about living and working in the Middle East. I met my German wife in Calcutta, India. Jessica was born in Germany and her little brother was born in Kuwait City, Kuwait. We\u0027ve been around and have some stories to tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo back to my work. The Time and Time Again series is not about submarines or the Middle East. It\u0027s about hope, 18th century history and genuine eternal love. What if you knew with absolute certainty that you had lived a hundred past lives and you could remember the details of those lives? You could speak the languages, you had the skills of great warriors and great thinkers. What would you do with that knowledge in this life? What would you do if you were a ten-year-old Native American girl with all of that knowledge, it\u0027s 1771 and it\u0027s your job to stop a revolution? Why? Because William Pitt and Benjamin Franklin ordered you to in your last life. Oh, and in your last life you were a man married to a fiery redhead and you had a child together. Now you need to find your former wife in order to complete your mission and you are the same age as your child. You are going to love this story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately Amazon owns the distribution rights to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Time-Again-Book-One-Enlightenment-ebook/dp/B00C4Y8T76/ref=sr_1_1?s=books\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1491429411\u0026amp;sr=1-1\u0026amp;keywords=Time+and+Time+again+Book+One%3A+Enlightenment\"\u003eTime\u00a0And\u00a0Time Again Book One: Enlightenment\u003c/a\u003e. As much as I\u0027d like to post it on Patreon I cannot afford to be sued by a ginormous corporation that has fleet of drones. What I am offering here is \u003cstrong\u003eTime And Time Again Book Two: Evolution and Revolution\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eas I complete each chapter.\u00a0It helps to have read the first book but it isn\u0027t absolutely necessary. Book One can be very funny though, I\u0027d hate for you to miss it. Click the link above to check it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking my patrons for 1$ per month. I can guarantee at least one new chapter per month. I also expect to be able to add short stories regularly. I am also asking for cover art suggestions for Book Two and my patrons will vote on the submissions. The winner will get full credit and when the novel comes out in hard copy they will get a signed copy with a special acknowledgement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there we are. I need you, Jessica needs you. In return you get great stories and some of them, as unbelievable as they may sound, are absolutely true, no sh*t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer: Never trust a sailor who starts a story \"No Sh*t..,\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
