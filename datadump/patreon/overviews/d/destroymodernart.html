    "summary": "Ciao!!\u003cbr\u003eIn around 3 weeks I\u0027ll be moving to Italy! Calabria! \u003cbr\u003eWHY?? So many Italians ask me? Its an area of high unemployment, low population, organised crime and... \"Africans\"...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell. I\u0027ve signed up to do 2 weeks voluntary work helping at a refugee center in a tiny village where the population was so low the mayor began to give houses to refugees to stop the place becoming a ghost town. Refugees are welcome in this area. I\u0027ll be helping with things like childcare, teaching English to teens and adults, art workshops... and helping people stay motivated. I\u0027m paying a lot of money for this chance- helping refugees- unless you work for UNHCR or another group is a self-funded mission. I managed to raise over \u00a32000 by selling my art work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am also moving there for selfish reasons. I want to learn new languages, meet new people, start my life over without the burden of *hoarded junk\" I\u0027ve collected over the years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m super excited but also taking a huge chance on life. I haven\u0027t sorted a job out yet, I think its the kind of place where I\u0027ll have to find work in person. So I\u0027m taking all my handmade jewellery and will be selling it there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m more settled I\u0027ll start the comic again, it really helps me process things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI wanna do it digitally now, if possible. I\u0027m hoping to work freelance when over there too, so I\u0027ll need to start using Adobe programs on my new laptop. Money from Patreon will go to helping me pay for that until I get regular work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReally appreciate the support I\u0027ve had so far. Helped me keep it together during a very difficult part of my life. I wouldn\u0027t be able to start this new part of my life if I hadn\u0027t used this comic as a kind of therapy.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrazie mille Amici :) xxx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ghostofspiderplant/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/ghostofspiderplant/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://destroymodernart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
