    "summary": "For the past 27 years I\u2019ve become an accomplished multi-tasker by working as a photographer, writer, speaker, and counselor. And those are only my paying jobs. I was able to make this work in my thirties and forties but something happened when I turned fifty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started wanting to channel those divergent streams into one river: writing. This felt simultaneously exciting and daunting. For a while, the daunting won out and I tried to dismiss the endless parade of words and ideas which marched through my head. \u003cem\u003eWhy would I choose to pursue such a competitive career which offered no real hope of adequate compensation?\u003c/em\u003e (Hadn\u0027t I already been there, done that with photography?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, I felt a surge of confidence. I knew I had both wisdom and a unique perspective, so I began blogging in earnest and submitted a few articles to \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god/practical-faith/fear-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-control-you\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRelevant Magazine\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2013/august/how-seeker-sensitive-consumer-church-is-failing-generation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHer.meneutics\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, (Christianity Today\u2019s site for women writers which was recently rebranded as CTWomen). Crazy thing, they said yes. And they\u2019ve continued to say yes (as have other publications). Now, five years later, I get out of bed, commute 20 steps to my lovely, little office and write for most of my days. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sit at this solitary desk week after week in the hope of offering wisdom and encouragement. I write about how my faith intersects with culture and \u003ca href=\"http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god/practical-faith/when-god-doesn%E2%80%99t-answer-prayer\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eeveryday life\u003c/a\u003e. I write about how to have whole and healthy \u003ca href=\"http://www.todayschristianwoman.com/articles/2013/december/holy-resignation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003erelationships\u003c/a\u003e, how to lead and parent well, and sometimes, how to make outrageous \u003ca href=\"http://www.dorothygreco.com/the-best-gfdf-cheesecake-ever/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGF/DF desserts\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.dorothygreco.com/gluten-free-granola-recipe/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eother goodies\u003c/a\u003e. My first book,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dorothygreco.com/my-book/\"\u003eMaking Marriage Beautiful\u003c/a\u003e, (by \u003ca href=\"http://www.christianbook.com/page/christian-books?navcat=Books\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDavid C. Cook\u003c/a\u003e), was released in January of 2017. God willing, I will keep making photographs until the day I die.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel engaged and love what I\u2019m doing. I\u0027ve gotten terrific feedback from editors and readers. It\u0027s all good\u2013with one exception. Few of these publications pay and when they do, it tends to be in the order of $75 per piece (at my current pace, this translates to less than minimum wage). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy husband is a teacher and a pastor, we live in an expensive part of the country, and in a few short months, we\u0027ll have two sons in college. I don\u2019t need to earn lots of money, but I do need to earn some. And that\u2019s where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any desire to partner with me in my creative endeavors, you can become one of my patrons. Patreon is a crowd funding organization much like Kickstarter but rather than money going to one big project like a movie or recording, it\u2019s an ongoing system of support which allows artists and creators to devote our time and energy to creating content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is that you commit to support me on a monthly basis. You decide how much you would like to give and simply enter that amount in the box at the top left.\u00a0You can set a cap on your monthly tips and you can opt out at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested but not familiar with my work, I suggest you visit my site (\u003ca href=\"http://www.dorothygreco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.dorothygreco.com\u003c/a\u003e) and read a few articles, browse my photography work, and make sure you can sign off on what I\u2019m doing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a tangible thanks, I\u2019ll offer free photo downloads (check out some \u003ca href=\"http://www.dorothygreco.com/photography/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esamples here\u003c/a\u003e) and a signed copy of my book. You can read more about specific rewards in the boxes below. Thanks so much. Your generosity will make a huge difference for our entire family."
