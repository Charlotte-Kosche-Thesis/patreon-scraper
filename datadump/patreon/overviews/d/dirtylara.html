    "summary": "I\u0027m an adult webcam model, but that\u0027s not what this is for. I\u0027m other things, too. Like a single mom and a smartass and an immigrant and a slut and someone that has wanted to write all her life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe substance of what you\u0027ll find here will be: attempts at short stories, peeks into my life, anecdotes, casual thought trains, reactions to things I\u0027m reading, who knows what else. I won\u0027t even stick with one genre. I will have some pieces I clearly love and toil over and some that are simply meant to be breezed through and left behind. I have to get lost in other people\u0027s stories or my own inventions. It\u0027s just survival for my pretty tormented mind, but I think with some work I can drag some of it out into stories that are fun to hear and tell.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am opening up channels for you to drive some of what I write or read, so you could realistically bully me into writing about whatever you want though it will always be my own way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy guess is that this won\u0027t be WHERE I write the book or books I hope to write eventually, but this is probably where some of my ideas will take shape and where I will find myself as a writer in 1,000 different ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yes anyone who thinks there\u0027s a chance I\u0027m worth investing in as a writer and does this with me will be thanked personally (however you wanna be identified) if (when?) I publish something. I mean publishing houses, letters of rejection, ultimate acceptance, real book shit - that\u0027s what I\u0027m going for here. This isn\u0027t some\u00a0self-publish ebook bullshit thing, ok? I\u0027m either doing it right or I\u0027m conceding defeat. I don\u0027t have a terrible lot of dignity, I\u0027ll admit, but don\u0027t try to tell me I don\u0027t have that much, y\u0027hear?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a long way from conceding defeat and I will quietly wait here until you come. I stubbornly believe that you will.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you\u0027re\u00a0interested in my smut, please know that Patreon doesn\u0027t support sex workers selling their online\u00a0services and I am not offering any explicit stuff; no pics, no vids, no shows, NUTHIN. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e Go to my \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/dirtylara\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eabout my other skillz, if you wish. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf I ever post videos or photos they will not be explicit. Claro? Just words about explicit life. And words about explicit thoughts. And expletives. And other words, too. Probably some non-explicit images or videos from time to time, if there\u0027s a reason. This Patreon page is truly to support me as a\u00a0writer. A hoe. But a hoe writer.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI am sure to make changes to settings and tiers as I go, but your stated rewards will be \"grandfathered in\"\u00a0if I change them as long as you\u0027re still around at that same level.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you choose to support this endeavor know that\u00a0I welcome your honest opinions \u0026amp; participation, that you\u0027re welcome to be quiet if you wish, and that if you change or cancel anytime I\u00a0won\u0027t hold it against you and I\u0027ll thank\u00a0you if I ever do write a\u00a0book. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI don\u0027t really expect anything from anyone. But I try to believe people, and people tell me to write. And maybe I will. Maybe with you, I will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
