    "summary": "I am just a young guy with strange ideas about writing. I\u0027d been giving this whole Patreon thing some consideration for a while and thought, \"Hey, why not try and see about getting a modest income out of my life\u0027s greatest passion.\" At first I was somewhat reluctant to throw myself out here, as I am not the most socially minded of people, and some internet outlets seem to paint Patreon content providers in a less than pleasant light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet from my experiences with it supporting others, and what I think it stands for after seeing some of what it truly does for people, offering them a means to support themselves with their passions in a world where it gets harder every day to do such a thing, allow others to see what exactly it is that these creators are passionate about, and if you like what you see, give them a little help on their way, I believe this organization has the potential to help a lot of people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I decided to give it a try, even though I am not usually comfortable with putting myself out on the internet. I\u0027ve been writing for quite a while now, ever since I turned sixteen, or at least I think I was sixteen. My memory is not exactly my strongest quality. Most of my exploits in written medium over the years tend to be romantic in concept and design, maybe that\u0027s unexpected? But I\u0027ve always believed love to be the greatest quality of us humans, call me a softie if you will.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and I am also somewhat of a furry, though I find that title somewhat... emasculating? I don\u0027t know, blame the media for turning that word sour. I look to my childhood and Disney for my affliction. In any case I mention this because my work tends to feature anthropomorphic characters more often than not, and if that\u0027s not your gig, well all the power to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell I could probably go on about myself for hours, though I wouldn\u0027t wish to sound narcissistic. I suppose to make a long story short, I hope to make something of myself with this particular expedition, perhaps fulfill my life\u0027s dream of earning a living off my passion, like so many others on Patreon, and would heartily thank anyone else who would like to take this trip with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027d imagine, it\u0027ll be slow to start, and it\u0027ll probably be a while before I find what will work so I hope I can ask for you patience as I start out on this venture. I don\u0027t have any rewards as of yet, but I\u0027ll be sure to think of some in the near future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a reference to what I do and my style so to speak, you can look at my Sofurry Account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drake-the-traveller.sofurry.com/\"\u003ehttps://drake-the-traveller.sofurry.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
