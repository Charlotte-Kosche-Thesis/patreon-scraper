However, I\u0027m also a content creator with various different passions and involvement in many different personal projects, as well as those for others, including music, film making, remixing/mashups, writing, voicing, and podcasting. Basically in layman\u0027s terms, I\u0027ve been making a bunch of shit on the internet for about 3 years now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to my main flow of content (and the reason I\u0027m rambling on), Recapitate. For most of my life I\u0027ve been in love with the horror genre, and pretty much have tried to soak up all I can surrounding it. Monsters, slashers, ghosts, psychological torment, Halloween specials, high and low budget...you name it; I\u0027ve seen it. I\u0027ve had a reputation of annoying my friends and followers about my constant spamming of excitement over frightening entertainment, both IRL and online. So back in June of 2016, I finally decided to shift my ramblings into one place: a podcast. Original, ain\u0027t it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003eYeah yeah that\u0027s a lot of words there, smart guy. But what exactly is this \"Recapitate\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecapitate is a (mostly) weekly podcast where I discuss different types of horror media (movies, games, TV shows, books, musicals, etc.) with friends, creators, and industry folk. The majority of episodes involve guests coming on to discuss their FAVORITE source of spooky entertainment, with a very shoot the shit style approach. Sometimes however, guests come on to discuss just overall elements of the horror genre, or things they love/hate within it. I\u0027ve had on many different talented and influential folks, and we\u0027ve been able to dig deep into some of the all time best and schlockiest fright-filled entertainment out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also aim to make my show \"more than just a podcast\" if I can. Individual title cards, original music, sketches, awesome guests, and more are just some of the things that I utilize to set my show apart. However, since day one it\u0027s all been me behind the scenes, recording, editing, clean up, booking guests, commissioning artwork, music, and other outside help, etc. I\u0027m pretty much a one man show, and to be honest, it gets expensive. So that\u0027s where this campaign comes in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s your goal here, jack?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGlad I asked. The aim of this Patreon is to not just keep the show going, but to grow and improve it as well. Sure I can get by making episodes the same way they are until I kick the bucket, but who wants that? I\u0027m ALWAYS looking to make my work better, and with the help of you presumably wonderful people, that may be a little easier than foreseen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically I\u0027ve broken down my goals into these main focuses:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter equipment and software for production.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter pay for artists, musicians, voice actors (anyone who helps me) make the show.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture possible set built for video episodes.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbility to travel for conventions, festivals, and appearances more often.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreate new segments and shows as I see fit for the podcast.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake Recapitate as great as possible, and give you guys more content!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get if I give you my hard earned dough, asshole?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve listed tons of cool rewards you can get from supporting; including bonus content, downloads, early episode access, private live-streams and recordings, merch, artwork, music, and so much more! If I\u0027m going to ask for help, I have to at least attempt to make it worth your while. Check out the sidebar for all the different tiers and perks available. I\u0027m always open to suggestions for better ones as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE FINAL GIRL...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, I know asking for money online is kind of a shady thing. Trust me, I understand it.\u00a0If you enjoy my show and come back every week, then that\u0027s really all I can ever ask for. That alone fills me with so much joy and high blood pressure.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you\u0027re badass enough to\u00a0share or donate to my campaign then ANYTHING you give is beyond humbling. Seriously. Know this though:\u003cstrong\u003e Even if I don\u0027t make a penny from this, I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS PODCAST.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Because I truly love doing it. Nothing gets me more amped then getting to chat with cool people about things that I\u0027m so passionate about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to skim through this cluster, and I hope your vision\u0027s still intact.
