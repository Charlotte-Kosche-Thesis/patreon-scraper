    "summary": "Greetings,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe discussed about what to write here, and decided an open letter would be the best. If you want a quick overview, then it would be best to just check out the video at the top of the page. Otherwise, enjoy a bit of rambling below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, my name is Michael Schwahn. My first podcast launched in November of 2014, it was based on World of Warcraft and lived for just over a year. It was a ton of fun and was truly the platform that taught me a lot of what I know today. World of Warcraft podcasts are a dime a dozen however and are extremely difficult to keep alive, since the game is quite old and content can be qrather spaced out. So, the show podfaded (Slowly died) and in those throws I started looking towards my next show. I had been discussing starting a show with my good friend Nathan Wood. A few ideas and discussions later, and iReadit was born!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both spend a ton of time on Reddit, a message board that claims to be the \"Front Page to the Internet\". It functions as a central terminal for TONS of information that flows across the world. They get news topics about what is going on in Germany or even a business scandal in India. You get a much clearer and definitive view of what is happening in the world. You don\u0027t have to worry about sources being biased like most News Stations seem to be. Looking at you, Fox News! It is people sharing pertinent information simply to make the world more aware of what is happening around us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wanted to try to deliver the news from the internet in an easy way. Which is the basis for the show. It is a news show at it\u0027s core with a couple of young idiots trying to deliver it to you as best we can. The show has already grown a lot in 6 months and we recently celebrated out 100th episode. We don\u0027t have any plans on stopping or slowing any time soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a moment to check our our goals, and our patron tiers. We have a lot of aspirations for the show, but we will definitely need some help getting there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, we would love to hear from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003efeedback.ireadit@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSchwahn\u003cbr\u003e"
