    "summary": "I make videos with my friends for the sole purpose to try and make you laugh!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to hear more of my story?\u003cbr\u003eWell, here it is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a young boy, my two older brothers got me into gaming. We originally had a Nintendo 64 and we used to fight with each other to see who was the real master of Super Smash Brothers. \u003cbr\u003eAs I grew older, my love for gaming only evolved and matured. And at some point in my young gamer life, I discovered that there existed a large community of people on the internet who created videos of themselves playing games. I was then drawn in by the stories that people created, the comedies and skits people assembled, the unfathomable skills of some players, and simply all of the groups of people just having fun with their friends.\u003cbr\u003eI was blown away by myriads of awesome communities and wanted very much to be a part of one and build my own community whom I could inspire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my 16th birthday, I decided to buy myself an Elgato HD Game Capture (a capture card) and make my first video. I did countless hours of research into how to use video editing software, editor techniques, the psychology of entertainment, and simply just watching other people\u0027s videos. I knew what kind of videos I wanted to make. I wanted people to smile and laugh during my videos and I wanted to spread the craziness and mayhem that my friends and I constantly experienced and got ourselves into. So that\u0027s what I did. I played games with my friends and pieced the segments of our adventures and most memorable moments into a digital portfolio that I encourage any and all to view and enjoy with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started making videos, I didn\u0027t expect much in the way of growth. I knew the odds of getting noticed weren\u0027t great and they definitely weren\u0027t getting any better as time moved forward. And because of this realization, I decided that my videos would be, on a base level, for my friends and I to look back and enjoy the times we had together no matter how much time passes. The videos may be heavily edited and segmented, but they are a genuine record of my interactions with some of the best people I have ever known. If nothing else, it\u0027s there to say that, \"This happened, we did this, and we loved it.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, I am more than thrilled to share the fantastic experiences and seat gripping moments of my time online with my friends. The people that I have come to know over the past couple years of doing YouTube, somehow succeed in putting a smile on my face\u00a0 every single day. My one hope is that somehow, through my videos, I can communicate the happiness that they give me and give you a small taste of that as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the important part, why do I need your money?\u003cbr\u003eThe answer has to do with security. In light of recent algorithm changes, advertisement blacklisting, the ad-pocalypse, and YouTube just generally deteriorating into a very non-user friendly site, I have no financial security in what I\u0027m actually doing. The unfortunate thing about life is that, as you get older, you need to be paid for the time you\u0027re putting into things. I love making videos on YouTube for you guys, but as I get older, this hobby needs to become financially practical. And there can\u0027t be any financial practicality without financial security. That\u0027s where you guys come in. Patreon will enable me to have that financial security and enable me to make more and better quality videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I have enjoyed my content in the past and would like to help contribute to my financial security, please consider supporting me here.\u003cbr\u003eThanks again guys :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to join my discord and come talk to me :)\u003cbr\u003eI will also be available to answer any questions that you might have.
