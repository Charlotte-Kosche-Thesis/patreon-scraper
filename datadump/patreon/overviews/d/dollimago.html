    "summary": "Doll Imago is comprised of one roque artist dedicated to\ncreating a unique atmosphere through digital soundscapes and melodic\nexploration. Inspired by her studies of classical composers, particularly the\nmusic of Chopin, Kabalevsky and Debussy, she has paved a way to decipher her\nown interior stirrings to compose. Currently her calling to classical music has\nlead her to study the music of Phillip Glass, Arvo Part and Michael Nyman. This\nhas in turn opened the doors to the music of a pop/ambient/ethereal learning\nincluding Harold Budd, Brian Eno and early 4AD bands like the Cocteau Twins\nwhere the ethos of the music of these composers can already be heard in her\noriginal music. Although her composing style blossomed years before hearing\nthese artists it is testimony to the fact that \"it is in the\nair\"-individuals with similar aims, in the case of beauty and simplicity\nwill arrive at similar results.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDoll Imago uses drone to promote stillness, uses repetition\nto stabilize the attention and variation of melody to create drama, narrative\nand reflection. It does not pummel you with beats, catchiness and attitude but\ninstead intimates it\u0027s purpose and furtively rewards the listener who is\nattuned to the subtlety of it\u0027s language; a language that pushes to and fro\nfrom wistful speculation to the point of discovery, an answer to the question\nthat is sometimes discordant and earthbound and sometimes graceful and\notherworldly. It seems the kind of music that can only come from a\ncontemplative essence that is grounded in the world of the present while being\nsteeped in the tradtions of the past. It is an intimate soundtrack to private\nmoments, providing empathy to the solitary part of the individual.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am joining Patreon after many years not composing.\u00a0 My hope is to find my musical voice once again and share this with Patrons.\u00a0 The artist statement included is a testament to my musical voice discovered and developed through the years of 2000-2010.\u00a0 My new voice will hopefully and expectedly include this kind of ethos but look forward to discovering and developing a current new voice.\u00a0 I look forward to sharing my works that will also include photography and knitwear.\u00a0 My main focus is however; the music.\u003cbr\u003e"
