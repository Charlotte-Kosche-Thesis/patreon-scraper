Or you fell down some sort of internet rabbit hole. Either way, welcome to my page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that you are here, let me tell you a little about myself. I am an acrylic mixed media artist who loves to blend nature scenes with abstract patterns. While my work is inspired by the mountains and trees I live near, it is entirely my own fantastic interpretation on what the outdoors feels like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating all these paintings is a labor of love and very fun, but it is something I take very seriously. All my paintings are created using quality materials so not matter what piece you own, it can be treasured for a long time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what I create, I do not do it alone. You, my patrons, are essential. Every pledge, even the smallest one helps me cover expenses, learn new skills and grow in my work. That is the real reason behind this page. So many of my fans have been looking for a way to offer more concrete support, and I want to offer something in return. That is why I have a few different levels of patronage with rewards at every level. Please take some time to read through them and find a level that works for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you for visiting and have a wonderful day!\u003cbr\u003e"
