    "summary": "My goal as a video creator is to help people find the games that fit what they want out of a gaming experience. I\u0027m of the opinion that the perfect game for one person could be the worst experience for the next. In particular, I focus on everything but the biggest titles, from the second tier triple A experiences down to the smallest indie games. Trying to find the gems that will bring some that gaming has to offer. I\u0027m the analytical reviewer: looking at the experience and where the game design succeeded and where the game design could be improved,in addition to providing tips and help to starting up indie devs, attempting to take their project to the next level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I put some money away for starting this experience up, it\u0027s getting to the point where I need to consider the revenue flow of creating these videos on a few times of week basis, so that I can still support my minimal lifestyle (aka food, shelter, health insurance) while still bringing you guys the content that you want and with the quality that I expect out of myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the type of content that I do, here\u0027s a couple descriptions of the series that I have done in the past:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-First Impressions: An edited format after 4-8 hours of gameplay, hitting the major points of gameplay, aesthetic, game design, and overall feel. Example:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-8_5-Suh28\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-8_5-Suh28\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Reviews: \u00a0I use a buyability score that has an enhancer system (aka, trying to center in on a specific type of player). Example:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z469HMUS3Bg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z469HMUS3Bg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Dev Letter: A game in Early Access, where I provide feedback to the developer and give people an idea of what the game could improve on, and what to watch out for. Example:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROu3vl9lBBY\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROu3vl9lBBY\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I change up the content in terms of different video types that are more creative now and again, ranging from game design, down to a different review format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re unfamilar with the channel, take a look and see if it\u0027s up your alley, and if it is, consider becoming a patreon. A buck or two that you would have wasted on a possible game that was shitty (well, besides Steam Refunds), could be used to help me tell you what to look out for in the gaming world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks as always, and keep on gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
