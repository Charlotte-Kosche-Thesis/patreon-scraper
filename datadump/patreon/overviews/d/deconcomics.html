    "summary": "\"Deconstructing Comics\" started in 2005 as three guys in a room, talking about comics. Not just about reading comics, but about *making* comics. Over the years it\u0027s evolved so that you never know what, or who, you\u0027re going to get each week. We\u0027ve done reviews, interviews, topic discussions, critiques of listeners\u0027 comics work. Occasionally coverage of comics conventions or other comics events. We\u0027re also producing \"To the Batpoles!\", a podcast about the \u003ca href=\"http://tothebatpoles.libsyn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e1966 Batman TV show\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this is a blast to do, but it takes money -- hosting, buying books, equipment, etc. I even took trips across the US in February 2014 and summer of 2017 to gather content for the show -- no small undertaking since I\u0027m based in Tokyo! I got some great interviews and group discussions on both trips, including talks with creators such as Dan Jurgens, Zander Cannon, Ted Anderson, Stephen Bissette, Derf, and more. I\u0027d love to do it again to put together more great episodes for the listeners, and maybe even turn podcasting into my full-time job, but I can\u0027t do it without your support! So please consider making a monthly pledge to help support the show.\u003cbr\u003e"
