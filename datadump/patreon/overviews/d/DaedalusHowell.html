I started in media as a paperboy for the local rag. After I matured into a newspaperman, I wrote for alt-weeklies and daily metros. Later, I spent a few years failing as a screenwriter in Hollywood. I eventually washed up an ink- and wine-stained critic in Sonoma and experienced all order of media mayhem whilst in Oakland. This is before I repatriated to Lumaville to take care of some unfinished business.\u003cbr\u003eEither I\u2019ve come full circle or I\u2019m treading a rat wheel I\u2019ve mistaken for a career. The difference? I\u2019m bootstrapping myself into the quality lit game with a new series and hard-earned sangfroid. I still do hired gun gigs and if you\u2019re fresh out of heroes, I might write for you too.\u003cbr\u003e",
