    "summary": "The Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice is a 501 C 3 organization whose mission is to free prisoners who are incarcerated for crimes that they are innocent of, as well as prevent wrongful convictions by raising awareness and seeking changes in the law designed to make the system more accurate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWrongful convictions occur much more\nfrequently than what most people\u00a0in society realize. In 2015, 149 people were exonerated,\nwhile 139 were in 2014, while 91 people were in both 2013 and 2012. A recent\nWayne State University estimates that 10,000 new people are wrongfully\nconvicted each year, while other publications reference that between 50,000 to\n120,000 people are wrongfully imprisoned across the country. The National\nRegistry of Exonerations, which tracks exonerations nationally, has thus far\ndocumented, including cases from 1989 forward, 1748 exonerations as of this\nwriting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Jeffrey Deskovic, and why did he start a Foundation for Justice?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJeffrey Deskovic, M.A., spent 16 years in prison-from age 17 to 32- wrongfully convicted of murder and rape, despite a pre-trial negative DNA test, based upon a coerced false confession, prosecutorial misconduct, fraud by the medical examiner, and an inept public defender. He lost all seven appeals and was turned down for parole. Jeff was exonerated by further DNA Testing through the DNA databank which identified the actual perpetrator, who had killed a second victim who was a school teacher and mother of two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter receiving some financial compensation for what happened to him, and unable to forget about the people whom he metaphorically left behind, Jeff committed $1.5 million dollars to launch the organization. But although he has been very generous in donating that money, he cannot carry the organization on his own. The Foundation currently has 600 cases that are awaiting screening to determine if the organization believes in their innocence claim, along with whether it believes that there is a way that it can prove the applicants innocence. There are additionally 15-20 new requests for help that come in every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResults and\u00a0Uniqueness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn it\u0027s 3 1/2 years of existence, highlights have included: helping to free William Lopez, who had been wrongfully imprisoned for 23 1/2 years; helping 3 of our clients get paroled on innocence grounds; helping four exonerees reintegrate back into society; creating \"The Thinking Juror\u0027s manual.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes the Foundation unique is: 1) it handles both DNA and Non-DNA cases; 2) it advocates policy changes other organizations privately agree with us about but won\u0027t advocate for; 3) we utilize parole as a stop-gap measure; 4) we offer exonerees short term housing 5) we are the only organization started by an exoneree which has an exonerative component.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJeff\u0027s expertise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUpon release, Jeff became a tireless advocate for the wrongfully convicted whose body of work includes: giving more than 100 presentations across the country; authoring more than 200 articles; giving hundreds of print, radio, and television interviews; educating elected officials and testifying at legislative hearings in NY, Connecticut, and D.C. Thanks to a scholarship from Mercy College, he completed the B.A., and in 2013 he graduated with a Masters Degree from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which included a thesis written on wrongful conviction prevention. He co-taught a wrongful conviction college course at Rockland Community College, and has lectured at: police academies; judicial seminars; defense bars; and groups of prosecutors.

If it\u0027s advocacy work that was engaged in, in whatever form, The Foundation will give it\u0027s patrons updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Foundation believes that, in order to be sustainable, it needs the assistance of recurring small monthly donations- imagine if we had 40,000 people who could afford to donate $5 every month, or even $3, what we could do??!!- as well as large donors, board members who have large giving capacity, grants, and professional organizations who can donate in-kind donations. We welcome the assistance of those who have radio and television shows, podcasts,\u00a0other platforms, and\u00a0audiences for\u00a0speaking engagements through which we can reach their audience to explain the urgency of our work and ask their assistance, even if it is only at the level of $5. If we all do a little, a lot can be accomplished!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Foundation would like to add 5 people who have the capacity to write a large check of $50,000 to $100,000 while opening their personal network of people of similar ability. Interested parties should email the Foundation through it\u0027s website \u003ca href=\"http://www.Deskovic.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.Deskovic.org\u003c/a\u003e , as should large donors who are interested and professional organizations who can donate in-kind services, for which they can receive a tax write off.\u00a0 We also welcome the assistance of those who can help us increase our visibility, including referencing our campaign, including through the medium of: blogging; blog talk radio; social media; and media interviews- no entity or audience is too small!\u00a0 We also give presentations at colleges, universities, law schools, high schools, community organizations, and organizations for criminal justice professionals- wherever and however we can get the word out there about this most important cause, which our Founder knows about all too well. Having finally established his innocence and regained his freedom, he is eager for his non-profit organization to continue it\u0027s work at freeing others! \u003cbr\u003e"
