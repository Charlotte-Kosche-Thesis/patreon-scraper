    "summary": "I am Cris or better known as Demoscenes on youtube. Many of you might know who I am and what I am doing but for you who are new to me, let me explain. The goal for me is to make the most accurate and real authentic Commodore 64 SID music recordings. It means All you see and hear has been done by hand, by one man. Meaning no automation or massive batch productions has ever been made to get the greatest SID recordings you ever heard! This is something I am doing on my free time, also known as hobby level of time and I have been doing this for over ten years. Much research, much time, much analysis are required to get to where I am at now. That is why I need your help to make the process going on and to make what\u0027s good ever better! There are some SID recordings out there but many of them are done in an emulator and won\u0027t even come close to my recordings, which are done on real hardware only using the best customized SID Models, SID Revisions and carefully measured frequency analysis. Nothing but the best is good enough for me and you. I wish to take my unique SID Recordings to a new level and this can only be done with your help and also a chance for you to be part of the process and journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso I have huge interests in music, as a composer and as a sound designer, this has recently been merged into this channel as well. Because why separate two huge interests when it is possible to combine them into one. I wish to expand this territory too by making tutorials and overviews.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWouldn\u0027t it be great to draw your straw to the stack to help out? I think so.\u003cbr\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart,\u003cbr\u003eCris (Xiny6581)\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Where creativity and inspiration make one is mostly when my brain start to work and get ideas. That constructive process is what makes music, design and graphic come to one stage called the \"demoscene\". That stage has been my playground for over two decades. The expressive stage has lead into where it all started for me when I was younger listening to \"chipmusic / computer generated music\". I\u0027ve spent nearly ten years to perfect the sound quality when it comes to capture the sound from the legendary MOS FET SID6581/8580 Commodore 64 chip.\u003cbr\u003eOne year of research matching the accurate setup to get the most authentic sounding sound, lead to be able to capture different composer\u0027s \"original setup\", as they used when a certain SID song was written. I have even went that far to ask individual composers what SID Model, SID Revision and Capacitors used in their system. Carefully notes and measurements where weight into analyses to cement that specific composer\u0027s signature sound.\u003cbr\u003eThis is the result of hard work, the ongoing process to get the greatest SID Recordings. Every song is recorded from real hardware with specific devices. Then edited(removing the player init-sound, trimming the end to match). Analysed to retrain the correct player used to make the song. Title screen made in After Effects to give the song a proper release.\u003cbr\u003eI also do special recordings for composers, the biggest parties and more.",
