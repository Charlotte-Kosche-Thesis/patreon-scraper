M. Almond. While Chronicles of Acadia keeps moving full steam ahead, with Book IV to be released later this year, I am finding myself hungry to share a new world I\u0027ve created. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to do something completely different than what I have tackled so far, something more in the vein of \u003cstrong\u003eXanth\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003eDiscworld\u003c/strong\u003e, with a more tongue in cheek approach to a light-hearted fantasy world. \u003cem\u003eTrollin\u0027\u003c/em\u003e was what I came up with, a world that formed around a sleeping dragon, where a young troll raised by humans is thrust out of his homeland. This is, naturally, a world that loathes his existence. So what is a young troll to do? Will he persevere against overwhelming forces that want him dead? Should he just succumb to prejudices and find a bridge to haunt? Or will he become an unlikely hero of legend?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fdade3_edbf0bd9f31d464a96a939e2f5e37767~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_630,h_332,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/fdade3_edbf0bd9f31d464a96a939e2f5e37767~mv2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fdade3_327f7aa082ee457eb3634b486b38e7b7~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_600,h_317,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/fdade3_327f7aa082ee457eb3634b486b38e7b7~mv2.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOver the next year I will be releasing two episodes of Trollin\u0027 a month \nuntil the first novel is complete.

However, I simply have not had the time. If I can meet funding on Patreon that will allow me to devote myself to this additional work without having to do so many conventions. This will equal more time with my two children and amazing wife and more time off the road. I would like to spend less time driving and more writing. I will still do book signings and conventions, just 2 or 3 less a year. You would be shocked at how much I can get done with the gift of time your patronage will endow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
