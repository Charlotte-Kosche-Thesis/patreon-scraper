    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome, theater patrons and supporters of the arts. Let us introduce ourselves, we are\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.deathandpretzels.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeath \u0026amp; Pretzels\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeath \u0026amp; Pretzels is a Chicago based theater company dedicated to exploring oddity, antiquity and ensemble built experiences. D\u0026amp;P was born in April of 2014 when a group of theater artists came together to collaborate on a production of S. Ansky\u0027s \u003cem\u003eThe Dybbuk. \u003c/em\u003eThanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign and a group of dedicated actors and technicians, \u003cem\u003eThe Dybbuk \u003c/em\u003eran for four weeks in the fall of that year. Though initially founded to support this one production, the people behind D\u0026amp;P had so much fun they decided they were in it for the long haul. After two years, and three more productions, including the premiere of a brand new play called \u003cem\u003eGruoch, or Lady Macbeth\u003c/em\u003e by Paul Pasulka, Jim Leonard\u0027s beloved \u003cem\u003eAnatomy of Gray\u003c/em\u003e and the Chicago premiere of Chiara Atik\u0027s \u003cem\u003eWomen \u003c/em\u003ein conjunction with YouTube juggernauts, Team Starkid, D\u0026amp;P is now on the verge of something huge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeginning in January of 2017, D\u0026amp;P will embark on a year long Artist in Residence program at the entirely re-vamped Gorilla Tango theater. This is a big deal for several reasons, but the biggest being that \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis means we now have a permanent home for a calendar year, and a permanent home means stability. Our patrons will know exactly where to find us, fellow artists will know exactly where to find us and we can look forward to taking off our shoes and staying a while.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis also means we get to put on a four show season. FOUR SHOWS. That\u0027s basically insane. A four show season is a lot of work, more than we\u0027ve ever attempted, but we\u0027re confident we\u0027re going to nail it- especially with your help.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it turns out, stuff costs money. We are absolutely not producing theater for the money, D\u0026amp;P is used to operating on a shoe-string budget, some of the greatest pieces of theater innovation came out of having to solve a problem with no money, and we\u0027re totally up for the challenge. Having patrons on Patreon offers us some financial stability that will make our jobs easier because often ticket sales are just not enough- with Patreon, we can pay our talented artists more money for their work, which means producing awesome plays with incredible actors and stellar technical elements. \u00a0A lot of times, theater professionals are expected to work for \"the love of the art\" or \"for the experience\" or in laymen\u0027s terms- free. Death \u0026amp; Pretzels firmly believes that these creative individuals deserve a real paycheck, with real money for all their hard work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our rewards and consider becoming a patron, thanks for visiting!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
