     "about": "Dustin Gardner, aka SHOE., has independently recorded and released 6\u003cbr\u003e\nalbums. His last album \"The Speed of Life\" won the 2011 Pop Rock Album of the Year honors from the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards. Last year Dustin reinvented SHOE.after discovering the Boss RC 505 Looping Station. Now he performs solo using prerecorded\u00a0loops as well as recording live loops on the spot. All of which you can hear on his 5th album\u00a0recorded, LIVE in Detroit, MI., in front of such an intimate audience you can even hear his friends cracking beers open.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe title \"#1AaaallowMeToReIntroduceMySelf\" was chosen for two reasons. The first was highlighting the reinvented sound Dustin created by performing \"Re-Imaginations of songs I\u0027ve written over the last decade creating a sort of\u003cbr\u003e\nbest of album\". The 2nd reason is all out International Alphabetical WAR.*\u003cbr\u003e\nHalfway through the writing process for this recording, Dustin (and friends)\u003cbr\u003e\nwere violently attacked in Vegas after a wedding reception. Forced to\u003cbr\u003e\ndelay for a few months until after a vital surgery, Dustin refused to be held\u003cbr\u003e\nback any longer, and is still in a prolonged recovery. \"From the\u003cbr\u003e\nbeginning I wanted this album to be a snapshot from this moment\u00a0in my life, and even with a small mistake or two, I\u0027m happy with the way it turned out in the end. Plus this album was my 1st show with the Looper and I\u0027m excited to see where I\u0027ll go from here!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
