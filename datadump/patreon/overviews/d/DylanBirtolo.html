My name is Dylan Birtolo and I am both an author and a game designer. I have been writing professionally for over ten years now and have published short stories, novellas, and novels both in established universes and worlds of my creation. Some of the worlds I have been lucky enough to write for include \u003cem\u003eShadowrun\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eBattleTech\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ePathfinder\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eWorld of Darkness\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eExalted\u003c/em\u003e, Mercedes Lackey\u0027s \u003cem\u003eValdemar\u003c/em\u003e series, and Green Ronin\u0027s \u003cem\u003eFreeport\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the gaming side of things, I have been an avid gamer for as long as I can remember and have a decently-sized ever-growing collection. This passion hedged me into the world of game design. As of 2017, I have sold two original game designs: \u003cem\u003eShadowrun Sprawl Ops\u003c/em\u003e to Catalyst Games Labs and \u003cem\u003eHenchman The Card Game \u003c/em\u003eto Clarion Game Studios. In addition, I was one of the additional developers for \u003cem\u003eDragonfire\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a knight. And sometimes when I\u0027ve just cleaned it, I\u0027m even one in shining armor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eBack in 2016, I left my full time job and decided that I would give this whole starving artist thing a try, preferably without the starving. I love creating and have always enjoyed telling stories, whether that\u0027s on the stage, in books, or through games. My dream is to make this a reality, and that\u0027s only possible if I keep creating and getting it out in front of people who want to see it. In short, I\u0027m trying to live my dream and Patreon is a way I can try to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI know, it\u0027s time to get to the good stuff! There are a couple of things I\u0027m going to offer on this page, and hopefully something will spark your interest. If it does, anything you can give is greatly appreciated. Seriously, thank you! Even if all you\u0027ve done is read this far or point someone to this page, that is a huge help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the writing side, I will commit to putting up at least one short story length piece of fiction a month. That may be a short story, or it may be a portion of a larger piece - such as chapters from a novella or a novel. All of my writings are fantasy, but they range from sword and sorcery to space with lots of stops in between.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the game design side, I look forward to sharing concepts for games that are in development as well as bits and pieces of the game design process as I go through it. I am hoping that I will be able to write some articles about aspects of the design process and share that information, but that will probably depend on interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of interest, I am looking forward to getting in touch with people who want to share their thoughts or offer ideas for things they would like to see on both sides of the fence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, in my gaming groups, I have been designated as the \"rules explainer\". Because I know games can be difficult to learn, I plan on creating some how-to-play videos. This is one thing that you\u0027ll definitely get to vote on: which game you would like explained. Then I\u0027ll make a short video explaining the game and taking a sample turn or two. Part of the video will be a little mini-review as well. It\u0027s something that I know some people might find useful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, since I am a knight, I do have a couple of rewards specifically related to something along those lines. How could I not? As I always tell people at our shows, I don\u0027t ask that you cheer for me but you should cheer for my horse. He is a very handsome boy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eThank you!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"

In addition to all of the rewards from the Viscount level, Princesses will have the opportunity to create a Tuckerization. If you are not familiar, this is where you provide the details and information for a character, and I will incorporate it into a story or a game as best as I\u0027m able. In addition, if the Tuckerization is for a short story, you will receive a signed physical copy of the story in the mail.",
