I started making jewelry for myself in 2009, a series of bone brooches (from a couple of mink skeletons my sister gave me as a birthday gift), and then finally the summer of 2013, decided to really make a go of it. Within one year, I have almost been able to cut out all my other sources of income and devote myself to jewelry full time. Almost. It is something I love immeasurably, and I will spend up to 13 hours a day creating, but I still have to duck out and take on odd jobs and whatnot to flesh out my income, which still finds me struggling in the day to day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the last few months, I have expanded my jewelry line beyond my two cities of residence (Louisville, KY and Minneapolis, MN), to Nashville, TN. My next goals are New Orleans, LA, Chicago, IL, Los Angeles, CA, and Seattle, WA in 2015. With your help, I can keep myself in supplies and devote myself full time to making this dream a reality."
