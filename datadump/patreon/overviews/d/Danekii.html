    "summary": "Hey guys, since August 2017 I used this Patreon to help pay various bills, and your continued support has meant the world to me. Last August, I was jobless and had infinite free time to maintain and upload various anime based video games to my youtube channel. Around September 17, I was finally hired after months of job searching, since I had found a boss that overcame being starstruck when he hired me - or had no clue I once got two views on a youtube video. I now work a 9-5, and stay up late to enjoy the sound of Old Man Birb yelling at teenagers standing around on his lawn. Therefore, it\u0027s hard to get used to a routine schedule due to those factors. Since March, I decided to focus solely on Yugioh and rewards have been appropriately updated. Every single one of my fans, I consider a friend. Because Anime only tells the truth, and the power of friendship allows you to get some really bullshit draws."
