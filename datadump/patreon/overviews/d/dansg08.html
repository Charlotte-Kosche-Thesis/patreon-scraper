Back in 2008 (yep, you\u0027ve already deciphered the \"08\" part of my username), I was a 16 year old kid who dedicated most of his gaming time to awesome franchises like Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy. I became totally engrossed in Final Fantasy X and took up some challenges for it like beating the game without ever using the sphere grid to level up. This lead to me discovering a certain enemy in FFX that had never been defeated, and we were at an age where you really needed video proof to convince anyone of the seemingly impossible. Being the ambitious young man that I was (and to some extent still am), I set up a Youtube account with the hope of showing Dark Anima No Sphere Grid (yep, that is the \"dansg\" part) being defeated. As luck would have it,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V4TGR81obQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI achieved this goal 3 years after creating the channel.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V4TGR81obQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSo what about this 3 year gap? I quickly realised that this Dark Anima thing was not only unlikely to ever happen, but even if it did it\u0027d probably take a VERY long time. So, armed with my 3.2 megapixel phone I started to record some random FFX content on my old CRT TV. The quality was terrible, and so were the views. I was just a kid experimenting with a new platform for reaching people all over the world. After the first 2 years of Youtubing, I had a grand total of 10,000 views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot very inspiring... But as I grew up, so did my skills and my desire to do things better. I decided to step up my game and start recording with a dedicated device. The quality improved. The views? Not so much...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen came the fateful day; 8th December 2010. I recorded a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oZxaGmOf2E\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo\u003c/a\u003e that went semi-viral, hitting a million views in a relatively short time. This didn\u0027t propel me to Youtube stardom, but it did show me that it was possible to really get yourself noticed. It was also the first time I was given the chance to monetise my content. A 19 year old who makes pocket money off of Youtube videos? I was living the dream. I knew I had to do the smart thing and study less at University, and make more videos. I still graduated with a 1st Class degree in Economics from a reputable University, but my diploma gathers dust on a shelf somewhere. The \"smart thing\" line was of course a joke - while Economics wasn\u0027t a career I was interested in pursuing, having a back-up in life isn\u0027t always the worst idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe buzz from the semi-viral video died down fast, and I knew that in order to really gain some momentum I needed to upload consistent, quality content. I saw the success of LP\u0027ers and decided I\u0027d try my hand at commentary. People seemed to like it, so it became a staple on my channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe final chapter in this story began in 2012. Around the same time I started commentating I decided to try and find something new to upload for Final Fantasy X (yes, \u003cem\u003ethat \u003c/em\u003egame again). It was a game so close to my heart I always found myself trying to get others to experience the story. I didn\u0027t have much luck. Non-gamers couldn\u0027t be bothered to learn how to play it, let alone sit through 40+ hours of gameplay. So I thought I\u0027d create a playlist of videos for them that would allow for even non-gamers to just sit down and enjoy the story of Final Fantasy X, like a movie. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \"Cinematic Movie Versions\" were born. These are painstakingly edited to strike an optimal balance between gameplay which helps with pacing and progression/action, while also ensuring it is not an overwhelming or boring experience for those who only want to see the story and the cutscenes. While the FFX movie has done well, the true explosion happened with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkLPKd-Vs8g\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Last Of Us\u003c/a\u003e. It got featured on gaming sites worldwide including\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-turned-into-a-six-hour-movie-514181539\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKotaku\u003c/a\u003e and after almost 3 years sits on more than 4 million views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2013 I have been striving to create high quality Commentary Walkthroughs and Cinematic Movie Versions of games that appeal to my tastes. I have covered games and franchises such as:\u003cbr\u003e- Final Fantasy\u003cbr\u003e- Metal Gear Solid\u003cbr\u003e- Uncharted\u003cbr\u003e- Bioshock\u003cbr\u003e- Tomb Raider\u003cbr\u003e- Watch Dogs\u003cbr\u003e- Journey\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past year I have added to my arsenal of videos, and occasionally produce in-depth story and trivia related videos for the aforementioned games. These are very time consuming to make but I have gotten some fantastic responses so I\u0027m always on the hunt for new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv6IwMqf0NQ\u0026amp;list=PL9wpzJw8GKy74rLqQv7OH9v94Hj8qQWps\u0026amp;index=134\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nv6IwMqf0NQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027ll preface this by saying that I try to be as up front and honest as possible. This section won\u0027t be any different.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube is NOT my primary job, and it is unlikely that it ever will be. I did Youtube full time on and off between 2012-2014, and it helped me build up a large archive of videos. As of 2015, I live and work in Istanbul in the Filmmaking industry, and my ultimate goal is to write and direct my own features one day. The work that I do by nature is very on and off. There can be times when I won\u0027t be able to record for 2-3 weeks, other times I will record and edit for 20-30 hours a week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the last year I\u0027ve uploaded over 300 videos, so while this thing is no longer my full time job, I am still very much enjoying myself and actively recording and editing whenever I have time, sometimes working Youtube like a second job once I come back home from the office. This won\u0027t change, I will always do what I can to keep making videos, even if I become a successful Director one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith an unstable career path such as mine, financially things are also difficult. There can be times when you\u0027re getting by just fine, and others where you need to be cautious in order to keep paying the rent/bills. This is where Youtube comes in for me. My current earnings are enough to keep me afloat even when work is not going so well (this is true for Istanbul where the $ is strong and living expenses are cheaper relative to London. If I was still in London I couldn\u0027t be financially independent with YT alone). This is why even when I\u0027m fairly busy, I try to keep pumping out the videos. Not only is it still enjoyable and a great release from the stresses of adult life and living in a tiring city like Istanbul, it also makes up a signficant portion of the money that goes into my bank account every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why isn\u0027t Youtube alone enough? Well, at the moment, it is usually enough. But the trouble is that Youtube, much like my day job, is equally unstable and fickle. I have kept making videos consistently for over 3 years and my earnings are barely any higher than they were in 2013. This is despite my subscriber count tripling in the process. Views are harder to gain than ever, and Ad/click through rates are a volatile business. With things like Adblock so readily used (understandably), it\u0027s hard to keep your earnings sustained. Youtube RED is meant to be really good for creators, and I personally have very high average view lengths, but it currently makes up less than 10% of my total income. Many of my viewers are young and probably don\u0027t use RED, so I haven\u0027t seen much benefit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdd to the mix the world of copyright. I have lost my channel once before due to copyright strikes in 2013 (I obviously appealed and got it back), and lost a huge portion of my earnings between December 2013 and March 2014 because of a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJkcsbuB4EQ\u0026amp;list=PL9wpzJw8GKy7J_njT2vg2_rfHHxZbbNWP\u0026amp;index=7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erandom contentID sweep that claimed most of my videos.\u003c/a\u003e The contentID thing has now been mitigated to some extent as I am a managed partner who is protected, but the whole idea of copyright and the claiming parties being much better protected than the \"offenders\" is a danger. You won\u0027t have to go far to see all kinds of huge channels suffering at the hands of this system, a quick search for \"where is the fair use\" and the corresponding hashtag should tell you all you need to know. Long story short, Youtube is here today, gone tomorrow. There\u0027s no reason why I couldn\u0027t get 3 copyright or community strikes tonight and wake up to find my channel terminated. This kind of insecurity makes Youtube an unreliable career path in the long run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I have managed to reach out to millions all over the globe, and some of these viewers have become true fans of the channel, supporting it at every opportunity. I have seen Youtube channels with an incredible Patreon campaign and realised that even though I feel strange asking for pledges, there are people out there who I have provided enough good quality content for that feel I deserve it, and are able to go the extra mile to support me. The pledges I receive from here will help me whether the storm financially if things go badly either at work or on Youtube, and I will also be able to of course give you guys some extra perks for helping the channel in this way. I think this model is great because it\u0027s the fans directly paying you to keep making the content that they enjoy. I greatly dislike things like sponsorships and have always refused any kind of approach from companies of that nature, even if I did earn more by doing this. I also don\u0027t upload videos just for the sake of making an easy buck. I have said from day 1 that I will ONLY upload what I feel like uploading, and even if that means less earnings and slower growth, so be it. This is something that is no-compromise for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an ideal world I\u0027d love to be funded 100% by patrons, and be totally non-reliant on ad revenue. But even then, I\u0027d feel bad that the Patrons are effectively paying to remove ads for non-patrons (which would be a HUGE majority), so you can\u0027t really win. But if I had enough to sustain myself without any ads, that would be the dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I was to have a truly successful Patreon campaign, if the worst was to happen (my channel being terminated and lost forever), I would have the backing and the fan base to either start anew or to move to a new platform. The ad-based model has worked okay for some years, but the future is uncertain. If we end up moving away from that model then having a strong Patreon campaign will mean I don\u0027t feel the effects as much and can keep doing what I\u0027m doing. If I didn\u0027t have something like this, I might have to spend that extra time trying to find more work that pays the bills and that will basically mean that my Youtubing will grind to a halt and Dansg08 as a video creator will cease to exist. It sounds dark and gloomy, but when I lost my channel in 2013 I seriously considered giving it all up. With such a large archive of videos, if I got terminated today, I may not be able to recover again...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDansg08\u0027s Promise\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are certain things I wanted to be sure wouldn\u0027t happen, so as a final thing I will clarify those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) I want to keep my pledge amounts (relatively) low, I have seen creators with Patrons offering hundreds of dollars per month. This is something I do not want, because I feel I cannot offer anything that would warrant that level of donation. Having simple perks with low entry fees helps keep the playing field level and allows me to keep doing what I\u0027m doing without having to change anything to please any big Patrons. Also, bigger rewards are both harder to make good on (logistically), and more stressful when it comes to Patron satisfaction. This creates a degree of dependence and control, I do not want this for the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) This Patreon thing will not create a \"pay-wall\", where only people who pledge money will get access to exclusive content. My channel and content type isn\u0027t suitable for this (lucky you!). Perhaps if I ran a \"show\" based channel such as Jim Sterling or SciShow then maybe it\u0027d be different. As it stands, I\u0027m going to keep everything on the channel \"free\". Outside of my utmost gratitude, even the top tier patrons will only have 2 advantages: 1 is a greater level of interactivity than what I can offer on Youtube/Twitter, and 2 is early access and feedback to help make my videos better. But everyone will see those videos eventually. As wonderful as it will be to hopefully have some Patrons, Youtube has gotten me to where I am today, so I do not want to abandon that audience just because they cannot afford to support me outside of ads. This is my justification for the current reward system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) If I ever have to stop making videos, either short term or long term, I will ALWAYS let you guys know so that you can stop your pledges if you want to. I cannot ever guarantee that I will be making videos at a steady rate. I sometimes take summer breaks for a couple of months where I don\u0027t upload anything, this is an example of something I would make sure everyone is aware of.\u003c/div\u003e"

If you have the means and the love for the channel to support it at this level, I truly appreciate it. Patrons in this tier have access to the lower tier content, but also get to be part of a select group who will have early access to any non-Walkthrough/Movie videos I make such as the FFX Trivia/List videos and the Metal Gear Archives. If you haven\u0027t seen these yet I\u0027d recommend checking them out. You will have a private link through which you can check out the video before its general release and offer any feedback to help make it better! Just remember that there is no guarantee of when I will make videos like these or how many, so please be aware before going for this tier!",
