Upon completion of my PhD research thesis (on immunologic memory) at The Rockefeller University, I held postdoctoral research training appointments in prominent immunology laboratories affiliated with Harvard Medical School and Stanford University School of Medicine.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY I LEFT THE MAINSTREAM RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT\u003cbr\u003eDuring my post-doctoral years, I realized that the so-called \u0027academic freedom\u0027 of the mainstream research establishment has been subjugated to a pharmaceutically-driven paradigm. Built on fear and misunderstanding of our relationship with all parts of Nature, the mainstream paradigm capitalizes on manmade chronic disease created as a collateral damage in our never-ending war on germs.  At the end of my post-doctoral training, I made the decision to leave the mainstream establishment, whose value system, priorities, and directions I could no longer embrace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy 2012 e-book \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Illusion-Tetyana-Obukhanych-ebook/dp/B007AW2CLG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1508989745\u0026amp;sr=8-2\u0026amp;keywords=Vaccine+Illusion\"\u003eVaccine Illusion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e marks my own humble milestone: the disillusionment with the vaccination paradigm. Since then, I\u0027ve been lecturing at integrative medicine conferences and public educational events to promote better understanding of the unintended consequences of mass vaccination programs and highlight the immune system\u0027s own requirements for optimal function in dealing with infections and avoiding disease complications. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently serve, as a Founding Director, on the board of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/\"\u003ePhysicians for Informed Consent\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, the first organization of doctors dedicated to safeguarding informed consent in vaccination and educating the public on infectious disease, the immune system, and medical ethics of informed consent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also involved with\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bbch.community/\"\u003eBuilding Bridges in Children\u0027s Health (BBCH).\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e BBCH is a private online community of parents and professionals who joined in to contribute their knowledge and experiences in science, medical or nursing fields, social work, and law to help each other better protect their children\u0027s health in a current paradigm that leaves more and more children chronically ill.

Being informed about what the immune system needs to have in order to function properly helps us avoid creating such immune vulnerabilities unknowingly, by what we do (or don\u0027t do) on a daily basis.  It also allows us to overcome the fear of microorganisms, whether or not they are targeted by vaccines, and understand the reason for the historical reduction in mortality from infectious diseases over time, even prior to vaccine introductions. I\u0027ve documented my scientifically-referenced perspective -- that the immune system, in its fully functional state, can ensure our peaceful co-existence (i.e., without deadly or crippling outcomes) with viruses and bacteria -- in a 6-part webinar course called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tetyanaobukhanych.com/nif.html\"\u003eNatural Immunity Fundamentals (NIF class)\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand I continue to create more lectures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT\u003cbr\u003eThank you for becoming my Patron and supporting my work in creating lectures on how to be responsible stewards of our own immune systems in a sustainable paradigm of health. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLIVE LECTURES WILL RESUME IN SEPTEMBER 2018\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.
