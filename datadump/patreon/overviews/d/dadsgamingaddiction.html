    "summary": "I\u0027ve always had a passion for both writing and gaming, even when I was very little.\u00a0 It\u0027s hard to believe that I was hooked on games when I first got my hands on the Atari 2600, but it\u0027s true.\u00a0 Besides spending a lot of time spiking controllers into the ground because the games I played were \"challenging\" (I later discovered that the game design was simply horrible), I also wrote short stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast-forward things to 2010, when I started my very first blog.\u00a0 It was a place where I could go to vent about whatever I felt like and to express my odd sense of humor.\u00a0 I eventually wrote a few game reviews just to test the waters a bit and eventually, developers began to take notice.\u00a0 I became so inundated with review requests that I eventually created a separate blog dedicated solely to gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn late 2012 I began dabbling in creating video content and uploading it to YouTube.\u00a0 I admit, some of my early stuff is plain out awful and simply unwatchable.\u00a0 I was so nervous!\u00a0 I spoke in a\u00a0low monotone voice and just wasn\u0027t very interesting to watch.\u00a0 Just like with anything in life, practice makes perfect.\u00a0 In 2014 and about 2,000+ videos later, I partnered with a gaming network in order to monetize my videos.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the thing...I\u0027m\u00a0a full-time dad who also works a full-time job.\u00a0 Gaming is simply a hobby right now as it doesn\u0027t pay the bills.\u00a0 At some point, I\u0027d love to be able to claim that I play games for a living...though don\u0027t we all?\u00a0 It\u0027s really a shame that a lot of us don\u0027t get to do what we ACTUALLY enjoy doing as our responsibilities tend to come first. \u00a0In other words, we do what we have to in order to make ends meet whether we like it or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u00a0 I wanted to give my fans a way to show their support and to help me to continue making both written and video content.\u00a0 I should stress that I do NOT want you throwing money at me if you\u0027re barely making ends meet yourself...you and your family come first. \u00a0There is no obligation and I\u0027d feel incredibly bad if you felt pressured into contributing. \u00a0With that said...if you do want to show your appreciation for the content I\u0027ve created thus far, then I welcome your support. \u00a0The money I receive will go toward purchasing more games to cover along with better recording/broadcasting equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, thank you for taking time out of your day to read/watch the content I publish. Whether you contribute or not, you have my thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStreaming Schedule: As a single parent working a full time job, my streaming schedule varies and I never know what game I\u0027m going to play until I boot it up.  If I do stream, it\u0027ll probably be during the following times:\u003cbr\u003eMon-Fri - 5 PM - 8 PM EST\u003cbr\u003eSat-Sun - Anytime\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
