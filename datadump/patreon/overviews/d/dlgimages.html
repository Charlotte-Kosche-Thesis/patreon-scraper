    "summary": "Well, here we are! I finally did the thing, and created a Patreon. First, and foremost, THANK YOU! Thank you for taking time out of life to come see what I hold near, and dear to my heart. Thank you to those of you who constantly encourage, and inspire me to pursue my creative endeavors. Thank you for your support, your care, your time, your attention to little ol\u0027me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is it exactly I am doing here? Well, whatever comes to my mind, and attention to create. However, with that said, I do have more direct projects in the works. They are narrative photography, images that will sort of tell a story unconventionally. I will also feature all other projects here, whether it be video content, photography, physical merch, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComplete transparency here, give what you can ($1) or more, if you want to. Most of my content will be open to all followers (patron or not). However, I do have future projects in mind that will require a tier payment to be seen (ie expensive production, mature content). It just makes sense to me to go about it in such a fashion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe money will strictly go towards more projects, which means equipment, crew, transportation, location costs, food, basically all the things that are needed to make a project happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am a single father that works a full time career. I live, and struggle like many of you, so all of the things I do are squeezed in the times I am able. The money I\u0027ve spent thus far means I have to sacrifice parts of my lively hood in order to turn my ideas into a reality. Sometimes that means I eat Ramen for a month, or my electric bill won\u0027t get paid, or whatever (queue violins). My attempt here is not to make you feel sorry for me, but instead realize just how real this is to me, and how much I love it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo, blah blah blah, come along with me as I grow, and create, and grow some more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be three (3) ways to view projects from here on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e1. Become a Patron by subscribing for at least a $1. This will get you about 90% of the content I post here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e2. Become apart of the team. Help me create these projects by becoming a model, make-up artist, extra pair of hands etc. You will gain access to the Patron only Instagram feed which will have all content (According to IG Terms). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e3. Go support the actual models that were apart of these projetcs. I work on a barter/collab system most of the time, which means the models will have access to showcase the work as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNow, free view content will still come in, and plentyful. I\u0027m aiming to make things more fair, engaging, and productive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and Love,\u003cbr\u003eDavey\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBanner photo credits:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.queendrea.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQueen Drea Reynolds\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/carlylpaolillo/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCarley Paolillo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dlgimgs/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOlivia Glasgow\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
