I have been working as an artist and illustrator for the past ten years, creating dark, surreal and fantastic imagery in both traditional and digital media.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy artistic practice is split between genre illustrations, painted digitally using Corel Painter and Photoshop, and more surreal, personal works created traditionally using oils or ink.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.dreamsofego.com/wp-content/uploads/X.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1402\" src=\"http://www.dreamsofego.com/wp-content/uploads/X-215x300.jpg\" style=\"width: 156px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-952\" src=\"http://www.dreamsofego.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jungle-elemental-300x219.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dreamsofego.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/crouch.jpg\" style=\"width: 213px;\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1212\" src=\"http://www.dreamsofego.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_1562_1-215x300.jpg\" style=\"width: 156px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy interest in art was nurtured by the covers of the books on my parents\u0027 shelves and as I devoured fiction by Asimov, Gaiman and Pratchett, my interest in illustration grew. As a gamer from an early age, I was surrounded by imagery from artists like Brom, Michael Whelan and Christopher Rush and soon started seeking out the work of other fantastic artists like Dave McKean, Patrick Woodruffe and H R Giger.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs my taste for surreal work grew, I started to experiment with traditional techniques like automatic drawing, \u00c9claboussure and Grattage to explore the dream and nightmare images that began to emerge and can be most readily associated with the modern Dark Art movement. This work allows me to express worries and tension that I could not translate into words and has been a key part of working through periods of anxiety.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-704\" src=\"http://www.dreamsofego.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/time-to-change-253x300.jpg\" style=\"width: 186px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-695\" src=\"http://www.dreamsofego.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/f53c553857-72e3d0156c-229x300.jpg\" style=\"width: 166px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy use Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nPatreon gives me the opportunity to reach out to an international audience of fans who are interested in seeing more of my work but may not have the means (or wall space in some cases) to purchase original pieces.
