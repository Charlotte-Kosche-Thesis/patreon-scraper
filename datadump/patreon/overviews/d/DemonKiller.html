It speaks about a protagonist by the name of Ning Cheng from China, Earth, born with photographic memory and amazing comprehension abilities, who is transported to an ancient world that focuses on cultivation due to an accident.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to his various antics, he is often made made out to be a bad guy, but is actually a caring fellow who always thinks of helping his friends and family. Because of this he is always forced to make hard choices and gets into many dangerous situations (most of the time unknowingly) all in order to push his cultivation to the limits, so that there would be no one who would then be able to hurt his close ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a journey filled with a lot of ups and downs, dangerous twists and turns along with lots of chases, there is comedy and also tragedy mixed in with a few pinches of good ol\u0027 fashioned massacring. As the only thing that he desires and want in his life is to keep his loved ones safe from danger. For it, he is someone who would dive down to the depths of hell to slaughter devils and demons and ascend to the heavens to massacre gods and even rend apart realms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe novel is complete with 1500+ chapters and is ranked in the top 30 novels on Qidian and its forums. Your support for the translation would be much appreciate as the entire team has decided to focus all of our available time on providing quality chapters for you all to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I provide 3 free regular chapters per week guaranteed, with additional sponsored chapters brought to you by generous sponsors.\u003cbr\u003e"

Any title that catches my eyes, I simply read them all!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, got hooked onto the Chinese Web Novels, that are a lot longer than the traditional English novels, moreover the turns, twists, and hair raising moments are simply too many that one can\u0027t help but get hooked onto them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut sadly there are are not enough translators to keep up with the millions of such web novels. So rather than sitting at home and reading there awesome works by myself, I just turned to translating them so that these amazing works could be brought to a larger audience.",
