    "summary": "Salutations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can call me \u003ca href=\"https://d.moonfire.us/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eD. Moonfire\u003c/a\u003e, or Dylan if you are being informal. I love to write about people in their endless variety, beauty, and horror. I love the stories of characters a little off the beaten path of many fantasies, the person standing next to the Chosen One, a pacifist in a violent world, someone long past retirement, and engineers struggling to puzzle out the universe. And I find the complicated, woven relationships to be one of the world\u0027s most treasured beauties. It isn\u0027t a single character, but how they interact that appeals to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary world is \u003ca href=\"https://fedran.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFedran\u003c/a\u003e, an industrial fantasy world poised between the downfall of magic and the rise of technology. You could call it steampunk, but it is more of the wild experimentation phases that happened before the Victorian age. I have also written \u003ca href=\"https://d.moonfire.us/fiction/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eother works\u003c/a\u003e including contemporary and sci-fi. There isn\u0027t one genre that I focus on, but I do lean toward action pieces with frequent forays into drama and romance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying to create a comprehensive world, one where there isn\u0027t one True Answer to anything, where a villain in one story is the hero in another. A place where no one is truly good or evil, just the complicated shades of humanity that I love so much. And, at the same time, show the haphazard connection between the different people and how they tie together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor this Patreon, your money will go toward creating stories and novels. They will be grouped in \"submissions\" of 6-8k words which will be either a collection of short stories or a few chapters of one of my unpublished novels. These will be all drafts with the occasional typo. The money I get will go toward hiring editors and a cover illustrator to have them properly released both in ebook and print form. When this happens, I\u0027m going to make the entire piece Creative Common licensed and only sell the print version. The ebook version will be free to download and share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first novel posted will be Sand and Ash, the sequel to \u003ca href=\"https://sand-and-blood.fedran.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSand and Blood\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
