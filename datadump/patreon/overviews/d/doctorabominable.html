    "summary": "Greetings, earthlings. My name is Doctor Abominable, but on Earth I am called Paul Russel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSUMMARY:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a 25+ year veteran video game artist (Halo), illustrator (Screeching Weasel), and graphic designer (Ravinia Festival). After burning out in the game industry (occupational hazard), I started doing birthday illustrations for friends. After doing over 500 of them, I thought that maybe this has some value to people, and there might be some interest in a book, so I started a Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFULL BIO:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a lot of years and rubber on the road as an artist. I started as a crappy cartoonist and illustrator doing work for the Columbia Chronicle as a student at Columbia College Chicago, occasionally doing album covers and flyers for local punk bands. One of them the kind of famous Screeching Weasel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter school, and many, many retail jobs, in the early \u002790s, I stumbled upon a temp agency specializing in Graphic Design work. While there, I did a lot of type corrections, catalog work, photo retouching, and graphic design for an ungodly amount of clients, eventually landing a summer job as an assistant graphic designer at Chicago\u0027s Ravinia Festival. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter working a couple more years doing promotional material for a Chicago area nightclub owner, I stumbled (again) into doing graphic design, character design, environment work, motion graphics, storyboards, animatics, 3d modelling, and animation at High Voltage Software, a Chicago area video game developer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA friend told me of a position opening up at Bungie Software Products Corporation, and I ended up there for 12 years, initially building alien characters and vehicles, then environments for what would eventually become Halo. I suggested that name, everyone hated it, but here we are. I eventually spent 12 years there, working on all the Halo games through Reach, and then another five months at Certain Affinity, capping off with some concept work for Halo 4 before I had a COMPLETE MELTDOWN.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sat on my ass for a couple years, with a neat case of PTSD that would send me into a crash every time I tried to do the kind of work I\u0027d been doing for roughly 16 years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, while on Facebook, I got the usual notification of a friend\u0027s birthday, and instead of typing the obligatory, \"Happy Birthday, Dude!\" I drew their picture, then the next person, and so on. A few years on, and I\u0027ve drawn over 500 of them, with the only intent of doing something nice for friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil I got greedy... Well, maybe needy. With Uncle Sam\u0027s meager monthly paycheck, I find it hard to afford things like car repairs, medical expenses, and travel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is where Patreon comes in. I want to continue doing these drawings, and maybe poke around the idea of doing a book for them, but I don\u0027t want to bilk you of all your hard earned money to pay me to do work that\u0027s essentially for other people... I only want to bilk you of a little bit of your hard earned money. I\u0027m thinking at a certain dollar amount, you get a birthday drawing of your own, as a high resolution digital file, because half my process is digital.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not looking to be Fatty McBigBuxx, here. This is just to cover life expenses beyond my basic income for now. Testing the waters a bit to see if there\u0027s something more sustainable and ambitious I can do in the future (i.e. a book of these).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re into the idea, I\u0027d love to have your support. You in?\u003cbr\u003e"
