I am inspired most often by nature and my own inner spiritual life. What comes out on canvas can be anything from a complex abstract composition to a surreal landscape.

My Patrons gain access to exclusive blog posts, videos, prints and may even receive original works! When you choose a patron tier you are choosing to invest in me and my artistic career. Each tier comes with a set of rewards. The value of the rewards may be greater than the tier itself. Simply chose the tier based upon either what you comfortable investing each month, or on the rewards which are offered. I will do all the rest!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd once again, thank you!"
