I think that passion makes it difficult for artists to understand the necessity of financial support, it gets put into the category of a hobby to make way for a real job that pays the bills, as a result, so many countless opportunities to create and share get lost along the way. By Pledging your support to me and this Project you will help me to have the freedom to Create. I thought about making a list here of all the ideas I have and what the money would help support, Equipment upgrades, studio lighting, a Book Idea, a Proper Portfolio... and all of that is Real, but the truth is, your support would help me to make a living as an Artist, and that is literally a Dream.\u00a0"

     "about": "I am a Photographer. It took me a long time to be able to write that as a statement rather than a question. I believe Art is an Expression of Emotion, I feel what I create, and hopefully you feel it too. I work in a steel mill, it was a result of settling for something I didn\u2019t want, rather than believing in something I did want. I suppose it\u2019s the old artists struggle with Impostor Syndrome, yes I create art, but is it good enough, am I a fraud? Anyway, the mill became a trap, bills piled up, a house with a Girlfriend and a few Animals, Oh and of course the expensive hobby of Photography and there was no going back\u2026 photography became my necessary creative outlet though, it kept me sane. The truth is after over 20 years of doing the same job I\u2019m starting to crack. I know in my heart I need to be creating. I need to be making things happen, I need to be Living and not just surviving. There are days when I literally can\u2019t shake the depression that sets in at the thought of returning to the mill, it\u0027s slowly destroying me inside and sucking away my soul! I know that last sentence sounds dramatic and a lot like whining, especially in today\u2019s economy where people would give anything to have a good paying job, I guess that\u2019s why I keep going, but I know it\u2019s more out of fear now. I questioned my ability to make a living doing what I love, but never for one second questioned my ability to do a job that is so physically demanding that people quit daily. There\u2019s something really sad about that. So fast forward a couple years, I break up with my girlfriend who was my first model/muse and I turn the camera inward, focus on the emotions of ending a 7 year relationship with someone I truly Love. The Project becomes a way for me to work through the pain, the fear of being alone again, the struggle of Life, it was my therapy. I wanted it to feel Raw, and Honest, Vulnerable (which is something I\u2019ve never been good at) so I shed my clothes. I know the first thing that comes to mind when You say Nude is Porn, especially for a guy, but the truth is there is nothing more vulnerable than baring ourselves completely, if you don\u2019t believe me try it, it\u2019s scary as hell to stand before someone completely nude, there\u2019s nothing to hide behind or from. This seemed like a good place to start for me, completely vulnerable. Only later did I realize the key to truly connecting with someone is allowing yourself to be vulnerable, which is something I read in a Brene Browne book titled \u201cDaring Greatly.\u201d I mustered the courage to share some of this work on Flickr, and made some connections, but I couldn\u2019t push myself to share my true identity, so I adopted the screen names DearIndifference and HelloDearThomas. I made some genuine connections, the work was well received (to my surprise), but I was constantly questioning myself, the anonymity felt wrong, the nudity made me feel guilt and shame, the fear of being recognized or found out was overwhelming, so I left, deleted everything and walked away\u2026 Five years I played this cat and mouse game, building up the courage to share this project on Flickr, DeviantArt, Tumblr, and every couple months the fear would wash over me like a giant wave, it would just knock me over, I\u2019d quit, at one point I even deleted the whole project from my computer, I had enough... the shame, guilt, fear, it wasn\u2019t worth it. Almost immediately I realized deleting this project was a mistake, It was like burning pages from your diary, hoping you\u2019d forget, but you can\u2019t forget, the details might get fuzzy, but you never really forget (Think Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind)\u2026 so I searched for a program to recover the photographs, but in the end, all that was left were the web edits, the originals were gone. I began shooting again, more consistently this time, sharing more liberally, striking up conversations with Real Artists who\u2019ve become Real Friends. I started receiving letters of encouragement and notes from so many different people from all over the world, People I respected and admired. I saw Improvements in my work and realized I was growing as an Artist and a Man. I realized this project was perhaps the opportunity I was hoping for, it was my chance to truly connect with an audience. Would it be my path to becoming a professional Photographer and Artist, after all the years of struggle and doubt, would the last hurdle be claiming this work as my own? There was so much fear about introducing it to an even wider audience, and hoping it would be understood and accepted, but I began grinding even harder, sharing work everywhere again, reading every book I could find, watching tutorials, writing openly, trying to figure out how I could make a living with this work\u2026 but I still had this little seed of doubt. Through my research I stumbled upon a Curated Fine Art site called 1x, I still needed to prove this Project was worthy of recognition, so I submitted one of the photographs that had won an award on DA, \u201cFeels Like Falling.\u201d Only 5% of art submitted to 1x gets accepted into the Curators Gallery and after a week, it was accepted! I couldn\u2019t believe it, so I submitted another, and another, to date, 9 out of the 12 photographs I submitted were accepted so far. I say that with complete humility because there\u2019s still a part of me that can\u2019t help questioning everything. but for the last 2 years I\u2019ve been on a journey to claim my place as an Artist, not a guy working in a mill doing art on the side, but an Artist who used to work at a mill who is one of those success stories (like all the ones that inspired me at various times throughout my Life). I used to daydream about having my own show in a NYC Art Gallery, I\u2019m tired of letting Dreams be dreams. Time is something we take for granted until one day you look up and realize it\u2019s literally now or never, time waits for no man or woman, and procrastination is a tool Fear uses to waste our Lives, I can\u2019t wait anymore\u2026 I\u0027ve spent months reading and researching about where to go from here, how to get my work noticed by galleries or dealers, how to make this dream a reality, Branding, websites, etc. and while the confidence and the courage is still kicking in me, while I still feel the Fire, I need to take advantage of this feeling and keep pushing! So I heard about Patreon while listening to a podcast about creativity and branding. Immediately I stopped the podcast looked up the site and the next day I began writing my story. There is a part of me that is hesitant, not because I don\u2019t think this work is good enough anymore (I\u0027m finally starting to believe that it is), there\u2019s just something about asking for money that I have a hard time with, but the reality is I\u2019ve been creating passionately for years and this work has been wasting away, hidden on hard drives, revealed to a select few as low quality web edits, but now I have a chance to share this work with an Audience who might deem it worthy of support. Your support will open doors for me into a world of art that I\u2019ve only dreamed about. I have to take this chance, I have to make every attempt at creating my Life as a Photographer and an Artist. Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to share this work with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
