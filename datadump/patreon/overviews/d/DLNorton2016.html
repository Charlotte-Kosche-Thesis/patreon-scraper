My biggest concern is that I do not think that I am reaching enough people who may be interested in my art as a whole, including the comics. I will, time to time, get a commission which can pay good, or get a request to be part of an art jam or that perhaps I can do a small sketch for someone with little to no compensation. It\u0027s fun to do, I love to do it, but in the end, I get nothing tangible from it..and I have to beg and plea for some kind of compensation, and I rarely get it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have no choice, and I need a little help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, why do I keep doing this? Labor of Love..? ..you say? You can say that, I\u0027ve said it, but I\u0027m still back to square one making this pay for its self. What do I need to do? I\u0027ll tell you what I need to do, charge for it. If someone wants to see it, and they really like it, then perhaps they can help me out on the monetary side to perhaps give me that helping hand to keep me in the game. And it\u0027s all about the game..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat my friend, is why I\u0027m here, I need your help to keep me in that game \u003cem\u003e(and on track)\u003c/em\u003e and to meet my goals with my art, my time, my creativity and my gratitude. To keep me wanting to get into, and hopefully..in the future, to stay in that goddamn studio of mine and crank out more of my art. I do work a \u003cstrong\u003efull-time\u003c/strong\u003e job to make ends meet, but that, in and of itself can be a detriment to my ability to do this. I\u0027m not asking for a living, I\u0027m just asking for a fair chance to help me with my expenses, that\u0027s it in a nutshell. I cannot make it anymore plain than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, my studio is a mess. It\u0027s a converted garage, but it is also a landing spot for anything else we need to store or stash. It\u0027s cramped, though cozy, but it needs work, and my staying in there more regularly, creating, will hopefully give me the inspiration to make this a productive studio. I feel embarrased when people come into it because it looks like a tornado hit it, but it is a studio nonetheless, and sometimes a woodshop (or repair shop) when I have to do that. I would also like to make it a gallery, but I\u0027m getting ahead of myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, help me to do what I truly love to do and hopefully do something that you love to see, on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATED: Caveats: I can except anywhere from a $1.00 contribution on up. But I would suggest not more than $20.00. If you pledge more, that is up to you, my goals do not change. It doesn\u0027t make my work come any faster or make the content change or make me produce more. It stays the same. A pledge of just a buck ($1.00) shows that you are interested and you like my work and want to see more. A pledge of $5.00 will keep my work coming (more regularly), per piece, and it goes up from there up to $20.00. \u00a0And of course, a pledge of $20.00 gives you special status and you can take advantage of any exclusives I offer. \u003ci style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e(Contact me if you have more questions on that by the way) \u003c/i\u003eThe more contributors I have, the more I am inclined to produce. I\u0027d rather have many contributors (fans) pledge in the $1 to $5 range than some contributors pledging in the $20.00 range.. but you have to start somewhere and I am\u00a0grateful\u00a0for any contribution no matter how big or small. I\u0027m not so much as money driven as I am driven by my fans and those who have an interest in my work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
