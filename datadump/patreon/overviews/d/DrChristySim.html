    "summary": "Thank you to everyone who\u0027s joined this movement to promote healing after trauma and violence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you also to all of those partnering with me to empower faith leaders with the tools and understanding they need when someone comes to them with the disclosure of being violated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow we respond to disclosures and how we behave toward victims of violence is incredibly important. What we do can cause a difference of the survivor needing to heal from only primary trauma or also having to heal from secondary, church trauma. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly believe healing is possible, from primary and secondary trauma. I use Thema Bryant-Davis\u0027 definition of healing. Unlike the flu or a cold, where healing happens when the sneezing and symptoms discontinue, healing after trauma is about reclaiming power and thriving in spite of what happened. The bodily symptoms may not go away entirely, but we find tools to claim back control of our agency and thrive, living fully in the moment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am one who experienced trauma and learned to thrive. I\u0027ve been in those agonizing moments: Held against my will, \nphysically, and mentally traumatized. My body holds memories of trauma \nand know how they haunt and debilitate people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter my experience I earned the credentials to creatively imagine and help others heal after trauma and violence. I also worked hard to study each aspect of pastoral care and counseling in order to provide expert advice and guidance to pastors walking alongside their hurting parishioners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have an earned doctorate in healing after violence with an additional 500+ hours of specialized training in trauma informed care, survivor centered services, domestic violence, sexual assault, and beyond. I\u0027ve been involved in criminal court as an Expert Witness for the District Attorney\u0027s Office, I have state coalition experience assessing service providers for accreditation, and I have served as an Executive Director of a nonprofit. I have also been a senior pastor, a children\u0027s pastor, and camp speaker.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now a \"Survivor Expert\" and I invite you to join me on this journey towards healing and thriving after violence and trauma. I am also a pastoral advisor and counselor, walking alongside faith leaders when someone comes to them with the disclosure of violence and assault, and invite you to participate in this journey with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy being present here today and accessing the free tools, you are already making a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to find ways to:\u003cbr\u003e* Expand your reach\u003cbr\u003e* Explore original ideas, and \u003cbr\u003e* Creatively help yourself and others on the healing journey\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I encourage you to sign up for the higher donation amounts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to:\u003cbr\u003e* Invest in your own advancement as a ministry leader\u003cbr\u003e* Access my expert counsel, and\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e* Find a space to talk through anxiety and feelings that surround survivor care as a faith leader,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI encourage you to sign up for the $30 amount. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnow that with each increase in donation, access to the resources and designs I\u0027ve created also increases. Over the years, I\u0027ve created hundreds of resources and I continue to design and imagine more resources every day.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy signing up to be a part of this Patreon, you get access to those resources and me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will provide some for free, so anyone can join and get something, and the ones that take greater amounts of research and work will be available through the rewards. For example, one of the resources I list in the $100 category took me a year to compose after 3 classes and pouring through about 7 books.\u00a0 The greater amount of work it takes me, the greater reward available. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy what I have to offer and it makes a difference for you and the people you love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe sure to check out the resources I post on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DrChristySim/\"\u003eDr. Christy Sim Consulting and Training Facebook \u003c/a\u003eand the articles and links I provide on my \u003ca href=\"https://drchristysim.wordpress.com/\"\u003eDr. Christy Sim Website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, allow me to address some common questions:\u003cbr\u003e1.
