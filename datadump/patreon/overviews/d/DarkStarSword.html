If you like the work I do for the 3D Vision community, please consider becoming a patron and supporting me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, keep in mind that while I am very active in the community and my name appears on the blog quite a lot, I am not the only person in the community doing fixes, but this page is purely to donate to me. I suggest you take a close look at the games you have enjoyed in 3D and who was to thank for them before you decide to pledge to me personally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI personally have developed new techniques and tools that have enabled us to fix games using Unity 4 \u0026amp; 5 and CryEngine 3, as well as a bunch of custom engines used by Witcher 3, Far Cry 4, Miasmata, Mad Max and even Euro Truck Simulator 2. I have personally contributed well over 10,000 lines of code to 3DMigoto to make many DirectX 11 games possible to fix, and to add numerous features to open up brand new possibilities - and some of these features are now even being used by modders outside our community as well. I am the inventor of the auto 3D crosshair / HUD / mouse cursor used in the fixes for Miasmata, Dreamfall Chapters, The Witness, Montague\u0027s Mount, Stranded Deep, The Long Dark, Far Cry 4 and Metal Gear Solid V, and many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would hope anyone at this page already knows the blog where we release fixes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://helixmod.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://helixmod.blogspot.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a list of games I have personally fixed on my website:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://darkstarsword.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://darkstarsword.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince a lot of the work I do is behind the scenes to enable others to fix games I\u0027ve decided to go for the monthly pledge option instead of the pay per game fixed option\u00a0 (and besides which, I think it\u0027s too ambiguous as to what would count for that - do I count minor 3DMigoto releases or refixing a game after a major engine update?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you only want to do a one-off donation instead of a monthly pledge, you can use \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/DarkStarSword\"\u003emy paypal\u003c/a\u003e instead.\u003cbr\u003e"
