    "summary": "Dear friends, fans, and family, thank you so much for clicking on this link!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past year or so, I have been creating brand new music with an eye for film scoring. It has been wonderfully fulfilling, and with each track completed I feel like I grow as a musician.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to build a strong portfolio that will attract filmmakers in need of composers. Initially, the way to do this is to say \"yes\" to any and all projects that come my way, and then produce the best music I can! Generally speaking, this means hiring live musicians, renting studio time, and many, many hours spent writing music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this page to ask for your help as I start out down this road. The way it works is that once I upload a finished piece of music to this site, your pledge kicks in. That means your contribution here will directly go to any time I have spent writing, and fund any musicians I may hire for the project. Any amount helps! For added incentives, view the \"rewards\" section of this page. To get an idea of what I\u0027m working on currently, you can see my \"goals\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost important, when you get a chance please check out the music I have written recently at iamdanielmark.com.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so, so, much for your support, and I very much look forward to sharing new music with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDaniel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
