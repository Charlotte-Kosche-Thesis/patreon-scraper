    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi, I\u0027m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://drzhana.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDr. Zhana Vrangalova\u003c/a\u003e, a NYC-based sex educator and adjunct professor of Human Sexuality at\u00a0New York University. I hold a PhD in Developmental Psychology from Cornell University where I studied casual sex, nonmonogamy, and sexual orientation, and my scholarly research has been published in a number of academic journals. But I am also super passionate about bringing accurate scientific information to the general audience, something I\u0027ve done in many different ways over the years including writing for popular media (for e.g., Forbes, Psychology Today, Playboy, Alternet, NY Daily News, Teen Vogue), sharing new sex research on my social media, speaking in front of various groups from college students to health care providers, running sex educational events and workshops, tirelessly giving media interviews, and providing private sex education and consulting. I also run the CasualSexProject.com (a place for people to share their true hookup stories), and am currently working on a book about the science of healthy hookups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of my efforts to bring scientifically accurate sex science info to as many people as possible, I am now embarking on two new projects: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Sex Science News Videos - #SexyInsightswithDrZ\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEvery Wednesday I\u0027ll upload an 8-10 minute video on YouTube, each covering topics ranging from a new study recently published in the academic literature in the area of sexuality, my personal thoughts and opinions on a sex-relevant topic, or answering audience questions about anything and everything sex-related that you want to ask me. If you want to ask a question feel free to connect with me via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram (all @DrZhana), or email at zhana@drzhana.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. The Science of Sex Podcast with Dr. Zhana \u0026amp; Joe Pardavilla\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the Sex Science News videos aren\u0027t enough sex science for you, don\u0027t worry, my second new project has you covered. Each week, I will inform you about the most interesting new sex research published in the academic literature in the past week or so, and I will take one of those studies and dissect it in greater detail, diving deeper into the topic, including interviews with the study authors themselves and/or some personal stories that help exemplify the topic at hand. I\u0027ll make sure the science is accurate, and my co-host,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.955plj.nyc/monk/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJoe Pardavila\u003c/a\u003e, a long-time contributor to the Morning Show on WPJL-FM radio, will make sure I don\u0027t go too far off the academic rails and lose all nonacademic listeners in the process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBecoming my monthly Patreon patron...\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe videos and podcasts will always be free and accessible to everyone (although some videos and podcast episodes may be sponsored by various companies). However, they do take a tremendous amount of time and energy to create, so if you can, I really hope you can support me by becoming a patron (i.e., a monthly subscriber to my Patreon account). Any amount counts and I\u0027ll be eternally grateful to you for helping me share sex science with the world. And the more you give, the more awesome perks \u0026amp; rewards you get: From monthly sex toy raffles, to virtual Q \u0026amp; As, to 1-on-1 sex education with me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of your support as buying me coffee, drinks, lunch, or dinner every month in return for me keeping you informed about the science of sex. I like food and drinks, you like sex info, it\u0027s a fair trade, right? :) Of course, you should only subscribe if you can afford it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think this is a really important point about the Patreon model of support: By becoming a monthly subscriber, you are allowing me to focus on creating high-quality content, even if it\u0027s not super popular or click-bait-y. Without your support, I\u0027d have to depend on YouTube ads, and that means catering to the most poppy content, ignoring all the rest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals to aspire to...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we reach the $7,000/month threshold, I will embark on a whole new project: Turning the Psychology of Human Sexuality class that I currently teach to undergraduates at New York University \u003cem\u003einto a freely available YouTube lecture series\u003c/em\u003e, consisting of 52 1-hr lectures (Powerpoint slides and all) released on a weekly schedule. Because I think high-quality sex education should be available to everyone, not just the lucky few who can afford to pay $50,000+ college tuition.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
