Thank you so much for visiting my Patreon and considering becoming a patron! My name is Grace but I go by the handle Derpy Mermaid! I\u0027m a plus size cosplayer and photographer aspiring to get better by the day~!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been cosplaying since 2014 (and hope I never stop), and I\u0027ve been a growing photographer since I could hold my first DSLR (circa 2010).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 60px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/946180_1151203131559299_4327719159268013990_n.jpg?oh=71e7532a7305205895ebb8ff2c633421\u0026amp;oe=59FE4786\" style=\"width: 513px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 180px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"85\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4317/35900270101_e4b0c4630a_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals with this Patreon is to engage, entertain, and interact with fellow cosplayers! But also most importantly, to grow my career as a photographer, and to help fund my favorite past time: Cosplay! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping those who want to support me do so because they want to learn from me, connect with me, or just plain see my content! I\u2019d love to be able to help at least one person with the knowledge I\u0027ve gained about sewing, crafting, and photography over the many years I\u0027ve practiced it. My hope is also that this helps me connect with new people as well! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, it\u0027s my dream to make a real career out of my photography and continue this hobby that enables my creativity and lets me be me. But working a minimum wage job really only pays the bills, and barely lets me afford to make my cosplays.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"74\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4311/35992406126_2ffed5d7e6_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth of it is that I usually pay for most conventions and crafting through the photo shoots I do at cons and on site. But those are never constant variables, so it can make planning really difficult.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example: Anime Boston 2017, I had 6 photo shoots lined up for the weekend and was set to break even for the expenses of the con. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, 5 of 6 of those shoots cancelled on me during the event, or were no shows. I had just enough in my savings to cover the costs of the con in the case something like this happened, but it set me back for a couple months. \u003cbr\u003eBecause of this I ended up cancelling on another con, scrapping a cosplay I was planning, and was unable to get some of the new equipment I was eyeballing for my camera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u2019t always the case, but it definitely shows how I can\u2019t purely rely on photoshoots to get me by all the time. \u003cbr\u003eSo this is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m hoping that I can get to a point where people enjoy my content enough on here that it will take some of the stress off my back that comes from living paycheck to paycheck and photo shoot to shoot to keep this hobby alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also love to be able to enjoy my favorite past time without stressing out about bills. \u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I worked so much to fund my cosplay that I hardly got to even do it: I worked two jobs and hardly had time to sew/craft. I ended up cancelling my plans for 2 conventions because I was determined to get ahead financially. \u003cbr\u003eThat was a rough year for me. With no creative outlet I was frustrated and upset almost all the time, and I ended up isolating myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not the end of the world to cancel a cosplan or two, or even to miss out on a con. But conventions are where I come to life! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"85\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4293/35992405726_26be0ffa66_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think a lot of people can relate to how much a convention can brighten your life. \u003cbr\u003ePersonally it\u2019s helped me immensely with my chronic depression and social anxiety. \u003cbr\u003eNothing has made me come out of my shell more than the connections I\u2019ve forged at cons. \u003cbr\u003eNot to mention the incredible confidence boost I get when people tell me they love my costume or the photos I\u2019ve taken! The energy I find at cons seriously motivates me to keep going creatively through life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo while it\u2019s not crucial to keep up with cosplay and conventions, it\u2019s something that has really helped me grow as a person, and something I would love to keep a part of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo add to that, one thing I desperately want to keep in my life? All the great friends I make through cons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"477\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4293/35862688992_cf7cbfb7d2_z.jpg\" style=\"width: 633px;\" width=\"530\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"85\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4329/35194586144_4a3dc7529c_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned before, I really want to further connect with the community and people. Conventions have opened so many doors for me and sprouted so many friendships for me, and I want to keep that going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me here, know that I\u2019ll support you back. \u003cbr\u003eI want to share any and all knowledge I can to help people enjoy cosplay and conventions as much as possible, because I know how important this hobby can be to a person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also expect cool rewards and bonuses if you become a Patron!All the tiers have their own special rewards, but I made access to my feed here and all the tips, tricks, and tutorials a lower tier so it\u2019s affordable for those interested. Considering a class at Joann Fabrics or Michael\u2019s craft stores run about $30-$60, I thought $1-$5 was a reasonable price to share my experience for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you get higher up the tiers you can expect fun stuff in the mail, monthly specials, and my specifically devoted time to you through various means. \u003cbr\u003eWhether it\u2019s participating in a poll to decide my next cosplay, following along a video/livestream, or participating in Q\u0026amp;A\u2019s, I really look forward to growing and helping people learn together with all this.But if you\u2019re just in it to get the polaroids/prints in the mail, enjoy the boudoir photos monthly, and follow my journey, that\u2019s awesome too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"85\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4304/35194586964_9c65d0517f_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to devote the time to improve my cosplay and my photography (specifically the cosplay portraiture I adore so much). \u003cbr\u003eBut most of all, I want  to keep doing these things that bring so much joy and enrichment to my life. \u003cbr\u003eBy pledging you\u0027re helping to support that for me, and nothing would make me happier~ \u0026lt;3\u003cimg height=\"484\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4315/35224079303_335b46da05_z.jpg\" style=\"background-color: initial;\" width=\"640\"\u003e"
