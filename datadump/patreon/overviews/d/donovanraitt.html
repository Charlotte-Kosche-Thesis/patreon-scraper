More and more, people have access to free music on demand, and it simply isn\u0027t the same music industry it used to be. Artists have to find ways to not only to be creative and do the things they are passionate about, but need a way to support themselves at the same time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the heck is PATREON anyways?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a platform for fans to support the artists they like so they can keep creating the things they create. Patronage of art goes back to the early Renaissance where wealthy families or individuals would become \u003cem\u003epatrons\u003c/em\u003e of artists and commission their works. Some of the world\u0027s best art would not exist if it weren\u0027t for the patronage system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, very simply, if you like what I do and want me to do more of it, why not \u003cem\u003eBECOME A PATRON!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eThere are several levels of support, starting at just \u003cstrong\u003e$1 a month! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOk, So If I become a patron, What kind of content will I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive Access to NEW Music! \u003c/strong\u003eAll patrons regardless of support level get EARLY access to all of my new music, and there\u0027s going to be a lot of it coming in the next few months, and the ONLY place you will be able to find it is by becoming a Patreon Supporter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Only Live Videos and Hangouts! - \u003c/strong\u003eOnce I can build up the support base on here, we can schedule exclusive live videos where I can show you guys what I\u0027m working on as I\u0027m creating it, so you can see the writing process and ask questions, Live performances, online hang-outs to chat about music, guitar and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonalized Guitar Lessons\u003c/strong\u003e - Patrons of certain levels can schedule personal one-on-one lessons with me either online via skype where we can discuss whatever you want! \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your support and thank you for becoming a Patron!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive Limited Edition Merchandise! - \u003c/strong\u003eAll patrons will get a discount on my merchandise store at\u00a0\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.donovanraitt.threadless.com\u003c/a\u003e and will have access to limited edition items that will only be available to patreon supporters!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
