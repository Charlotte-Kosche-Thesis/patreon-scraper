    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eThe end...for Patreon\u003c/h2\u003eHello everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me start off by saying I greatly appreciate everyone who so generously contributed to my Patreon over the past seven months or so. When creating the Patreon in the first place, a large portion of its creation stemmed from my uncertainty of the future and being able to support myself. A year and a half out from graduation, I still had not been able to find a full time job in my field (or any field). I had a part time job I worked from home, but it did not provide much stability. As fate would have it, very soon after launching the Patreon, I received an offer for a full time, but temporary job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I began work full time, I was still unsure about the future, as it was a two month contract which would then end. I kept the Patreon up to keep an eye on the future, and it seemed that it would be a fun way to engage with you all. As I continued work, the contract was extended, and I was given more assignments as I performed well. As it stands now, the contract runs through the end of the year, and it\u0027s looking good that it will continue far beyond that. Currently, I\u0027m not in a state of financial worry every day of my life anymore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, I am still working the part time job I mentioned before. My part time job involves disaster/evacuation plan mapping in Texas, and if you\u0027ve followed the news on Hurricane Harvey, you\u0027d know there\u0027s quite a bit of disaster that needs mitigating, which has made work very busy. After working full time, coming home and working another job, and spending time with my family, it\u0027s been an incredibly difficult experience trying to find time to make videos. I do it when I can, research viruses that might make good videos while I have downtime at work, and basically stretch out what little free time I have to ensure there\u0027s always content for YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut making content for YouTube does not mean that Patrons, those who have willingly opened their wallets for the videos I make, get their fair share of special content in exchange for that donation. As the Patreon carries on, I\u0027ve faced many delays getting rewards out in a timely manner, been lazy in capturing bloopers/outtakes/special content to give to patrons, and generally I don\u0027t feel comfortable accepting your money for my videos as they currently stand. I feel like I\u0027ve neglected those who like my content the most, so because of that I\u0027m shutting down the Patreon effective immediately. The videos won\u0027t stop, but rather, I don\u0027t want to feel like I\u0027m letting anyone down when life gets in the way of YouTube. \u003cstrong\u003eYou will not be charged for the month of October or any point in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have exciting plans for the future, but for the reasons mentioned above, some of them will likely take quite a while to develop and pursue. So until then, hang on tight, and I\u0027ll keep getting the videos out whenever I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to those of you who have pledged or considered pledging in the past. Maybe in the future, if I have something that would adequately support the Patreon model, it can be reopened, but for now I will leave it as it is. Maybe in the future they\u0027ll have a way of stopping troll pledges as well, but I\u0027m not going to hold my breath. There is always the possibility of a merchandise store, but I need to put some serious thought into it - so if you missed your chance to pledge for a Spider Doggy plush, then maybe you\u0027ll still have the opportunity to snag one in the future. Thanks again for all of your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake care,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003edanooct1\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
