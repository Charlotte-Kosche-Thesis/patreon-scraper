The arts are the universal languages that have the capability to speak to the core of every human on Earth. I believe that creativity is our greatest human resource;\u00a0 my intention with everything that I create is to inspire others to unleash their own creative potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT I DO AND HOW I DO IT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a musician, producer, composer, speaker, photographer, designer, philosopher, writer, yogi, creative consultant, visionary, lifestyle coach, activist, entrepreneur, and creator of all things. I have also been my own manager and booking agent, touring 3000+ days in over 20 countries over the past 10 years.\u00a0 I also co-founded the artist collective/social movement \"Slow Down\" which celebrates creativity as our greatest human resource, reminds us of the simple elegance of \"being\" and aims to support arts programs around the world (I want your help with this!)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e I am a passionate collaborator. I believe in celebrating diversity and consider the essence of collaborating is improving one\u0027s weaknesses with the strengths of others in order to birth something bigger than oneself. I have used this philosophy to release over 100 pieces of music in the last 8 years and have 25+ songs planned for release in 2018.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAll\u003c/em\u003e my music is available for donation (because I believe creativity comes \u003cem\u003ethrough\u003c/em\u003e you not \u003cem\u003efrom\u003c/em\u003e you).

I have never compromised my message or my artistic integrity in favor of selling over saying. I also often work 80+ hours a week, traveling 300 days a year, and would like to expand my team (allowing me to focus on more on the arts). Your contribution will help me to continue spreading my message around the world by helping with the extensive costs often paid for by major record labels (which unfortunately often enslave artists in the process!). Hiring musicians (live and in studio), PR, designers, marketing, promotions, building out an expanded live touring show, launching my first interactive photography exhibition, transforming my artist collective/social movement \"Slow Down\" into an official 501 c3 non-profit and so much more. Expanding my team (this includes \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e) is the biggest part of my next step.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW YOU CAN BE PART OF THE TEAM!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been asked by many people over the years how best to support me directly. Supporting and sharing my Patreon page with others is an \u003cem\u003eamazing\u003c/em\u003e way!\u00a0 Please share this page with anyone who you think will be inspired. From exclusive mixes, works in progress, to one-on-one life and art coaching and private concerts, I want to make myself available to you - the wonderful humans who have made all of this possible. I am so grateful for all the support over the year; I am forever grateful for the path that I walk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA LITTLE ABOUT MY JOURNEY\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this beautiful thing we call life, I have been blessed with many opportunities. When I was 21, I decided to pursue a life of happiness and adventure by quitting my old job, leaving everything and everyone I knew behind, moving first to Central America and then to India. At that time, I had never performed my music for anyone in public. I went from busking on the streets to touring around the world.  The journey of my artistic discovery has been tandem with my journey of self discovery.  Along the way, I have continually redefined what it means for me to be \"successful;\" creating, collaborating, sharing and learning.  From expanding consciousness with plant medicines to Vipassana meditation, living in Mayan villages or the base of the Himalayas, playing festivals to lecturing at MIT about creativity, I am truly fascinated by this incredible thing we call \"The Human Experience.\"  I truly believe that we are not human beings having a spiritual experience - we are spiritual beings having a human experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eDavid\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eClick \u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/THEHUMANEXPERIENCE\"\u003e[here]\u003c/a\u003e to listen to my music\u003cbr\u003eClick \u003ca href=\"http://www.davidblockphotography.com/\"\u003e[here]\u003c/a\u003e to view my photography\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGET TO KNOW ME MORE WITH THE INTERVIEW BELOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L3yJWl5IaLI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
