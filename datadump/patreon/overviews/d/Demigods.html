I have had a weekly funny comic series going on for a year now under the name WeFlaps (Still not sure why I named it that) and I\u0027ve had fun doing it, but as of the last few months I\u0027ve been looking for an outlet to draw slightly more serious comics. Which brings me to the Webtoon Comic I started called Demigods! *Lifts the curtain..I guess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.cubeupload.com/yCq0ZQ.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \"Demigods,\" is a Story idea I wrote up as a movie screenplay for a high school film class long ago, and I\u0027ve finally decided to share it in comic form!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat is Demigods About?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDemigods follows the Story of Tyson, Noah and Karen. Who are suppose to be the last Demigods on Earth. The Greek Gods have left Olympus, to live out normal human lives as their powers have weakened due to lack of belief in them in the modern world. Zeus Poseidon, and Athena lived happily with their normal families until something changed, leaving each Demigod missing a their godly parent in the middle of the night without explanation...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.cubeupload.com/WkwV4I.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e12 years later...The Demigods receive a message of the return of their godly parents...except they return with the intent, to end them all. We follow our three demigods on their journey to discover why their parents left in the first place...and how\u00a0 they can get ready to fight them when they return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhy are you starting a Patreon now?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell I thought I could pull off my regular WeFlaps funny comics(a source of income), Demigods series on webtoons and my part time job(other source of income) as well. But, lately it has been taking a toll on my health (sleep deprived, stress, blood pressure) to try and keep up with all these things. Since I really don\u0027t want to stop doing Demigods with the lovely, and sweet reception it\u0027s received so far. Patreon is my shot at turning Demigods into a source of income and eliminating the part time job so I don\u0027t have to stop telling the story!...So that\u0027s why :D...because bills and unfortunately the bank wants me to pay this off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon supports my overall comic illustrating career, but will hopefully secure a future where I can illustrate the Demigods Webtoon to the quality I dreamed of, and tell the story the way I originally wrote it :D. Thanks or checking out my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S Also, I understand money is tight. So if you can\u0027t support financially but love the comic, then give it a share on the social medias if you could, thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003elink to my funny comics page:\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WeFlaps/\"\u003eWeFlaps Funny Comics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eand here is Demigods on Webtoons!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/demigods/list?title_no=95331\"\u003eDemigods\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
