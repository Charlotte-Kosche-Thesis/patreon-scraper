I\u0027ve been working digitally for almost a decade now, though my ability has vastly improved over the last couple of years at school. I also write scripts for comics, and though I\u0027m sure I could do any genre I feel like, my favourite is Fantasy. You know. Dragons, magic, demons, general mayhem of the magical variety. I haven\u0027t been published, but with any luck, that day won\u0027t be too far from now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, why I started a Patreon? Well, I\u0027d love to be able to seriously work on my graphic novel, and with Patreon, I\u0027m encouraged to create daily content. Even if it is just school work and random little comic strips for the now. The great part is that I\u0027ve finally have a good schedule for schoolwork gelled, and I\u0027m able to post more personal work, which I\u0027m excited about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me on this adventure; I won\u0027t disappoint.\u003cbr\u003e"
