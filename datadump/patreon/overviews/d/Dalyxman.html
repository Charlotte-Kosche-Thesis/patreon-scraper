    "summary": "Since June 2010, I have produced wrestling commentary on Youtube. These videos range from LIVE reviews, wrestling topics, fan interactions, and an abundance of other things. Thanks to my amazingly loyal fanbase, my Youtube channel has now grown to a point that I now have new equipment and can now produce the best podcasting/wrestling commentary channel on Youtube. Thank you to all the people who helped me reach this level of success and I hope you continue to stick around for what\u0027s to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo at this point, this page is simply here for donations. Donate to what? The growth and prosperity of my channel. Every cent will only go to buying equipment and improving the quality of my videos, nothing more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make this clearly.\u00a0This is NOT a demand. Regardless of how much money I make from this, my content WILL be free and I will continue to make it free. This is only for those who WANT to contribute and are willing to do this out of the kindness of their hearts. If you are financially unable to contribute, I\u0027d advise you do not and just simply watch my videos. The more views I get, the more money I make from Youtube. However, if you feel the need to support me during this time, do know I appreciate your gratitude."
