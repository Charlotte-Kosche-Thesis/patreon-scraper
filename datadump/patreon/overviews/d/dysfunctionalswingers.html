    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are the Dysfunctional Swingers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s the creative project of Emily Edwards and Brendan McGlynn, two NYC based dancers from different genres of dance backgrounds who found their common ground in swing dance.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do we do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur work focuses on story-telling, partnering, and humor through dance. We are consistently growing our repertoire and now have many original creations from the past 3 years that we have been working together. We\u0027ve performed at multiple places in New York including venues such as Victorian Gardens in Central Park, Governors Island, The Slipper Room, and 13th Street Repertory Theatre. We are currently starting our 4th summer on Governors Island where we will be teaching free swing dance lessons to visitors at the \u003ca href=\"http://dysfunctionaltheatre.org/dysfunctional-collective\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDysfunctional Collective\u003c/a\u003e house. We\u0027ve also used our summer residency on Governors Island to create site-specific dance videos, inspired by our beautiful surroundings on the island. You can see one of them \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS_OXG6TA-g\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is our creative process?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGenerally we create our works based on performances we have coming up or when we are inspired by a particular song or style. We spend at least 20-30 hours building each 3 minute piece before we show it to the public. We push ourselves to try new genres, moves, and tricks. This always takes time to make sure we are doing it safely and think through each aspect of the routine to make sure it is conveying the story we want it to.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do we need patrons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been extraordinarily lucky in that we have access to some free rehearsal space. However we do still have other costs such as costumes (usually vintage or handmade) for each number, PR, travel expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses such as hiring videographers and photographers. Because we don\u0027t have one particular show or performance that we are creating and are constantly in the studio making new content, we decided that a platform where we have a monthly \"allowance\" is the best format for us to raise money so it can be allocated on an as-needed basis. While this means The Dysfunctional Swingers will still be a \u0027labor of love\u0027 for us, this does mean we won\u0027t be scrambling to pay out of pocket for our creations. Your help and support will allow us to focus our energies on creating more opportunities for us to be seen and taking our work further than we have before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre The Dysfunctional Swingers available for lessons or performances?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe sure are! Reach out to us about what you would like to do and we are more than willing to sit down with you and create a custom experience for whatever you have in mind. We\u0027ve performed at theater benefits, amusement parks, sexy cabarets, and more. We\u0027re very adaptable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave additional questions or want to know more?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can visit us on our \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dysfunctionalswingers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook Page\u003c/a\u003e to learn about our recent and upcoming events or contact us by \u003ca href=\"mailto:dysfunctionalswingers@gmail.com\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e with any thoughts you may have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
