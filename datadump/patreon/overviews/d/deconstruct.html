Quality wise and also by committing more time to it. To create the best Deconstruct podcast we know how to do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why we need your help. \u003cbr\u003eSadly, time is limited and we all need to earn money somehow. With your help we might be able to devote more of our time to the show, time that we would otherwise spend working \"for the man\" or simply someone else. There are also a few things on the horizon we would like to buy to improve the quality and reach of the show. Just check our goals or talk to us directly for a few ideas we have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put it simply: The more you are willing to give to us, the more we will be able to achieve.\u003cbr\u003e"
