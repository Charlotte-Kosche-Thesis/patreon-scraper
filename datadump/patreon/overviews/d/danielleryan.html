    "summary": "Hi everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re on this page, you\u0027ve probably run into my work somewhere before, so\u003cstrong\u003e thank you\u003c/strong\u003e for reading and thanks for being here. I really appreciate it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who somehow ended up here more by chance, let me give you a bit of background. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an\u003cstrong\u003e independent freelance journalist\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m Irish, but have lived in the US, Germany, Russia -- and I\u0027m now based in the beautiful Budapest, Hungary. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTen years ago, when I was starting out, I had an idealistic view of journalism. I believed there were good publications (which told the truth), and bad publications (which told lies). I believed there was such thing as \u003cstrong\u003e\"objective journalism\"\u003c/strong\u003e -- and I believed it was very important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of years in Washington D.C. would disabuse even the most staunch idealist of that notion. As the Godfather of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/18/hunter-s-thompson-journalism-politics/\"\u003e\"gonzo journalism\"\u003c/a\u003e said himself:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u201cThere is no such thing as Objective Journalism. The phrase itself is a pompous contradiction in terms.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eToday I view all journalism through that lens. None of it is 100% objective -- and any journalist who claims to be 100% objective is either lying or completely lacking in self-awareness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a big critic of \"mainstream media\" but that doesn\u0027t mean I trust \"alternative media\" blindly. What I believe in is multiple streams of information, multiple perspectives, multiple voices -- and allowing people to decide for themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe that\u0027s just another form of idealism, but wouldn\u0027t it be great?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am sick and tired of watching the media sell us lies and regime change and wars. I am sick and tired of people believing their options for \u0027real news\u0027 are limited to corporate-owned media which serve the interests of warmongers and weapons manufacturers. I am sick and tired of arms makers and governments funding \u0027think tanks\u0027 and journalists helping to pass them off as objective arbiters of truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe we should subject stories in the mainstream press to \u003cstrong\u003erigorous skepticism\u003c/strong\u003e and be forever seeking second opinions and varying perspectives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy focus is\u00a0geopolitics and the media narratives that dominate. You can check out my work via my website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://danielle-ryan.com/\"\u003edanielle-ryan.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you might have guessed, freelance writing is not exactly a ticket to fame and fortune! That\u0027s especially true if your views are considered outside the \"mainstream\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT this is\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ea sob story! I\u0027ve been lucky enough to have found some great editors along the way who are open to publishing ideas that fall outside of mainstream narratives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, it\u0027s getting a little bit harder -- and that\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery little helps. \u003c/strong\u003eIf I can accumulate some small monthly pledges from readers, the more time I will be able to dedicate to new writing projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne of those projects\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eis a book which tracks my Trans-Siberian journey across Russia from west to east last summer, from the\u003cstrong\u003e Solovetsky Islands in the North Sea to Vladivostok in the Far East\u003c/strong\u003e, giving first-hand honest insight into the places and people of a country that is currently so maligned in the media. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is to release chapters here on Patreon exclusively to patrons as my pledges increase. That\u0027s in addition to much more new work\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@danielle_ryan\"\u003eon Medium\u003c/a\u003e and patron-only content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhether you can afford a $1 or $100 pledge, I appreciate it.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your generosity.\u003cbr\u003eDanielle\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
