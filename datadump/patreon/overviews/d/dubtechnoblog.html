    "summary": "I have been blogging about dub techno for over 8 years now. All this has been done solo just by me \u00a0and out of my own pocket. I have long had plan to improve the network I have created but I always get held back by either 2 things, TIME \u0026amp; MONEY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s this reason that I have setup this patreon page. Dub Techno Blog has thousands of fans, and people visiting the blog every month. It\u0027s really great to see so many people love this music as much as me. I want to do more though, and with your donations I can start working towards that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will You Do With The Donations?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore regular content on the blog:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0By hiring a virtual assistant I can get more content on the blog. There is so much out there that I do not share, purely because I never find the time. I\u0027d like the blog to be THE place you go to to find the latest mixes and releases.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore exclusive content on the blog:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We have a huge following and with that I\u0027m sure we can get some exclusive content for our readers, be it free tracks or exclusive mixes. With the help of an assistant we will be contacting many artists and labels asking to work with us to give you all exclusive content.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive tracks for Patreons:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We want to reward those that contribute to us so we\u0027ll work with artists and labels to allow us to share commercial tracks for free to all patreons.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImprove the quality of our weekly shows:\u003c/strong\u003e Every week I work my butt off to find the newest, most amazing dub techno \u0026amp; deep house for you all to listen to and enjoy. It\u0027s great supporting so many artists and labels but I unfortunately never get to play half of the music because it is released on vinyl only.\u00a0I want the shows to showcase the best in dub techno so to do this I want to buy a record deck and a monthly batch of the finest dub techno vinyl. Once I play this vinyl I will give it away to the patreons who contribute in the vinyl owners category.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport Drift Deeper Recordings:\u003c/strong\u003e If we reach higher monthly contributions we will start working towards a vinyl releases on Drift Deeper Recordings. We also need to pay for mastering too.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp pay for the running costs of the network:\u003c/strong\u003e We use social media ads to promote releases (yes I promote other peoples releases for free for them at the moment), giveaways (rafflecopter has a monthly subscription of $50), maintain our email list (soon Mailchimp will start charging us), hosting ($10 per month), domains ($10 per year), soundcloud pro account ($10 per month) etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThere\u0027s more stuff but for now that\u0027s all I can think of. If you have any suggestions or questions feel free to message me, remember it\u0027s only $1 per month, that the price of a coffee and if you all contributed that it would make a huge difference to the dub techno blog network."
