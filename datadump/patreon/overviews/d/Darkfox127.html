    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Darkfox127 but my\nreal name is Richard. I\u0027m a modder of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and I\u0027ve been\naddicted to the Creation Kit since way back when Skyrim released in 2011. For\nover five years I have been creating YouTube videos covering how to mod the\ngame yourself and your own creativity into the world of Tamriel. Of course, I\nhave also released a selection of my mods over onthe Skyrim Nexus, which you can\nfind all the details of over on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my wide range of skills have grown in the modding community, I have branched out a little and started to run a community over on Discord and also started to live stream a lot of my modding. As you might imagine, running a website, managing a Discord server, live streaming on Twitch and juggling a bunch of other life stuff is quite a task. It takes a lot of time, and although I do it mostly from the passion of modding, I do put a lot more effort in than I really need to so that I can provide the best content to my followers possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, now to the reason I have started a Patreon page. Running all of this equipment to provide the best content I possibly can costs more money than if I just stuck to gaming and didn\u0027t bother modding at all. Aside from an increased electric bill, I\u0027m always having to maintain my equipment and I\u0027m always trying to upgrade where possible, so that I might improve my content further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what is Khajiit spending all of this coin on? It\u0027s going into utility bills for the most part but it also helps fuel the new website and pays for Spotify which provides the music in the live streams, helping keep us all sane while we fight the battle of modding. As I mentioned, I also want to continue to upgrade my equipment where possible so that I might branch out a little more on the YouTube side of things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo anything that people can spare each month to help push my content forward would be very much appreciated. I have also thrown some Skyrim themed Patreon rewards on here for those who help with that little bit extra.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks go out to all my patrons who have supported me so far, no matter how much you give, every little helps me out. I will also thank in advance any future patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRichard aka Darkfox127"
