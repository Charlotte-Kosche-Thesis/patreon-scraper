    "summary": "Deviant Children Productions is a New York based independent film company. Started in 2009, the goal was to produce high concept , original film and video content without the high budget (due in no small part to the fact that the current core team members are broke ...) Team DCP has produced a number of short films and one feature film, as well as music videos, dance videos, webseries, etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor 2017 we have set a new goal, to produce one new original short film every month. The catch, it has to be done in a 48 hour time period. We have scripts and concepts created in advanced, but production and post production must be done in a 2 day space before its release. As we like to think of it as \"Shoot Saturday, Edit Sunday, Out On Monday!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason for this is simple. We want to make sure that we are consistent with our content on when it comes out and at the same time, able to make it all work with our full time lives outside of filmmaking. By putting a time restriction on ourselves, it means no messing around forever in post, no mulling over reshoots or additional days, each project must be catered to work in a 48 hour production turnaround time. It sounds limiting but it actually is very freeing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help facilitate that momentum, directing duties for each project will alternate between our two directors, Nicholas Ortiz, creator of Deviant Children Productions and Peter Lawton of Chopstick Graffiti, a fellow independent filmmaker and good friend. Each will write, direct and edit on their month, with the other helping out as crew as well as producing BTS photos and video for that project. Regular updates will happen here as we roll on later in the year and goals and rewards could definitely expand as we grow our Patron fan base.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the End, 2017 is going to be our biggest and busiest year to date and we invite any and everyone to come along for the ride."

See as we move forward, its important that we begin to push ourselves on what we are capable of and expand our knowledge of the ever changing film gear landscape. Its important to use the right tool for the right job and by helping us gain access to those tools, we can then begin to push out more polished and professional work for your enjoyment.
