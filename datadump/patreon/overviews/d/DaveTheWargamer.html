It is a world filled\nwith marauding hordes of Orcs, imperial Elves, hardy Dwarves and mere Men, who\nare constantly warring against each other. Some will use their might to crush\ntheir foes, while some will use their cunning and others will wield devastating\nmagic or use war machines to destroy all who stand against them on the\nbattlefield.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://epicwargaming.com/Images/Imperial-Golden-Dragon.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 273px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eAnyway, back to why I\u0027m here; after many years of working part time on\nthis project I am up to Three Plains V2, but I am not too far away from\nreleasing the 3rd version of the game now. I have also created all the models\nand other aids you need for this game, which anyone can download for free and\nuse. Up to this point, I have financed Three Plains out of my own pocket, but things are getting a little tighter for me now...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe main costs are Ink, Paper, Card, Hosting and the big one is\nProofreading. The problem is I\u0027m dyslexic, so all of my written work needs to\nbe looked over, and I would love to have professionals do this for me, but all this\ncost money, which I cannot afford at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://epicwargaming.com/Images/Black-Land-Orcs-and-Trolls.JPG\" style=\"float: right; width: 360px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eAlso, if I got enough funding together I could outsource some of my workload and have other artists work alongside me, which would speed everything up greatly, and higher up the quality of the game too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is why I have decided to join Patreon, to make it easier for people to support me with the development of Three Plains. Any help given will be greatly appreciated and will enhance the game for everyone who wants to play it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for\nyour time\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDave\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo visit my site, Epicwargaming.com click\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://epicwargaming.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://epicwargaming.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
