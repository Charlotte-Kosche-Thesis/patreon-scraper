    "summary": "If you are simply following the Order 66 Podcast or one of the other great shows on the network, thank you for pledging to our merry little band of podcasters! We put out great content on a regular basis on a variety of topics from Anime to Star Wars and everything in between, and the podcasters love what they do! This campaign helps us build out the one thing we really need, which is great content in a blog style that allows for more people to use what we provide in their games. If we can fund high enough, we can even pay the content creators for their work and every article they write. Pledging at higher levels mean that your questions get moved up to the head of the line, when able, for Messages from the Edge, and there is even a level that allows you to be mentioned on the air during every show as a sponsor!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will continue to put out great podcasts, and we will begin writing up all the builds you hear Chris, Dave and Phil coming up with in their build-offs along with an archive of questions from Messages. This in addition to great articles and builds submitted by our contributors. We\u0027d love to send them a few bucks for writing, and you can help make that happen!"
