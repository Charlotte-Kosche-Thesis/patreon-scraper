It can\n also help the creators communicate more with their supporters. With my patreon I want to focus on making a comic book \nseries, WIPs (works in Progress) of my work. Like many others on this site art is my\npassion, its what i do everyday and I just want to have others\nenjoy my work and stories as much as I do. i am an inspired comic book artist that wants to bring her stories to life. THANK YOU so very much for your support and interested, I can\u0027t do it without you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtist Background:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello\neveryone, My name is Danita Sibert some of you my know me by the name\nBetaoftheBass. I have been drawings since I was 5 years old, me and\nmy older sister would draw characters like Pokemon, Spyro the dragon, Digimon\nand so many other characters from our childhood. I have always been\ninto video games and cartoons when I was younger I would watch them\nwith my father and older sister. Ever since I was a young girl I have\nalways had a dream to bring my characters and stories to life, so I went to a performing art school and majored in Visual Arts and graduate in 2011. It was\ngreat and a good way the learn the basics of drawing; Afterwards, I went to the Art Institute of Ohio and graduated in 2014 majoring in Media Arts and Animation. First wanting to making animations, but realizing that i love to draw the characters in illustrations and storyboards more than actually animating them. when i was a young girl i would always draw comics and i would have the time of my life making short stories for my favorite characters in cartoons and games. I decided that i want to work on making my stories into reality, which leads me to be working hard and relentlessly on my comic book series and trying to start a business with my older sister named: \"Cy-comix\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
