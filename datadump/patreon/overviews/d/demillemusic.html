    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eBased out of New York City, DeMille brings her charm and mystique to every performance. She\u0027s hard to miss, standing near six feet tall with bright purple hair, but her songs are her true identifier: poetic lyrics and soaring vocals infused with hints of blues \u0026amp; jazz. Reading like a diary, DeMille\u0027s tunes will send you to memory lane - whispering secrets in the back of a lounge, staring into the bottom of a coffee cup on a sleepless day, memorising the twists of your own body in a mirror. With two singles out and more music in the pipeline, you can catch DeMille on any major music platform or playing stages around NYC. Turn on a track and experience the world through violet-tinted glasses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eHello Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by. I\u0027m a New York based pop artist, heavily influenced by soul and jazz. I was born and raised in Austin, Texas, but moved to Liverpool, UK to get my degree at university. After achieving my BA in music, I relocated to Manhattan where I\u0027m currently teaching music lessons and playing around town with my band. We just finished recording our debut album and are so excited to share it with y\u0027all! In anticipation for all that goes into a great release, Patreon seemed like a great way to connect with those of you who want to show your support but can\u0027t make it to a show, or those want to be more involved with the ramp up to our first album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does we sound like? \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been compared to Amy Winehouse, KT Tunstall, Janis Joplin, Florence + the Machine, Haitus Kaiyote, Lorde and John Legend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen is the album being released?\u003cbr\u003eWe are still working out an exact date, but the full album should be out by Fall 2018. Singles will be released this summer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does your patronage go toward?\u003cbr\u003eLuckily, the album is done. Unfortunately, that\u0027s just the first step. Your patronage at the moment will be going toward making merchandise, creating great music videos and press campaigns. After the release, patreon will be helping out with getting us on the road to take the album on tour, where we can meet all of you and thank you in person for your patronage!\u003cbr\u003e"
