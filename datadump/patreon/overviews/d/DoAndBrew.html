    "summary": "Howdy folks - and - Welcome\nto my DO \u0026amp; BREW Patreon site! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks\nfor stopping by!  Navigating to my\nPatreon site indicates that 1. You enjoy my video tutorials and 2. You\u2019re\nconsidering supporting my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf your journey ends here\u2026thanks\nvery much for checking out my Patreon site and even considering supporting my\nchannel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope you continue to\nexplore the Do \u0026amp; Brew Patreon site and all the patron-only benefits\navailable to you as a Do \u0026amp; Brew patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy channel is about all\nthings home improvement \u0026amp; repair, woodworking projects \u0026amp; craft beer\nreviews!  I am having fun sharing my\nknowledge of 25+ years of home improvement and furniture building.  I really enjoy creating useful and decorative\nthings out of wood.\u00a0 Whether it be a step for\nthe little ones to brush their teeth, a decorative shelf, china cabinet or a\nroll top desk \u2013 I have made them all and more and they are/will be cherished\nfamily pieces for generations to come!  I\nreally believe that anyone can build a piece of furniture with just three\nthings in your tool belt:  1. Time, 2.\nTools, and 3. Patience.  Ensuring you are\nnot in a rush to complete your project is key\u2026having the right tools is very\nimportant \u2013 you WILL NOT be able to edge join wood that is cut with a circular\nsaw\u2026and having patience is paramount as you work through numerous intricate\njoinery steps.\u00a0 I have not completed any\nfurniture build videos as of yet because I have been focused on renovating our\nold house.  Much of what I have learned over\nthe past 25 years of carpentry work lends itself to fixing just about anything\nin the house.  I am finishing up on a\ncomplete gut and renovation of a kitchen and numerous bathroom projects.  Still to come is a master bedroom remodel (to\ninclude bath and \u2018dressing room\u2019), building a carpentry shop and extensive\noutdoor projects (retaining walls, drainage, decks, patios, pathways, exterior\nlighting, and a new \u2018ice-melt\u2019 driveway). \nSo, much more to come!\u00a0 My ultimate life\u2019s\nconstruction goal is to build a large Butt \u0026amp; Pass (4,000+ square feet) log\nhome completely by hand, the old fashion way - no kit build for me!\u00a0 Finally, if you have any\nhome improvement questions, please ask, I am happy to help any way I can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks very much for even considering supporting the Do \u0026amp; Brew channel\nhere on Patreon.  Please check out the Do\n\u0026amp; Brew patron benefits.\u003ch1\u003e\n\u003c/h1\u003e"
