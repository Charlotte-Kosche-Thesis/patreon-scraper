    "summary": "Hello, my name is Kevin Perjurer, and this is Defunctland. Defunctland is a video series published on YouTube that documents the history of extinct amusement park attractions. It is also a virtual reality preservation project that is in the early stages of development. Join me and the Defunctland community as we research, discuss, and preserve yesterday\u0027s creativity, today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI told myself that I would create a Patreon only if I made it to 10,000 subscribers, a goal that I never thought I would reach. However, thanks to all of you, here we are. I am not ignorant to the fact that you are not here for me. You are here because we all share a deep interest in amusement park history and preservation. We all understand the time and creative effort that went into creating our favorite attractions and rides, and unlike other mediums of art (film, music, etc.), when an attraction closes, it is difficult to experience again. Defunctland is both a love letter to forgotten creativity and an attempt to preserve it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have some extra cash, donating to this Patreon would be extremely helpful to me so that I can continue to focus on the series and produce videos more regularly. Thank you!"

I am always focusing on my next project, and currently, that project is Defunctland. Defunctland is an amusement park that I am attempting to create by utilizing popular or infamous extinct attractions from amusement parks around the world. I try to resurrect these in two ways: historical videos uploaded to my YouTube channel and an eventual virtual reality recreations.
