But we do seem to be doing one thing that nobody else is -- creating videos about creating videos, reviewing equipment, and just generally acting as a knowledge resource for people in the video production industry, especially the budget segment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile most people on Patreon use this service as a way to help fund their business, DJP is mainly looking to use it as a way to cover the costs of our YouTube videos.\u00a0 I, as the owner of DJP, don\u0027t intend for this to be a source of income for myself. Just a way to make better videos for you, the viewers.\u00a0 But, if this little project is successful and it starts taking up a significant part of my time I may start drawing on the funds to cover my time.\u00a0 We\u0027ll just have to see how it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to see more videos featuring how-tos, behind the scenes, and product reviews, please join me by signing up to help fund the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e-Doug Johnson, Owner"
