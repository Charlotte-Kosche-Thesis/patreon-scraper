    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003eSo, a bit about me. Currently, I work full time in tech support, have done for years now. Unfortunately as a creative person (and an introvert), sitting in a block and answering phone calls all day tends to leave me brain dead and exhausted (something which I\u0027m sure everyone stuck in a job they don\u0027t like has experienced), and after eight odd years I\u0027m finally stick of it (and my girlfriend doesn\u0027t exactly like me turning into a zombie each week either).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve made the decision to start working towards making a job out of what I enjoy and am passionate about which in my case is Silk paintings, and a Patreon campaign seems like a great way to get that started. \u003cbr\u003eThe hope is that\u00a0in the future I\u0027ll be able to make a living doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the heck is Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThink of it like Kickstarter but with a much smaller buy-in and it\u0027s for ongoing projects rather than one big thing, it\u0027s a way that I can get some support (and incentive!) to keep making pretty things for all of you out there to see, and in exchange I\u0027ll add more art into the world, and post some tidbits, tips, making-ofs and such for my Patrons to see.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also be able to send me messages and queries, like \"hey, I have no clue how you\u0027re doing XYZ, can you post up some close ups from your next project?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge whatever you like, even a couple of dollars, and every time I complete a new project (and upload it here for all to see) that money will be charged from your account and go towards my next project!\u003cbr\u003eObviously you can cease at any time, put a maximum amount per month, all that type of thing\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do:\u003c/strong\u003e I do paintings using watercolour dyes on white silk sheeting. Setting up the silk and frame can be quite time consuming, and due to the medium if you stuff something up you either put up with it, figure out a way to incorporate the stuff up into the design, or you start again (there\u0027s no \"I\u0027ll go over this in another colour\" with silk once the dye hits the silk it\u0027s there to stay!) but it\u0027s well worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a fantastic medium for making things like medieval style banners, perfect for big bold colours, and lightweight silk flutters in the slightest breeze. I\u0027ve also made things more suited to just hanging up on a wall at home like you would a regular painting (it also works great for stained-glass type effects).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also started doing a bit of resin casting, and anything that I put up about that will be free extras for my Patrons to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you take commissions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I sure do! If you\u0027ve ever gone \"You know, I\u0027d love a big banner fluttering in the wind in my front yard\", or if you look at one of my images and go \"Wow, that would look amazing on my wall!\" then feel free to send me a message and we can discuss it.\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry about where you are in the world,\u00a0silk folds up so tiny that even a 1m by 2m super-banner folds up into a ziplock sandwich bag.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat next? \u003c/strong\u003eClick the \"Creations\" link at the top of the big picture above this and take a look at my stuff :D"
