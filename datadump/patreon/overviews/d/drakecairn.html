    "summary": "My new site is up.\u00a0 Please visit me at \u003ca href=\"https://drakecairn.com\"\u003edrakecairn.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Forest (currently under spontaneous growth).\u00a0 I am glad that you came, and I sincerely hope that you will stay awhile.\u00a0 Links to posts and book chapters can be found by clicking on \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/drakecairn/posts\"\u003eposts\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 My main focus here is telling you about this very special forest that is in a world not unlike this one. I\u0027ve only recently come in contact with this magical place, and am familiarizing myself with its nature, revealing to you the things that it has revealed to me.\u00a0 This will be quite a journey, I assure you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not a published author of fiction.\u00a0 That publishing business has always annoyed me a little bit, and it seems like the internet ought to be able to enhance the experience of both authors and readers in a way that is substantially more interesting to me, and I hope to you.\u00a0 I am a physicist, as well as an engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur, but that is my day job and probably not my lifelong calling.\u00a0 I have published many works, but those are restricted to scientific papers and patents that I, or the company I work for, literally have to pay someone else to publish, and then count on someone else paying others to read those works.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eBut here, I write from, and about, The Forest.\u00a0 I also hope to provide video readings of many of the writings and topics that I post here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes when I write from The Forest, I will explore certain ideas in prose form.\u00a0 While these may generally be in the form of social commentary on the present age of man, I assure you that I am completely and utterly incapable of discussing anything so irrelevant as politics (The faeries would hardly allows such from the beauty of the Forest). Nonetheless, I will still have the opportunity to explore serious topics from a viewpoint that puts the indomitable human spirit in its proper place in the creative evolution of man.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally envisioned the story of The Forest as an animated production or a graphic novel, but the story can\u0027t wait for me to assemble a team of visual artists, so I am putting it together in a narrative form as well.\u00a0 This site is starting from the beginning, and will grow with the story.\u00a0 I know something of the mind of present day man, and I know something of the force that is revealing this story to me.\u00a0 I am pretty sure that those two want to meet, and I do not seek to stand in their way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am on Patreon to seek patronage, to seek those who desire to support me as an artist so that I can create art.\u00a0 I will use all funds for the specific purpose of generating more hours in my days for me to write.\u00a0 While this has some limitations, at least until I reach a certain mark whereby I can take a quantum leap to 100%, I do know that any support whatsoever will help me to bring more of my writing into existence.\u00a0 I also have other big dreams, such as working with graphic artists to turn The Forest in to a graphic novel and/or an animated production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so very much for joining me, and your support is greatly appreciated.\u00a0 I recognize that there is no interaction between living beings that is by chance, and so I could never consider others as mere consumers of information that I generate.\u00a0 This is a personal interaction, and when you read or hear about the Forest, it will be Your Forest.\u00a0 Don\u0027t forget to bring your darkness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
