    "summary": "I was born and raised in the Bronx, NY. I grew up around a creative family and remember watching my dad act in theatre and my mother paint at home. Though growing up was not easy, I was grateful to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology and graduated with a degree in Advertising and Marketing. While in college I was inspired to get into photography and invested in my first camera. A friend had suggested that I try it out. After years of hard work and dedication to this art I have become an internationally published photographer. Along with actively creating and shooting personal series some of the companies I have shot for include Nike, Adidas, LG, BeTerrific and various non-profit organizations. I am excited to see how my career continues to evolve and hope to transition more into videography and directing. One of my main motivations in continuing to pursue my career photography and film is the ability it gives me to meet new people and to constantly challenge myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Currently there are several things that are holding me back and preventing me from stepping up my work to the next level-- this is mainly due to lack of funding to produce shoots for my personal series, money for framing and gallery spaces for group and solo shows, new equipment (new computer, hard drives, film), material to build new sets, etc. By supporting my patreon you will have the ability to help me in pushing my career to the level I strive for. I am really looking forward to this journey and hope this allows for further opportunities to open up for me. I have been shooting for 7 years and really want to ability to share my work and progress forward into my dreams of directing and producing short films and features. At the moment there are 3 series I am working on that I do not have the funding to produce as quickly as I would like to. This is due to my need to put time into my paid work that is sometimes not as soul fulfilling as my personal artistic endeavors that I dream of. I appreciate your time and any support that you could offer me. Hopefully my rewards keep you happy and allow for a more personal interaction with me and my work. Thank you again.\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eDavid Zayas Jr."
