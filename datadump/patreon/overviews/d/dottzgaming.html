    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for visiting my Patreon! \u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Dottz Gaming, and I am a Twitch Affiliate \u0026amp; YouTube content creator, streamer, and partner. \u00a0The content on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dottzgaming.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/dottzgaming\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e is mainly for the Elder Scrolls Online by Zenimax Online Studios. \u00a0Your support is greatly appreciated and moves me closer to maybe one day making this more than just a hobby. If you have any questions about how this works, please take a look at the \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\"\u003ePatreon FAQ\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0The most common question people ask though is \"When will I be charged?\". \u00a0You will be charged on the 1st of every month, and it usually takes about 72 hours for the payment to process. \u00a0You will then receive an email that will tell you if your payment was successfully processed or declined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eMy YouTube channel\u2019s journey started as a World of Warcraft PvP channel in June of 2014. At the end of 2016, I decided to call it quits though and was searching for a new game. Unsure of what game to play or what to do with my channel that had only a little over 2k subscribers at the time, I ended up deciding to play the Elder Scrolls Online in January 2017 and have been having a blast. When I first started ESO, I decided to make beginner content; my line of reasoning was that since I was a beginner, I\u2019ll just teach people things as I learn them. Little did I know that this one decision would be what ignited the rapid growth of my YouTube channel. Since switching to ESO, I\u2019ve had the amazing opportunity to play with and become friends with some of the biggest content-creators for the game, become sponsored/backed by Zenimax, and even featured on Zenimax\u0027s community guides page about a half a dozen times!\u00a0I am continually making new beginner and intermediate guides, as well as keeping my old ones updated, streaming, making PvP montages and working towards becoming a well-known PvP player (lofty goal, but one that I have). I am so excited to see what the future holds for myself as a gamer in ESO as well as a content creator and streamer on YouTube!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I pledge? \u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a great way to support the channel if you want to go above and beyond just watching the videos and streams.\u00a0 I know my Patreon does not appear to offer as much as other creators\u0027, but that is because I don\u0027t gate interaction with me behind a paywall like other creators do (nothing against them for that, it is just not how I like to operate). I interact in voice communications with everyone, answer everyone\u0027s DMs and comments, and allow everyone to join my Discord server.\u00a0 With that being said, a pledge here on Patreon shows you want to be involved in the channel. Patron\u0027s are the first people I got to when making a big change on the channel, am looking for new ideas, fleshing out builds, etc.\u00a0 You, as a Patron, will have more access to me outside of the stream than anyone else, and you will have a voice on how the channel grows and progresses.\u00a0 You also will get much more in-depth help from me if it comes to lengthy questions like personal build assistance, in-game help if you\u0027re on PC NA, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShould I be a Patron or a Twitch Subscriber?\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eA Twitch Subscription\u00a0is an alternative to Patreon to support the channel monetarily monthly. \u00a0Patrons earn rewards such as being given a special rank in discord, and a greater access to myself in helping you throughout your ESO journey. \u00a0Twitch Subscriptions will unlock for you custom emotes, a badge next to your name in stream chat, 2x multiplier on giveaway entries and a special rank in discord. \u00a0The way I explain it the best is that Patreon gives you more access to me outside of streams (being involved in the brainstorming process and backend, more in-depth help, etc.), while being a subscriber gives you more perks inside of stream (due to all the chat-based bonuses). \u00a0Both forms of support are \u003cem\u003egreatly appreciated \u003c/em\u003ebut never required. If you decide that being a Twitch Subscriber is more of what you\u0027re looking for, you can click\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/products/dottzgaming/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
