    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello! My name is Dreamy Star, and I\u0027m the sole full-time member of Dream Syrup Games, formerly ComicSans Games. I\u0027m a 29-year-old hopeful video game maker and artist.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I was a child, I\u0027d adored video games and role playing games of all genres, and it\u0027s been a dream of mine to actively make, primarily, video games. I\u0027ve attended school for video game design, and the short time I was able to spend with that school cemented my love of creating video games. Sadly though, I lack the funds and time to actually make a game completely from scratch since I\u0027m balancing a job, bills, and student loan debt while also supporting me and my spouse. As it stands, my job hours are inconsistent, so almost all of my money goes to supporting my spouse and I, rent, and student loan debt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s why I\u0027m here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to bring \u003cstrong\u003ecreative, inclusive, and new ideas to life\u003c/strong\u003e, and I need your help to do it in a way that will make both me the creator, and you the player, happy with the product.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find all of my games on Itch.io, so if you would like to see the kind of games I make,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dreamsyrup.itch.io\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echeck it out\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy what you see, and would like to see what I can do with proper funding to back it, then any little bit would help to make my goal of creating video games for both all of you and myself a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a note, this will not be a monthly pledge. As game development, especially solo game development, takes time, I feel it would be wrong to ask people to pledge on good faith alone. So it will be based on \u003cstrong\u003edetailed progress reports. \u003c/strong\u003eWhat this means is I will attempt at least once a month to post a detailed progress report on my current game projects - which includes screenshots, possibly sketches, word counts, and problems I\u0027ve run into and such. \u003cstrong\u003eBut, just because I will try to post one once a month doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ll be able to\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome months, I may not have anything to show, and \u003cstrong\u003eposts about that will be free to patrons and won\u0027t result in any of you getting charged\u003c/strong\u003e for just standard updates. But this also means that I may post \u003cstrong\u003emore than one detailed progress report a month \u003c/strong\u003eat times too. So please set a pledge cap if you don\u0027t wish to be charged for more than once or twice a month.\u00a0"
