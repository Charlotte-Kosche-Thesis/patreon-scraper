    "summary": "Greetings and Salutations. I\u0027m Derrick Ferguson. But of course you know that already. What you want to know is what I\u0027m doing here on Patreon and why you should give up your hard earned money and put it in my pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, first off I\u0027m taking it as a given that you\u0027ve some familiarity with me and my work be it through my novels and/or my stories in various anthologies which you can find at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Derrick-Ferguson/e/B002QJZQHU/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1502495079\u0026amp;sr=1-2-ent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon.com\u003c/a\u003e Or maybe you heard me as a guest on a podcast or you were a regular listener of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://betterinthedark.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Better In The Dark\"\u003c/a\u003e the podcast I co-hosted for a goodly number of years. Or maybe you\u0027ve read my movie reviews over\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://derricklferguson.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Ferguson Theater\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt really don\u0027t matter how you got here. The point is you are and I hope to keep you coming back by means of giving you content well in advance of the hoi polloi. There will be a Dillon serial running constantly. Soon as I finish one, another will start a month or two later. So if you\u0027re a Dillon fan you\u0027ll get to read a brand new adventure a year ahead of everybody else. Nifty, right?\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be dropping in short stories and novellas that for one reason or another haven\u0027t been seen for a while in print or I\u0027ve been hiding away in my files for one reason or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what AM I doing with the money you\u0027re donating? I\u0027d actually like to get back into podcasting but on a more professional level. So I\u0027m socking the money away while I get educated on equipment, editing, the technical stuff I was too lazy to learn about before. So that\u0027s something on the horizon you can look forward to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut by all means, whatever you\u0027d like to see from me here, do not hesitate to let me know. The bottom line to all of this is communication and the more you let me know what you want, the more I can give you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, that\u0027s it. Thank you for your time and patience and as always, God Bless."

     "about": "Derrick Ferguson was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY and has\nlived there for most of his life. He worked security for many years at a\nvarious establishments before retiring to take care of his health and dedicate\nhis life to his true passion: writing and sharing exciting stories.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing as long as I can remember. Usually I\nwould simply rewrite stories I read in comic books or saw in cartoons on TV. My\nfirst crack at true creative innovation came from when I was possessed with an\ninexplicable obsession with MAD Magazine\u2019s \u201cSpy vs. Spy.\u201d I filled up whole\nspiral notebooks writing two and three page stories about them,\u201d Derrick said.\n\u201cFrom then on I just went on writing whatever struck my fancy. I was writing\nfan fiction before I even knew what fan fiction was as I wrote stories about my\nfavorite superheroes.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDerrick wrote mostly for the Star Trek and Marvel/DC fan\nfiction communities and for his own personal enjoyment throughout the \u201980s and\n\u201990s. During this time he submitted a fair amount of manuscripts to various\npublishers who \u201csent them back just as fast as [he] sent them out.\u201d New\nopportunities came about, however, with the advent of the internet. Derrick and\nseveral of his fellow fanfiction writers joined together to create Frontier\nPublishing, a fiction website devoted to publishing serialized novels. The site\nran several serials, including Derrick\u2019s own novel Dillon and the Voice of\nOdin.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnfortunately, Frontier Publishing had to close up shop\nafter a couple of years, and that may have been the end for Derrick\u2019s writing\ncareer and his now-beloved character Dillon if Derrick\u2019s friend and fellow\nwriter Russ Anderson hadn\u2019t cajoled him into sending the completed serial off\nto a publishing house for one last shot at getting his writing into print.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cIf anybody has read and enjoyed my Dillon stories then they\nshould go right now and send Russ a thank you email. If I\u2019m Dillon\u2019s daddy then\nRuss is his granddaddy,\u201d Derrick said. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Russ kicking me\nin the ass and throwing considerable support behind me to get that book\npublished, you probably wouldn\u2019t be reading Dillon adventures today.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks to Russ, \u003cstrong\u003eDillon\nand the Voice of Odin\u003c/strong\u003e was finally published in 2003 in paperback\u2014or \u201cdead\ntree format\u201d as Derrick facetiously calls it\u2014, Derrick\u2019s professional writing\ncareer began in earnest, and over the years publishing houses such as Pulpwork\nPress, Airship 27 and Pro Se has been graced with a number of thrilling tales\nof Dillon\u2019s adventures as well as many other great works of new pulp.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLike any great writer, Derrick is a voracious reader, and it\nwas quite difficult for him to narrow down the list of writers who have\ninfluenced him over the years. \u201cThat would be a really long list if I had to\nname all the writers who have influenced me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll just give you\nThe Dirty Dozen of the writers I love the most and who I feel have influenced\nme the most: Robert E. Howard. Chester Himes. Roger Zelazny. Ishmael Reed. Mike\nResnick. Jim Steranko. Ian Fleming. Larry McMurtry. Robert R. McCammon. Lester\nDent. Charles Saunders. George C. Chesbro.\u201d With a literary pedigree like that,\nit\u2019s little wonder he\u2019s made such a mark in the world of new pulp!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut awards and hyperbolic praise not what drive Derrick in\nhis career as a writer. \u201cI like telling stories,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is no deeper\nthan that. For some reason God gave me the gift of making up outrageous stories\nand the ability to communicate them in an entertaining manner through prose . .\n. What do I hope to achieve? That my stories can entertain and maybe make\nsomebody\u2019s day a little easier and maybe make them forget their troubles for a\ncouple of hours.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",
