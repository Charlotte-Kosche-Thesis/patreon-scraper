Begun in 2012, the project has attracted a loyal following by regularly posting in-depth articles and videos, the latter of which are regularly featured on some of the highest-profile film and media outlets in the world.  THE DIRECTOR SERIES has been cited by Indiewire as a \u201csignificant contribution to film scholarship\u201d, and boasts a regular readership of over 1100 and over 200,000 cumulative video views.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-- WHO AM I? --\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMy name is Cameron Beyl, and I\u2019m a filmmaker based out of Los Angeles.  My original shorts and features have won awards at several film festivals.  I\u2019m a graduate of Emerson College\u2019s film program and a native of Portland, OR.  In 2013, I co-founded a collective of digital media artists and like-minded filmmakers named Raccord. \u00a0I single-handedly generate all the content for The Directors Series-- writing the text essays in addition to narrating and editing the videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI initially began The Directors Series as a way to help me organize my thoughts and insights after watching a given director\u2019s entire output in chronological order.  The project has grown over the years to become something much, much more involving and creatively fulfilling than I ever could have known, and has attracted a following that I never could have imagined.  When the videos started getting exposure on prominent websites like Indiewire, Vice Creators Project, No Film School, Slate, and SlashFilm, I began to realize that I had somehow tapped into a collective hind mind of cinephiles hungry to see their favorite films in a new light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, I\u2019ve studied the works and careers of filmmakers like Terrence Malick, Michael Mann, Stanley Kubrick, Noah Baumbach, James Gray, Tony Scott, and PT Anderson...amidst many others.  My aim is to cover the greats, as well as the many who have contributed to the art of cinema in a significant way.  Along the way, I also hope to shed a little light on the underexposed filmmakers and lesser-known voices.  I believe that, as filmmakers, we benefit greatly from studying the artists who came before us... even the bad ones.  In an age where movies are dominated by over-commercialized blockbusters and compound franchises, it\u2019s more important than ever to preserve our cinematic heritage and the wide variety of artistic voices that comprise it.  While my essays and videos tend to be fairly comprehensive, by no means are they meant to be a definitive look at a director\u2019s work-- art, after all, is subjective and the only viewpoint I can bring to the table is my own.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-- WHAT GOES INTO MAKING A SINGLE VIDEO? --\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSimply put, a lot.  My text essays serve as the foundation on which I map out the videos, but a fair amount of time is spent cleaning them up and updating them with new information.  I aim to use the best available video quality for each of a given director\u2019s works, which means a fair amount of effort is spent tracking those elements down.  Each video takes an average of 15-20 hours to edit together. Because I work a full-time job on top of all this, that time is currently spread out over several nights and weekends, which means that I post a new video on average about once a month.  I\u2019d love to increase the frequency of my output, just as I imagine the project\u2019s supporters hate to see a month pass between installments.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-- WHY START A PATREON? --\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe Directors Series was always intended to be a free resource, available to anyone and everyone.  As the project has grown, it has required me to invest more of my time and resources in an effort to adhere to a consistent posting schedule.  I like to joke that The Directors Series owns me now, but that\u2019s really just a reflection of the outpouring of encouragement I\u2019ve received as the series has evolved.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Patreon sponsorship would not only afford me more resources and time to release new video essays more frequently, it would allow me to connect directly with you in dialogue while also enabling me with the means to better reward you for your support.  My ultimate goal is to create an expansive chronicle of cinema\u2019s most important voices while providing aspiring filmmakers with a variety of career templates they can consider while forging their own paths.  As such, your support is an invaluable contribution towards achieving that end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-- THANK YOU! --\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
