I\u0027ve just always been fascinated by the idea of what might be, and what might have been. I\u0027m an amateur writer right now, and I\u0027m looking to get my work out there by releasing it online, chapter by chapter. Because I have some acting experience, I thought an audiobook delivered as a free, weekly podcast would be the most fun way to see my work get out into the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy setup is pretty small now. I\u0027m currently working with a borrowed microphone, a 4+ year old laptop, and a cracked smartphone. I don\u0027t have access to a recording studio, so I just nailed blankets to the wall of my closet for soundproofing.Just about the only thing I have on lock is the writing itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron, you will have the opportunity to see and hear advance writing samples before they go up, get creator blogs about the writing and recording process, as well as whatever other weird stuff I have lying around.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to working with you. Thank you!"
