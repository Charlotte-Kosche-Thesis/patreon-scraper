Thanks for stopping by. Real quick in case you don\u0027t know... Patreon is a way for you (the public) to support content creators. There are are over 50,000 of them here so be sure to look around and check them out. There are probably other things you may like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow... why I am here? I believe radio is broken. The DJ no longer gets to play what they feel is good music. The stations decide based on advertising and promotions what they play. That\u0027s why you will hear the same song at the same time of day on multiple stations. Not to mention the fact that you will hear the same 10 songs over and over again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat leads into my other problem. We are not holding the artist accountable to make good music any more! We can debate \"art for the sake of art\" in future posts and conversations. This is a place where I can explore and share, in my humble opinion, what I think is great music and great mixing\u00a0and you get to enjoy all of these mixes right here. You can even download them if thats what your into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow... What will I be doing? I promise you this... every week I will be doing several different mixes, different styles and genres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHip Hop\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEDM\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThrowback Thursdays\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOpen Format\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMainstream\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eETC...\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAlong the way you guys can toss me ideas and feedback.
