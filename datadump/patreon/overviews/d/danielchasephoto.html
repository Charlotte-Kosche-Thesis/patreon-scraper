What I post on Patreon is my art. I have always believed that art should be shared and is not only for the wealthy. I shared an image daily on my\u00a0Instagram account with my 94,000+ friends and followers until Instagram deleted my account! I invite you to follow along on my journey with my new\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/exposuresbydaniel_v2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram Account\u003c/a\u003e as well as here. For every print I have sold, I have probably given away two. I shoot art nudes for magazines, for every image they print, 6 or 10 are never seen, often quite a bit more, sometimes the ones that are not seen are some of the best. I plan to share these full sets on Patreon along with a lot of new never before seen work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cThe human body is the best work of art.\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003ca href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2980674.Jess_C_Scott\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJess C.

I work with professional models, Dancers, gymnast and the girl next door. I don\u0027t pay my models, I can\u0027t at this point, although they certainly deserve it, they pose for me for the sake of creating art with their bodies. My style tends to change with what I\u0027m feeling at the moment, it may be about shape and form, shadows and light, or emotive, I love a strong narrative, I want my work to evoke a feeling. Sometime it may be more innocent and soft, sometimes it may be more erotic, sometimes it may be more dark or whimsical, but I always consider it art. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cPhotography to the amateur is recreation, to the professional it is work, and hard work too, no matter how pleasurable it may be.\u201d \u2013 Edward Weston\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do, but as Edward Weston quoted above, it\u0027s work and hard work at that! I want to thank all of my patreon supporters! Your support means the world to me and words just can\u0027t describe it! I never thought I would ever be close to 100,000 followers on Instagram, but now that goal will never happen. Again, thank you for your suport! - Daniel"
