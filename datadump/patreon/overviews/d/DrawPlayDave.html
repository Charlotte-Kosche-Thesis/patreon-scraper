    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Dave Rappoccio, better known on most internet circles as\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DrawPlayDave\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e DrawPlayDave\u003c/a\u003e. I\u2019m the guy behind the Draw Play comic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thedrawplay.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Draw Play\u003c/a\u003e is a webcomic/blog site of my own dedicated to making fun of football. It updates 3 times per week and also features a lot of other work. It\u2019s by a football fan, for other football fans, and it\u2019s dedicated to making sure football isn\u2019t taken too seriously. It\u2019s a silly game, and it deserves to get lovingly mocked at all times. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe DP started out as a few comics done for an internet forum and in 4 years has blossomed into something I never thought possible, and I want nothing more than to keep it going, but I\u2019ve reached a point where if I want to keep it going and make it better I need some help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe DP is a one man labor of love. I made it, I run it, I update it, I panic when things go wrong, and I\u2019m surprised I\u2019ve managed to keep it as stable as I have. It\u2019s a hobby that I\u2019d like to make more than a hobby, but I can only do so much, and if the DP is going to continue to improve there are some things that I simply haven\u2019t had the funds to accomplish. So if you become a Patreon, what will I use that extra help for? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-A web designer. to spruce up the site and create a working mobile version. I\u2019m not a web designer. I\u2019ve learned what I could in the past few years but I simply don\u2019t have the time to give it the study it needs, and I\u2019d like to be able to hire someone to come in, fix the site\u2019s bugs, streamline it a bit, make it prettier, and most importantly, create a good mobile version. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Upgrade my servers. The DP runs right now on the cheapest servers I can afford and things get bogged down and run slower than I want. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Better equipment. My wacom tablet is \u003cdel\u003e7 years old \u003c/del\u003eDEAD. My monitor is 8 years old and has also started to act funny. My computer is about 5 years old now and has started to finally be a little dated, and I could use a new graphics card and more power to handle larger photoshop files.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-A podcast! I hope to have a podcast up and running soon, but I currently have a very cheap mic and limited audio programs to work with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Get a store going. I\u2019ve wanted to get a store going for so long and I want to do it right. I\u2019d like to know what my readers would like to see me make, what they would wear/use/burn in effigy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Update and post more. Right now 3 comics a week is manageable, but it\u2019s about the extent of what I can afford to dedicate my time to. If you guys can make things a little easier for me, I can make more content for you and put more time into making the DP the best bad football pun delivery system on the web. Updating 5 times a week? Maybe. Branching out into college and other sports? Possibly. Bringing on some more content creators to give some variety? Hey, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Living. I have to eat and live somewhere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe DP has room to grow, but if it\u2019s ever going to reach that potential I need your help. I\u2019ve been doing this for 4 years at the expense of most of my free time and even occasionally my health, and I hope that in those 4 years I\u2019ve earned your trust. I\u2019ve missed updates fewer times than JPP has fingers. I love what I\u2019m doing here, and I want to keep doing it more than anything else. I\u0027m not quite sure yet what my special Patreon only- rewards will be, but be sure I\u0027ll have something for you. Even if you donate just a little bit, know that you\u0027ll have my eternal gratitude. Without the fans, TDP is nothing."
