    "summary": "Hi guys, welcome to our Patreon page. This is the part where we are supposed to \"sell\" our podcast to the masses with the hope of getting support from the world of Patreons, so we can continue to share the work that we love doing, and most importantly make more of it, more frequently. Only, how do you adequately \"sell\" what we do? Personally, I don\u0027t think you can. You either dig it, or you don\u0027t. We don\u0027t cater for the mainstream. We make a deliberate effort to cover the fringes of cinema, the weird and wonderful, the obscene, the sublime, and sometimes utterly bizarre. We are certainly aiming for a niche market. And so, as I write this, on behalf of myself, Kat Ellinger and my co-host Samm Deighan, I am going to assume you found this page because you know us and I am already preaching to the converted. And, if by some chance you just stumbled here by accident and quite like the idea of two women freely celebrating outland cinema, as well as the pleasures of the artistic bush shot, whilst making the odd threat of violence, then please check us out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo instead of doing some naff sale pitch, which I suck at anyway, I want to write this as a personal note to anyone who has enjoyed our podcasts and supported the work that we do. First off, I don\u0027t come here with any expectation, and if you can\u0027t afford to become a Patreon that\u0027s totally fine with us, we understand, there are plenty of other ways to support us. However, and here\u0027s the sell so to speak, we really want to take Daughters of Darkness to the next level, to build on what we\u0027ve already achieved and to grow the podcast into a community we can all be proud of. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we mentioned on our most recent episode (at the time of writing this), we have had to take a hiatus for several months. This has made us truly miserable, and from the feedback we are getting on social media we get that some of you share our pain. But the kicker is, with me freelancing full time and Samm having to work full-time and study, our beloved podcast has just had to take a backseat. Each episode takes hours of preparation and we just haven\u0027t had the time when there are more pressing things calling us away, like rent to pay. So here is how you can help us to make more of the things we love, and what we can offer you in return: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of any level you pledge we are creating a special Facebook group for all Patreons. In the group you will be able to get all the inside chat, help us decide on topics to cover, and vote on themes. We also want to have an \"ask us anything section\", where you can give us a question and we will answer it either in a Patreon only blog post or live on one of our episodes where possible. We will select a couple of these every month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing we are most excited about is a new item, separate from the main podcast, called the Daughters of Darkness Book Club. Although these special, shorter, episodes will be made available to everyone, our Patreons will be able to join us in reading along and will get all the details in the aforementioned group, long before we record. If you aren\u0027t on Facebook then we are more than happy to send out separate emails on all the important stuff so you can stay involved (just shoot us an email to request). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have set our funding to charge per \"thing\" but promise not to bill you more than once a month (that\u0027s just so if we have to skip a month, you won\u0027t be charged). Our main aim is to get back to recording a main episode at LEAST every month, and if things go well, possibly more, as well as our additional literary based special episodes. We will also be making all episodes available to Patreons five days before they hit public circulation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you can get involved, please do. We are itching to build this into something massive, and with your help we can. \u003cbr\u003e-- \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
