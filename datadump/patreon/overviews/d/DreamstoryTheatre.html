The work involved with creating one has increasingly become more intricate over time, as the production values have increased. It\u0027s my ultimate goal to make a living off creating these unique audiobooks, while being able to invest into making the audiobooks better. In addition, I have monthly costs, I have a SoundCloud to pay each month, 3 adobe creative cloud subscriptions, a Soundly subscription, as well as sound effects, which can be very expensive, I have already spent thousands of dollars expanding my SFX library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat makes your content so special?
