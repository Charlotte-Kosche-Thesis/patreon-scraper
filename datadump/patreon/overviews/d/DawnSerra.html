    "summary": "As a sex educator, sexpert, and sex \u0026amp; relationship coach, I spend most of my time helping people navigate the complicated terrain of sex, love, self-acceptance, emotional intelligence, kink, and communication with loved ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal as an educator and coach is not to have as few clients as possible paying ultra-premium prices, but instead, to reach as many folks as I possibly can at a variety of affordable price points so that we can all feel more connected, seen, desired, valued, and understood - especially when it comes to the tough stuff like sex and desire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date, my weekly podcast has been a labor of love, and it\u0027s reached almost 700,000 downloads (as of July 2016). I also blog for the podcast and my coaching site (though not as consistently as I\u0027d like).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been trying to figure out how to connect with more of you - to create super safe spaces where we can all talk about sex in a non-sexual way, let go of our guilt and shame, learn how to honor our needs and desires while respecting the people we care about, and do it in a way that is as accessible as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to change the world at a global level and help everyone level-up in love and in life, but that takes money and support from folks like you who value a world based on inclusion, acceptance, sex positivity, body positivity, social justice, and love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support not only helps me create more content, but it also gets you access to more advice and support for your own relationships and sexual journeys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to learn more about me?
