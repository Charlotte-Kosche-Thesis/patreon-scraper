    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eTube electronics and DIY projects are the most important part of my spare time. Six years ago I started with almost no electronics knowledge and dived straight into the guitar tube amplifier world. Most of the things I\u0027ve learned so far came from youtube videos and old electronics books and magazines. I\u0027ve realized that the most important thing in this hobby is to simply start doing the things that you can at this very moment! Without fancy tools or materials, expensive parts and infinite knowledge and engineering skills, you can still create exremely simple, yet effective and powerful devices that can boost your confidence. There is something in this hobby that never stops - frustration! Be it from the lack of money, parts, building failures and unrecoverable projects and destroyed parts... or dislikes from people and\u00a0negative attitude. There will always be something to discourage you on your tube path for higher wattage! But if you love it as much as I do, you will never be able to stop. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 By building and failing over and over, I\u0027ve gained valuable experience and reached the point in my hobby which I\u0027d thought would never even be possible. Sure, I still lack a ton of knowledge and probably there are loads of things I don\u0027t do perfectly or even properly. But still, I believe I have enough practical knowledge to make great projects happen and expand my knowledge and learn from my mistakes. When I first started I had ZERO tools (and the equal amount of know-how) and I had my poor friend coming to my house with his suitcase full of tools just to solder two wires for me. (yep, it was that bad!) During the past several years of countless youtube electronics videos, books and articles and many unsuccessful attempts, I\u0027ve manged to come to a point where I\u0027ve successfully built replicas of several boutique guitar amplifiers, managed to wind my own power and output transformers and chokes, solder countless hand made eyelet and pcb boards, made custom wooden cabinets and upholstered them with tweed and tolex and many other similar stuff. Become my patron and help me create useful, helpful and fun projects and videos that will help you start from scratch and expand your tube building, soldering, woodworking and many other exciting skills. Support me on my journey to make more affordable than ever guitar amplifiers, effects and tube audio recording preamplifiers, tube EQs, compressors and many other devices, and experiment and explore the world of electronics, music and sound. For the less than a coffee per month you can support me and enjoy and share the experience of building electronics projects from scratch so that you can follow the videos with no previous knowledge and in detail explanations of every aspect of the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
