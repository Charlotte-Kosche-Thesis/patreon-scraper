I\u0027ve always enjoyed fascinations and venturing into the surreal. As an avid gamer and sci-fi movie-goer, I\u0027ve grown quite fond of everything that tests the bounds and limitations of reality. I\u0027ve found creating surreal worlds focused on fantasy characters through photography has given me the perfect outlet for conveying my artistic ambitions! I\u0027ve done contract work for clients such as 2K Games/Gearbox Software, Blizzard Entertainment, The Nerdist, and many more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe not so relevant tidbits: I have a dog named Scrappy, he\u0027s 6 now! We live where there\u0027s lots of cacti and pools. In my free time, I play A LOT of videogames. ^_^ I\u0027m also married to the love of my life, Mike Gaboury, co-founder of Filthy Casual. You\u0027ll notice I travel quite a bit and it\u0027s all been because of my work for Filthy Casual...I do all of their product and promotional photography AND sell swag all over the US and Canada at conventions! If you wanna meet, I update all my travel info as part of this Patreon so you\u0027ll know where me and the rest of the FC crew will be next! Traveling has also given me the opportunity to produce more video blogs (which has become one of my favorite things to dabble with on here)! One could say I\u0027m living the life, but let me tell you, it\u0027s hard work and I spend countless hours making sure the dream never dies. On top of Filthy Casual, I also do retouching for some other wonderful ladies you\u0027ve heard of! I\u0027m a busy girl and I absolutely love every aspect of the hustle!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9x9wmgA.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/I7eCgD2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy I\u0027m On Patreon:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve had so many amazing people reach out requesting more from me, more content that extended beyond just my cosplay photography...and gave me the chance to step in front of the camera! Patreon gives me the opportunity to provide more content centered around me and my craft. So as far as cosplay, boudoir, and photography content goes, I offer everything to you in the form of reward tiers. And these tiers contain goodies such as project announcements, photo first looks, behind the scenes photos and videos, travel vlogs, wallpapers, DIGIPACKS, prints, polaroids, personalized letters and thank you videos, and so much more! *see to your right*\n\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/myx2i1E.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DdcP7qF.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t--------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eBoudoir, Implied, and Cosplay Lewds:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Two years ago I made a milestone here on Patreon...one that helped me break out of my skin and get out of my comfort zone. Being comfortable with my body and being able to express that has always been a goal for me. So, I thought this would be the perfect platform to start that endeavor along with cosplay and photography stuff...so I did just that! All of my lewd content will feature implied nude, cosplay lewds, boudoir, etc. You\u0027ll receive all the final photos from these sets in the form of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eDIGIPACKS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e!

For example, I just recently bought my own studio space, one that\u0027s not attached to my apartment! Haha. I also get to level up my gear, commission more cosplays, hire people, pay it forward, etc. etc. etc. So not only does the money go towards giving you all more content, but towards helping my dreams GROW!
