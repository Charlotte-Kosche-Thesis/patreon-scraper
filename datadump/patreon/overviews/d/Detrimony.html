I\u0027ve also lowered my goal amounts to have more rewards for Patreons as I get more Patreons.\u00a0 I\u0027ve reduced my hours at work by 10 per week and will be investing that time into my Detrimony comic book and my artwork.\u00a0 This will also free up a little more time for me to be able to go to school events with the kids during the day and not be so pressed for time to make up at my day job.\u00a0 I want to give a shout out to both \u003cstrong\u003eCraig Kobylka\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and \u003cstrong\u003eThe Schuckers\u003c/strong\u003e for your support I will always be greatful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the creator of Detrimony, which is an all original comic book that is sick!!! \u00a0I have the first issue almost complete it is about inked and I\u0027m in the midst of coloring it with my Cintiq and Photoshop. \u00a0Really excited for this book. \u00a0The story is unreal and has a lot to it. \u00a0Detrimony is about a man named Mason Grey that instead of having a superpower has a curse. \u00a0The more angry Mason gets the worse the weather gets around him. \u00a0It has so much more to it than I can explain and is very easy to follow. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have 3 kids and work a day job as a telemarketer, although I draw the entire time at work while on the phone to keep up with my commissions. \u00a0As the writer, penciler, inker, colorist, and letter it\u0027s really hard to find time to keep this book moving and continue to make money to keep my family supported. \u00a0The goal is for me to transition from my day job to just creating all day long. \u00a0Below is a sneak peak of the story Detrimony...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the first two issues written.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 380px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWalking through the desert, with a cold rain in the warm air was Mason Grey, a man with a curse.  For as long as he can remember it has been raining.  Mason has learned to keep his emotions in check and not to dwell on the past he\u2019s figured out that the angrier and more upset he gets, the more violent The Storm gets.  Mason is always on the move and tries his best to stay almost absent minded. \u00a0He keeps his distance from the cities of people because he fears he will harm them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRain is as good as it gets for Mason.  The second Mason starts to feel sorry for himself he will hear the Thunder and watch the Lightning.  If he begins to dwell even further, The Storm can get extremely   violent.  Mason is used to the rain, as he ventures forward, he takes his wooden walking stick and digs it into the sand.  He takes back his hood and puts his face to the sky.  The rain is cold and the air is warm, this works well for Mason.  While walking, Mason notices the rain for the first time, is letting up, more, and more by the second.  With excitement he looks up and is able to see the last drop falling.  Mason extends his hand with his eyes wide and catches it.  He begins to cry, it\u2019s the first time while outside that he has not been pelted with the rain.  He drops to his knees with his arms open, as he gathers his thoughts a female figure fly\u2019s overhead, Mason feels a very warm feeling when she passed overhead.  Mason has never seen anyone fly before, he watches in amazement with hishand over his eyes to cover the gleaming sun.  He wondered \u201cHow long have people been flying?  Are there others?\u201d  Then all of a sudden the rain begins to fall again!  It\u2019s starting off light and is getting harder by the second.  Mason stands up and puts his hands out to catch some rain.  He clenches his fists and grits his teeth, \u201cThink Mason, think.\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
