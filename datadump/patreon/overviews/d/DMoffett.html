Im the creator of Fallen Angel, The artist\u00a0Elyas Shamaan\u00a0is an artist I\u0027ve worked with on a fan-made manga for the past few years. My reason for creating this Patreon page is to basically help me fund this project and keep it going.\u00a0All pledges and support will go directly toward the project allowing me to continue both writing and funding Fallen Angel, And by being a Patreon supporter, you\u0027ll get access to a bunch of cool stuff, like sneak previews of the art, special posters and or art drawn by Elays, You get to see the pages a week or two earlier then the scheduled release date, and more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSynopsis:\u003cbr\u003eLong ago the gods listened to the people of earth and sent down a child made from their own blood combined, but the child was picked up and raised by bandits and became the most powerful and evil being known to existence. The gods locked him up for eternity and swore to never interfere with humans again. They made it forbidden for angels to get near earth or they will lose their wings. Hunderds of years passed and the story faded. When a young angel wanders into heavens forbidden lands he hears cries and voices, curious and unknowing of the rules, he tried to get close to earth but loses his wings in the process. A young boy, now lost his wings, cannot return to heaven. The boy meets an old man and a child, setting on a quest to do what the gods swore not to do: help the humans in their war against evil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pledge as little or as much as you\u0027d like, and depending on your pledge level, you get a bunch of backer-only benefits."
