I spend a lot of time writing commentary about inclusiveness in genre media (sci-fi, fantasy, horror, and comics) and racism in fandom, with a focus on antiblackness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing about representation and working to spread awareness about the isms in our fan communities, I spend more time on this blog than I can really afford \u2013 and even so, I don\u2019t get to create as much original content as I\u2019d like (specifically, long-form commentary pieces). By trade, as of August 2017, I\u2019m a p/t tech reporter and a freelance newspaper theater reviewer, which offers a steady paycheck (as opposed to my former all-freelance position) but doesn\u0027t really support other projects. This Patreon allows me to give time to these projects, including the blog, instead of using that time to pursue other freelance projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will have special access to original content (depending on the level), and will play a part in additional projects, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA book tentatively called \u201cFandom Racism 101,\u201d a collection of observations and essays based on my writing on diversehighfantasy,\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eON HOLD\u003c/span\u003e -- \u201cIn Undead Color,\u201d an anthology of short horror stories by authors of color.

This underserved demographic is especially underserved when it comes to black and brown kids, who are often segregated away from \u201cdesirable\u201d schools and are left with diminished confidence in their capabilities and futures.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatronage starts at just $1!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
