An impatient, anxious, endlessly overthinking but ridiculously creative individual with a passion for taking over the world with words. I have the scars to prove my existence and I speak beyond my thirty one years on this rock.

I think there is a truth lacking from our world, lost in the distractions of daily life that once was front and center.

I\u0027ve applied to others but I\u0027m going to really start to focus on my writing. That means engaging more on Twitter, publishing more books, and also getting audio done. I\u0027ve learned a ton about publishing and having an audience in the last few years. I\u0027d really like to establish myself and my writing as things people can look to for help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2022lead me away\u003cbr\u003e\nfrom exhaustion\u003cbr\u003e\nwith delicate kisses\u003cbr\u003e\nand i will leave weak\u003cbr\u003e\npresses at your wrists\u2022\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE DREAM: write, publish, travel, inspire, teach..\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing poetry. Anywhere, at home, traveling, or just out on the town. I\u0027m easily inspired by the world and (more importantly) the people around me. I want to help people see the world in a different, authentic, bold sort of way. \u00a0I want to stir something inside of you that you thought long forgotten. Maybe you are in a park reading one of my books, or just woke up on a Sunday morning having your coffee. Maybe you are on your long commute home and you feel lonely. Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to read something that says to you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou are not alone and there is a world out there that is yours.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to provide for an engagement and honesty not seen yet in the literary world.

I don\u0027t have a formula, each book is different. Originally, I limited them to only paperback, but I want to expand into ebook and audiobook versions to reach more audiences. I price the books very cheaply.. that\u0027s why I\u0027m here on Patreon, to find a basic income to get my feet off the ground. I need financial flexibility so I can pursue the creative process, and not slave away in an office.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to influence and show generations of people what it\u0027s like to have words that mean something far more than their letters, far more than just in one language, or one culture.

It allows me to focus on my passions, which I want to share with the world.\u00a0I am a love poet with influences like E.E. Cummings, Bukowski, and Plath. I have read hundreds of books, I am a sponge for experience. I have lived in Europe and Africa, besides North America. I\u0027ve traveled to Asia. I was born to see and translate the experiences of the world. I believe there is a mindfulness and connectedness that is still out there, waiting to be known.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow YOU can help:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJoin me on this journey to change the world through words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a patron.\u003cbr\u003e"
