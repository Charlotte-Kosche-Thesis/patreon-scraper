    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://thurotdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dan-thurot1.jpg?w=788\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy grandfather was a writer. He wrote list books \u2014\n1,001 Reasons Why, that sort of thing. They were terribly dry, but composed\nwith the same gentle steadiness that marked the rest of his life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSpace-Biff! is about me being like my grandfather. Except with a much greater\nappreciation for board games, minus the dryness and obsession with lists, and\nhopefully fostering the sort of place that strangers will want to visit every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thurotdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/5-shes-an-actual-alien.jpg?w=788\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn a far less personal note, Space-Biff! is about\nfulfilling two goals. The first probably won\u2019t surprise you. I have always had\na deep preference for written reviews. With a written review, you\u2019re allowed to\nread as quickly or slowly as you like. You\u2019re allowed to return to a paragraph\nand ponder whether you agree or disagree with the author. You\u2019re allowed to\nmarvel at the way a phrase captures a particular moment or mechanism. A written\nreview is both more deliberate and more briskly consumed than a video review or\npodcast. Not that it\u2019s necessarily better. But a carefully worded essay has a\nplace alongside every other form of criticism, if only because it can express,\nin the most measured and distilled manner, the reviewer\u2019s experience with a\ngame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that, by the way, is what I believe a good\nreview is all about: expressing a reviewer\u2019s experience. If I were more\ncreative, I might figure out a way to work two more Xs into that sentence so I\ncould claim it as a 4X game. Expertly expressing a review\u2019s existential\nexperience. There. This blurb is now functionally Clash of Cultures II. It\u2019s\namazing what an internet search can help us accomplish, isn\u2019t it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo express my experiences with a game, and to do\nso with insight, clarity, and hopefully some value to my readers, whether they\u2019re\nlooking for a purchase recommendation, hoping to figure out why a particular\ngame bugs them, or seeking a deeper appreciation for a title with a hundred\nlogged plays under their belt \u2014 that\u2019s the first goal of Space-Biff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thurotdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_9086.jpg?w=788\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe second is to remain independent. I have never\nbeen averse to freelance work, and dabbled here and there. However, most of the\nindustry\u2019s larger spaces are driven by the need to generate as many clicks as\npossible while prompting as little controversy as possible. Most article\nlengths are capped at around a thousand words and content is often carefully\nmonitored to appeal to a broad demographic. It\u2019s simple business: give your\nreaders a reason to migrate through multiple pages without giving them a reason\nto stay away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSpace-Biff! isn\u2019t about that. While I pride myself\non not wasting my readers\u2019 time, I also pride myself on knowing when a game\nwarrants 500 words and when it warrants 5,000 \u2014 though I don\u2019t believe the site\nhas ever featured anything quite that long, so please come back from the door.\nSometimes a game will require a tough discussion, whether because of a sticky\nsystem or because it wants to engage with a serious topic. Sometimes a small\nindependent game will be the best game of the year, while the big-box release\nthat saturated the internet with flashy ads and earned a million dollars on\nKickstarter won\u2019t be worth a tin of old lima beans. On Space-Biff!, I have the\nfreedom to tell you precisely what I think, beholden to neither advertisers nor\neditors-in-chief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thurotdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/0-best-week-2017.jpg?w=2000\u0026amp;h=\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs an example of what I\u2019m going for, take a look\nat Best Week. This is my version of an end-of-year list. Rather than\nhighlighting the ten best games of the year, I look at multiple categories and\ngenres. In 2017, for instance, the games I chose to highlight included a visually\nugly negotiation game named Sidereal Confluence, the weirdest social deduction\ngame of all time in Bemused, the children\u2019s dexterity game Rhino Hero Super\nBattle, the light card-matching game Ethnos, the second edition of the solo\ngame Nemo\u2019s War, a socially conscious cooperative game called Spirit Island,\nand a wargame, Time of Crisis, that reduced one of Rome\u2019s toughest centuries\ninto a sublime deck-building game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe process of crafting an insightful written\nreview requires more than just sitting at a keyboard and clacking out some\nimpressions. It takes preparation, multiple plays of a game, a heavy dose of\ndiscussion, and a whole lot of showers gone cold because I\u2019ve spent too long\nthinking about how to write an introduction rather than washing my hair. When\nreviewing a wargame, I often have to read a book! Sometimes two books! This is\nalways enlightening, but can also eat up plenty of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thurotdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/4-money-money-money.jpg?w=788\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is why I\u2019ve turned to Patreon. While writing\nboard game reviews is enjoyable, it\u2019s also not the sort of pursuit that keeps\nthe furnace running. My goal isn\u2019t to make a living from this, but to make it\nmore worthwhile and hopefully expand the quantity, quality, and style of work\nthat I\u2019m able to offer to you, the reader. I\u2019d like to add a monthly editorial\nand eventually bring back the Space-Biff! Space-Cast!, the world\u2019s premier (but\nshortest-lived) podcast about the deeper meaning of board games. Right now,\nneither of those things are possible. But with your assistance, there\u2019s no\nreason why they couldn\u2019t be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn short, with your help, I hope to not only continue\nwriting Space-Biff! for a long time to come, but also shape it into something\ngreater than it already is."
