    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\"What I stand for is what I stand on.\" - Wendell Berry\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowdy! We are two authors of the Driving Food Home \nCollective, Sera Deva and Rachael Saland (and this is our sidekick, Wanda the Honda!). Our next journey is a continuation of \u003cem\u003eDriving Food Home: Culture \u0026amp; Community\u003c/em\u003e, \nwhich was documented on our \u003ca href=\"http://www.drivingfoodhome.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e in June \u0026amp; August of 2014. During \u003cem\u003eDriving Food Home, Homesteads \u0026amp; \n(Her)story\u003c/em\u003e, we will be focusing primarily on sustenance farming and female-run \noperations. We will be visiting multiple operations across the country \nin a six \nweek road trip across the south and up the east coast of the United \nStates examining varied approaches to agricultural systems and \ncommunities. Our focus will primarily be in California, New Mexico, \nTexas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North \nCarolina, Virginia and Kentucky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the broader picture, \u003cstrong\u003eour \nproject seeks to expand on the current conception of the \nimplementation of agricultural practices of farms, homesteads, and food \nproduction systems in general in order to develop potential solutions to\n food systems issues in the current paradigm.\u003c/strong\u003e In addition to continuing \nthe Driving Food Home Publication, we are creating a forum \nentitled \u003cem\u003eYoung Farmers for Young Farmers\u003c/em\u003e (linked on our website) which will provide a network \nfor young farmers to share experiences, discuss problems, solutions and \npractices that they have worked in systems. This will generate a \ncommunity amongst young farmers to work together, learn from each other,\n and discuss whole system solutions. Moreover, emphasis will be put on \nyoung farmers including where they are geographically and the \ntopography, climate, soils, and important information necessary when \nconsidering \u201cplace based agriculture.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funding we seek is \nfrom those who believe in our mission as strongly as we do. It will be \nput to our minimal traveling expenses and redirected towards the farmers\n we\u0027re writing about in the form of food purchases. Along with covering our operating expenses, \u003cstrong\u003eour goal is to raise enough money to purchase a tour bus of sorts to be run on veggie oil\u003c/strong\u003e for the next trek in Spring 2015 thru the Northeast. Although we are currently traveling in a sedan with wonderful gas mileage, fossil fuels are a dirty habit. We want to eliminate them from our traveling to make our adventures on the road truly as sustainable as the organizations we\u0027re promoting. Everything raised beyond $2,000 will be put towards a Magic School bus fund.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance\n for your support and understanding of the importance of this movement.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love from the Road,\u003cbr\u003eThe Driving Food Homegirls"

Over these 5,000 miles and\n two months, the travelers specifically looked for diverse ways of \nmotivating community action through the implementation of local food \nmovements. Seeds for inspiration and networking began to root.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, the articles, forums, and databases found on this site seek to \nacknowledge various forms of sustainable agriculture and sustainable \ncommunity structures that are popping up all over the nation. As young \nmembers of the food movement, we seek to learn from each of them, and \nencourage you to explore them too. We wish to connect young farmers and \nfood enthusiasts, inspire and encourage change through creating a \nnetwork of support and seasoned experiences from around the map.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith strong community we can begin to make structural change in \npromoting the localization of our food systems; this is the grass roots \nmovement in motion.\u003cbr\u003e",
