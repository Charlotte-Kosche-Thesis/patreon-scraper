    "summary": "I\u0027d like to use this Patreon page to raise support for an ongoing series of recordings that I think of as \"That \u002770s Show\": the songs I played when I was a young singer-songwriter on the \"steak and lobster circuit\" in the Bay Area. I recently recorded \"\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/coverme10/bobbymcgee-dgans\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMe and Bobby McGee\u003c/a\u003e\" for a compilation titled \"Cover Me Turns Ten: A Free Covers Album,\" and that has inspired me to do more like it. This will include songs by Cat Stevens, Elton John, Jackson Browne, Steve Goodman, the Beatles, the Grateful Dead, Little Feat, Randy Newman, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do this for a couple of reasons. First of all, I\u0027ve had these songs in my head for so long that I feel they\u0027re part of my genetic code. Second, I love recording in the studio! I\u0027ve been working with Jeremy Goody at Megasonic for nearly 20 years, and we\u0027ve developed a wonderful way of working together. I just finished my ninth full-length album and I\u0027m already jonesing to get back in there and do something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI am a performer and recording artist with a unique blend of original songs, loop-based improvisations, and interpretations of music from other sources. I don\u0027t fit into any known genres and I am way to old to be of any interest to the music industry. But I get plenty of work, from house concerts (which I love) to bar gigs to medium-sized music festivals. I can deliver a solid set of music with just \u00a0an acoustic guitar, or with my looping rig and effects, or with an electric band; I can give you a set of original music, a set of purely-improvised music, a full set of Grateful Dead songs, and any combination of the above plus lots of \"covers.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is a good model for the likes of me: the people who like what I do can support my work directly, allowing me to expand my musical horizons in all directions at once rather than forcing me to focus on one configuration or another.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for your interest in my music, and I thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
