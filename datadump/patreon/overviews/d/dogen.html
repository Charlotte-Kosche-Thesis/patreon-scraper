Though I do have a strong command of the language, writing and performing new content each week in Japanese is time consuming, and frequent business trips often complicate scheduling.

In many cases, this causes Japanese learners to develop bad habits which become very difficult to fix down the road. I try\u00a0provide the Japanese learning community with a set of tools meant to prevent and fix these habits. In my Patreon video series\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eJapanese Phonetics\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0I talk about my experiences picking up\u00a0Japanese as a teen, introduce useful phonetic practices, and break down\u00a0the dozens of complicated phonetic patterns I learned while earning my degree in Japanese linguistics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eJapanese Phonetics Episode 3: Common Japanese Misconceptions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_s6QqmJd7k\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough a\u00a0fair amount of information on Japanese phonetics exists, it can be hard to find, and difficult to understand without advanced Japanese and linguistic knowledge.
