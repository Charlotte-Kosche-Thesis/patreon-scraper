    "summary": "It\u0027s a rough world, but there\u0027s also beauty and goodness to be found in unexpected places. I hope my music, in some small way, adds to the Goodness and Beauty side of things. Let\u0027s tip the scales together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut first, what is this Patreon thing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere has never been a more exciting or challenging time to be a musician and songwriter. The tools to create, record, and reach an audience have been democratized, but it is increasingly difficult to make money as an artist. I didn\u0027t get into music to strike it rich, but it takes money to put quality work out into the world (gear, producers, studio time, mixing, mastering, video shoots - it adds up QUICKLY).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ePatreon is a membership platform that makes it easy to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love. \u003c/strong\u003eIt lets you say, hey, what you\u0027re putting out into the world is valuable to me. You choose a monthly tier that\u0027s right for your budget ($2 to $50 or more) and receive rewards in return. Though it\u0027s a slick new online platform, the idea of patronage isn\u0027t new at all. For centuries people have been directly supporting artists so they can continue to paint/compose/create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/rwvUjAv6pxg\"\u003eHere\u0027s a quick vid from Patreon that explains it well.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will we make together?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSongs, Videos, and a Podcast.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSongs.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve got a new batch of songs that I\u0027ve begun to record in my home studio. I think they\u0027re pretty rad. A couple are getting back to my roots: heavy Jimmy Eat World, Death Cab, Pedro The Lion vibes. Others are more Americana Pop, like Tom Petty meets The Killers. Really fun. And - no surprise - a couple slow, haunting, slightly depressing tunes. Melancholy is my happy place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo take these songs to the next level, I\u0027ve got a short list of producers I\u0027d really like to work with. The sooner we have the funds to pay for the producer, studio time, mixing, mastering, etc., the sooner we can make this happen. Even these demoes have a bit of magic though so I\u0027ll be releasing them here for Patrons only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideos.\u003c/strong\u003e There\u0027s a ton of talented people in the video/film world here in South Bend. I\u0027d like to team up with them on some live concert videos and creative/weird music videos.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLov8CKKy5c\u0026amp;t=139s\"\u003eCheck out the work of Joe Baughman here\u003c/a\u003e.

Each episode, with the help of some pretty incredible guests, we\u0027ll introduce you to an off-the-radar band or artist that you absolutely NEED to hear. If you\u0027re a Patron you\u0027ll be able to submit questions for our guests!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s do this.\u003c/strong\u003e I quite literally can\u0027t do this without you - and I\u0027ve learned the past few years that I wouldn\u0027t \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to do it without you.
