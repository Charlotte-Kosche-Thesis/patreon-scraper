    "summary": "(Just so you know: what\u0027s on the video and what you see below are different. To get the whole story, watch the video!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Dream Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI once attended a writers\u0027 conference in which the keynote speaker talked about the Power of Story to change the world. He used the slavery issue in America as an example. We had Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, William Lloyd Garrison, and so many others speaking and working for abolition. Their work was vital. But the speaker said that arguably the thing that turned the tide was Harriet Beecher Stowe\u0027s \u003cem\u003eUncle Tom\u0027s Cabin. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a dream that my writing might, as one small voice among so many gifted writers, help to create change and reconciliation in the world.\u003cbr\u003eRight now, my bone-deep longing is to write a big novel that shows a family trying to keep their feet through the unbearable illness that killed my husband, and took ten years to do it:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.theaftd.org/understandingftd/ftd-overview\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFrontotemporal Degeneration\u003c/a\u003e. FTD is less of an orphan disease during the past few years than it was when it attacked us, thank God, but it is still far less well-known (or funded) than Alzheimer\u0027s. I believe a story, a well-written one that pulls readers in, will help to bring it to the public eye, and will help to drive more research and more services to families battling this horrible disease.\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is,\u00a0I have been writing in the cracks and crevices of whatever else was happening in my life for many years, (and a very few of those years, even earned more than the poverty limit doing it), but this project doesn\u0027t seem to be like that. I\u0027ve tried. As you can imagine, even though it is complete fiction, not my family\u0027s own story, writing it still draws heavily on all my emotional resources, and I have realized that I need to be able to devote my time to it for at least a year. I can\u0027t do that without help. I need you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore About Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore you decide to help support my writing, you need to know if you even like it! You can read free sample chapters of my fiction on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.debbonnaire.com/books/fiction/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e. I have been writing since I could hold a pencil, and sold my first story at the age of eleven. I\u0027ve published over 700 stories and articles for adults and children, and 28 books. To be clear, some of those are textbooks, six are small booklets, and some were \"work-for-hire,\" done by independent contract, so only about six or eight books are easily available to the general public. (Yes, it varies--some out-of-print books can sometimes be found used.) Two novels and three recent Christian non-fiction books are easily found in softcover or ebook format at Amazon, Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, and Kobo. Naturally, you are also more than welcome to help support me by buying my books, and leaving reviews!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was in college (a million years ago!) I wrote a paper entitled \"The Role of Patronage in Elizabethan England.\" I thought that was wonderful--someone with means \"adopting\" an artist and supporting them so they could do what they were born to do. In exchange, the artist created things especially for the patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon. Now you don\u0027t have to have means to help support a variety of artists--and get something special in return. Browse the list of rewards, and by the way, I\u0027m so grateful for your help that if there\u0027s something you want but don\u0027t see, you are welcome to suggest it!\u003cbr\u003eOne more thing: for Patreon, I must put a specific dollar amount, so I couldn\u0027t put this in rewards, but anyone giving anything higher than the highest level I created can choose a personal short piece written just for them. It could be a story featuring your child, or a piece about you or your business--we\u0027ll talk. Because I\u0027ll owe you!"
