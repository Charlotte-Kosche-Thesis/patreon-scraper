    "summary": "My name is Jack Kruse and I am a neurosurgeon. \u00a0I want to thank you for joining me on chasing change in our modern world and becoming a patron of mine here. \u00a0I would like to share with you some ideas I have here on why we\u0027re all in trouble these days. Humans evolved the attributes of a large brain and the ability to speak, in order to form intricate social networks that can use many aspects of technology. Our biggest attribute is the ability to think. This allows us to radically change the environment that we are ideally adapted to. It has allowed us to dominate all habitats and create havoc in most of them as well. The real human miracle of our minds is not that we can see the world as it is\u2026\u2026but that we can see it as it is not, and then change it. If we think and act incorrectly, we can quickly recalibrate and overcome it. Conversely, we seem to be a prisoner to our paleo-cortex (older less evolved brain), and resist change even when we know it must occur. Many times we will subjugate the best interests of our survival to suit our emotional needs or desires. The real paradox of humanity is that our reasons for the things we do are often weak but our sentiments to do them remain quite strong. Interestingly, we have overcome that liability as a species many times so far. Some of us even find comfort in that ability at times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe today we are now mismatched with our environment because of our own doing because of the light we\u0027ve chosen to live under. \u00a0\u00a0Here was her comment: \u201cMy parents eat more prescriptions than they do food and they never go outside anymore. They do not think their light and food choices ultimately affect their health. They bought a Wii for exercise, watch exercise guru\u0027s on youtube every morning, and only play games in the Wii now. They BOTH work in the medical field, too.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis thinking must change and eventually it will when patients mandate they want better than what they have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to start the dialogue of how to evolve healthcare using patients as foot soldiers by turning them into \u003cstrong\u003e\"MITOCHONDRIACS\"\u003c/strong\u003e. I am hell bent on changing the process of how medicine is practiced and healthcare delivered in this country. Right now my sphere of influence is small and I can affect my patients and family with my thoughts. Thinking about how to do this is a messy process when the end point is not well defined. I do know that it must change, but for now I am going to trust the process I\u0027ve begun. Some paradigms change slowly and to others change comes like a tsunami. I have decided to embrace change and try to become the change I want to see in medicine now. I realize I cannot control it, but I know I can work in harmony with it and even cultivate the vision I see for it. I used to worry about healthcare reform and how it might end up after Washington DC tried to control it, but I realized that if I could not control it, neither can they. I found some solace in that. \u00a0Thank you for joining my in help changing our world by changing your perspective on what really matters in healthcare, light, water, and magnetism in quantum biology of humans\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

This change also coincided with the invention of the electric power grid and the incandescent light bulb in 1879.  The change in lighting from solar light to man made light was the inflection point in human history where light began to drive mitochondrial diseases in man.  Dr. Kruse\u0027s journey about how light controls food electrons in the mitochondrial complex became his passion.  Later in the 2oth century the focus of blame was placed upon food and not light.  Politics began to reshape America from an industrial power to a technologic service powerhouse that is fueled by the man made use of the electromagnetic spectrum between the Schumann resonance of 7.83 Hz and the Infrared band of the visible portion of the spectrum of light.  This is where modern ills begin.   Nixon and his cabinet committed to reshaping the nutritional landscape so that high food prices would never be an issue in American politics again, and the US food pyramid was born in the early 1970\u0027s.  To date no one understands how artificial light is the driving force behind modern neolithic diseases tied to mitochondrial dysfunction.  That is Dr. Kruse\u0027s sole focus now.  He aims to teach people the world of quantum biology.\u003cbr\u003eToday, in the face of rampant heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases like celiac disease, multiple sclerosis and thyroiditis, we have learned that America\u2019s health crisis began with Tesla and the power grid in the during the last 19th century during the \"Electric Power Wars.  It continued with several political moves made nearly forty years ago by elected officials who didn\u2019t want to deal with the fallout of inflation in food prices. Some of our most popular beliefs about good health are, in fact, lies that were sold to the American people as propaganda.  Scientists are now uncovering that the electric power grid and things plugged into increase blood glucose without any added food source of carbohydrate.  This drives altered signaling in cells.  Today PhD researchers are blaming food for the etiology of mitochondrial disease, but the science of light is showing us this is a misplaced notion.  The physics or organisms will uncover deeper truths about nature that tie us back to the eukaryotic origins of the Cambrian explosion when mitochondrion were usurped by our cells.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2007, New York native Dr. Jack Kruse, then a Nashville-based neurosurgeon, suffered a torn meniscus in his knee at 6\u20192\u201d, 357 lbs. Ashamed and frustrated that he\u2019d let his health spin out of control, Dr. Kruse knew his life had to change. He devoured anything he could find on obesity and disease, reading between 5 and 6,000 articles over 18 months, uncovering research on the new science of leptin receptor biology and the physics of light,  along with the dietary lies and propaganda of the USDA, agra-food complex, and the pharmaceutical complex. Dr. Kruse realized he was dying from the same epidemic that now plagues 150 million Americans and billions worldwide  while he ate under man made lights.  Moreover, our light sources and diet is now being outsourced globally to market place that is not ready for the destruction it can impart to human mitochondria.   Leveraging leptin\u2019s cutting-edge science and using evolutionary biology as the beacons for optimal health, Dr. Kruse lost 77 lbs in three months and 133 lbs in a year.  his journey continues today, even as he finds out more things about our leptin receptors connection to the retina and circulatory system that will astound the curious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis most startling discovery defies everything modern medicine believes about health, weight-loss, and managing disease: obesity is not the result of too many calories, not enough exercise or living a slothful existence. Obesity begins in the eye because of an altered spectrum of light.  Obesity is an inflammatory brain condition that is completely reversible when you control your environment properly. His mito-hack showed him that obesity is a thermodynamic problem causing us to lose energy to our environment and not a state of energy excess that people believe.  He leveraged his findings to help patients in his private practice lose weight and reverse major diseases like osteoporosis, diabetes, and sleep apnea. He eventually developed his \u201cLeptin Rx Reset,\u201d a protocol that acts as a brain surgery without ever using a blade, completely rewiring the hypothalamus by aligning with our natural circadian rhythms and mastering the \u201ctiming\u201d of our evolutionary blueprint. His findings include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe timing of when you eat is more important than what you eat: seeing AM sunlight is critical\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSnacking or eating \u201csmall meals\u201d every 2-3 hours as commonly advocated by conventional medicine all but guarantees life-long obesity,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnyone can lose massive amounts of weight without ever counting a calorie,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRigorous cardio exercises (like long distance running or chronic cardio routines) leads to stem cell reduction and shaves years off the end of your life, and\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEating fats conventional medicine told us to shun is ideal for Optimal Health.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIn June of 2011, Dr. Kruse began blogging about his findings, and people all over the world began to marry the Leptin Rx to an ancestral diet (known as the \u003ca href=\"http://www.jackkruse.com/brain-gut-6-epi-paleo-rx/\"\u003eEpi Paleo Rx\u003c/a\u003e template with incredible results, chronicled in forums all over the internet. One such thread on a popular paleo diet forum has logged over 1.5 million hits in just over a year. Dr. Kruse is on a mission to reshape healthcare in America by educating the masses and their doctors on what it looks like to achieve optimal health and reverse chronic disease.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDr. Jack Kruse is a respected neurosurgeon and CEO of Optimized Life, a health and wellness company dedicated to helping patients avoid the healthcare burdens we typically encounter as we age. He resides in Gulf South close to New Orleans with his family.\u003cbr\u003e",
