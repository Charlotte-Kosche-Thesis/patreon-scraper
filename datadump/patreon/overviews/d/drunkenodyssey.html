    "summary": "Hey! Welcome to Drunken Odyssey! The premise of the game is simple: It\u0027s an interactive story where your choices matter, and the story becomes tailored to your style the more you play. Think Telltale games meets twine meets porn. You start out celebrating your eighteenth birthday - and things go from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, it contains a variable system that changes what you can do and constrains your choices. There are many paths to follow - with one main, leading path - and a host of transformations (as well as a load of sex scenes :]) There\u0027s hand-drawn art that will be updated soon - unfortunately, my drawing tablet has ceased to work on my computer. Along the paths there\u0027s more transformations, changes, and alterations to your character and your mind as you find yourself deeper and deeper into the odyssey - where you won\u0027t be coming home the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE GAME WILL CONTINUE TO BE UPDATED - FOR FREE - WITH EVERY RELEASE ON TFGAMES. \u003cbr\u003eThe benefits of supporting me can be read in the reward tiers! If you decide to pledge, thanks for supporting this game and helping me finish it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for playing, unsuspecting player! There\u0027s a discussion section on TFgames, or shoot me a message - any kind of comments, critiques, or just general interest would be appreciated. I have started this patreon as the more in-depth the game gets, the more it\u0027ll become time consuming. I also would love to do heavier-duty (as in, better) illustrations - which will be impossible until I can buy a newer tablet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  The current wordcount of the game as per v1.0 on October Tenth - the first day of the count - is 82,582. The first major update will be at 132,582.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e|\\|    82,582\u003cbr\u003e| |    132,582\u003cbr\u003e| |    182,582\u003cbr\u003e| | 232,582\u003cbr\u003e"
