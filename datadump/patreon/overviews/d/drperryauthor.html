Maybe not a factory. It feels more tidal sometimes; like waves that just don\u0027t quit saying hello to the beach.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll notice some of the tags here. One is Poeticalendar, which is a project where I want to publish 365 poems in a calendar format. Or maybe 366 because I don\u0027t want poor Leap Year to feel left out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother one is the Random Idea Theatre. It pretty much is what it says. I am a reformed performance artist, after all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, the fact that you\u0027re here is like sunrise over the water. You know what I mean if you\u0027ve ever been to a shoreline at dawn. You just have to stop and maybe sit even though your Bermuda shorts will get all sandy. You need to stop and acknowledge that rising sun even though you\u0027re absolutely sure already that it\u0027s the start of something awesome. You\u0027re awesome.

D.R. is well aware that her home state has both of those things, but isn\u0027t defined by them.
