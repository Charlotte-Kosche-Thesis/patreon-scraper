Humans only casinos, yeti lounge singers, family drama, puns, and MURDER await!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut who are Sean and Allison? They are a couple of nerds who have been drawing and writing as soon as they could get their hands on the appropriate implement. Sean draws; Allison writes. Shortly after Sean married one of Allison\u0026#8217;s best friends, and she asked the sucker to make her words into pictures. Turns out, he would. It\u0026#8217;s fabulous. \u003cbr\u003eSean has enough saved up for a year to make illustration and comics his full time job. (Allison really has no idea how to plan that far in advance.) We would love for this to be sustainable. You and I know yeti detectives are the bee\u0026#8217;s knees, but some reason other people don\u0026#8217;t want to throw money at us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all you can spare is a dollar or five, literally that helps. I know people say that and you\u0026#8217;re like, REALLY??? A dollar? Come on NPR I\u0026#8217;M TIRED OF YOUR PLEDGE DRIVES. But, as usual, NPR is totally right. Small dollars adds up to large dollars that become tools to survive the capitalist machine (rent, pens, books, food, fine feathered hats). Even more, it means, in some way, the art we make matters to you. And that is just incredible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis comic is so much of who we are. It is silly, serious, shouty, bitter, and sometimes joyful. There are bad puns, yetis, and probably Big Foot. (Allison is 90% sure Sean is 30% Sasquatch.) We couldn\u0026#8217;t make this anywhere else. We want to keep making it and sharing it. Help us out if you can. Doc would be proud, even if he wouldn\u0026#8217;t admit it."
