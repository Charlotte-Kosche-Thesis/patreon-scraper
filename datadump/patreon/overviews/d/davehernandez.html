I believe you can change the world through both of them and I really want to be able to dedicate my life to both. Also music is the place where I can forget about everything else and just be.\u003cbr\u003eI usually make cover videos of songs I like and I\u0027m hoping to make some of original songs as well. I like almost every type of music and I speak both English and Spanish so I\u0027ll be uploading songs in both languages.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very excited to be here, I hope you like what I do and if you do please consider giving me a dollar (or the amount you want) for each video, it makes a huge difference and it lets me continue improving my work and delivering greater quality videos and music to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhere your money will go\u003c/h2\u003eUp until recently I only uploaded videos as a hobby but I decided I really want to do this for real so with your support I will be able to do that.
