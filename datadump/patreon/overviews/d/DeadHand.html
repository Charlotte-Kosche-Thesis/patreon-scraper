    "summary": "Hello! I am a novice author of short animations and CG artist. First, sorry for my English. Studied English in school many years ago so I will speak briefly. I have just finished this animation. It\u0027s about the last war in history, and about how it\u0027s going to end.  Animation name \"Last day of war\".  This is the second animation of my project \"Dead Hand\" I\u0027m working on in my spare time.\u003cbr\u003eLast War which used every weapon invented by mankind in this universe, did not spare anyone. There are only ghosts, prisoners in a steel shell. And the ghosts are still at war.  Machines continue dutifully follow orders. On the automatic base machines fueling and charge the weapons of last surviving bomber preparing to drop bombs at the dead enemy city. This happens until the echo of mankind subsides completely. Then comes a new era in which there is no place for us.\u003cbr\u003eThis is non-commercial project i am working in my spare time, sometimes other specialists help me, but most of the work I am doing by myself. Previous cartoon gathered a lot of views, looks like people need it. It seems to me that this animation is timely. Countries exchanging with mutual curses, accusations, weak punches. The situation is tense. I am painting the world in which it\u0027s not important anymore. Where only an echos remains. Maybe science fiction can give answers to real questions of our time. I ask you to help me with the next animation from this universe. It will be ~5 minutes animation with the working name - \"MIR\". Last animation took 1.5 years. Although people helped me. New episode requires lot of hi-poly modeling, animation, music,lot of rendering. With the normal budget time could be reduced significantly, quality can be significantly raised. The main question is why you need this cartoon? I dont know. I\u0027ve got no such thing as a career here, so I will have no promotion. Most likely animation will not bring me money. I just feel that it should be done. Regardless of whether I will gather even a penny, work will still be done. People told me that someone might want to help me. Thats why I\u0027m here.\u003cbr\u003eThank you and have good day!:)))\u003cbr\u003e"
