    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! My name is Debra and I\u0027m a freelance illustrator and artist based in South West London, U.K. I\u0027ve been drawing since I can remember, and I knew I wanted to be an illustrator from an early age when I used to make my own little books.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve always been drawn to fantasy, fairies and mystical, mythical subjects, and this is the area I now focus on in my personal work. Since I graduated in 1997, I\u0027ve worked as a freelance illustrator most of the time, but as all illustrators know, income from commissions sometimes isn\u0027t dependable! I also sell limited edition prints through a gallery, and I make work to sell online.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon? I\u0027ve been inspired by seeing so many artists I admire sharing their work here. I love what I do, and I want to continue to create and show you new work. All artists know that every little bit helps us. The costs that I need to cover include studio rent, materials, promotion, etc. By supporting me, you will be helping me continue in my work practice, and in turn I hope to show you many new creations! You are of course free to cancel or change your pledge at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is to create a Faery Tarot deck, or at least enough samples to show a tarot card publisher -and I have had some interest from one. This is something I\u0027ve long wanted to do, and as creating a deck is a lengthy process and a labour of love, I appreciate any support along the way. I\u0027m planning to base my deck along traditional lines, and aim to put a lot of research into it, but also my intuitive thoughts about each card.\u003cbr\u003eI consider it a privilege to share my work and process here with you, and I aim to do my very best to honour your pledges. I\u0027m excited about what\u0027s ahead in the future, and look forward to sharing and discussing my art with you. This is a work in progress, and future rewards I may offer could include colouring pages, original etchings and more. I\u0027m open to suggestions and feedback, and would like to connect with many people here. I\u0027m learning along the way! (I can\u0027t post a video here, sorry, as I don\u0027t like the sound of my own voice! I\u0027d much rather write and post pictures.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for stopping to look at my page, and for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
