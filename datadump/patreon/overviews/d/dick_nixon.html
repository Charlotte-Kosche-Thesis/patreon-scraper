What started as a writing exercise has turned, for better or worse, into a daily attempt to understand and interpret our times through President Nixon\u0027s thinking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want @dick_nixon to \"play it tough\" (as he\u0027d say), cut the crap, and perhaps make you think differently about current events and Nixon\u0027s place in them. If I can give you some laughs, too, then I\u0027ve succeeded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We\u0027re Here\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI published a lot of political analysis during the 2016 election. @dick_nixon was a weekly (often bi-weekly) columnist at\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mashable.com/2016/03/20/disaster-looms-hillary-clinton-campaign-dick-nixon-explains-why/\"\u003eMashable\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e and also wrote for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/24/dick-nixon-tweets-watergate-215300\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePolitico\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/dick-nixon-to-hillary-clinton-you-cant-rise-above-fear-without-abandoning-hope?ref=author\"\u003eDaily Beast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/03/there-is-an-international-disease-which-is-hillary-clinton/\"\u003eForeign Policy\u003c/a\u003e, \u003c/em\u003eamong others.

It was great to have more than 140 characters, and they were a challenge under @dick_nixon\u0027s byline or my own.

(In big news weeks, maybe more than one.) They\u0027ll begin on May 1, 2018, and pause only for the flu or jury duty. (I\u0027ll let you know.)
