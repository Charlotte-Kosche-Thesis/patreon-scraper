    "summary": "Hello and welcome to The Daly Planet! We\u2019re Scott Daly and Matt Freeman and we make podcasts and online content exploring Movies, TV, Books and the stories we love. We\u2019re growing each and every month and we\u2019d like to invite you to be part of our community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Daly Planet?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah, like the newspaper from Superman, but with Scott\u2019s last name. In 2014, Scott decided to start a blog as an outlet to talk about the pop culture entertainment he loved. Starting with (poorly written) reviews and essays about random movies, the website grew and a few months later Scott invited his college friend Matt to join him. The two eventually started a podcast because we both love to talk and to listen to ourselves talk. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to over two years later and Daly Planet Productions is turning out weekly and monthly content across a wide spectrum. But we want to do more.

How much does it cost us to keep this thing going? Producing and hosting podcasts is unfortunately not cheap, and the more shows we produce the more those costs go up. Right now here\u2019s what it costs us to produce our content each month:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$50 on podcast hosting\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$10 on website hosting\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$40 on recording/editing software and equipment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$50 on books, TV shows, and movie purchases\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, we like to give some of that money back to the community we love and respect so much. We\u2019re hosting regular fan art contests for our We\u2019ve Got \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorm \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003epodcast that results in cash and other prizes. Part of your support goes directly toward funding these prizes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut by far the most costly part of producing these shows is the time investment. In order to deliver the quality content you guys expect we spend a lot of time producing each episode. As an example, here\u2019s approximately how much each episode of We\u2019ve Got Worm takes to produce:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e4 hours reading time per person\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e6 hours on show prep and scripts per person\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2 hours recording the episode per person\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 hour editing the episode\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 hour on art, show notes, publishing, and promotion.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u2019s just one of our weekly shows! Our dream is to one day be able to do this full time, but in the meantime, we\u2019ve got to juggle these time investments with our day jobs. This is why your support is absolutely critical. Not only does it encourage, focus and prioritize us, but each and every dollar you contribute gets us a step closer to our goal: To grow, expand, and spend our lives talking about great stories and why we love them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to visit our Patreon page! If you\u2019d like to support passionate independent criticism and analysis of great art we encourage you to pledge your support to The Daly Planet. In return, we\u2019ve got some great exclusive bonuses for each and every one of you. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
