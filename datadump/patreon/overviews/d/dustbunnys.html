    "summary": "Dust Bunnys are made up of a little bit of everything! Although they are known to form on their own under the right conditions, sometimes a little pocket lint from others can help a Dust Bunny grow bigger than they every dreamed! Dust Bunnys often dream that one day they will become large enough to absorb larger items like professional gear and production software. For now, Dust Bunnys will continue to tumble around wherever it may roam, picking up whatever it can and using it to fill your ears with new friends. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA word from Nick: You may already know this, but Dust Bunnys is a solo project that I officially launched around the start of 2018. My big dream is to reach a point where I can make a living by consistently deliver new music to you every week! I usually put over 12 hours into a song and it can become really frustrating when life forces me to pull away from making music. But I\u0027ll continue to work on bringing new music to your ears as often as I possibly can for now! I feel like I\u0027ll never be able to thank you enough for the support, but I\u0027ll try. And hey, if you can\u0027t afford to become a patron, just know that even knowing that people out there simply enjoy listening to my music is enough to make me a truly happy human. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR Hit that \"become a patron\" button and make it possible for Dust Bunnys to deliver new music to your ears even more often!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
