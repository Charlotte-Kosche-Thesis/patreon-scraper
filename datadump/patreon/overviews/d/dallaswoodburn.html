Thanks so much for stopping by my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy new collection of short stories, WOMAN, RUNNING LATE, IN A DRESS, will be published by Yellow Flag Press in March 2018 as winner of the Cypress \u0026amp; Pine Short Fiction Award. You can be first on the list to receive a signed copy! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Dallas Woodburn\u2019s collection of interwoven stories shows real maturity about the complexities of relationships of all kinds, and she doesn\u2019t shirk from the painful experiences of her characters. Even so, the writing is so lively and the scenes so engaging that the reader gets to move fluidly between heft and lightness. A terrific debut!\" \u003cbr\u003e-- Aimee Bender, author of The Color Master\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a writer, teacher, speaker, editor, publisher and coach. I am passionate about using the written word as a tool of empowerment. In a nutshell, my life\u2019s work is not only to share my stories, but also to help others tell the stories that matter most to them and embrace their best lives. THANK YOU to my supporters and patrons for enabling me to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping to support my creative writing of novels, short stories, essays and plays. Thank you for helping to support the launching of my new \"Masterpiece Day\" podcast, and hopefully in the future, the \"Dancing With The Pen\" podcast about the ups-and-downs of the writing life. And thank you for supporting the ongoing content creation for my blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://daybydaymasterpiece.com\"\u003eDay-by-Day Masterpiece\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write essays for my blog about the daily intricacies, musings, and big questions of life, and I include questions at the end of each blog post to encourage readers to think and journal about the topic for themselves. On this Patreon page, I will publish exclusive blog posts that are only available to supporters, along with behind-the-scenes videos, audio content, and recipes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy blog title \u201cDay-by-Day Masterpiece\u201d was inspired by one of my favorite quotes, which comes from the late, great \u003ca href=\"http://www.coachwooden.com/\"\u003eJohn Wooden\u003c/a\u003e. One of the maxims he lived his life by was, \u201cMake each day your masterpiece.\u201d These words remind me that each day is truly a treasure and a blessing. Each day is something to savor. Making your day a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d does not mean making each day \u201cperfect.\u201d Far from it \u2014 masterpieces are full of mistakes, trial-and-errors, messes and wrong turns and laughter and spontaneity. Indeed, I think that\u2019s part of what makes a day a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d \u2014 the surprises give our lives variety and richness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me, a masterpiece day is one that is filled with creative exploration, expression and connection. I am eager to share these riches with you, and I so hope you enjoy them. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
