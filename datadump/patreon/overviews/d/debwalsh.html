    "summary": "I\u2019ve been kicking around fandom for a long time \u2013 let\u2019s just\nsay I remember the world before the Internet, and that once upon a time, I\npublished paper zines. Art has always\nbeen a part of who I am. Art and story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI drew my first picture book when I was three. It was \u003cem\u003ePeter\nPan\u003c/em\u003e. I wanted a storybook of it, and\nthere wasn\u2019t one at hand, so I drew my own. In crayon. I wish I still had it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut that kind of defines who I am as an artist and as a\nwriter. I don\u2019t see what I want, so I\ncreate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove a movie, but don\u2019t get the ending I\u2019d like to\nhave? The happily ever after? The loose ends satisfactorily resolved? That\u2019s where fan fiction saves the day. And it provides a wonderful outlet for\npersonal exploration, a love of research, and those storytelling muscles one\nshould never lose.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSteve and Bucky didn\u2019t hug \u2013 something they would have\nnaturally done as two men who\u2019ve been best friends forever, and who were from\nthe 1940s \u2013 grumble, spit, hiss, okay, I\u2019ll draw it for myself. I\u2019ll write those scenes Marvel Studios didn\u2019t\ngive me. Heck, I\u2019ll create action\nfigures that hug to my heart\u2019s content!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove the Pops, but they don\u2019t make the character you\nwant? Kit-bash! For those of you who don\u2019t routinely redesign\nvinyl figures, that means take different kits \u2013 different figures \u2013 and bash\nthem together \u2013 recombine them. The term\ncomes from model kits, but it applies to figures.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m about \u2013 writing, art, toys. I know a number of people\nfollow me to see what I\u2019m up to, so it seemed like a good time to translate to\na Patreon. I already spend a lot of time\n(and money) here as a Patron \u2013 why not as a Creator, too? It\u2019s something I want to get more serious\nabout, and eventually look at reducing my hours in the corporate world to\nembrace more of the creative. What\nbetter way to get serious about than creating a Patreon?\u00a0 And what better way to do than than sharing it with you?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eNo matter how much the pledges total, each\nmonth I\u2019ll make a donation of 10% of the total to The Trevor Project. If we reach higher levels, I\u2019ll add more\nsocial justice charities. Note:I already personally donate monthly to\nPlanned Parenthood, ACLU, and Lambda Legal, plus the Pennsylvania environmental\ngroup, Penn Environment.\u00a0 That\u2019s the only\nreason none of them are listed below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on how things go, we might add the occasional\nmailing of prints and stickers, if there\u2019s interest, and possibly fanbooks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of all, thank you for being here.\u00a0 Let\u0027s enjoy our time together and have fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Deb\u003cbr\u003e"
