Thank you to all my Patrons for your support over the last year and I invite those new to this page to explore the free content and consider becoming a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eSince Antje and I are no longer working together exclusively, I am shifting the focus of this Patreon page to be around the healing power of dance in a more general sense rather than directly related to Cocr\u00e9a. Though your contributions will still go towards supporting the work of Cocr\u00e9a, my hope is for this space to be filled with dance videos and writing that inspire a desire to share dance as medicine for our hearts, minds and bodies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a look at the free content here and consider pledging to see more dance videos and content on the healing power of movement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Wren LaFeet\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFueled by his curiosity in spirituality, sexuality, global community, the natural world and human relations, Wren\u0027s devotion to love has been his guiding light, and partner dance the method of his understanding. He underwent a rigorous dance training at The Branson School, followed by a BA in Drama and Dance at University of Washington where he trained with Suzuki masters Steve Pearson and Robin Hunt, and professional dancer Peter Kyle in P3. After four years cutting his teeth in the Seattle entertainment industry, Wren\u0027s work truly came alive when he discovered the Gene Keys and the OneDoorLand community in Portland, OR and gained a holographic overview of humanity through which to better understand our Shadows and greatest potential Genius.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn working somatically in his contemplation of the Gene Keys, applying his study of humanity through theater as well as applying his highly developed intuitive ability, Wren has enabled countless students to dance with joy, helped free insights locked in the body, brought people into a greater awareness of their sensual nature and even assisted in the healing of chronic disease. Wren\u2019s goal is to help guide people into right relationship with the moment; to listen and respond appropriately to what is being called for in service to the highest good of all involved. He is an author in the published work, \u201cReinhabiting the Village,\u201d a TEDx speaker on \u201cPioneering a New Renaissance through Movement\" and creator of the mindful movement modality, Cocr\u00e9a\u2122.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

This will offer more people access to the work, giving them the means to acquire the pre-requisite credits for becoming a Cocr\u00e9a facilitator should they desire, and steward they\u0027re own Cocr\u00e9a community practice.",
