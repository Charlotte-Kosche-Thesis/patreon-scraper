A dream that someday there would be a game which bronies could point to and say: \u201cThis is much-much more than just a video game about ponies.\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI wish that someday bronies would come to E3, Gamescom or another big game presentation and watch as someone comes onto stage and says: \u201cwe made a game about ponies. And it is amazing.\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI wish that someday bronies would tell an exciting, wonderful, and emotional story, set in a unique magical beautiful world. A story about deep, developed characters with magnificent wings, shiny hooves, majestic horns and hearts as strong as horses. A story that will make players look at the world from a different perspective. A story that will make you rethink your opinions and points of view. A story that will prompt people not only to laugh, but also question ideas such as \u201cWhat is the true difference between good and evil?\u201d, \u201cWhat does it feel like to be immortal?\u201d, \u201cIs there really any way to make each and every person in our world happy?\u201d. A story that will break stereotypes and become one of the most beloved masterpieces in gaming industry.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI waited quite a lot, but nothing like that has been happening. Then I asked myself: \u201cwhy should I wait for something like that, if I can make it happen myself?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is quite a tough goal right there, right? To a lot of people it even seemed impossible, considering the fact that I had no skills or any understanding how games and storytelling worked at all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tImpossible. Yeah, they said that it\u2019s impossible.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter that I said: \u003cstrong\u003e\u201cin that case I will try doing it, just for fun.\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e I have learned every detail of game development, worked on creating something good for quite a while, polished my ideas to the point where I had to cut more than 90% of the original concepts, throw my own work into the trash just to make the game better, and finally came to the alpha stage of the project I have been working on.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that was the point when I published first gameplay video of the first part of the Ambient series \u2013 a game called \u003cstrong\u003eAmbient.Prologue\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have started making:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAn action adventure game with RPG elements. The story centers around two sisters as they try to find their place in the beautifully hostile world around them. You will play as Astrum, the elder sister, as she goes about her life with Krinita by her side, facing chalenges, danger, emotional situations, trying to find and reach a certain goal.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter the video was published, lots of talented people from completely different places in the world have contacted me and offered their help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that was a start of the story of the A Little Bit Different team.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd this is a story we are building together now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt sure will take an ennormous amount of time and effort. It\u2019s the goal I have been walking towards for about 3 years. And this is a goal I\u2019m now going towards with a group of great friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout a year has passed from the start of ALBD working together. The year of tough decisions, lots of expirimentation, valueble lessons in game development and team management. The project we planed before transformed to something much more serious now. With bronies support, loyal, tallented new team and big amount of expirience \u003cstrong\u003ewe redefined our goals and style from scratch\u003c/strong\u003e so we could make a game with trully \u003cstrong\u003efun, interesting gameplay, full independent emotional story and unique beauty in graphics and sound, supported by good optimization\u003c/strong\u003e. We set the mark of quality we could be proud of, the one that can be called nothing less then amazing. And at this point we understood: \u003cstrong\u003eThis game is not just a prologue anymore\u003c/strong\u003e. Now it is a full first episode/volume in Ambient series. Now that is \u003cstrong\u003eAmbient.White\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tThe one really inspiring show there on television and web once said \u201cFriendship is magic!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo let\u2019s show them that Friendship really can do magic.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
