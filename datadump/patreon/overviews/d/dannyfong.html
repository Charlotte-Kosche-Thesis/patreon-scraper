I\u0027m heavily influenced by vocal music (think Hi-Lo\u0027s, Singers Unlimited, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mercer, Nancy Wilson, Ella.. lots of old stuff), jazz big band music, 60s and 70s soul, Motown, R\u0026amp;B, Funk, singer-songwriters, and folk music. As I discover more music that has shaped the past, I find new inspirations to cultivate my own own music-making on my online stage.\u003cstrong\u003e You are my audience! \u003c/strong\u003eIn my early YouTube days I was focusing on view-chasing and people-pleasing and I\u0027ve finally found a groove that expresses myself and my musical integrity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn and outside of music, I\u0027m a jack of all trades, master of none who has an enormous amount of love for the music I make and the people I interact with. I want to be a positive influence in your life as a creator and friend, and I welcome messages from anyone who wants to share thoughts and feelings about music or anything else you\u0027re passionate about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m doing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I continue to work toward bigger and better things with my vocal group Accent (www.patreon.com/accent), \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube\u003c/strong\u003e (along with a few other local musical jobs) \u003cstrong\u003eis my job!\u003c/strong\u003e We live in a modern age where creators of music and other content can make a living doing what we love, but only with the support of our Patrons! If you enjoy the music I make, please consider becoming a Patron.\u003cstrong\u003e Just like tip jar at a local music gig, Patreon is one way us musicians can make a living (except my music doesn\u0027t have live crowd at music venues). I intend you continue bringing you a professional product that can musically enrich your life because all of the people I\u0027ll work with are a collection of independent professional musicians of whom you will likely never discover.

Typically it\u0027s 1-2 each month. You can set a monthly maximum as well, $10 pledge and a $20 monthly maximum, means you only will support up to two videos each month.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would you want to support me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWith each pledge amount you have access to special rewards for each tier level. I want to be a creator that you\u0027re proud to support, and am happy to create custom rewards if there\u0027s something I can do outside of what I\u0027ve already listed. (Customized messages? Social media shout-outs? Personal video conversations? Voice Lessons? Let\u0027s talk!

You also get to observe how I live my life and establish a friendship or connection with me. I\u0027m not a big shot looking to pocket some cash from fans, I\u0027m a struggling musician who wants to create sounds and visuals for your viewing pleasure. I always want to hear from you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a supporter of many other projects and live musicians and I know that it feels pretty good to support things that interest you, not to mention you\u0027ll always have a great story to tell, and new sounds to enjoy.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo sum it all up:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic is one of the few languages I understand and with your help, I\u0027m able to work freely and live a fulfilling life. The amount of hours I put into rehearsals and production, considering appropriate locations and researching costs, and coordinating availability of the other busy people who are willing to share their time with me, is likely unknown or overlooked by you, my online audience. I look forward to creating behind-the-scenes footage and sharing all of these experiences with you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery pledge makes a big difference to me and doesn\u0027t have to cost you more than a cup of coffee. A $3 pledge might seem meaningless alone, but fifty $3 pledges, once or twice a month can cover many of my production costs, which all come out of my pocket.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsking or begging strangers for money is very difficult and I try to be upfront about everything I\u0027m doing.

A large part of my identity as an arranger is to create unique textures using only voices. I\u0027ve developed my arranging style over the last decade and found my identity in arranging music in a challenging and rewarding way for singers. My greatest musical influences come from 1920-30s jazz and 1960s-70s Motown, soul, pop, and rock.\u003cbr\u003e",
