If you like my videos, well, maybe future ones might help people. \u00a0That\u0027s what I try for. \u00a0Even if all I can help just one person crawl out of the dark pit of depression, or religious indoctrination (in my case it was both). \u00a0I certainly am giving it my best shot, which is all anyone can do!"

So I really think people can make a difference by what they say and speaking out. \u00a0That is all I hope to do with what\u0027s left of my life. \u00a0That, and taking care of as many animals as I possibly can!",
