    "summary": "G\u0027day,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a writer based in Australia. I studied theatre at uni and ended up writing plays. Some of these plays, like \u003cem\u003eApril\u0027s Fool\u003c/em\u003e, ended up being quite successful and have toured Australia and are studied in schools. A couple of years ago I published my first book, \u003cem\u003eHow to Be Happy\u003c/em\u003e, a memoir about my teenage years. I wanted to talk to young people about surviving depression and anxiety directly. I\u0027ve been lucky to win some awards for my work over the years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Slow News Weekly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a few spin-off internet projects over the years, including a couple of podcasts. But just last year a blog I created called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.slownewsweekly.org\"\u003eSlow News Weekly\u003c/a\u003e really took off. I believe the more people are reasonably informed about world events, the better our society can become.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.slownewsweekly.org\"\u003eSlow News Weekly\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027s \u003c/em\u003emission is to deliver the week\u0027s essential news in style.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you post?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTwice a week. I deliver the week\u0027s most essential news with an Australian focus on Fridays. On Tuesdays I post a deep dive into a news-worthy issue. All posts are a thousand words or less. I want to fill in gaps that most news leaves behind. Why is North Korea so pissed? Is environmental apocalypse inevitable? What are Australian politicians exactly \u003cem\u003edoing \u003c/em\u003eall the time? What the hell is Brexit? Will any or all these things inevitably cause armageddon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you make money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSlow News Weekly is edited, written, published and hosted by me personally. I don\u0027t make a dime. My income comes from three seperate channels. Firstly, my \u0027day jobs\u0027 - these may include teaching, editing, marketing, online services, and whatever other casual contracts come my way. Secondly, my writing. A couple of times a year, if I\u0027m lucky, a publisher or theatre company will pay me to write a show. Sometimes I get royalties. Thirdly, \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon pledges \u003c/strong\u003erepresent the most stable way that my writing is directly supported.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes, thank you! If you\u0027ve read this far I\u0027m so grateful that you would give me this much of your time. I\u0027ve now been writing long enough to know that I\u0027m only interested in working on projects that help make the world a better place. Thank you for helping me achieve that vision. I work tirelessly to put good writing into the world. It\u0027s why I\u0027ve been put on the planet. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support. \u003c/strong\u003eReally. It means the world.\u003cbr\u003e"
