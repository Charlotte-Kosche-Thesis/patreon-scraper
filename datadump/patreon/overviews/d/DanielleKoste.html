    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u2019m Danielle\u003c/strong\u003e, but if you\u2019re here you probably already know that. On the off chance that you don\u2019t though, let me introduce myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14941921.Danielle_Koste\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eauthor\u003c/a\u003e. Well\u2026 sort of. My debut novel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28873988-pulse\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePULSE\u003c/a\u003e has yet to hit shelves, but my unofficial job title didn\u0027t stop my first draft from hitting over a million views on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/user/skinandbonesx\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWattpad\u003c/a\u003e since uploading it in 2012. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve had a long, crazy ride from there, both involving my writing life, and involving my personal life, but I don\u2019t regret a moment of it because it\u2019s all brought me here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u2019s here?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, \u003cem\u003ehere\u003c/em\u003e is finally getting to live my dream of sharing the stories and characters in my head with the world (so I can seem just a little less crazy when I talk about them constantly). \u003cem\u003eHere\u003c/em\u003e is on the path to my goal, to my career, to the plan I\u2019ve had brewing in my head since I first decided I wanted to write for a living, way back in junior high after reading a book that changed my view of the world of fiction entirely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere\u2019s just one drawback to being \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehere,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e though. \u003c/strong\u003eEven when I pride myself in being a pretty productive person as my Writer\u2019s Anxiety(TM) allows it, (I mean, not everyone has completed\u00a0NaNoWriMo multiple times or finishing a whole novel in less than a year, good job me) it still always seems like there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day. I do what I can to try and make the most of my time, but it always seem to slip away, my fingers unable to write fast enough for how quickly life passes by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a part-time which I enjoy very much and allows me to hoard some of my precious life hours over making more money because time has always seemed to be of more value and tends to be easier wasted than a wad of cash. I make just enough to pay my bills and that works for me pretty nicely, most of the time at least (we\u2019ve all got that itch for spending money sometimes). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven with my halved \u201cday job\u201d hours and meticulous budgeting of my \u201cfree\u201d time, I can\u2019t make plans for things like exhaustion, unexpected expenses, or even the forever looming Seasonal Depression (by seasonal I, of course, mean whatever season the depression decides to arrive in) and because of all this, juggling both a current job and a budding career is a balancing act that often leaves me pinching pennies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, my ultimate goal would be to learn how to sleep and eat at the same time (could you imagine the time that would be saved!) But until then, I find myself often forced to cut into my designated writing time simply because I don\u2019t have the energy or motivation to make the most of the few hour I\u2019ve allotted myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe solution?\u003c/strong\u003e Well obviously becoming an International Best Selling Author is the simplest way of going about it. But it turns out that\u2019s not quite as easy as most people would like to believe (I know - I know. It can\u2019t be that hard right? I mean, 50 Shades sold pretty good!). Unfortunately I\u2019m a four leaf clover and lucky rabbit\u0027s foot away from the kind of good fortune it takes to become a best seller. It\u2019s not impossible, in fact I believe with dedication and passion, anything is possible, but a lot of authors never reach such high regard, and that\u2019s OK too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I don\u2019t have in fame and fortune, I do have in friends. And family. And \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003efans\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. Amazing, beautiful people who have been along with me for this ride all the way from 2012 and earlier. People who were there at my lowest and watched me develop over the years. People who got to experience the excitement of my climb to a career in fiction. People who really truly just appreciate me and my work, and maybe have a buck or two to show that appreciation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo that\u2019s what this patreon is for.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u2019s a way for you out there, the person that wants to give me a little hand towards my goals, to reach out and boost me up. To maybe even help me make my dream career a reality. A full-time reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t need money.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIn fact, I\u2019ve been quite blessed in my life that I\u0027ve never had to experience what it truly feels like to not have any money. Just like a lot of people, there have been tight times and close calls, diets that weren\u0027t imposed with the intention of losing weight, and lots and lots of waiting for the next paycheck, but I\u0027ve always had a roof over my head and people to support me. I\u2019m in a good place now, even if I hadn\u2019t always been, and I will continue pursuing my writing career whether or not my patreon is successful. Actually, I\u0027ll continuing writing whether or not my career is even successful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do need is freedom.\u003c/strong\u003e Freedom to do more of what I love. Freedom to live off of my passion and creativity. Freedom to create and share more of my craft with the people who appreciate it. If it was up to me, writing would already be my full-time job. And who knows, perhaps with help, it could be. I\u2019m not looking for charity, so if you pledge, I\u2019ll know that it\u2019s because you truly support my work and want to see me succeed, and unconditional appreciation like that is the best kind of encouragement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOf course, I\u0027d want to give back for your support. \u003c/strong\u003eSo part of starting this patreon is committing to being more active in my little community. I want to share more with the people that want to have more. I want to show everyone how much I appreciate them being there through it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreons of $1 or more can look forward to early access to chapters of current WIPs that will later be uploaded to wattpad, along with exclusive access to \"extra\", such as flash fiction, side-stories, and in some cases even requested pieces and small excerpts from PULSE and WHAT THE FLOWER SAYS OF DEATH.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, higher pledgers can expect early cover reveals, merchandise and ebooks giveaways, signed and personalized copies of my novels upon release, shipped from me too you (Maybe I\u0027ll even include some lovely swedish goodies for these special someones)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReaching my goals will also open new opportunities for all patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMost of all though\u003c/strong\u003e, becoming my patron allows me to interact with you more, which is one of my favorite parts of writing. Even if you can only pledge $1, I get to have a place where I can share my passion with those who truly appreciate it and are just as passionate about it as I am, and that\u0027s a beautiful thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you think so too, please consider pledging!\u003c/strong\u003e"
