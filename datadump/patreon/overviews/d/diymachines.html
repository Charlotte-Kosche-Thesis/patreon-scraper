It\u0027s just sometimes we need a bit of inspiration to pull our sleeves up and create something - and it doesn\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s exactley what I shared with you or your own version of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be truly awesome if I could offset the cost of the materials required for researching and designing projects. At the moment I work second shifts (as a furniture assembler) to earn the extra pennies required to create my videos. I can find the time to share my creations with you, I need your kind help so that I can afford things such as spools of plastic for the printer and electronic components. It\u0027s with your help I hope to be able to keep inventing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron of mine you\u0027ll get exclusive early access to videos before they\u0027re published as well as the ability to submit your own ideas for me to work on bringing to life. I\u0027ll also exclusively share with you my original design files so you can download them and tweak the models as you wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone that has chosen to support DIY Machines so far - it really makes a huge difference to the amount of content I can create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, all patrons get immortalised and famous when I personally thank you in front of the world with a mention in my next video. That is just how much your support means to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChow for now. :)"
