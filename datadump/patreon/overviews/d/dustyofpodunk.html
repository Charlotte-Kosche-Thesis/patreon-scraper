My name is\nDustyofPodunk and I have been making games and youtube videos since\n2010. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor the past almost 8 years I have been\ntrying to do things the \u201cright\u201d way. What I mean by that is\nmaking game prototypes then preparing pitch documents and then trying\nto find a publisher to fund the game like how a development bussiness\nis \u201csuppose\u201d to be run. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only problem is I had no success at\nthis I was able to get some contract work here and there but none of\nmy own stuff was getting of the ground this way. I had always labeled\nby self as \u201cindependent not indie\u201d, I use to say \u201cI am not one\nof those artist developers trying to make something strange for the\nsake of it I was going to make things that were going to get\npublished and have the market behind them and blah blah blah\u201d \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look back and shutter at my thinking\nover that time. It was dishonest not just to the games I could have\nbeen making but the heart of why I make games. Around this same time\nI was running a youtube channel that never really got off the ground.\nWith the gift of hindsight I can see where I went wrong in both\nrespects I wasnt making things that had my heart in them, I was\nmaking things for someone else I was making them for me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTldr; I need money to live and buy dog\nfood AND keep making free content (games videos etc)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOne core tenant has remained from my\ntime trying to being a bussiness man my company Podunk Studioz first\ntagline was \u201cGiving Gaming Back to Gamers\u201d \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to produce afforable games\nthat were still of a high quality and that is still a want but rather\nthen afforadable I want to release free games so that anyone of any\nbudget has something to enjoy.
