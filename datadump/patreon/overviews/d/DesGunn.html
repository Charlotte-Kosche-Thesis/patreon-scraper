I run a tea tavern in Red Lodge, MT, but I also write fantasy. All my life, I\u2019ve adored writing, and I\u2019ve strived to be the best I can be. At this point in my life, I\u2019ve published two books, have three more on the way, and plenty of ideas in the meanwhile. This patreon account is to fund my writing, which I\u0027m currently having a hard time giving focus when I have a tavern to run.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLook, I love my tavern, I love it to bits. It\u2019s a family business, and has been for fifteen years. My parents moved out of the hustle-and-bustle of California to buy a ranch in Montana, and in no small part due to my father finding a bookstore for sale there. They ran that bookstore when I was too small to know what was going on, they brought me on to develop people skills as a young teen (thank god they did, but I\u2019m sure we lost some business. I was awful), and I eventually started to manage chunks of it for them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt all really kicked into gear when we put in a tea bar, and I dove into it head-first. I loved it, which is funny, since I never loved tea before. But something about it just brought out the best in me. I managed it, I ran it for them, and I pushed it to levels beyond their expectations over and over.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://desdemonagunn.com/books/bio1-print\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52e18c18e4b0e4434af1e4a7/5a297f18f9619ab40cee12d5/5a298391c8302545c8d98276/1512692130774/!Final+Desi+Web.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 250px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIn 2016, we sold the bookstore to a new bookstore cooperative, and agreed to run it for them for a time.

It\u2019s great, and I love it, I\u2019m passionate about my job, and I love making tea for people and making friends this way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut good lord, I miss writing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI wrote my first book in 2013 in two months, when I was just starting to assistant manage the tea bar in the bookstore, and I edited it to death for two and a half years. Then, I finally published it through\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.proseyr.com\"\u003eProseyr Publishing\u003c/a\u003e in November of 2016. It took two years to write book two, and it\u2019s taken two more to write book 3.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is not the schedule I want myself on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI long to spend days writing at a time, but that\u2019s just not feasible when I\u2019m managing a business. This Patreon account is to allow me to take time off to work on my writing. The more money you throw at me, the more I\u2019ll be able to devote to my craft.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.desdemonagunn.com/books/bio2-print\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52e18c18e4b0e4434af1e4a7/5a297f18f9619ab40cee12d5/5a298399652dead95226dcfb/1512692127130/final-1000.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 250px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI\u2019ll never get away from the tea trade; I love it too much. I\u2019ll still be a large presence in Phoenix Pearl Tea, but I won\u2019t devote my entire life to it anymore. My goal is to make enough money here to support my writing full-time, to the point that I can work the tavern part-time as Tea Master, choosing blends and tasting for the business, leaving the managing to someone else.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u2019s more, though.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m what you call transgender. Means I was born one gender, but am really, in my heart of hearts, another. In my case, I was born male, but am honest-to-all a woman. Unfortunately, that\u2019s an expensive mistake to happen in my genetics. This means I have a lot of expenses, from medication to laser hair removal to therapy to voice-training to electrolysis to out-and-out reassignment surgery. It\u2019s expensive.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI won\u2019t lie, a good part of this patreon is gonna be funding that. The more I make off my writing, the more I can become on the outside who I am on the inside. And that all starts with focusing my efforts on the job I love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo here\u0027s what I offer you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eTabanica\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eFirst Friday of Every Month\n\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is a serial I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a long time now. She\u2019s a character that\u2019s been in my head for years, and I\u2019ve had her story worked out for a while, but I just haven\u2019t figured out how to do her. My Barons ($4+/month) have access to a new chapter of this ongoing novella every month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m posting a chapter of this adventuring serial once a month outlining the story of Tabanica, huntress of the wilds of Southern Runnir, and how she interacts with the world. It takes place in the same universe as the Biomancer Quintet, so the Adra universe, so it has the same species of folk and same land masses you know and love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe Mead Wars\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eUnlocks at $750/month\n\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOkay, I\u2019m pretty stoked about this. The Mead Wars is an adaptation of a Pathfinder campaign I played years ago that I\u2019ve wanted to adapt into prose form for quite a while. A lot of my best stories come from D\u0026amp;D, hell, Biomancy started as me writing down the campaign I was playing in and evolved well beyond that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis will be a thriller set in Liam Albreight\u2019s and Osadoguhn Viaxy\u2019s youths when they were just getting started in the Gorenyan Guild of Assassins. It will take place in Kunurin, a town in Vol\u2019Tyr that specializes in the production and sale of premium meads, as well as other trades. But things will turn dark for our heroes as they find out that not all is shiny in the mead capitol of Vol\u2019Tyr.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eEnd-Game\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the end, I wanna be doing constant streams of content here. I\u2019d love to do thrice-a-week mini-stories, weekly serial chapters, yearly books and regular extra content to boot. Unfortunately, I just don\u2019t have the money to do that. I need you guys to boost my income, boost my morale on my writing, remind me that people are actually reading my stuff by throwing money at me to read it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more successful this Patreon is, the more writing gets in the hands of you, the consumers. My Initiates, my Barons. My Wardens and Sheriffs, my esteemed Archons and Imperators. My unbelievably gracious Emperors and ungodly-frivolous Grand Emperors. Thank you all for your money, thank you all for helping me on this grand adventure, and thank you all for giving what you do. It means the world to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow I know I can\u2019t just expect you to\u00a0give me money for writings you\u2019ve never seen before. I know plenty of you have read by books, but for those who haven\u2019t, here\u2019s some free samples of each of what I offer.
