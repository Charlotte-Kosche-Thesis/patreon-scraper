    "summary": "I\u0027ve been developing content for the Traveller role playing game for years, first as a hobbyist releasing free content, and I decided to try my hand at self publishing in late 2011. \u00a0Over the last two years, DSL Ironworks has released around a dozen products, focused mainly around deck plans and starships. \u00a0Up to this point, DSL Ironworks had been focused on development of the Foreven sector in the Official Traveller Universe, under the Traveller OGL and Foreven Free licenses. With the release of Mongoose Traveller 2.0, those licenses are being phased out, and all Traveller materials are being released on Drivethrurpg.com under the Travellers Aid Society tag. Unfortunately, due to changes in the licensing structure, control of intellectual property, and an increase in royalties, all Foreven material has been removed for sale. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, DSL Ironworks has shifted focus in a couple of ways. \u00a0The first is the move to supporting the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?keywords=cepheus+engine\u0026amp;x=0\u0026amp;y=0\u0026amp;author=\u0026amp;artist=\u0026amp;pfrom=\u0026amp;pto=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCEPHEUS ENGINE\u003c/a\u003e, which is a 2d6 sci-fi game system based off existing OGL materials with an old school feel. The second shift is away from a published setting (the official Traveller universe) to an original setting called \u003cstrong\u003eENIGMATIC. \u003c/strong\u003eThe basis of this setting is near future, near earth, gritty sci-fi in the tradition of some of my favorite shows- Alien, Blade Runner, Outland, The Expanse, Space: Above and Beyond, Space: 1999, and a host of others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to take the entire project to the next level, make it more accessible to my patrons (you!), and increase the overall quality of my products. \u00a0Your support can help me do that, and in the process, you\u0027ll have access to the content that I generate as soon as it\u0027s finished, rather than waiting for a completed product to be released (although as a patron, you\u0027ll have access to the final product as well). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it works. Each month, I\u0027ll be releasing several modules, consisting of 3-5+ pages of content related to a given subject in the \u003cstrong\u003eENIGMATIC \u003c/strong\u003esetting- maps, art, stats, etc. \u00a0To start with, we\u0027ll have ten types of modules being released - ships, vehicles, planets, subsectors, locations, organizations, aliens, animals, non-player characters, and short adventures. \u00a0Even non-patrons will be able to follow my progress through the background text and fiction that will be posted for free. \u00a0I aim to release between two and five modules per month; these modules may or may not be related to each other. \u00a0All of them will pertain to the Enigmatic setting. \u00a0So, for example, one month I may release a ship, the vehicle it carries, the organization that uses the ship, and a short adventure that uses all three. \u00a0The next month, I may release three ships and two vehicles that are completely unrelated. \u00a0This ensures a variety of content that patrons have access to right away, gives me a bit more freedom to work on things that I\u0027d like to focus on, and helps keep me from getting burned out on a given topic (such as working up all 120 planets in one shot). Some of these modules will be released as a paid product, for which your pledge will be charged. There may be multiple paid products over the course of the month, but Patreon does allow you to limit the amount spent each month so you can maintain a budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I\u0027ve got enough material to put out a finished product (a book of ships, for example), those items will be collected, re-edited, and laid out for a final product that will be available to the general public and my patrons. \u00a0As a patron, you\u0027ll have access to everything much sooner than the final release. \u00a0You\u0027ll also be receiving rewards and perks that you won\u0027t be able to get anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very excited about exploring the \u003cstrong\u003eENIGMATIC \u003c/strong\u003euniverse, and I hope you\u0027ll join me in that exploration."
