    "summary": "When Dram Cetus first came into my life (that\u0027s his picture, by the way, not mine) he was a joke, an\nexcuse for an intelligent man to make some rather stupid mistakes about his\nforeign hosts. What Barra Ursus read in the little book that Dram Cetus\nwrote led him astray, but that was mainly Jekka\u2019s fault, and that\u2019s another\nstory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome dozen or so stories later, and the world through which\nDram Cetus travelled is beginning to take shape. It\u2019s also at risk of becoming\na place of contradictions, as the needs of individual stories impose\nconflicting constraints upon its sketchy geography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy desire to share this world \u2013 the world of the Khyran\nprovinces and of the Tormaben plains \u2013 and my desire for it to be a world that\nworks have come together in a project that brings Dram Cetus back to life, not,\nthis time, as comic relief, but as a traveller, a diarist, and a collector of\nfolk tales. That\u0027s what I want to share with you here, Dram\u0027s diaries, a glossary to help you navigate his world, and some of the folk tales that he collects on his way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDram is a comfortable presence in the back of my mind, and\nhe and I are in this for the long run. We both want to thank you for the\nsupport that makes his continuing travels possible, and that will in time allow me to bring out a collection of stories from all the lands between the mountains and the sea.\u003cbr\u003e"
