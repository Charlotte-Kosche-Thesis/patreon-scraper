    "summary": "My name is Tim Franzke. I am currently a student of World Heritage Studies but most of you most likely know me from Google Plus where I talk about games and play them. I like to consider myself a pillar of the \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/communities/100084733231320276299\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDungeon World Tavern\u003c/a\u003e, having posted there since March of 2013. During that time I followed most conversations there and always attempted to help players better to understand the game to get the most out of it. I have collected some of the best advice given there in posts like\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MCAVL9DzB3EZqbzRb57YQgzZkuhE32x89vvSzVZ8Ke0\u0026amp;authuser=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Animal Companion FAQ\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f2MR7NyN41T9QxsYXUhMJCUvXWWX0VYxp1tAtYiOxWs\u0026amp;authuser=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThings to do in the first session\u003c/a\u003e (that has been translated into two languages). I also posted different compendium classes and custom moves to the tavern and organized the #ClassWeek community events.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan\u0027t you just continue to do that Tim? Why a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLife as a student isn\u0027t cheap and with my Master Thesis approaching next semester I will be harder pressed for time. I want to continue talking to all of you about Dungeon World and writing more in depth guides to further the understanding of the game. I will also be getting married in August and I need to prioritize for that too. Having a bit of support (morally even more importantly then financially) from all of you can enable me to continue to be a voice in our community without cutting back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou will get posts and advice from me as you are used to but I will also write more condensed and precise \u003cstrong\u003eGuides\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to certain aspects of the game. Aspects like how to think about \"Encounters\" or Action scenes in Dungeon World. How to improve your pacing or how you can exploit your prep better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am also really eager to start working on \u003cstrong\u003eStyle Guides,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003emy take on how one can do setting or genre supplements with Dungeon World as well as \u003cstrong\u003eClass Guides\u003c/strong\u003e, i.e. reviews of Dungeon World Classes that are out there. \u003cbr\u003eI also want to take your feedback and write about everything you want to know or discuss as well as pick up topics that are hot in the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is to release 3 Guides per Month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan anyone see these Guides?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYES! \u003c/strong\u003eThe plan plan is to release the Guides for free to everyone. I write these guides to help you all so putting them behind a pay-wall seems counterintuitive to me.\u003cbr\u003e(Setting Guides might stay Backer Exclusive though)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
