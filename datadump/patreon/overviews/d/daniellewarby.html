    "summary": "Hi potential patrons! Many of you would have come here via my Women in Sport email newsletter but for those who haven\u0027t, here\u0027s a little about me and why I\u0027m asking you to part with your hard earned cash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\u00a0an advocate for women in sport and have been working to promote women\u2019s sport since 2006.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking with elite athletes, sports organisations and the media, I\u0027ve built up the largest women\u2019s sport network in the country. That\u0027s Australia \ud83d\ude09\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was previously the managing\u00a0editor of \u003cem\u003eZela\u003c/em\u003e, SBS\u2019s website dedicated to women in sport; Board Director of both the Australian Womensport and Recreation Association (AWRA) and Womensport NSW; Community manager at Sport for Women; Strategist and content producer at \u003cem\u003eThe Women\u2019s Game\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now? I run \u003cem\u003eSporting Sheilas\u003c/em\u003e, an independent media outlet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the field, I\u0027m a life member of The Flying Bats Women\u2019s Football Club, as a (pretty rubbish) player for over 10 years with 7 years on the organising committee including 2 as President. The Flying Bats is now the largest lesbian soccer club in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn December 2012, I was a finalist in the Australian Sport Commission Media Awards for reporting on Women in Sport. I received this award for my work on the London 2012 Olympics \u0026amp; Paralympics for Sports Hydrant\u2019s Sport for Women site\u00a0and was presented with the award by the Federal Sports Minister, Senator Kate Lundy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was also recently awarded the \u2018Local Hero\u2019 Legacy Award from the Federation of Gay Games for my work promoting women in sport and The Flying Bats in the LGBTI community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why am I doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m on the look-out for my next women\u0027s sport project. I\u0027m a collaborator and an innovator, a square peg in a round hole looking to do things differently to what the current media landscape offers. I believe that opportunities come to those who make their own luck. So that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing here, asking for help and making my own luck. In the future, I\u0027ll be posting larger reward tiers looking for collaborators to work with me on some exciting projects I have coming up. For now, I\u0027d like your support in assisting with the ongoing publication of my women\u0027s sport email newsletter, which you\u0027ll receive weekly whether you contribute $1 or not... but I hope that you do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://us7.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=d928fd7457f6d465c1a2d5a79\u0026amp;id=c60dfa8a41\"\u003eTake a look at some sample emails and subscribe\u003c/a\u003e."
