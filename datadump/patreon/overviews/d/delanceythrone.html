I\u0027ll have a space to send you my work in high-quality that sites like Facebook couldn\u0027t allow. I will be able to send you my written works and receive your opinions on where my Youtube videos should go next. I can share with you my recommendations of film, music, other artists, and give you articles on how I perceive these.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing I am most excited about is the prospect (the fantasy?) that your support will help grow our apparel into something unique and unseen. Clothing that isn\u0027t simply cover art pasted to a shirt or some hurried design that lacks nuance and expression. We want our apparel to fill the void for people that appreciate street fashion but want to wear the \u003cstrong\u003eart \u003c/strong\u003eof film and games\u00a0that\u00a0they love.

Delancey Throne really wants to offer as much as it can to \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e, and your support makes that so much easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve rambled a lot, and if you\u0027ve read this and have a genuine interest in supporting, then from the bottom of my heart, \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn the words of the Gramercy Riff\u0027s leader Cyrus,\u003cstrong\u003e \u0027CAN YOU DIG IT?\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eRhys Ware\u003c/em\u003e - \u003cem\u003eDelancey Throne\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
