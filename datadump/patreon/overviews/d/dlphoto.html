     "description": "A big goal of mine is a basic equipment upgrade. I\u0027m trying to save for an A7RII body. In college I learned on a Pentax K1000 and an Olympus wide angle that my grandmother gave me. In 2009, I invested $1k on a Nikon D90 (I will always love that camera) and shot over half a million photos with it before its final demise in 2015. I\u0027m currently shooting with a glitchy Sony A6000 which is nonetheless an incredible camera and a remarkeable acheivement at its price point. It also has the potential to work with the collection of old minolta lenses that my father gave me although this is somewhat limited because it is not \u0027full frame\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Sony A7RII (body) costs about $3k. In addition to being \u0027full frame\u0027 it offers 40+ megapixel resolution, a huge upgrade and excellent for landscapes and large format printing. \u00a0The camera has extremely high iso capability (100,000+) for shooting in low light (can shoot 4k video in moonlight) and the mirrorless design is extremely fast and generally represents a revolution in technological advancement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts true that equipment is not the most important consideration. Historically, \u00a0I have valued the time of the very talented models I have had the good fortune to work with over equipment costs 10-1. \u00a0I do not regret this decision as it is my models which are truly to thank for what is ultimately produced.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe acquisition of a \u0027pro grade\u0027 camera represents a professional milestone for me as I beleive that my models (and the work itself) deserve it and I beleive I am well poised to exploit its potential and help take my work to the next level.",
