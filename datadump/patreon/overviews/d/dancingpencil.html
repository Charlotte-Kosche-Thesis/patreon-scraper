So I\u2019m putting it right up front. I\u2019m having fun making my comics, and I\u2019ve got\nsome cool stuff coming up, and I\u2019m looking forward to having you come along on\nthe ride! Thanks again!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Actual Start\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI tell people I\u2019ve been making funny pictures for as long as I\u2019ve been\nable to press a drawing instrument to paper. My mother also claims that as a little kid I had a funny sense of humor\nthat was evident from way back in toddler time. With that combination, it was inevitable that I would develop a love for\ncomics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was fortunate to be born back when the Silver Age of comics was just\nstarting to take flight. You could find spinner\nracks in just about every corner store, and when I discovered them, comic\nprices had recently jumped from ten to twelve cents(!) each.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeeling Nostalgic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn Romita had just taken over the drawing reins for Spider-Man from\nSteve Ditko, Jack Kirby was still busily working on Fantastic Four, Thor,\nCaptain America (which was still in Tales of Suspense) Hulk (which was in Tales\nto Astonish) and a lot of other stuff, and Stan Lee was still writing and\nediting almost all of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMeanwhile, Adam West was appearing twice a week on TV as \u003cem\u003eBatman!\u003c/em\u003e and I\nwas young enough to not realize that it was played for laughs. I took it seriously, and my mother said that\nwhen we went to see the Batman Movie in theaters a couple of years later, I was\nmortified and crushed that the audience was laughing at my hero.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThose were the very formative years. As I grew and I realized that could draw pretty well and loved to tell\nstories, I would create my own mini-comics that I would share with my circle of\nfriends. I enjoyed creating my own comics as a personal hobby, but I never\nthought about reaching a wider audience with my comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToo Much Looking Back!\u00a0 A Leap Forward\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJump forward to 2008 when I somehow stumbled across a podcast called\nWebcomics Weekly, and publishing comics on line seemed like\na possibility. Meanwhile, I was doing\nweb design at a job that I wasn\u2019t too fond of,\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t on the best of\nterms with my boss, and in the middle of all of this, I came up with the tag\nline \u201cYou Think YOUR Boss is BAD, Try Working for a Super-Villain!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd so I launched \u003cem\u003eHenchmen for Hire \u003c/em\u003ein October of 2010\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.henchmenonline.com/\"\u003eHenchmen for Hire \u003c/a\u003eis a FREE online comic about three normal guys\n(Tinker, Evers and Chance) who hire themselves out as henchmen in a world of\nsuperheroes and supervillains. While they don\u0027t have superpowers, the guys are\nvery good at what they do, and their friendship and loyalty to each other makes\nthem a great team.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI post a new page of \u003cem\u003eHenchmen for Hire \u003c/em\u003eto the web (\u003ca href=\"http://www.henchmenonline.com/\"\u003ewww.henchmenonline.com\u003c/a\u003e) every Monday,\nand I write, pencil, ink and color each page myself.  Along the way I\u2019ve\ncompleted three full story arcs that I\u2019ve collected into graphic novels.\u00a0 You can read them on the site archives, or if\nyou like having a hard-copy version of your comics (or even a PDF download),\nthen you can \u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/dancingpencil#\"\u003evisit the Henchmen store\u003c/a\u003e and purchase a version there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Coming Up Next\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking forward to the next\nyear, I\u0027ve just started a new Henchmen story\narc which I\u0027m calling \u003cem\u003e\"Origins\",\u003c/em\u003e which will delve into the\nbackstories of a couple of the characters while introducing the nastiest\nvillain I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m also planning on\nspinning off a new character \u003cem\u003e\u201cTek Girl\u201d \u003c/em\u003einto her own series. \u003cem\u003eTek Girl \u003c/em\u003estarted off as a very minor\ncharacter in HFH, but her story soon evolved into an interesting tale about a\nteenage girl trying to understand who she is while dealing with emerging\nabilities and family expectations. It\u2019s\ngoing to be a lot of fun and I\u2019m looking forward to sharing that with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
