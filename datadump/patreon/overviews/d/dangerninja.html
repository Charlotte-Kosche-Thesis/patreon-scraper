In 2007 I started Danger Ninja in my living room in Eugene in the hopes of getting into the modeling photography business, after seeing the revival of the pin-up genre and loving all of the vibrant colors involved in it. \u00a0I posted casting calls for models all over social media, and I haven\u0027t looked back since. \u00a0I\u0027ve always been a one-person operation in every aspect of the business and my work is a synthesis of dozens of different styles, influences, backgrounds and locations. \u00a0I dabble everywhere I find inspiration, from glamour to high fashion, fine art, fetish, erotica and special FX. This near-decade of building a business on my own has been the wildest adventure I\u0027ve ever taken, and I\u0027ve loved every second.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why should you support me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to take my photography career to the next level. \u00a0I want to create projects I\u0027ve never had the funding for, travel around the USA and the world to meet and collaborate with new incredible artistic talents, and continue upgrading my equipment to keep up in a competitive industry. \u003cstrong\u003eFor just $1 a month, you can help me do this. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ll see entire brand-new photo sets and series as I finish them, past archived work and sets that I have never posted in their entirety, and get a never-before seen look at my photography including behind the scenes shoot videos and blogs describing my lighting styles and editing techniques.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will your financial pledge do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon, you\u0027re helping me in multiple invaluable facets. \u00a0Your pledge will help me repair my current photography gear and purchase new equipment both for my camera and for lighting. \u00a0It will enable me to travel all over the world seeking new photographic opportunity. \u00a0And it will fund new local projects and ideas with all of my favorite current collaborators. \u00a0Most of all, it will allow me to continue doing what I love full-time so that I can push myself every day to become a greater artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI hope you decide to stay a while and enjoy all of my artwork, blogs, tutorials and behind the scenes content I\u0027m sharing here! \u00a0Please feel free to write me as well and tell me what you\u0027d like to see! \u00a0Suggestions and questions about my business and my work are always welcomed. \u00a0Your support, no matter how great or small means everything to me! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
