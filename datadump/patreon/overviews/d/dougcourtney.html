    "summary": "I write.\u00a0 I write all sorts of things fiction, non-fiction, blogs, and screen plays. It has always been fun and I have done so for a number of years.\u00a0 I have even written a short story and read it on a video which I have posted on YouTube. (Hated result. Good idea, bad production, need to redo it) \u00a0 I am most noted for my yearly Christmas short stories.\u00a0 I have been writing them every year since 1999 and giving them as presents to my friends.\u00a0 I even made a collection of them in 2010 and self-published them.\u00a0 You can find it on Amazon.com or on my \u003ca href=\"http://www.courtneypress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eweb page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy foray into non-fiction created a book called\u003cem\u003e Inhale Fear, Breathe Anger: TEA Partiers, Dixiecrats, and Changing Political Paradigms.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 It is still my biggest seller on Amazon and I have sold a few of them worldwide.\u00a0 (You know how COOL that is to know one of your books was read by someone in Western Europe.\u00a0 WESTERN EUROPE!\u00a0 Can you believe that!\u00a0 Ahem, back to reality.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut my writing is now to a point that if I want to keep writing I have to sustain it.\u00a0 Can\u0027t give too much away for free anymore! (Bill collectors have SUCH an attitude!) \u003cstrong\u003eSo I need your help\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 I want to finish my latest novel \"\u003cem\u003eUnburdened\u003c/em\u003e\".\u00a0 (The first six chapters are on my \u003ca href=\"http://courtneypress.com/online.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eweb page \u003c/a\u003eif you\u0027d like a preview.)\u00a0 It is a story about the sale of marijuana in a state that has legalized it.\u00a0 Includes thugs, street gangs, corrupt politicians, homeless people, and the occasional flower child.\u00a0 Oh, and a love interest and revenge. A little something for everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also writing a political fiction novel which I hope to turn into a series of three books.\u00a0 The premise is a large shadow organization takes a relative unknown and places him in the position of running for president to, in their words, reverse the disaster that is the current American political environment.\u00a0 This novel will integrate current evens, views from both sides, have some good sex, lies, and murder.\u00a0 You know, basic American politics.\u00a0 The first novel in the series will be named \"\u003cem\u003eThe Losing Candidate\u003c/em\u003e\".\u00a0 Check out postings for the link to the first chapter.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
