    "summary": "Hello, I\u2019m Dan Sacharow, creator of the webcomic Molly Beans, at \u003ca href=\"http://mollybeans.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emollybeans.com\u003c/a\u003e, as well as Molly\u2019s video content over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZoB6uizE-Nu0BaSC6uGTdA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe youtube.\u003c/a\u003e Thanks for stopping by my Patreon page; Let me take a moment to explain why I\u2019m here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, I will never place ads on my site, and I will not monetize my video content. Ads are intrusive and slow down the experience, and monetization can create the wrong incentives for a creator. If I don\u2019t monetize, I\u2019m not beholden to the platform for my livelihood. If I don\u2019t run ads, I\u2019m not beholden to the advertisers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only people I wish to be beholden to are those who enjoy my content, directly through voluntary association. I\u2019m not interested in dealing with the whims of third party social media platforms, which can change the moment a day that ends in \u201cY\u201d begins. I\u2019m an old school content creator, and I\u2019ve produced content years before most of these platforms were even thought of or were technologically feasible. \u00a0I\u2019m perfectly comfortable going my own way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the foreseeable future, I will continue producing the Molly Beans comic strip and her video content as I presently do, and both will always be freely available. \u00a0I don\u2019t ask anything of my readers or viewers beyond sharing the content if they enjoy it; that\u2019s enough on its own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all of that said, I know I can continue to expand the offerings I can produce through this property and offer more value for those who enjoy Molly\u2019s world. Any small amount the brand can produce on its own reduces the amount I will need to personally subsidize and will justify a greater amount of time spent developing the brand. This not only includes additional content creation, but also outreach, site enhancements, marketing, merchandising, expansion into other forms of media, et al.  I have the tools and I have the talent (thanks Winston), but I\u0027m short on time and resources. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eNow I\u2019ve kept the donation tiers small, since there are other things you need to be spending money on. As I said, anything I receive makes it easier to justify spending additional time on this project. \u00a0But I\u2019ve also created three premium tiers with what I hope will be some nice incentives for those who really want to give Molly a boost. \u00a0Please note that those tiers are limited for now, but depending on how things go I may modify the rewards and tiers as time goes on. \u00a0Regardless, every donation tier will receive access to the Patreon only feed, which will contain whatever I happen to put there. \u00a0Like a procedurally generated universe, I have no idea what they will contain, but I\u0027m leaning toward \"Coffee with Molly\" mini podcasts among other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
