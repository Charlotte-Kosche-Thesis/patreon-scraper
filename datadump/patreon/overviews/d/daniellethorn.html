It simply wasn\u0027t something people did.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt fourteen I discovered screenwriting, and began spending my weekends at the computer, telling stories in script format. From there I discovered other aspects of filmmaking, and fell in love with every aspect of the craft from writing, to cinematography, to editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I knew that I desperately wanted to work in film, I didn\u0027t have anyone to look up to who had followed that path. With high school coming to a close, and post-secondary quickly approaching, I decided to try and pursue it anyway. I thought I\u0027d rather try and fail, than have not tried at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree years after graduating, I am successfully freelancing full time in the industry, and working on my own projects on the side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The Creative Type\" is a short form documentary series that profiles a variety of artists in different areas of expertise such as musicians, visual artists, writers, content creators, and many more.\u00a0The goal of this series is to inspire people to live a creative life, whether that\u0027s personally, professionally, or both. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0hope you will join me in this journey, and gather the inspiration you need to let the creativity flow in your life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Planes flying overhead, noisy neighbours, and shoddy electrical can slow a film shoot down to a standstill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the plus side, studio spaces are generally an optimal environment to shoot in because of their look and sound, two things that are extremely important to film projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this goal amount, I can rent a studio space without going into a considerable amount of debt! Something that, I\u0027m sure, will make the Canadian and Ontario governments happy, considering I still owe them for my student loan.\u003cbr\u003e",

Unfortunately working for free doesn\u0027t pay the bills, so finding a crew without paying them is difficult (not to mention asking people to work for free hurts my soul). When people do agree to work for free, it usually comes with the disclaimer \"If I get offered paid work, I\u0027ll have to take that.\" I have done this on numerous occasions, so I completely get it and understand, but it can throw a wrench in the planning if someone drops out last minute, and can even hurt the final product if a key crew member has to leave.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith $875 pledged every month, I can afford to pay my crew for their skills! So not only does this mean they can pay rent, and I don\u0027t feel scummy asking friends to work for free, but it makes scheduling a lot easier!\u003cbr\u003e",
