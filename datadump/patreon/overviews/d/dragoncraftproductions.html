    "summary": "Hello DragonCrafters! Thank you for reaching to my Patreon Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alex, aka Warcrow from DragonCraft Productions and I like to see myself as an entertainer in more than just one form of it; there are literally hundreds different kinds and I like to expand and try things out as they go. That being said, I believe my true passion lies into Gaming, Anime \u0026amp; Manga and Movies/TV Shows. Of course, I enjoy other things as well, but I think these are what I truly love and enjoy doing the most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating videos about my passions is more than just a hobby to me. Being able to share my opinions about them, being able to create entertaining videos that many folks can enjoy, that is my goal. But because my description is kinda vague, let me explain just what kind of videos you can expect from me (and hopefully more members from the DragonCraft Team!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be doing mostly Game Reviews in a more personal theme, various playthroughs of games, go into depths about certain aspects of video game, such as culture, lore, fantasy and more, with different takes and projects on each, for example, Game Reviews as Should You Play or \"X number of times Video Games made our hair tingle.\" A very specific project I am looking forward to create is \"Insider\", a series of videos where I talk about the lore and story of a certain game, movie, anime, manga or comic (maybe more in the future) I will also be doing discussion theme videos about certain Anime Series or themes into Anime in general. Let me give you a detailed list of what is up and what is going to be up in the near future:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould You Play (Game reviews with a more personal touch)\u003cbr\u003eGaming Insider (Delve deep into the lore of games!)\u003cbr\u003eGaming Talk (Talking about games was never that fun before!)\u003cbr\u003eAnime Talk (Cause Anime is Life, Anime is waifu!)\u003cbr\u003eShould You Watch - Anime Version (Anime reviews with a more personal touch)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI actually have a lot of projects lined up that I want to start making into full-fledged videos. By pledging to DragonCraft Productions and myself, you give me the opportunity to work on them while being able to do them without worries. Maybe the biggest reason I am creating this Patreon Page is hopefully fullfilling my dreams and goals and trust me when I say this, being able to be called a succesful YouTuber and live through them, is not the end of the line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this and thank you for supporting my endeavor! Have a good one folks!"
