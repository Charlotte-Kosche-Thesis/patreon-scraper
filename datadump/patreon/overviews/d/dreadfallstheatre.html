If you\u0027ve reading this page it\u0027s because you\u0027re interested in\ndonating to Dread Falls Theatre and want to support us in making Season Two of Father Dagon. \u003cem\u003ePlease\nnote: this Patreon Campaign is only for our podcast work, and not our live theatre\nshows.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur podcasts will always be\nfree to listen\u003c/strong\u003e, the campaign is\ndesigned to help support us in making Father Dagon and further shows in the\nfuture. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFather Dagon takes a lot of time and manpower\nto make. There is the cost of web hosting, writing and researching time, voice\nactors to pay, and the recording and mastering of the tracks. Each episode takes\naround 80 hours to complete, and Season One took over 300 hours to produce and\nget to public. We love making this podcast and want to produce more, by signing\nup to Patreon, you are helping give people jobs, and getting some cool rewards\nas a bonus.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI have been a patron since Season One, why have you changed the campaign from Per Creation to Per Month?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that we have a season\u0027s worth of experience under our belt we have made the choice to change from Per Creation to Per Month because it is easier to keep a track of our patron\u0027s rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen Season 2 is finished, will I still be charged monthly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot at all. Patreon has a way to \"pause\" a campaign. Once Season 2 has finished we will pause the campaign until we are ready to start again.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have been a patron since Season One and have noticed your rewards/funding goals have changed, why is this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have made a number of improvements to the show based on listener feedback from Season One. One of these changes is increasing the length of each episode, which in turn means increasing the time and manpower it takes to create each episode. As a result we have altered our rewards and funding goals to reflect this. Please read through all the rewards to make sure you are still happy with what you have chosen, and remember; you can change your donation amount at any time so if you fancy a different reward next month you can go ahead and treat yourself!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you release episodes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe release two episodes a month; on the 1st and 15th from June through to the end of October.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will I receive my\nrewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will be billed at the beginning of the month, and rewards are posted at the end of the month.
