    "summary": "I am an artist living and working in San Francisco. Many of my pieces\ninclude found objects, bringing attention to life\u2019s commonly overlooked items.\nI appreciate the idea of reuse and bringing meaning and importance to objects\npeople overlook and discard. I gladly embrace\nthe synthesis of painting and sculpture. Nature, music and material all influence my work.\u00a0Robert Rauschenberg\u0027s work is very inspiring to me too. I am very interested in consumerism and the obsession with money in our culture. I recently started playing with this idea mixed with colors I see in nature, since the ideas are so contrasting. So far these concepts show themselves in an abstract way when I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps feed my desire and need to create. It\u0027s such a wonderful feeling knowing others encourage my work and the arts. \u00a0I will use the pledges to\u00a0maintain my studio space\u00a0and obtain materials I need to keep creating.

     "about": "Mixed Media artist, DYANNA DIMICK, lets material and her eco-friendly lifestyle drive her creative process.\u00a0Born and raised in California, Dyanna\u0027s work provides a glimpse into her west coast roots, love for the beach, and eco-friendly lifestyle. She studied fine art and practiced sculpture at the University of California, Santa Cruz. This sparked her interest in using found objects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDyanna\u0027s creations are an\u00a0exploration of color, shape, material and juxtaposition. You can often see her obsession with organization, placement and\u00a0multiples in her work. She\u00a0appreciates the idea of reuse and using available materials in her surrounding environment.\u00a0Turning items once consumed and discarded, back into a desired piece. Our eyes often tune out thousands of objects around us because we don\u0027t have a current need for them or they don\u0027t seem important to us. Dyanna notices these items, the colors and shapes\u00a0specifically. She sees just about everything as a raw material.\u003cbr\u003eAlso conscious of the consumerism\u00a0cycle, she\u0027d rather find her material than buy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live with pollution. It\u0027s part of our world, we accept it and it becomes invisible. Dyanna seamlessly adds found material to her work as part of her palette to mimic this idea.\u00a0Our culture\u0027s obsession with\u00a0consumerism and vanity also sneaks into Dyanna\u0027s work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter her first solo show in 2004, Dyanna has exhibited work in galleries and public spaces throughout California, sold work overseas, created art for musicians and has been published in several magazines. She currently works\u00a0and lives in San Francisco.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
