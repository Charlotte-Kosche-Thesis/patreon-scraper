    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWho are we?\u003c/h3\u003eDCAbridgedUniverse is a group of writers, voice actors, editors, artists and fans working on parody videos like YJ Abridged, Suicide Squad Abridged, Throne of Atlantis Abridged, and more to come! Here\u0027s some examples of our work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_PXpV_fIkQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yYEiU91KGZU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oOAutBKEMWI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy are we here?\u003c/h3\u003eUntil now, we\u0027ve been working on our projects as much as we can in our free time, but we do not earn any money from our work.  All our videos are fan-based parodies, strictly non-profit (please support the official release!), and that will never change.  Any advertisement you see on our videos are allowed by the owners of the footage of music we use, we do not monetize our videos and never will.  However, as we continue to grow and expand our work, more expenses are required, and so anything you can send us will go a long way in helping us make our videos faster and more frequent for you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere\u0027s the money going?\u003c/h3\u003eAll money we receive will go to paying to work and develop our own projects.  If we manage to get even more than we dare hope, we could invest in expanding our work and group even further!  Let us be clear, no one is under any obligation to donate, so only do so if you can and want to show your support.  We do the parody videos we do for fun, and will continue to do them as long as we can, regardless of whether people donate or not. With your help, we can start developing our own projects, and make it easier for us to continue our work in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAre those levels rewards?\u003c/h3\u003e\u00a0Yup!  The more you donate, the higher level you get, and thus have access to more perks! Check the information written on the right side to know what you\u0027ll get at each level, and feel free to ask us any questions you may have. Also,keep in mind that while our Patreon is monthly, our rewards are not, necessarily. We give them when we have them, and that may not be every month, but our abridged content will always be available to everyone regardless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo what now?\u003c/h3\u003eDonate, or not, either way, we thank you for watching and supporting our work, and hope you continue to do so! Enjoy and always remember:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYOUNG JUSTICE FEMALE DOGS!!!\u003cbr\u003e"
