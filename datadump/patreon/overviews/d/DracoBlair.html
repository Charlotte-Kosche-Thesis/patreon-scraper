After reading a number of books on Adobe Flash I started drawing backgrounds for a project known as Welcome to Ponyville.\u003c/div\u003eLittle did I know that I would soon not only use the software for drawing and animating but also coding my own interactive pieces!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter creating over forty strips for a pony blog, some being fully interactive and, of course, animated wherever possible, I decided to set on another project, one that I found extremely fun and (at the time) quite simple: A Tamagochi/The Sims/Petz game starring a colourful equine. That\u2019s when the concept of PixelShy was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, the game has been in development for over two years. The concept of a single colourful equine\u2019s changed into over 17, the initial idea of a two-minute-long intro changed into a colossal ten-minute HD piece and the three minigames became over 27 fully voiced mini engines. The game has become massive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPaVZHfDuK4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the creative process, many people have pledged their support, be it Voice Actors and Actresses, people who offered their musical scores or those who want to promote the project. While their help was uplifting, there is still much to be done and we could really benefit from more animators and VAs on the team. \u003cbr\u003eI do not want to raise money for myself, yet some sort of remuneration for everyone helping is much in order. My job has recently become very taxing, so I plan to use the additional funds to hire skilled people, speeding up the development.
