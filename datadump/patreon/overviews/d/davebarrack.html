The ultimate goal of course is to trade my car in for a flying solid gold palanquin while being waited on by a plethora of pi\u00f1atas, I mean... tanned attendants, but one step at a time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith enough support I could hire a colorist, do the comic full time, or even both, all of which would mean more comics.
