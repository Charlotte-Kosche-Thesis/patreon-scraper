    "summary": "Hello internet. My name is William Grubb. I am an online voice actor, singer, rapper, video producer, dancer, and overall content creator and entertainer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been in school plays, community theater, musical theater, and dance concerts for as long as i can remember and always had a passion for doing it. In 2007, I started producing self-made online content for the whole world to enjoy, yet with mixed results. In 2010, I discovered My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and my drive to create came back in full swing and much better than before. I brushed up on my voice acting skills, started writing music, and since 2013 I have gained a small following for my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Voice Overs: I have appeared in a number of well-known productions in the online Brony community including Discord in Bride of Discord (and its soon to be sequel Daughter of Discord), the titular character in EdPlus Adventures in Equestria, Thespio in Dr. Wolf\u0027s TF2 Analysis Anarchy series, the (_) Meets MLP animations by ToucanLDM, the un-named Unicorn in Pinkie Pie\u0027s Exciting Adventure series by TheInvertedShadow, Gustave le Grand \u0026amp; Caesar in Case 2 of My Little Investigations by Equestrian Dreamers, along with countless dramatic readings and voice over roles with the likes of TheLostNarrator, ObabScribbler, ToonKriticY2K, Lightning Bliss \u0026amp; Joey Turner\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Music: I have collabed on several music tracks with the likes of Mary Medley, Ember Dash, MEMJ0123, Haylizabeth, Rhyme Flow, SydeMusic, Pinkie Rose \u0026amp; DisneyFanatic2364, as well as doing many solo songs and covers. I was also cast in the Broadway Online production of \"You\u0027re A Good Man Charlie Brown\" as Schroeder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Other Content: I also have done a lot of other videos such as MLP Analysis, fandubs and fanfic readings. Outside of video producing I am also a trained dancer and have had the privilege of performing alongside Michelle Creber (voice of Applebloom and first singing voice of Sweetie Belle in My Little Pony) and Gabriel Brown aka BlackGryph0n at different My Little Pony Conventions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as you can see I am a pretty active member of the online pony community. My main goal in life is to do voice overs professionally for TV, Movies and animation. I will be using patreon to fund better home recording equipment, classes, and investing in my future demo production. It would also allow me to create more online content for you all to enjoy and at a higher quality. If you decide to become a patron of mine, I have set it up for a monthly payment plan so you would only pay once a month regardless of how much content I upload or link per month. You can cancel or adjust your amount at any time you wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish to thank you all for your continued support and your interest in supporting me for you newcomers out there. Thank you all so very much and I\u0027ll catch ya later\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and love\u003cbr\u003e-William"
