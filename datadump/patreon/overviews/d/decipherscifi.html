    "summary": "Hey you! How would you like to help us produce \u003ca href=\"http://www.decipherscifi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe show\u003c/a\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur podcast is free and will remain as such, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebut if you are a regular consumer of our content please consider making a monthly pledge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e to help us put out the best possible content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Christopher Peterson and Lee Colbert, and we\u0027re a couple of science- and rationality-minded geeks who make a podcast called decipherSciFi. Every week on the show we take a science fiction movie and find the best conversations to be had about their sciencey themes and ideas. From Ex Machina (easy) on one end, to Battlefield Earth (rather difficult!) on the other, we polish off the shining gems inside each film we cover and present it to you each Tuesday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo share our rationally optimistic enthusiasm about the society, technology, and the future with as many people as possible. This starts with the podcast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou, and the entire audience as a whole, are already invaluable in the production. The conversations we have on our social channels, the movie and topic suggestions, and even the real friendships that emerged from our audience have made this show better. Now if you could and would pledge one of the enumerated pittances every month, it would really help us continue to make this podcast better still.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, because we\u2019ll never get Matt Damon on the show without the notoriety of a huge Patreon success. Second, because you\u2019d be helping us make the world a bit better, and that will make you feel good about yourself! Increased (any) funding can help us get the show out to more people, and help more people develop a greater appreciation for the insight offered by science fiction. More people will develop a positive conception of where technology and society are headed, and the world will be better. Easy peasy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Ticket to the Movies\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor less than the price of a single movie ticket, you could help fund us for a whole year. A year! That\u2019s around 34 HOURS of entertainment from our show. And you could still have enough left over for a serving of microwave popcorn.  What\u2019s a movie going to get you, around 2 hours max? The math is clear on this. And math doesn\u2019t lie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHard Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe spend around 10-12 hours a week on the show as it is now. To be honest, we thought it would be a lot easier before we started. But it turns out to take a kind of a lot of time to watch the movies, produce worthwhile thoughts related to the movies, then record, edit, and publish, and promote the show. Not to mention the added level of complexity in scheduling and execution now that we\u2019ve been bringing on guest co-hosts to help us do a better job with topics outside of our wheelhouse."
