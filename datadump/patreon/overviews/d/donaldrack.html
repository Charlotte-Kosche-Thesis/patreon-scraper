    "summary": "Hello! My name is Donald Rack. If you\u0027re reading this then you probably don\u0027t need an introduction. If you don\u0027t know who I am allow me to introduce myself. I live in Rochester, Minnesota. I am 32 years old. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my genes that affects an important protein is rather corrupted. The protein dystrophin, which keeps muscle tissue all muscly. I have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy\"\u003eDuchenne muscular dystrophy\u003c/a\u003e. Average life expectancy is 25. Guess I didn\u0027t get the memo? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February of 2002 I was 16 living at home and I got really sick. They gave me a tracheotomy and I was put on a ventilator. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CeOM0S7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis has extended my life greatly but it also has made that life more difficult. Added to it is the way my legs are contorted. I could be not be in a regular wheelchair. To put it in perspective my wheelchair is 3 feet wide. It used to be wider. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore that I could only leave the house on a stretcher. Since September of 2002 I have spent most my time in my room, stuck in bed. I maybe leave my room once every couple of months. Before 2010 I left once a year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of living in a nursing home I was fortunate enough to end up in an assisted living group home with my own room. I live with four other people and a Shih Tzu. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a very creative person. I\u0027ve dabbled in many different kinds of art. Mostly failing at it but I always try. I\u0027ve done every kind of thing you can think of. Writing, 3D modeling, graphic design, video editing, and music production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve been able to do all of these pretty inexpensively. There is just one art form I\u0027ve never been able to do and I have always wanted to. Photography. Just one little problem. No money. Photography is a notoriously expensive hobby. Most people start off small and progress from there. I couldn\u0027t even afford to start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo on Christmas of 2015 I started a GoFundMe. I raised $2,000 in two weeks. That March I bought a camera and the needed accessories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI barely even got to do anything with it when I had a death in the family and a pretty serious health problem on the same day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t start working with my camera until the summer of 2017. The biggest hurdle is assistance, I get to really use my camera about twice a month. So I have to make sure I learn a lot with every photo shoot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only kind of photography I can really do is portrait photography. I want to create characters and stories through portraits. I want to collaborate with other like minded creative people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second biggest hurdle is money. I live on a fixed income and there isn\u0027t much leftover for hobbies. I can\u0027t really complain, I live in a really nice place with great individual care. Excellent quality of life with doctors from one the best clinics in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery photographer can probably tell you they wasted money when they first started, I\u0027m no exception. In three months I \"earned\" $60. I have some money but not much. I can\u0027t even afford the software needed to edit pictures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I ask you is, would you buy me a cup of coffee once a month? Let\u0027s say that it costs $5. I would say most people could do that. I could do that. Why should you give me money? I don\u0027t want you to think of it as giving me money. You\u0027re buying something for your money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou would be helping me create art. You know, if you\u0027re into that kind of thing. Everything would go directly to my photography. Software, equipment, or props. I know I can create some amazing images and tell interesting stories. Just need some coffee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt does not have to be $5, if all you can contribute $1 a month that helps. If you want to and can pitch in more, that also obviously helps. I can\u0027t really provide much in way of reward tiers at the moment but maybe in the future. Thank you for your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
