    "summary": "My name is Diana Cayton, and I have been writing for as long as I can remember. I started out as soon as I realized that the books that I loved so much were written by real people, and that I could be one of those people, if I tried hard enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, as a college student in the second decade of my life, I feel like I have a few stories to share with the world.\u00a0 Particularly, a novel that has been in the making since my sophomore year of high school. The working title, which has rather cemented its self after years of not finding anything that rang more true, is Wayward Soul. It follows the story of a former addict, a future nurse, and a supposed psychic thrust into a murder mystery that they never asked for or wanted. I don\u0027t want to give too much away, so I\u0027m making the first chapter available to all so you can see if you enjoy my writing style and get a small taste of the story!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate each and every one of you who believes that my art is something worth pledging money to. With your support I can keep going to college in the comfort that I have an extra source of income for necessities and emergencies, should they arise. I also have two sweet kitties who thank your support in providing them with the good cat food, the kind that has gravy on it and real bits of chicken."
