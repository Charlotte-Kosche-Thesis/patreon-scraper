I need your help in order to make it a reality and to further expand the channel to heights never thought possible. It might be an impossible goal, but I thought the same thing about ever getting above 10k subscribers... and you all blew that goal out of the water. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re wondering what you can expect from your support, I\u0027ve setup some stretch goals that I think a lot of people would really enjoy. From simple things like bringing back the PS4 streams to very nerve racking (for me) things like face reveals and face cam vlogs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you\u0027re worried about Patreon exclusivity, there will NEVER be Warframe content that is for Patreon\u0027s only. If you can\u0027t support me you will never be punished for that and there will be the same steady flow of Warframe content you\u0027ve come to love over on my YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e"
