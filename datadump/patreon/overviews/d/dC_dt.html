    "summary": "Not much to say on who I am. I\u0027m in college for Game Design, and part of being a Game Designer is appreciating how games are a web of interconnecting facets. Programming, stories, art, music. A lot goes into making a single game as great as it can be, so I dabble in a bunch of hobbies to gain a better understanding of how it all can intertwine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon account is more for those hobbies than my work -- mostly writing. As much as I like practicing drawing or making music, it\u0027s the written word I really shine with. I am willing to explore almost any world or concept, although I prefer a touch of fantasy or sci-fi, and it\u0027s world building that fascinates me the most. I have dozens of different worlds and races and cultures in my head -- all waiting to come out with a prompt from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now though, you\u0027re probably here for a silly story on horses and bugs that look like horses. dC/dt \u2260 0 is probably the most comprehensive collection of my ideas I\u0027ve had to date. It might still be fan-fiction I made to practice, but I can\u0027t express how much thought goes into parts of the story that MLP:FiM can\u0027t give me. Writing it has given me so many ideas -- and the confidence to maybe try expressing them in a world completely of my own making. That\u0027s the future though. For now, I\u0027m focusing on what you want to see and know of dC/dt \u2260 0, and I aim to make side stories and get art commissioned for what I can\u0027t cover in the main story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs to what I\u0027d be using my Patreon support for... Honestly, it\u0027s entirely to commission art for dC/dt at this point. I want to give more than just the story, but lack the artistic talent.\u003cbr\u003e"
