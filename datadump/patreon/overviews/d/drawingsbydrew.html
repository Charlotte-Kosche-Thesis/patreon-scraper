Eventually I decided to express this with my lifetime passion of art. I am completely self taught and am always pushing my skills to the next level. As I am sure many know, it is very hard for someone to make a living artistically, but it\u0027s all I have in this world so please support me so I can continue showing you the odd things that come from the deepest parts of my mind."
