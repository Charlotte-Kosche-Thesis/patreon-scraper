    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eAbout Dissidia\u003c/h3\u003eDissidia (Final Fantasy) is the ultimate game for a Final Fantasy fan. Bold statement, I know. But it\u0027s true! It may not up to everyone\u0027s taste\u2014however\u2014the game offers so much in terms of content that it should be satisfying for a wide range of fans.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt takes characters from most installments and pits them against each other in a competitive manner. A lot of those characters saw their three-dimensional iterations for the \u003cem\u003efirst time ever\u003c/em\u003e thanks to this wonderful fanservice game. It was jaw-dropping to see what were once only sprites or low poly 3D models now reborn as elaborate representations of characters from past eras.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI myself was primarily a PlayStation 1 era Final Fantasy fan, and while I did play through every FF game, I truly cared for and praised only a few out of the entire series. It\u0027s thanks to Dissidia that I came to really appreciate pretty much every single FF. Where my favorite game of all time is Final Fantasy VIII, in the original DFF I mainly played Cloud of Darkness. In Duodecim, I played Kain!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDissidia did an absolutely wonderful and amazing thing for Final Fantasy fans. It allowed them to express their fandom in a multitude of ways, though primarily competitively\u2014which was hardly available before (PVP in MMOs, speedrun competitions and other various player-made challenges).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe game, the series, will forever live on because of its fanservice strength. As PS3, and adhoc Party along with it, weakened in activity, a PSP emulator popped up, giving the game a new, possibly everlasting, life. Now there\u0027s also a PS4 Dissidia game in the making, so the series is about to get even more support and a larger playerbase.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout Dissidia Network\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://dissidia.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDISSIDIA network\u003c/a\u003e is a network of fansites dedicated to the Dissidia series. Calling the network just \"Dissidia\" is intentionally made so as to be open to any and all kind of things that come out under the name.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDISSIDIA network currently consists of:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://dissidia.community\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edissidia.community\u003c/a\u003e \u2014 site dedicated to the Dissidia community; for people to converse about various topics on a Dissidia-themed messaging board. In the age of social media, the flavor that fansites provide to the user is lost \u2014 all communities are generally unified under one design. DC offers an environment centered around Dissidia and Final Fantasy and it shows that in its design. For example, you can supplement your communication to fellow\u00a0fans\u00a0with special Dissidia emoticons.\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://dissidia.info\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edissidia.info\u003c/a\u003e \u2014 an archive of the most important Dissidia news.\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003edissidia.wiki \u2014 under construction, this wiki is a long term project that will aim to be \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e Dissidia encyclopedia. An independent Dissidia wiki is important due to its lightweight design.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout this Patreon\u003c/h3\u003eI created this Patreon in hope to get support for what I did, what I do and what I will continue to do for Dissidia. I\u0027ve been creating Dissidia content since 2009 and still haven\u0027t stopped\u2014Dissidia is truly my passion.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you\u0027re supporting both the Dissidia community and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dissidia.community/profile/1-hyne\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eme\u003c/a\u003e as a content creator, allowing me to invest even more of myself as this project grows."
