I am on an amazing journey right now and I am so excited for you to be a part of it with me! In February of 2018, I decided to pack my entire life into my car and live the mobile life, shooting a web series called Travel Songs. On the way (to wherever I\u0027m going?) I\u0027m meeting up with singer/songwriters in different cities and making videos of us producing and recording one of their original songs. I am currently in partnership with the company Warm Audio who has graciously lent me some AMAZING recording equipment to use in these videos. I\u0027m constantly looking for more people to work with, so if you know a songwriter, tell me about them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron, you will receive exclusive access to my travel vlog, original songs that I\u0027m writing, and even a song written just for you, if you so desire. If you decide to become a patron, THANK YOU! Your support is allowing this crazy dream to continue. You are helping me with things like gas, production costs, food, and equipment upgrades - all of which are expenses that go into making Travel Songs a reality. I can\u0027t thank you enough for your generosity and I\u0027m so excited that you want to be a part of this journey!!"

I really want to have a videographer for these videos because it allows me to work more fluidly with the artist on the music that we are creating. It also makes for a better visual production in my opinion because adding a videographer puts one more persons creativity into the video and becomes three angles of creation, the videographer, the songwriter and the producer. I think that would be really amazing to be able to be incorporated into every episode and really step up the quality of the show!",
