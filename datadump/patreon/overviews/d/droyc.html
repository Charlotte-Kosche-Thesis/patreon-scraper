It enables us to shoot\nmore models, more often, and at a better creative and technical quality - a simple MMAM formula \n(Money. Models. Art. Meaning).

We\nbelieve that nude and erotic beauty is too important to be left to a corporate\ndecision making where clicks, views and time-on-site are the main metrics to\nvalue a piece of art. We can do better. And we do. We don\u2019t operate as a commercial\ncompany and we don\u2019t seek investments. Instead, DROYC Studios is a community of\npassionate people organized around\u00a0projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWHAT YOU\u2019LL GET\u003c/h3\u003eWe considered to offer behind the scenes or some special materials as it is often popular on Patreon, but it goes against our ideology. \u003cstrong\u003eWe believe that art (including behind the scenes) should be free. \u003c/strong\u003eThere is no secret group or community where we share the best stuff. It\u2019s all there for everyone to see - just visit our site. Instead, we want to create an engaging community that is not based on incentives and rewards but consists of individuals that believe in our vision and want to be part of our journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBE IN THE CREDITS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWe recognize that some people would like to have their names on the credits so this is what we\u2019ll be offering. By supporting us you\u2019ll get your name on the credits. This is optional and you can contribute without being on the credits or you can state a fictional name or alias.

They are expensive because they are limited. And they are limited because they\u2019ll be part of our inner-circle - receiving direct communication regarding our upcoming productions.

It\ntakes time for us to get to learn a model, to shoot her in a way that represents\nher uniqueness, to learn her story. Most often we write about our experience working with a particular model, trying to highlight her personality and story, rather than a technical aspect of a shooting. Sometimes we publish an daring opinion piece that a model has written herself and want to communicate to the world. It is this attention to a model\u2019s\npersonality and uncompromised artistic quality that make those models want to\ncome back, and to refer other models to us.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nCHANGING THE WORLD, NOT WOMEN\u003c/h2\u003e\nThere are hundreds of great models out there who want to work with us.

With your support we can give these women an opprtunity to make a personal and social difference - earn money, to inspire millions of people, to leave her mark.
