    "summary": "In 2012, DBM partnered up with Elitist Jerks to help bring traffic to the site and connect two user communities together. In this time I was able to switch gears into working on DBM as a full time job from home. This has been perfect for me because I am currently a full time care giver for my widowed mother.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorking on DBM full time allowed two things.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.\u003c/strong\u003e Massive feature improvement and mod quality. During this time I was able to deliver more feature improvement than DBM had seen in the years prior.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. \u003c/strong\u003eWhile working full time from home, I could be available to my mother more conveniently. If you have never been a primary caregiver, it can be hard to imagine just how much time and energy it demands of you.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a while, my dev time was supported by partnership with Elitist Jerks website. Unfortunately, times have changed and the need for EJB has diminished. Traffic from this website no longer covered costs of hosting DBM (or even itself). That partnership has come to an end and Elitist Jerks has closed it\u0027s doors completely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow, I\u0027m asking you, the users of DBM, for support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked very hard getting DBM ready for Legion and continue doing so for all upcoming content. The mods I\u0027ve created so far are some of the most advanced mods included in DBM yet. The time I\u0027ve poured in goes well and beyond the time most authors put into any wow addon. I have been there for every raid test, every dungeon (multiple times), countless hours in logs and coding, and have spent lots of time gathering feedback. I want to continue giving the level of support that\u0027s put DBM in top form these last three expansions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do if I cannot make full time DBM work anymore. I\u0027ve counted on this for 4 years to create the best mods possible while also being best caregiver possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs such, I have launched this Patreon so users can help crowd fund and support DBM\u0027s continued full time development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf DBM can make at least first goal, I\u0027ll be able to continue to provide the following:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003eTo deliver the feature rich quality I work for.

Eventually WoW will come to an end. I\u0027m only asking for help to make it as long as possible. As long as there is a World of Warcraft, I want there to be the best DBM possible for all. Do this, and I promise I will always work my hardest on delivering best mods that I can. Mods I can be proud of. Mods that I myself use as well. It doesn\u0027t even take a lot. Just a little from a lot of people. Giving as little as 1 dollar a month still goes a long way. Anything extra that isn\u0027t needed to support myself and my mother has always gone into DBM. I\u0027ve often used my own money to pay other authors to help with certain features, or guilds for their private logs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live off very little so I can give the most to my work. DBM has never made a lot of money, but for a number of years it has been enough. My fervent hope is that with your help this can continue to be the case. Thank you so much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can read a more detailed post at\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.deadlybossmods.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3\u0026amp;p=32\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.deadlybossmods.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3\u0026amp;p=32\u003c/a\u003e"
