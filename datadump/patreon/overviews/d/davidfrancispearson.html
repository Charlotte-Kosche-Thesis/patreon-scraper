You can\u0027t be a full time writer without these things.\u003cbr\u003eAfter I reach $2000 per month I will be able to write full time and produce content a lot quicker!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis money will also go towards paying for editors, even some towards publishing and printing hard copies.

The universe is in my head, and it\u0027s waiting to hit paper. However, the time it takes to create a comic book alone is daunting and unrewarding, especially as my talent in the comic book arts are not refined enough to create the stunning visuals I can see in my mind. The comic book universe will be slowly leaked out into written short stories over time. So keep your eyes peeled for these little gems of insight! If my goals are reached, then I can hire a team of carefully chosen artists to create something fantastic!\u003cbr\u003e"
