I\u2019m a single father from rural Kentucky who is sharing his story\nwith the world. Over the past two years I have focused strictly on YouTube\nContent, sharing my dad life vlogs and taking you on my journey as\na single dad raising a sassy southern daughter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI find that many of my viewers find humor in my story, some\nfind it just entertaining, others endearing and there are a few out there that\ncan relate to everything I share on a personal level. I find that to be the\nmost rewarding part of everything I do. The ability to connect with people and\nproviding them the feeling that they are not alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"height: 0;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E9sPT_3LuKc?ecver=2\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will I do with your money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst and foremost, I need help keeping the lights on for\nhosting the blog. I set out with the expectation that within the first month or\ntwo I could hopefully turn the blog to a point that it will be self-sustaining,\nsomething that I have yet to be able to do with YouTube as the cost of entry is\nmuch greater. After web hosting is covered, I\u2019m going to be honest and not blow\nsmoke with a lot of empty promises, everything else goes towards Charlie. Without\nher, I wouldn\u2019t have much of a story to tell. Life as a single parent is often\nfinancially tight. So be it clothes, weekend trips, places to go, things to do\nor maybe just finishing off a Big Birthday or Christmas request, a little bit\ngoes a long way. In turn that gives me the opportunity to produce not only more\nblogs but more video content for the YouTube Channel as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
