For all your humorous science, smut, steampunk and tea-related needs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://islandofdoctorgeof.co.uk/out/patreon/patreon-arrowB201710.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking art makes me happy. Making art that makes other people happy is a joy and a privilege.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor almost 15 years, I\u2019ve been producing mad, ridiculous art, trading at shows, exhibiting at museums, and writing and publishing comics. My flagship comic was Fetishman; a joy-filled tale of a superhero in a restrictive rubber suit, who\u2019s rubbish at fighting crime (he just falls over a lot). Since then I\u2019ve created comics about particle physics, bees, cats and their tanks (a colouring book), created embroidered patches, art, pewter pins, portraits, a fake tea-related museum, instigated a thing called tea duelling, and even won awards for my Steampunk Literary Review, the misleadingly-titled collection of my steampunk comics and art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until recently, I\u2019ve focused a lot of my time on attending events like comic-cons, the Asylum Steampunk Festival and Whitby Goth Weekend to name just a small selection. However, the process of doing lots of trade shows to flog my wares, so to speak, takes up time and that eats into the art making which has led to me completing less new art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://islandofdoctorgeof.co.uk/out/patreon/patreon-arrowB201710.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is hopefully a way for me to make more art, more often, whilst giving something back to the loyal (honestly, you guys\u2026) fanbase I\u2019ve built up over the last decade. A way for me to do even more of the art you love whilst having a closer dialogue with the people who support my crazy ideas. A place I can share with you even more of the things that are in my brain and help bring them to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks my lovelies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://islandofdoctorgeof.co.uk/out/patreon/patreon-signature201710.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoctor Geof\u003cbr\u003e"
