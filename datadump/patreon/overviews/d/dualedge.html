    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThis is Aaron Horton (aka Onyxinterior/Xaoran), and thank you very much for visiting my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\nGenerally\n speaking, this is solely an art account, which will be specifically geared toward my work; pinups, some fan art every so often, short comics, and features geared toward my current comic project, Dual Edge: Remnant \nPulse.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--So, Why Patreon?--\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a long time now I\u0027ve wanted\n to try my hand in making a full fledged story.  Due to the priorities \noutside of my art life, nothing I personally created or helped others \nwith ever really managed to get off the ground yet. And it becomes a \ndifficult task when the path to career goals and dreams don\u0027t really correlate with one another. But thanks to sites like Patreon, I\u0027m discovering an \nopportunity to carve a path to my goals, to develop a hobby into a \ncareer, without having to keep my dreams separate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI consider \nPatreon to be more manageable for me than Kickstarter. Rather than \nhoping for goals to be reached within a specific deadline with a large \nset of money for a singular major project, I\u0027m able to ask for smaller \nofferings while frequently delivering content for my contributors with increasing quality and effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat to expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe focal points to be expected on my account are:\u003cbr\u003e1. Fantasy- Most of the inspiration for ever even wanting to invest myself in art comes from the various media I latched onto while growing up and even now as an adult. Primarily in the form of video games. Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Dragoon, Chrono Trigger, Panzer Dragoon, and Final Fantasy (to name a few) all revolve around an innate sense of freedom and imagination. A sentiment that is shared across numerous genres of story telling. Mythology, movies, comics, books, even music. You name it! It is my wish to invoke that mysticism in my own way for others to experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Focus on Detail- This point refers to constantly improving the quality of my art and creating solid and interesting story narrative.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating digital art for over 5 years now, completely self taught. The process diverted me to what I was used to doing on paper, canvas, and sketchbooks, but after some diligent time, I began to recognize my art style again. I\u0027m very glad to have made the decision to pick up tablets. But now that I\u0027ve grown comfortable with the process, going forward my goal is to improve my practices. Which will involve some more exploration of techniques and programs that I\u0027m not familiar with. But I know it will be for the best in the long run.\u003cbr\u003eIn regards to storytelling, it is still very much a learning process for me more than anything. Whatever knowledge I have all stems from the stories others have told. But the things I watch now, what I read, are all with the intent of learning and applying that knowledge with my personal values. That goes hand in hand with improving my art.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the immediate future, these efforts will mainly focus around my current comic project...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd10/Lynxbox06/Derplogo_zps8c457eea.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eNumerous worlds are comprised and constitute\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003ed by the deities that inhabit \nthem.

Wanting to be like the creators of my numerous childhood shows and games, I slowly obligated my efforts to improving my skill, creating drawings with an increased sense of substance, giving them character.\u003cbr\u003eAnd as I matured, so did the entertainment industry in many ways . I became intrigued by stories with mature and sometimes controversial themes such as Neon Genesis Evangelion, Berserk, Akira, and Drakengard. \u003cbr\u003eUltimately that desire to create tales of my own continues to permeate in my mind as an adult. But thanks to the ideas and technology made available, with my drive, vision, and love for storytelling, I feel that I have a platform now to make that dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e",
