    "summary": "I am Dave Holmes, a musician and producer from the UK and I\u0027m involved in a variety of musical styles. Specialising in Brazilian music, I perform live authentic sounding Bossa Nova classics on guitar, with vocals in Portuguese and English. I also bring other contemporary covers and original songs into the mix. (My new album is in production, release date is April 2019 !)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the 90s I studied Popular Music and Sound Recording in Chichester, England, followed by Foundation and Advanced Audio Engineering studies at the legendary Alchemea College in London -\u00a0 a 24/7 recording studio training facility which was attended by some of the industry\u0027s best producers, engineers and artists over the years.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI then went on to work on dance music in Portugal for\u00a0two years. I was a sound engineer / producer in a band, becoming great friends with some of Portugal\u0027s best electronic music DJs and producers. It was there I first learnt to speak Portuguese and since 2001 I have also travelled many times to Brazil, absorbing the culture and Portuguese language, improving my fluency. I am now heavily influenced by Brazilian sounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy next album\u003c/strong\u003e, in production, will be released with a live show in Brazil in April 2019. Anyone who supports me will get a Soundcloud link to hear the tracks as each one is finished over the coming months and a free album emailed or sent to you after it is all done, with behind the scenes videos and photos available as the project unfolds. I\u0027ve been working on my tracks for a very long time, I have a few albums worth of material in my archives, but only now do I have the right circumstances and team to finish this body of work in a professional way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, you will be kept up to date with the recordings. You will also receive updates on my performances in UK or elsewhere, including performing for, and producing, Brazilian artist Andrea Amorim\u0027s European tours. We toured Europe in 2016 and 2017 [see the video clip on this page, with myself on Guitar] and we have many plans for future musical projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrazilian Demos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 I recorded two 18 track Bossa Nova albums entitled \u0027Born To Bossa\u0027. These gained radio play on specialist Brazilian Music shows in the UK, and also in Holland, where I performed tracks from the latest album live in Holland, on the Brazilian Blend show (ORTS FM Radio). I also performed live on an FM radio station in Peru, via an online connection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was interviewed, and my albums critically reviewed on online music sites in Japan, Jamaica, and the USA, and I have toured Europe with shows in UK, Holland, Spain, Belgium and Portugal.
