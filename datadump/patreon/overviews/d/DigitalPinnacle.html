We are a couple of friends who have a passion for video games, movies, TV and other forms of media. We started our Company/YouTube channel because we always used to find ourselves talking about games, movies etc. in the same way that YouTube creators do. We were inspired by companies such as IGN and Gamespot, and we decided to make our own channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhat does Digital Pinnacle do?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see by our Channel Trailer, we model ourselves on being honest fans of games and movies, and we want to create videos that give our honest opinions of these. We currently create multiple different types of videos, including Top 5 Countdowns, an episodic wish list series called Digital Desires, Reviews of the latest games and Trailer Breakdowns. We also have plans to start entirely new series in the future. To see what we do with your own eyes, head over to our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/DigitalPinnacleMedia\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e and check out some of our videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eW\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003ehy are we different do other YouTube creators?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe believe we are different to your average small channel because we focus on high quality content creation. Rather than \u0027tuning\u0027 our videos to make the most amount of money, like many other content creators do, we spend hours on making our videos the best possible quality. It takes hours to make any one of our YouTube videos, and we have to fit this time around our university timetables.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhy should you pledge to us?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs undergrad university students, money isn\u0027t the easiest thing to come by. At the moment, we create our videos on a \u00a30.00 budget. This includes recording our voices on borrowed microphones, editing public domain videos and using royalty/copyright free music. We hope one day to be able to purchase our own high quality equipment. This will in turn allow us to create much better videos and of course allow us to develop the kind of content we create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope that one day we will be able to turn Digital Pinnacle into a viable business, not just a YouTube Channel, but a real company, with hired employees working every day to create the content you love. The only way for us to do this is to earn enough money to reinvest into our company. Anytime you pledge to donate some of your hard earned money, to us, it helps us get a little bit closer to our dream. We want our content to remain free, and we would never ask people to pay to watch it. But if you are a fan of our content, and would love to see us develop it further, donating will really help us meet our goals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Notes: Please note that at the moment we aim to create one video per week at a minimum. Based on Patreon\u0027s recommended donator scheme, each donation is per video. This means that if you wish to become a Patron donating $1.00, you will almost always be paying our $4.00 per month, and of course this applied to higher tiers as well. We would never wish to take advantage of any of our loyal fans, and have them donate more than they can afford for our content. Patreon has an in built tool which allows you to limit how much you are charged in each month, so that Creators cannot take advantage by suddenly uploading 10 very short videos or something along those lines, and although we would never do this, we recommend that you take advantage of the tool due to the fact It is always possible that when their is a lot of media hype for games or movies etc. such as during events like E3 and Gamescom, we will increase the amount of videos we upload quite dramatically. As said before, we would not wish to see our Patrons pay more than they can afford.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

This kind of donation will mean so much to us and will allow us to do so much more with our channel. Of course, a donation of this level requires a suitable reward. For $25.00 per video, as well as doing everything from the lower tiers, we will do 3 things. Firstly, we will use our \u0027Adobe Creative Cloud\u0027 skills to create you a personalised logo design to your order. You could use this logo on your own YouTube channel, a Facebook page or pretty much anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter that, we will create you a short, personal thank you video from both of us, which you can download, and then watch over and over to your hearts delight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we will send you a link. This link is very special because it will give you access to a specific Google Drive folder, in this folder, you will find every single one of our videos both from the past and ones that have just been released. As well as that, you will find Uncut versions of some of our videos, where you might find bloopers, or even just funny things that we decided to cut from the final edit. What is even more great about this, is that you will be able to download a copy of any of these files to your hard drive, meaning you can watch our videos whenever you want, even without an internet connection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Disclaimers: Please note that depending on when you donate, the content inside this folder may be limited, due to the amount of videos we have create and how many uncut versions of things we have etc. Also note that we can only work on so many things at once, so creating a logo may potentially take a month or more. Of course we will keep you updated. We reserve the right to take away this logo designing reward at any point if we receive to many orders at any one time. Also note the reason we ask for your shipping address is we eventually intend to implement free Merchandise into these higher tier rewards (see Goals).\u003c/em\u003e",
