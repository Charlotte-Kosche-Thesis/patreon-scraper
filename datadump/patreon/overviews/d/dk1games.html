During times in my life when I\u0027ve felt down, I\u0027ve often turned to watching Let\u0027s Plays on YouTube to cheer myself up. That feeling of playing a video game with a friend has really brought me comfort in the past. That\u0027s a big reason why I started making gaming videos, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, planning, creating, editing, and uploading daily videos requires a significant amount of time, which is where this Patreon page comes into play. Putting videos out there is something I\u0027m passionate about and work hard at. But things in life pile up, like bills and jobs, and purchasing new equipment and games can get expensive. I would LOVE to continue posting videos, and also start livestreaming regularly, but often these aforementioned roadblocks get in the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinue creating and uploading daily Let\u0027s Play videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePour more time into the videos I create\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo gaming livestreams more often where I can chat with viewers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAfford equipment upgrades and games to make better content for you\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGive you guys some cool perks/swag as well\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI definitely don\u0027t expect everyone to be able or even want to support me, which is totally fine! \u003cstrong\u003eMy videos will always be free for everyone who visits my channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther ways you can help:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eJust \"liking\" or commenting on a video helps it reach a larger audience.
