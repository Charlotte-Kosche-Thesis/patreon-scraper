After receiving his first Ocarina back in 2000, he played as a hobby until 2007 when he began posting music videos on Youtube.com, quickly gaining a large following. He now has over 60 million video views and 200,000 Youtube subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a collection of\u00a0 nearly 200 ocarinas from the last 1700 years, David has toured the country educating the public on the history and development of the ocarina, as well as teaching his ocarina students how to make the most of their flutes and music education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDavid initiated the first major US Ocarina Gathering in 2009, held in Seattle, WA, which was sponsored by Songbird Ocarinas and SMule Inc. He also represented the United States when he attended the 2011 International Ocarina Festival in Budrio, Italy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 and 2013, David partnered with JMP Productions and Nintendo of America to present a series of ocarina workshops in New York City as part of a promotion for the traveling concert tour, \"The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses\". At one of those workshops, David performed with video game ensemble \"Videri String Quartet\" for an audience of over 200 people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, David successfully raised over $23,000 via crowdfunding for his debut studio album, \"Leave Luck to Heaven\", with 10 of the songs being original compositions. This past year, he toured the United States to promote the album and is currently working on a second album with music inspired by his 2014 tour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
