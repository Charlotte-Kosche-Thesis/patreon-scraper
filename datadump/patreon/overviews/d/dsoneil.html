    "summary": "Who is Darcy O\u0027Neil and why should you participate in his project?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is easy. First I\u0027m a scientist (chemistry) who has worked in\u00a0research and development labs for 15 years. I\u0027m curious and like to figure things out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, and probably more important, I\u0027m a drink pro*. Since 2004 I have been writing about drinks (cocktails, soda fountains and spirits at (\u003ca href=\"http://www.artofdrink.com\"\u003ewww.artofdrink.com\u003c/a\u003e) and have published one book on the history of the soda fountain (\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fix-Pumps-Darcy-S-ONeil/dp/0981175910\"\u003eFix the Pumps\u003c/a\u003e) which was nominated for \"Best New Cocktail Book\" in 2011.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can hear you say \"\u003cem\u003eDarcy, none of that relates to beekeeping?\u003c/em\u003e\" True, but I have been a beekeeper for five years and have lived on a farm for seven years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eWhat is the plan?\u003c/em\u003e\" Well, since I started beekeeping I have followed the century-old beekeeping dogma that you find online. Then I realized that most beekeepers are losing 40% to 50% of their hives every year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWould you take advice from a cattle farmer who lost 40% of their cows every year? Me neither.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, the plan is to take a hard look at current beekeeping practices and see what we can change to make things better. Large scale beekeeping is different than sideline and hobby beekeeping, and it should be reflected in the methods used to maintain healthy hives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen we will take that information and develop an improved beehive, actually, designs are well underway and the first prototype will be built shortly. We shouldn\u0027t expect miracles, but even modest improvements\u00a0can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eWhy would you want to reinvent the wheel? There are decent hive designs already.\u003c/em\u003e\" True, but the primary Langstroth hive design was developed in the 1850s and the Warr\u00e9 hive in the early 1900s. We\u0027ve learned many things in the last 100+ years and technology can help us out even more. Let\u0027s use it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no better way to learn than to try to get deep into the details of a hive and understand how bees live. The best way to learn about cooking is to make the food from scratch; the best way to learn about engine repair is to take the engine apart and rebuild it. Consider this project a classroom where we are going break the information down and build it back up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are a professional beekeeper, hobbyist or just bee-curious this project will be interesting and fun. I will even work my drink expertise into the project because if you are harvesting honey, you will need things to do with it. Honey Phosphate soda anyone?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny entertaining interludes on the farm will also be included. There is a future project where I intend to create 20+ person, multi-course meal from only things I harvest on the 13-acre\u00a0property I live (salt and yeast will be the only externally sourced exceptions). Honey plays an\u00a0important role. But more on that later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSign up, let\u0027s do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to check out the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.beespace.ca\"\u003eBeeSpace\u003c/a\u003e website and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.beetalk.ca\"\u003eBeeTalk\u003c/a\u003e forum which is where I have decided to consolidate all of the questions, comments and other communication. Though, I can answer simple questions on Twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow on Twitter:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dsoneil\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@dsoneil\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Drink pro is relative, I\u0027ve just written a lot about drinks, bartended a lot and did dozens of presentations around the world on making a better drink. \u003cbr\u003e"
