    "summary": "Thank you for all of your continued support!\u00a0 Without viewers, listeners, and readers, this doesn\u0027t exist.\u00a0 Firstly, \u003cstrong\u003emy baseline content will remain FREE\u003c/strong\u003e (with the exception of my full length novels) for all those who want to consume it.\u00a0 I think that\u0027s important.\u00a0 That being said, this Patreon page is for fans who like what I have been putting out for the last two years and want to contribute financially in order to ensure I can continue producing this content as well as improving its quality each time.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eIf you choose to become a monthly patron, pledge whatever you think is an appropriate amount for what you\u0027re getting.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e I am still thinking of ways to incentivize patrons with additional patron-only content.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you get for contributing to my efforts:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) DVRT Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e: I put out a weekly LIVE podcast discussing topics that either me, my co-host, or my community find interesting.\u00a0 These range from current events to personal interests.\u00a0 You can find this podcast on all major platforms including but not limited to iTunes, Stitcher, and Podcast Addict.\u00a0 Every episode is also posted to the \u003cstrong\u003eVossen Media YouTube Channel\u003c/strong\u003e with full video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) How to Comedy\u003c/strong\u003e: How to Comedy is a web series where I am documenting the entire process from being an open mic stand-up comic to becoming a working paid comedian.\u00a0 Every set I have ever done is contained in these episodes along with discussions of how I write bits, manage my time, and conduct the business of comedy.\u00a0 Each episode also has a section where I take ego out of the equation, honestly critique my work, and assess how to improve my performances in the future.\u00a0 Come see every success, failure, and learning experience!\u00a0 You can see me get laughs, bomb horribly, and figure out how to navigate this complex and interesting world that is stand-up comedy.\u00a0 These episodes are uploaded to the \u003cstrong\u003eVossen Media YouTube Channel\u003c/strong\u003e on an average of three times a week.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Fightin\u0027 Round the World\u003c/strong\u003e: I love martial arts.\u00a0 I had some exposure as a child and then briefly again in the military where I learned just enough to get my ass kicked under the influence of alcohol in my early 20s.\u00a0 Now as a more mature man in my mid-30s, I spend a good deal of my time at a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym here in NYC.\u00a0 The last three years of my life were changed greatly towards the positive due to BJJ.\u00a0 Although I am not an expert, I am extremely interested in analyzing fighting from a cerebral perspective nowadays.\u00a0 You can watch fight breakdowns and analysis all day but with Fightin\u0027 Round the World, I like to take you to the more obscure forms of competitive combat sports.\u00a0 I examine the primal nature of human aggression\nand analyze any discernible martial arts techniques and/or game-plan that we\nmay have the good fortune of seeing in these captured moments in time.\u00a0 Examples of previous topics are Youth MMA around the world, Medieval MMA, and hood/trailer park fights.\u00a0 This show is uploaded to the \u003cstrong\u003eVossen Media YouTube Channel\u003c/strong\u003e on an average of twice a month.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4) Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Competitions\u003c/strong\u003e: I upload all of my BJJ competition footage.\u00a0 Sometimes I win and it feels great.\u00a0 Sometimes I get choked out in front of my friends, family, and teammates.\u00a0 People seem to like that these are on the \u003cstrong\u003eVossen Media YouTube Channel\u003c/strong\u003e so I will keep uploading them as they come.\u00a0 May, 2017 is my next event.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5) Gaming Streams on Twitch\u003c/strong\u003e: I have loved video games since I was introduced to them in 1986.\u00a0 I still play most days on the \u003cstrong\u003eDougVossen Twitch Channel\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 I like streaming because it connects me to people with similar interests who I can interact with and it allows me to cross promote some of my other work.\u00a0 It\u0027s generally a good experience and I have built up a pretty cool community that I look forward to expanding in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6) Novels by Doug Vossen\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0 In December of 2015, I published my first novel, SKYFIRE (\u003cstrong\u003eavailable on Amazon\u003c/strong\u003e).\u00a0 It was generally well received and I am working on my second novel now.\u00a0 I also have my third outlined.\u00a0 Writing will always happen in the background of whatever else I am working on in my life.\u00a0 I plan to release my second novel, DIVINE EQUILIBRIUM, in the first quarter of 2018.\u00a0 For added value, you can download my work for free on your Kindle or Kindle app if you are an Amazon Prime member.\u00a0 I also make paperbacks for those who prefer physical media.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, \u003cstrong\u003ePatrons will receive public acknowledgement\u003c/strong\u003e in the form of recognition on videos and the podcast.\u00a0 This can be written or verbal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
