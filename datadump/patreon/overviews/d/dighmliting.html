This story came out of no where with incredible speed, but its so refreshing to make something over the top with a darker feel!! There will be violence, foul language, magic, demons, and probably a bunch of other things that\u0027re offensive to religious and/or conservative people.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been working on this comic for a year now. It\u0027s an adult comic with LOTS of blood and very dark themes like death, suicide, self-harm, but also lighthearted ones like love and friendship, and healthy relationships of unhealthy ones. There are a lot of important messages a want to present in this comic and though it\u0027s dramatic, it\u0027s also pretty comedic and I do intend for it to get pretty heavy but it won\u0027t be like that all the time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, with real life in the way, I\u0027m unable to spend as much time as I want to it and it\u0027s been stunted for months. I\u0027m hoping that with Patreon that will all change and I can dedicate all of my time to my comics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://dighmliting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NoxCaedis3.png\" style=\"width: 580px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANKS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
