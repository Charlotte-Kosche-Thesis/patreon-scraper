I also tend to post sketches here that I don\u0027t put anywhere else, as well as WIPs and sometimes alternate versions of pieces I don\u0027t post publicly. You\u0027ll also get access to my secret patron Dropbox, with a nice tidy easy-to-browse archive of the content I\u0027ve posted here over the years. Patrons get my paint tool SAI brushes for free, and other bonus content I\u0027ll be selling on my Gumroad in the future (sketchbooks, possible comics).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE YOUR MONEY GOES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live with various chronic health conditions and can\u0027t work very much; Patreon helps me pay the bills along with my part-time retail job (16 hours a week). Your support is SO appreciated, even if it is only one dollar-- in fact, $1 pledges are the backbone of any Patreon, so please do not think I\u0027ll be insulted by a small contribution. When you support me, you are helping me pay for stuff like clothes, shoes, \u003cdel\u003eanime figurines,\u003c/del\u003e shampoo, and ergonomic improvements to my workspace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE NITTY GRITTY STUFF\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are eligible for rewards (sketches, discounts, letters) after your card successfully charges once. You cannot \"save up\" sketch requests and \"spend\" them later to get multiple sketches in a month. Patronage itself can\u0027t be counted as payment toward a commission. Please don\u0027t repost any of the high-res images or other Patron-only content anywhere else. Please credit me with a link if you repost things I drew for you on social media!\u003cbr\u003e"
