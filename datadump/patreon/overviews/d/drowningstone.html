I have a lovely wife and two awesome sons. I\u0027m also autistic, if you\u0027re interested in knowing that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, everything on my page is free. So why buy the cow? Well, first, by donating you ensure that I have the time to make more and more music. The more donations I get, the more time I should have to devote to making and improving my craft. Secondly, when you donate, you receive an email address where you can send me personal messages about what you\u0027d like to hear, what you think of my work so far, songs you think I should cover, even lyrics you\u0027ve written yourself that you can\u0027t write music to. When you email that address, you\u0027re also added to my mailing list, and will receive periodic updates from me about what\u0027s new, what\u0027s coming and what\u0027s going on in general. Finally, you get actual CDs. I write a wide variety of music, but when I get enough, say, pop songs written to fill up an album, I\u0027ll release a disc. When I get enough rock songs written, there\u0027s another disc. I\u0027ll burn them, print them and probably have some cool album art going on, and I\u0027ll send them directly to you for no extra charge (not even shipping). So, for whatever you choose to pledge per month, you\u0027re buying every album I will ever make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT I GET OUT OF IT\u003cbr\u003eI get a bit of extra income to help keep my family afloat through some hard times, and the emotional healing that comes from working on my music and having it heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT THE MUSIC\u003cbr\u003eI write, record, mix and master everything you hear here myself. There is no band, no expensive studio, and nobody at all working on this except me. I play the instruments, I program the synth, I sing the words, I mix the levels and I do an increasingly good job of widening the stereo field, etc. \u003cbr\u003e"
