    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Taylor, and for the past six years (this will be the seventh) I\u0027ve been helping people declutter their homes, 15 minutes at a time, using the Declutter 365 plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love for you to support my efforts as a patron, either by donating to pay me for the otherwise free calendars I provide of this plan, or if you so desire, to donate enough that I\u0027ll have time to help you as part of a smaller group in succeeding with the plan, as we work through it together day by day, in a closed Facebook group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is The Declutter 365 Plan?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Declutter 365 plan is exactly what it says it is, 365 daily missions that you can follow to declutter your whole house, 15 minutes at a time. I\u0027ve put the whole process into a logical sequence, and broken down large tasks into separate missions to help you succeed in what can otherwise feel like a task too big to accomplish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an example of a calendar, for January 2018, where we focus on decluttering and organizing the kitchen, mainly:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.home-storage-solutions-101.com/image-files/declutter-your-home-calendar-january-2018-large.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst Level Of Rewards: $1/Month - A Way To Say Thank You For The Calendar\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe calendar you see above is free, and available to anyone who wants it from my website, Home-Storage-Solutions-101.com. I provide 12 of these calendars every year (January through December), and many people have found them quite helpful and want to show their appreciation for that gift, and have asked to donate some money as a thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027ve created the first level of reward here on Patreon, where you donate $1 month and receive the free monthly calendar (as well as the full yearly calendar) as a thank you. It works out to paying $1 for each calendar. If you find the thoroughly thought-out and tested Declutter 365 plan, and its accompanying calendars helpful for your own decluttering and organizing journey, I do appreciate your support as a thank you for that work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond Level Of Rewards: $4.99/Month - Let Me Help You With The Decluttering Missions In A Closed Facebook Group\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can do the Declutter 365 missions, and accompanying 52 Week Organized Home Challenge, all by yourself using just the calendar plan, and accompanying articles as your guide. It can work quite well, I\u0027ve seen it. But many people need and appreciate more support as they work through the missions, because if decluttering and organizing your home were completely easy everyone would have already done it, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA community of support is often vital to success, as well as being able to ask questions when you feel stuck and need help with a problem. That\u0027s where a Facebook group is very helpful, and it\u0027s what I want the ability to give to you in the second level of rewards, when you commit to donating $4.99/month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron at this level your bonus is an exclusive Facebook group just for donors, where we can all work through the Declutter 365 missions together, daily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you\u0027ll get in the Declutter 365 Premium Facebook group:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eReminder of the daily missions from me (I\u0027ll post each day\u0027s mission, as well as provide a link to any article I\u0027ve got related to the topic from my website);\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA weekly live video chat from me, where I can provide more guidance, and you can ask questions or bring up issues you need help with about that week\u0027s missions (and there is a replay available if you miss the live version);\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA closed group where only members can see what you\u0027re saying or posting, which can allow you to feel more comfortable sharing your triumphs and setbacks;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe ability to start your own posts and ask questions not only of me, but from the whole group, to allow a community of like-minded supportive participants of the Declutter 365 plan to help and support one another.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate any level of support you can give to the Declutter 365 missions. I\u0027ve committed years and years of my life to this plan, and have seen the results pay off for so many participants, and I hope it can help you too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 Taylor\u003cbr\u003e"
