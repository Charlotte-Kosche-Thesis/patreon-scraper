I am Andy Davies, a musician from Minneapolis, MN, and I create, perform, and release music as DoublePlusTen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music I make is meant to make you shake your butt, bounce your head, and pump your fists. I just like making fun, sometimes aggressive, sometimes calming electronic music that makes me happy and it seems like it makes other people happy, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can listen to my first two albums, \"Hourglass\" and \"Get Human\", on my \u003ca href=\"http://doubleplusten.bandcamp.com/\"\u003eBandcamp page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a way for fans of DoublePlusTen to join an exclusive group to keep up to date with everything I am working on and be the first to hear not only the the newest music, but even everything I\u0027m working in the studio! Your patronage will go back into my music by way of new software and hardware so I can make more and better music for all of us to love and to pay for live performances\u0027 costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to write and release a new album by early- to mid-June of 2018. Depending on the level of your support, you\u0027ll be able to get/hear anything from completed tracks as they are finished to each and every demo and idea I have in the process of the entire album creation or even work with me on a track for the album! (and if you\u0027re really generous, you could even get yourself a live show!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I want to hit my goal of a June album release, that means I would need to finish about 10 tracks by mid-May, averaging a song about every 2 weeks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for joining me on this journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://doubleplusten.net/patreonImages/logoSecondary.jpg\" style=\"width: 50px;\"\u003e"
