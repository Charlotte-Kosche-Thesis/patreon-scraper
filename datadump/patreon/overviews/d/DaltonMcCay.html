    "summary": "Hello out there in Patreon Land! It\u0027s my dream to become a full-time creator. I want to do projects that people will fall in love with. And I want to be a person who does things to better communities and foster communication. Currently, I\u0027m juggling about seven different projects ranging from novels and short stories to releasing my own pen and paper role-playing system, APress. Once the system is out I want to be able to use my time to create modules for it as well as work on other game/fiction projects I have in the wings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0just need some breathing room so I\u0027m not asking for much. The content is going to come out regardless of whether or not I meet my goals, but the more funding I get the more I can afford to really focus on different projects and get them to my patrons quicker. Also, please be patient with me, I\u0027m still learning to use Patreon and it\u0027s going to be a little slow at first until I start working some of the higher tier rewards into my daily routine. Rest assured, though, it will happen! I am dedicated to this cause. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are my livelihood, my patrons, and I hope in time we can also be friends."
