Based off a dear friend of mine she is the sweet girl who came home after a bad day at work to find shrunken people in her apartment. Unlike most stories in this fashion, Misery quickly becomes paranoid of these tiny invaders when she accidentally steps on one. Before long it\u0027s an all out delight for her to hunt them down and squash or gobble them up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFantaSize the animation was a hit back in 2006 and since then the cast has grown considerably. Misery has new friends, her mom has even joined into the mix, and more details have been revealed about the scientist Amanda who is behind all this size changing chaos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon will allow me to bring you more of what you love, while staying focused on my artwork! It will make commission completion time faster, comic releases more frequent, and you\u0027ll even get to see occasional behind the scenes stuff for FantaSize 2 my in production animation! Not only that but occasionally we\u0027ll take a trip outside of the FantaSize universe as well for some other giantess drawings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo join in! For just a dollar you\u0027ll have access to the regular drawings gallery. A few more and I\u0027ll get some comics on the go for you to enjoy! Don\u0027t forget too, this is a community so I more than encourage your feedback! This is all about you having fun with the FantaSize universe!\u003cbr\u003e"
