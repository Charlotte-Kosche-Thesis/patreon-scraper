    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! If you enjoy my music and want the best possible way to support me and my art, this is the place to do it! Patreon is a subscription based platform that allows fans and listeners to connect with me in a much more intimate way than buying my music off of more traditional music retailers. Instead of buying my music, you can offer me a pledge in exchange for downloads of tracks and albums, production tips, access to unreleased music, video chats, and insights into my creative process. You get to choose how much money to offer, set a monthly max, and change or stop your subscription at any time. Making a living as an artist can be extremely difficult. Almost all of my income comes from playing shows and touring which can make my income somewhat unstable. By offering me a pledge here, you are giving me a much more stable source of income and helping me to put more of my focus into writing more music so you can have more to enjoy. Thank you so much to all of you who choose to support me. None of this would be possible without you \u0026lt;3"
