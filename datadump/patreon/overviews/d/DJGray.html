Paused a second more before leaving that shop? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about if the captain of your spaceship was in a wheelchair?  What does an asexual person hear in a siren\u2019s call?  What is the most important thing in a time traveler\u2019s pocket? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe answer lies in the stories you\u2019ll get access to if you become a Patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDJ Gray is a made-up person.  It\u0027s a pen name I created to honor two of the biggest supporters of this short mischief maker and storyteller.  The last name comes from Babylon 5, one of the biggest SF/F media influences on my life.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up a wanderer and my best friends were always books, but I was one of those people who never ever was satisfied by \u201cThe End.\u201d  I always wanted more details, more stories.  This eventually led to scribbling down my ideas for what came next in notebooks and wherever else I could get a bit of space for my words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had a steady diet of folklore, history, mythology, and anything else I could get my hands on.  However, as I got older and I kept writing, I realized that there weren\u2019t a lot of stories featuring people like me.  People who were disabled. People who were asexual.  So I decided to start writing them.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGranted like most writers, I also have a day job to support this writing career of mine. \u00a0My hope is to one day, be able to quit the day job and support myself with the writing. \u00a0Patreon is a start in that direction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat You Get:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort Stories and Novellas written by me.  Mostly Science-Fiction or Fantasy, but could also branch out into any number of subgenres (Time Travel, Cthulhu Mythos, Solarpunk, Alternate  Histories).  You also get to help me choose the theme of what I\u2019ll be writing on that month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Often You\u2019ll Get It: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least once a month.  Sometimes there\u2019ll be more than one story a month.  You\u2019ll be the first to see them for a while.  They\u2019ll be access-locked to Patreon supporters for at least 6 months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Conclusion:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for getting this far! \u00a0I\u0027d love it if you selected a patron level, kept an eye out for updates, and let the stories flow. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, thank you so much for even considering a thing.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
