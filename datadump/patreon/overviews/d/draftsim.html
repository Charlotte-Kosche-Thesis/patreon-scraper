    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Dan and I LOVE to draft. That\u0027s why I am so passionate about running the best MTG Draft simulator on the web, \u003ca href=\"http://draftsim.com\"\u003eDraftsim\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince 2015, Draftsim has been bringing you the best draft practice tool with great AI, pick suggestions, autobuild, and a mind-boggling speed of new set updates. Hundreds of thousands of you have used Draftsim to learn to draft, improve your skills, or to familiarize yourself with the new cards in time for the prerelease. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter helping you for such a long time - now Draftsim needs your help. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDraftsim always has been and always will be free. But there\u0027s a lot going on behind the scenes. I spend hours and hours each set poring over the spoiler and rating all the cards myself so you can start drafting ASAP after the set is revealed!\u00a0 For example, \u003cem\u003eIconic Masters\u003c/em\u003e was up and running on Draftsim within just hours of being spoiled. There\u0027s so much more I want to do with the site, but I just don\u0027t have the time or the funding right now to accomplish everything.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where you come in - I\u0027m so excited about what we can do together: Currently the site design is quite barebones and simple looking. My goal is to vastly improve the deckbuilding tool and create a super-advanced AI. Imagine being able to drag your cards in and out of your deck, resize the screen on the fly or have the system rate \"how good\" your draft was. And what about having bots that draft based on mana curve and synergy too? (Yes please!)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe money you give through Patreon will go toward:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePaying for help with site design and development\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImproving server/hosting infrastructure that runs the site\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFreeing up my time to add even more sets and content to the site!\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eMasters sets, \"UN\" sets, and special releases are all great examples of this\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor \u003cu\u003eway \nless than the price of just one draft per month\u003c/u\u003e, you can give back and help shape the future of Draftsim. Just think about all the extra packs you\u0027re already winning because of your practice :) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your support and for being part of such an \n\u003cstrong\u003eawesome\u003c/strong\u003e community! Your kind words and help have always deeply inspired me and I\u0027m looking forward to making Draftsim even better. Any help at all is appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
