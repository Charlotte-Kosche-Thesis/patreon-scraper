Dark Days is the adventure of Jack Ganon as he searches for his missing brother. He is quickly swept up into a larger conflict that threatens much more than him and his search. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I\u0027ve been working on this comic, at least as a concept, for the past 8 years I\u0027ve finally started drawing it and it\u0027s quickly dawned on me that it is a full-time job. The purpose of this Patreon is to help me make Dark Days my first priority. I won\u0027t ask anyone to support who cannot, so please do not strain yourself to help me. However, if you can find some worth in what I\u0027m doing then it would be greatly appreciated to have your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil I can fully pivot from working on the side to working fully dedicated I will also be doing illustrations and drawings to keep content coming on this page. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your interest and I hope more than anything that you enjoy Dark Days.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
