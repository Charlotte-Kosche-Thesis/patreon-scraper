    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWho Are You Guys?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, Everyone, we are the Darkest Timeline Film Podcast, which is a group of five friends (or down to three friends depending on scheduling) that decided to make our Bad Movie Night into a podcast, and we decided to call it the Darkest Timeline because we\u0027d been talking about Community for some reason. Our backgrounds vary greatly from our States of birth to our day jobs, but this is how we\u0027ve all decided to unwind, however unwise that might be.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFun Stuff, But Why Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy, how kind of you to ask. I think I\u0027ll tell you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, we\u0027ve been doing this podcast since January (2016) with absolutely no plan on how to do anything other than losing money on it, and it turns out that we could have just made a Patreon right off the bat! Ha! But we really would like to get paid for all the time we put into this thing\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, starting with Season 3, we wanted to start doing more things, which is where actually making money would really come in handy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThings? What Things?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, to start off, we\u0027ve already made a YouTube Channel just the other day, but that doesn\u0027t affect this page at all, so I\u0027ll leave it out.\u00a0We\u0027re actually going to be making designs that can go on shirts and such, which you will be able to see the creation process of with the $10 tier.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI think the biggest thing we want to do is the Patreon-Exclusive Podcast, which would come out once a month, and feature a movie that the $20 and up tier have voted on during the previous month. That\u0027s only really going to happen if we have enough people to vote on something. It\u0027d be sad if it was just one guy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are some other things that we\u0027re not quite ready to talk about, cause they would require a lot more money to deal with, but we\u0027ll get there.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo, Where Is My Money Going?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGlad you asked. Well, at first it will allow us to not just lose money (food and beverages for the movie. The movie itself. Advertising. Etc.). But the immediate plan is to just massively improve the quality of the podcast by buying new equipment and eventually renting space that we can actually control.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nObviously, it will also be going toward paying David, Brett, Ian, Dylan, and John for their time (on a weekly basis depending on who shows up). If we were making upwards of $2500 a podcast, it would become something of a part time job, and some of us could take the night off work more often without burdening ourselves financially. That\u0027s really the goal.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnything over our goals just helps up save up for larger projects!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAnything Else?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes: Thank You. All of you. We\u0027ve really had fun thus far, and I think we could have a lot more if we could afford to spend more time on it. So, thank you, whoever you may be, for reading this. And thank you, so much more, for listening to the five of us.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
