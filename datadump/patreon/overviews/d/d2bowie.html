I was already a warcraft 3 and mods fan so the transition was not that hard. \u003cstrong\u003eAt the time i played a lot of MTG and what i loved about that game was how open ended and well thought it was. Endless possibilities, a simple game with enourmous skill ceiling, eventual patches and beautiful art and lore. Dota had all that with the added benefit of being free to play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time went by I learned more and more about the game, when Dota2 came out i was ranked at 3.5k MMR and my constant thirst for improvement brought me at 5k MMR even though I \u003cstrong\u003ehad\u003c/strong\u003e college duties and a girlfriend . One of my great passions inside of Dota is to analyze and break what more experienced players do, it is something i love and something that helped me grow as a player as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to bring together my love for the game and a way to help you guys learn more about Dota and what makes it so exciting. I do that with videos like this one:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aq_2V6OzOyo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eMore about me:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eMy name is Gustavo Mattos, I am a 5k Brazilian Player undergraduate Chemical Engineer that loves strategy games, stats, Dota, every type of music, making food, beer, travelling and wants a career on e-sports.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy I need help:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e6 Months ago I started my Brazilian Channel and at that time \u003cstrong\u003ei did not have enough time to maintain both of my channels at once so i decided to give that channel and my country\u0027s scene some love\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e3 months ago right at the time that I decided to start updating both channels at once\u00a0 my video card broke\u003c/strong\u003e (The Dispel Video was the first one I did for the international channel).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I couldn\u0027t play anymore there were still some options to keep making videos : Youtube replays, Vlogs, Raw Analysys . Some of these videos got very good reviews and that only makes me thirstier on what could I do with better support. My goals as of now are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGetting enough money to buy a similar GPU : with that I could analyze entire replays instead of being limited to one player perspective\u003c/strong\u003e. (DONE)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6xAcX_1xFA\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eGetting enough backers to be able to move out of my house and dedicate way more time into this project. As of now I can only record my stuff past midnight because a lot of people live in my house and it is really noisy, because of that streaming (another possible revenue source) is also not an option (added the gpu incident). \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
