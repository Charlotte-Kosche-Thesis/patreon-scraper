    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey friends! My name is Dins and I\u0027m an artist and comic creator. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very passionate about creating stories and characters and I love getting to share them with the world. I enjoy exploring aspects of my life my academic background in my work, and aim to create atypical but organic characters, bringing something refreshing and (hopefully) unique...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on two comics:\u003cbr\u003eOne is a sci-fi action/mystery called\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tapastic.com/series/Positron\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePositron\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eabout a young soldier, Martin Pryce. His life changes dramatically when a warp core explosion grants him the ability to jump through time and space, but leaves him stranded as a survivor of an attack with unknown motivations. Although empowered, he soon finds himself pulled into ethical and political conflict that forces him to reconsider his loyalties and place in a new world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second is a supernatural horror drama named\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tapas.io/series/moonland\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMoonland\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. This story is shorter and experiments more with style than content. Henry, a young but jaded writer, is faced with a traumatising event that forces him to abandon his old life as a recluse and finally think of more than just himself. Wandering the boreal forest in his quest for revenge, he soon finds out the woods are filled with things far more terrible than him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePositron updates weekly and deals with the concepts of loss, morality and the nature of science and humanity. Moonland updates sporadically and focuses on isolation, duty and connecting to others... as well as monsters and gore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a hobbyist, the time I put into comics detracts from the studying and commission work I need to support myself. With Patreon, I hope to remove some of that pressure so that I can keep creating new content.\u00a0In an ideal future, Patreon support could make it possible for me to treat comics as a part time job, ensuring that I can always keep putting this amount of effort into my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much if you consider becoming a patron and supporting me in my journey as an artist. Your support truly means the world to me! \u2764 \u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t hesitate to get in touch if you have questions, suggestions or job offers.\u003cbr\u003e"
