    "summary": "In an era where the Major Studios have a near-monopoly on feature-length animation, DAWGTOWN is an independent film in the truest sense.\u00a0 It\u0027s hand-drawn, traditional animation for teens and adults (much like classics \u0027Watership Down\u0027 and \u0027The Plague Dogs\u0027). DAWGTOWN is the story of a young Pitbull and his struggle to escape from the world\u0027s largest underground dog-fighting organization.\u00a0 It\u0027s \u0027Gladiator\u0027 meets \u0027The Shawshank Redemption\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDAWGTOWN began as my Master\u0027s Thesis in college in 2012 and have put 4 years and thousands of dollars into the film, hiring animators from all over the world, and even hiring voice talents JASON BEGHE (star of NBC\u0027s Chicago PD) and Former World Heavyweight Champion GEORGE FOREMAN. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe entire movie has been story-boarded and edited. I am now in the process of replacing the story-board shots with finished animation and backgrounds.\u00a0 Of course this costs money, and your support will help keep me and my animators working.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a supporter, you will have access to artwork, shots and even full scenes that will not be posted publicly while the film is in production.\u00a0 You will also have access to behind-the-scenes videos that provide an inside look at the process of how an animated feature is created, as well as interviews with the artists and voice talent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love animation, and believe that independent voices need to be heard, then this project is for you!\u003cbr\u003e"
