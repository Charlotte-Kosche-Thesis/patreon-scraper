My name is Darius, but everyone online knows me as DWall. I\u0027m 24 \nyears old, and I have been writing novels for about ten years or so. My \nultimate goal in life was to not only write stories, but to be able to \nhelp inspire and encourage people with the help of my stories. But now \nthere is another goal that I want to achieve... As you may know, I have been doing a gaming channel on YouTube for nearly five years, and I want to eventually turn that into a full time career! I also plan to not only start a Twitch channel, but to also start a Discord server as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of goals that I want to accomplish in my life: start my own wrestling company, write a lot of great, entertaining novels, use my love for video games and wrestling to inspire people to always pursue their dreams and goals and to never give up on them no matter how hard things get...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I can\u2019t do them alone, which is why I need your help. And even so much as $1 a month can help me along my journey. Also, you also get some cool rewards and prizes, that are listed on the page. Please take some time to check them out, and more will be added in the future! Thank you again for reading and I hope you enjoy all of my future content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
