    "summary": "Let\u0027s start this off right. I\u0027m supposed to introduce myself to you. I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s the best plan since after people meet me they usually hate me. Seriously, the day I was born the doctor looked down at me and told my mother this kid is going to be a huge disappointment. My mother, being the sweet and kind woman she is, looked him right and the eye and said \"You couldn\u0027t be more right.....I was hoping for a girl. Can you pass me that cigarette\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI should have known what was in store for me the day my father decided to acknowledge my existence at the age of 6. He came into my room, sat next to me and said \"today kid (he never admitted I was his son) is the day you are going to learn what it means to be a man. After he unchained me and led me from the cell .... I mean my room, I started my new and exciting career. I didn\u0027t understand exactly why the goats needed their scrotums shaved but I was just glad to not be hanging upside down anymore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a few years later when I stumbled into a school thinking it was a bar for midgets. After ordering a drink from the wench with the ruler I was told I needed to attend this institution of learning or my parents would be put in jail. Even though that sounded just fine to me I decided to stay and check this place out. I was intrigued by all the kids running around the building with actual clothes on. As I looked down at my tattered paper clothing comprised mostly of unpaid bills and tears I had an epiphany. It was there in that hallway the heavens opened up, trumpets played and I came to the blinding conclusion my parents were two of the biggest assholes this side of Lake Michigan. Years later I found out this revelation wasn\u0027t so unusual but it still was a profound moment in my life. I found myself standing tall with a glimmer of hope in my eye as I walked home barefoot in the rain with my \"clothes\" melting off my body with every new raindrop. I knew I had a purpose in life and that purpose was to find a way to be the biggest jerk this world has ever seen. I was going to see the fault in everything everyone ever did. First thing, of course, was to head straight home and burn that sucker down. Unfortunately the rain hindered those plans so I decided turning my parents in for not paying taxes on all the marijuana they were selling illegally would do the trick. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSchool was hard......or I should say it was hard to sleep in school with the teacher talking all the time but I did learn quickly that enough cough syrup can make any hard surface comfortable. There was one aspect of school I did like though, art. I\u0027m not sure if it was all the drugs my mom did when she was pregnant or the lack of oxygen to my brain when my \"father\" tried to strangle me with my own umbilical cord or just the fact I wasn\u0027t very bright that made it so easy for me to let my mind go and really delve into my artistic endeavors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now you know my story.....or at least the beginning of it. I\u0027d like to share the rest with you but unfortunately being an artist is one of the dumbest ways to make a living.....second only to being an author. But as I said, I\u0027m not that bright so I am going to attempt to do both. I\u0027m currently working on a book filled with art. Cartoon art to be precise but this isn\u0027t going to be something you will want to share with your kiddos. Well until they are older and the world has beaten all the hopes and dreams from their souls.... then share away. So here\u0027s the deal, you give me money, I draw you cartoons. It\u0027s pretty simple even for you morons to understand. Oh and after I draw enough of these obvious and irrelevant comics I will then be gathering them together with a collection of stories and putting together a book for you to enjoy reading while you are pooping. I\u0027m already pretty far along so with your help I can finish soon and then start the arduous task of getting the second edition on it\u0027s way to a bathroom near you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
