    "summary": "You can find lots of information on the web, in books, in online courses, etc., about how to write or how to speak.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m interested in more than just sharing information with you. I want to give it impact and \"real life,\" because I want to help you do that with your message. You are more than just a scribbler or a talker: you are a \u003cstrong\u003eRaconteur\u003c/strong\u003e, making a difference to the people who read or hear your words.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4760/39654716384_4a02dd0540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen you communicate effectively, getting the words \"right\" matters, of course. Meeting expectations in terms of grammar, punctuation, rules, etc.\u2014all that matters. But when you get right down to it, effective communication isn\u0027t so much about getting the words right as it is about giving the words impact. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work with individuals and groups to help them craft compelling messages about whatever they care most about. I\u0027m all about communication effectiveness. I do this through Medium posts, blogs, magazine articles, books, and desktop videos. I speak, teach, train, and create online courses. (You can see something of my approach by taking a look at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://donnellking.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@donnell.king\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not just about a job skill. It\u0027s about life! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am coming to Patreon as part of a plan to do more to help people write more effectively and speak more effectively. I hope you will join me in that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the material I produce seems useful, you can help get that material to a wider audience by supporting my work here on Patreon. As thanks, you will get access to information and to \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e that goes deeper than what\u0027s available on the open web.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI remember subscribing to magazines like \u003cem\u003eAnalog Science Fiction\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eWriter\u0027s Digest\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eReason\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eEsquire\u003c/em\u003e, and many others, looking forward to each issue and taking satisfaction in knowing I was supporting writers, editors, and photographers in bringing their insights to me and to the world. I was part of a community! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of those magazines remain, of course, but more and more people go straight to writers and other artists without the middleman of the publisher. Patreon and similar sites offer a great service for both writers and readers. You can support the folks who interest you with a relatively small contribution each month and be in much closer community than your magazine subscriptions brought you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s why I\u0027m here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you be my Patron? In so doing, you would help me, and, perhaps most importantly, you would help the people (including yourself) who could directly benefit from having greater impact communicating their own ideas to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStudies by Stanford Research Institute and the Carnegie Mellon Foundation among Fortune 500 CEOs suggest that around 75% of long-term job success comes from \"soft skills,\" according to a textbook by Ashok K. Sinha and Nisha Singh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me help you and others! Join the community of \u003cstrong\u003eRaconteurs\u003c/strong\u003e. I would love to partner with you. Just pick out the reward tier you prefer over on the right, and I look forward to meeting you! \u003cbr\u003e"
