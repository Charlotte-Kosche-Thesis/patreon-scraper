I\u2019m Darius Brasher, and I write superhero novels. Eleven-year-old me would squeal with delight if he knew this is what I would wind up doing as a grown-up. I was obsessed with superheroes when I was eleven. I still am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two ongoing superhero series, the \u003cem\u003eOmega Superhero Series\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003eSuperhero Detective Series\u003c/em\u003e, both of which are available through Amazon and are a part of the Kindle Unlimited program.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/1QEtDkZ\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e is a link to all my books on Amazon. Both series are set in the same fictional universe in which superpowered people must become licensed by the government to legally use their powers. The \u003cem\u003eOmega Superhero Series\u003c/em\u003e tells the story of Theodore Conley as he transforms from a simple farm boy into one of the most powerful superheroes in the world. The \u003cem\u003eSuperhero Detective Series\u003c/em\u003e chronicles the adventures of Truman Lord, a wisecracking private investigator who is also a licensed superhero.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, I have a total of eight full-length superhero novels that were written over a two year period, for an average of one book published every three months. (That seems fast, but I know people who publish really good books every single month. Thinking of those speed demons makes my head hurt and my fingers tired.) Starting in 2018, I anticipate releasing a new book in both ebook and paperback formats every two to three months. Each book will be full of more superhero awesomeness than you can shake a stick at. Which begs the question of why you go around shaking sticks at things, unless you have superpowers and stick-shaking is how you activate them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI often have fans (I have fans! Yay! I love them all!) contact me and\nask for things like autographed books, to find out the background of a\ncharacter or a scene, to pick my brain as to how I came up with a story, how\nthey can help me publish books faster, and a bunch of\nother things. So I thought I\u0027d start this Patreon page through which people\nwho enjoy my work can help me write more of it with a little financial support\nin exchange for special perks and rewards they can\u0027t get anywhere else and no one else will have access to. It\u0027s like us forming our very own superhero team to help each other. I\u0027ll need to do more crunches, though, if you expect me to squeeze into tights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne hundred percent of any money you pledge to join our exclusive superhero community will be poured into me producing more\nand better books--commissioning better covers, retaining more editors, hiring voice actors for audiobooks, researching a super-speed serum so I can write faster, that sort of thing.\nUnless you pledge enough for me to buy a tropical island. \u0027Cause tropical\nislands are awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhether you pledge one dollar a month or one million dollars\na month (tropical islands aren\u0027t cheap, after all), know that I am grateful and I will make it more than worth your while.\u003cbr\u003e"

And y\u0027all will get to decide what I write! I\u0027ll put up a post asking you what you want to read, and that will be what I write. The stories will stay exclusive to you all for the year after we hit the $1,000 threshold. After that, I reserve the right to publish them.",
