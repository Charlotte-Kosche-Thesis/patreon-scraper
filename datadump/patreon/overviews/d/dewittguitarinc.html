    "summary": "Hello, I am Marshall DeWitt. I recently retired from a long and successful career. Though my career focus was in computer software and systems architecture my true passion lies in woodworking, specifically building guitars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to present a proposal to assist our armed services men and women that have given us more than their fair share. My proposal combines my passion with a desire to honor and support those who have so selflessly served our country. I am here because I believe that together we can accomplish this goal so much more effectively than we could independently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn associated portion of my venture will be organizations such as or similar to Guitars for Vets (G4V), a non-profit out of Milwaukee. Though there is not currently a G4V or similar organization working with the Savannah and Hinesville, GA Veterans Affairs (VA), I am already communicating with the VA to get one of these organizations\u00a0started. These existing guitar playing programs provide\u00a0a unique support structure for veterans struggling with PTSD and other disorders that allows them to rediscover their joy through the healing power of music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClinical trials have proven the remarkable impact this form of therapy has on the symptoms experienced by our veterans. As part of the graduation from this learn to play guitar program, participants receive a new acoustic guitar. My goal and the purpose of this proposal is to provide the guitars gifted through these programs free of charge to the Savannah and Hinesville VA-programs for each graduating student.\u00a0 To this end, I have formed my own nonprofit, DeWitt Guitar Inc (DGI). Through DGI, I will be providing my shop, tools, labor, and expertise as free resources. DGI will build guitars to be gifted to the veterans suffering from PTSD that graduate from the guitar playing classes. However, guitar building also requires raw materials, such as tonewood and guitar hardware. After a time, wear and tear on equipment will necessitate replacement of items like saw blades and drill bits, creating additional costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my own, these costs would be prohibitive; but, together, we could truly make a difference in the lives of so many members of our military. Over 800,000 U.S. veterans suffer from PTSD. On average, we lose 22 of them every single day to suicide. I believe we can start to change that. These guitars give our veterans a chance to connect with each other through a shared musical experience, creating a sense of brotherhood outside of the realm of combat. The US Department of Veterans Affairs has documented that these guitar\u00a0programs decrease PTSD symptoms by approximately 27%. Please help me to begin to repay the great debt we owe these men and women\u00a0by helping them to regain a sense of peace through music and become the person they once were. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Each guitar built by DGI will cost approximately $800 to $1000 in materials. These guitars would typically sell for over $5000 each; however, they will be given to PTSD recovering veterans as gifts. This goal will allow for the classes of 10 students to receive guitars every 10 weeks.\u003cbr\u003eUpon reaching this goal I will begin to provide captured build techniques and design principles for website publishing to this site and a future book that provides more specific details. The book will allow other luthiers to adopt these methods as they see fit. The book will be made available from this site for purchase.\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "Once the first few 10-week training classes are completed and the DGI guitars are delivered to the veterans we will be modifying our shop to allow us to build guitars at a faster pace. Faster guitar construction and possibly a small amount of automated template cutout ability could allow us to service both the Savannah and Hinesville, Georgia VAs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also will see a lessening of material costs due to the newly realized material volumes. So, we should be able to move forward an increased number of student\u0027s and accomplish the above enhancements. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this new level of\u00a0funding\u00a0we will also start creating the book on our processes and the engineering techniques associated with the way we build guitars. Our approach is different from other luthiers that we know and published approaches.\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "This goal is for your second year. We will extend the concept of building at a faster pace and automation, without reducing our hands-on tone-wood tuning approach, which provides our sound quality and timbre. This approach requires a vast amount of time and can never be removed from our process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo accomplish faster builds and automated techniques we will focus only on material rough cutout instrument sides, backs, tops, necks, etc.; however, the tuning, finish, and all other portions of our builds will remain unchanged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSavannah and Hinesville, Georgia VAs will be in full focus along with the above modifications for this level of funding. Our book will also come to a completed state under this new funding and be published.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "This goal is for establishing DeWitt Guitar Inc. as a nonprofit. The funds are already spent, out of pocket. However, I felt it was appropriate to charge these dollars back to GDI. If any of the contributors have\u00a0an issue with this please message me so I will know. THANK YOU. The setup amount was $1500. I have subtracted $300 from the total to arrive at the $1200 shown. The $300 came from my initial funding talk at Fia Rua discussed in the messages section of this webpage. This goal will move to the next level in about 10 weeks. And as always: THANK YOU\u003cbr\u003e",
