This place is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to support what you\u2019re doing: helping you create awesome wordpress websites and further your knowledge with plugins, SEO, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s videos on wordpress and other plugin tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping people create their own business\u0027s and be able free to make your own schedule or have freedom to spend more time with your family! Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like) per YouTube training that I create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gears.jpg\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I tend to publish about 8 Wordpress Website Tutorial videos to the Darrel Wilson channel. Each time I do so, I share that YouTube training here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of YouTube trainings I publish that month determines how much you contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you pledge $1 per YouTube Video and that month I publish 4 videos you\u0027ll contribute $4 for that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you can pledge $10 per YouTube Wordpress Tutorial, get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $10, thus supporting 1 YouTube Wordpress Video that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either. You will still continue to get my YouTube trainings even if I publish additional YouTube trainings that go beyond your maximum contribution limit for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/give-money.jpg\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to invest into producing free Wordpress Tutorial training videos and digital marketing videos for the YouTube community. This is better than a college education!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do more important things like walk my dog :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eShoot, I don\u0027t have money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/no-money1.png\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem at all! Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money or are struggling financially. I know what that feels like and want you to take care of more important priorities first. I will continue to make videos and podcast episodes that I hope will help you not only change lives, but even earn a bit of extra revenue from YouTube to alleviate some of your financial pressure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://darrelwilson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/984104_10206405894292258_7791615947534853298_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 318px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Darrel Wilson.

Everyone called me crazy. Im here to do the same for you. Dont let anyone tell you that your crazy for wanting to do something different. Take the risk, its worth every second.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! I really does mean a lot to me. My family and I really appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e"
