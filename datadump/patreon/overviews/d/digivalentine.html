What\u0027s happening, everybody? \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m DiGi Valentine, an online video content creator from North London.\u003cbr\u003eThe topics of my videos usually fall under the video-game genre since it\u0027s the form of entertainment I find myself more strongly connected to. \u003cbr\u003eOn some rare occasions I can dip into other areas such as cartoons and comics, but my main focus is with video-games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I can produce a variety of different video-game orientated content for \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DiGiValentine/\"\u003emy channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, my main flagship show is the one that seems to have drawn the largest audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat show is called \u003cstrong\u003eWho Dat?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.spectramisarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/whodat1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my Who Dat show I take one video-game character per episode and review them.\u003cbr\u003eNot only do I give a brief insight into the characters back story, but I then cover what I like and dislike about the characters visual design, personality and importance to their world as well as our own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a great little show that allows me to analyse these characters and share my thoughts on why I believe they have been presented in the ways that they have. I will occasionally throw some humour into my videos too, just to keep things light-hearted and fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho Dat is a demanding show though, and producing each episode does take me quite a long time, especially if I want to make sure I\u0027m giving each episode my all. \u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, things are only made more difficult for me due to a particularly large factor in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving in London.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.spectramisarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/whodat4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love London, I truly do. It\u0027s my home and it\u0027s a wonderful city. I am proud to be from the LDN.\u003cbr\u003eBut the cost of living here is insane. Due to family reasons, moving away to a cheaper location is not an option either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith jobs putting me back to square one I decided to try and make a career out of my passion instead. Maybe I would get lucky like others had done.\u003cbr\u003eThings were actually progressing fairly well for a while. I was able to balance money from part time work with the money I was earning from my content to cover bills, but then disaster struck. YouTube began demonetizing videos that they deemed unfriendly for advertisers and crippled my income. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I can\u0027t rely on the platform to help me get by.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the costs of living in London on my shoulders, knowing I\u0027ve started something really good with Who Dat is heartbreaking when I have to consider the very real possibility that I might have to cancel my show to find another career. I don\u0027t want to do that. I love what I do and I want to explore every possible option before I throw in the towel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is why after nearly three years of trying to do this on my own I\u0027ve come to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.spectramisarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/whodat2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWith my Patreon I aim to firstly stabilize my income. If I can reach my first goal it will allow me to fully focus on making the show without having to worry if I\u0027ll be able to pay the bills or not. Producing Who Dat as well as any other content will finally become a stable career. \u003cbr\u003eThe goals beyond the initial goal open up more possibilities of growing the show itself, changing my restricted living and working environment to something more reasonable, as well as hiring people to help me make my content better than it is. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recognise that my goals are tall orders but they\u0027re very real, they are my life and I want to make sure I never downplay how important they are to me. I really want to give this everything I\u0027ve got. I hope to build towards reaching these goals slowly over time as the show continues to grow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help me achieve my goals I have a couple of unique and interesting reward tiers that you may find appealing, so please do check those out and see if anything takes your fancy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read a more detailed explanation of my goals in the \u003cstrong\u003eGoal tab\u003c/strong\u003e at the top left of this page.\u003cbr\u003eFor more information on my \u003cstrong\u003eReward tiers\u003c/strong\u003e head over to the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll support will be incredibly appreciated and I thank you whole heartedly for any pledges you\u0027re able to make, regardless of the amount.\u003cbr\u003eCheers, everybody ~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eTHANKS FOR YOUR TIME\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.spectramisarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/whodat6.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

It does also allow me to invest a small amount into the content I produce, but no more than I currently spend right now.
