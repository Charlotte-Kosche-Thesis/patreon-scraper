    "summary": "My name is David and I tell stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI concentrate on thought provoking thrillers. This runs the gamut from science fiction to horror. My books are brutal in parts, hilarious in others. I\u0027ve had fans write me and tell me that they cried when finishing my books, from how \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0my characters feel to them, as well as having to leave the world behind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have some of the greatest fans in the world; I\u0027m truly blessed. I don\u0027t even like using the word \u0027fans\u0027 when describing my closest readers--they\u0027re more like friends. Every year for Christmas, my first real \u0027fan\u0027 asks her daughter to get all my books, signed by yours truly.\u00a0I gladly sign them, and charge nothing, because I\u0027m blown away that someone would ask for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write full time, but I\u0027m also running an entire publishing business. Everything from the first sentence on the page, to the cover art, marketing expenses, even the back of the book copy--all of that comes from me, and it all takes time and money. By donating here, you\u0027re helping me compete with people like Stephen King and James Patterson, who have multi-million dollar marketing arms that help propel their books up the charts. I know money is tight for everyone, but if you can give a dollar per month, it would be life changing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any suggestions, or just want to drop me a line, email me at david@davidbeersfiction dot com. I always answer emails personally."
