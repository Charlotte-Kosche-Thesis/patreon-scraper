Resides in Howard Beach Queens NY, home of many infamous Capos and Buttons. Ventured into Indy Wrestling as a manager for a hot second. His all time favorite movie is Goodfellas, enjoys a nice glass of Red Wine with his Linguini Aglio e Olio, and has been Politically Incorrect way before being Politically Incorrect became cool again.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nKevin Castle:\n\u003c/strong\u003e Italian in his 40\u2019s, heavily inked (tatooed), has worked in the Hard Rock and Heavy Metal music industry for decades. Resides in Queens NY, and was\u00a0brought up part of a Military family. He favors\u00a0classic Horror \u0026amp; Slasher flicks, enjoys Yoo-Hoo, and considers himself Politically Independent.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what do these two have in common? Well, actually not much other than they\u2019ve been life long wrestling fans. And even that has them at opposite ends. Growing up, Don Tony favored WWF and ECW, while Kevin Castle favored Florida Championship Wrestling, World Class, and NWA.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://wrestling-news.com/patreon/KENDTSHIRT.jpg\" style=\"width: 212px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\nSince 1999, Anthony \" Don Tony\" DeBlasi\u00a0turned a hobby running a\u00a0wrestling hotline for thousands, into podcasts that now\u00a0generate millions of downloads annually.
