You, my Listeners and Patrons, are most important to me. You make it possible for me to continue doing what I\u0027m doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI make music, of course: jazz, smooth jazz, and blues saxophone music (with some other stuff sprinkled in). But I\u0027m also, with intention, spreading love with my music. And I don\u0027t mean just love for the saxophone or love for jazz. I\u0027m talking about human, heartfelt, genuine, healing, high-vibration love. That\u0027s my intention with my music and that\u0027s what you are helping me do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot familiar with my music?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/851230/The-Music-Of-Dr.-SaxLove/\"\u003eHere\u0027s a good place to start\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cem\u003ebe sure click the 3D button\u003c/em\u003e - it\u0027s a lot more interesting that way).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s easy. You tell Patreon how much you want to contribute to support me each month (even just $1 is awesome) and then, conveniently and amazingly, you get rewards - extra content, free downloads, video chats, etc.! It\u0027s just that easy. And you can, of course, cancel your patronage at any time.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy job, then, is to create great music and great content that you\u0027ll love and enjoy and that will make you feel happy - if you\u0027re happy, I\u0027m happy! I\u0027m extremely grateful for your support and I\u0027ll work hard to make sure you feel good about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your support and consideration, your patronage, and your love. \u003c/strong\u003eI am here to help bring more love into the world through the music that flows through me (I am but a conduit). Without you, dear listener, I could not do what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease let me know if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, critiques, interesting stories, life-changing realizations or gestalts; any interesting art or videos you\u0027d like to share with me; anything at all, I want to hear from you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, thank you, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e~Mark Maxwell (Dr. SaxLove)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave more Questions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: I\u0027m not sure how much to pledge. Can you help me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Sure. Keep in mind that even $1 is significant, so if that\u0027s all you can afford - that\u0027s awesome! If you\u0027re a little better off and you want to help a little more, consider $5 or $10. If you\u0027re really blessed, and you really want to say something loud and beautiful, consider pledging $25 or more. Also, if you\u0027re feeling really generous, keep in mind that you can write in a higher amount on any level - it\u0027s completely up to you. Also, keep the rewards in mind; those might be significant to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can I stop donating at any time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Yes, you can cancel any time. There is no commitment beyond the now - you can simply login in and change or cancel your pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: When are my pledges deducted from my account?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Pledges are deducted on the 1st of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why don\u0027t you ask for pledges per song or per video?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: I thought about that, but in the end I decided that since I do a lot of new music and lot of videos and it would just be simpler to do a monthly thing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: I\u0027m not comfortable making a monthly pledge, but I would like to contribute.
