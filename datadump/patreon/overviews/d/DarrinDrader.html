    "summary": "Darrin Drader has been a freelancer in the tabletop\nroleplaying game field since 2000, and a semi-professional self-published\nauthor since 2012. He explores the realms and galaxies of the imagination, and forges\nhis ideas into genre fiction for the entertainment of others. He loves to tell\nstories, whether people interface with them directly via games, or read about\nthe exploits of well-developed characters in his fiction. Although he continues\nto work with various well known publishers, he would prefer to create material\ndirectly for fans of his work. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDarrin loves what he does and would continue to do it with no compensation if that\nwere the only way forward. Being a writer isn\u2019t a job, it\u2019s part of a person\u2019s\nidentity. However, this is a platform that can make exciting things happen. With your support,\nhe would like to transform his career, taking what is essentially a hobby that\noccasionally pays and turning it into a secondary source of income. The\nlong-term goal would be to make this his primary source of income, allowing him\nto quit his day job and focus entirely on his writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a Patron, you will receive electronic copies of all\nmaterials Darrin creates independent of other publishers. In addition to this,\nwhere possible, he will also provide patrons with work done for other\npublishers. Currently, there are plans to publish fiction in his\nspace opera universe, Reign of Discordia, as well as his alternate history\nGreek fantasy series, The Atheniad. In addition to this, he intends to release\nnew third party content for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, and\npossibly other systems\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBelow is a short list of the major works he has contributed to\nor authored to date, and the publishers he has worked with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFiction:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Atheniad: Echoes\nof Olympus\u003c/strong\u003e (novel) (historical fantasy, alternate history) \u2013 self published\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNuclear Sunset: Legacy\nof Ruin\u003c/strong\u003e (novel) (post-apocalyptic science fiction) \u2013 Vigilance Press\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUpcoming Fiction:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Atheniad: Pearls\nof Atlantis\u003c/strong\u003e (novel) (historical fantasy, alternate history) \u2013 self published\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eReign of Discordia:\nNeurogenesis\u003c/strong\u003e (novel) (space opera science fiction) \u2013 self published\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eUntitled fantasy\nnovel\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 The Ed Greenwood Group\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eUntitled Interface\nZero novel\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Gun Metal Games\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRoleplaying Games\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBook of Exalted Deeds\u003c/strong\u003e,\nD\u0026amp;D 3.5 edition \u2013 Wizards of the Coast\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eForgotten Realms:\nSerpent Kingdoms\u003c/strong\u003e, D\u0026amp;D 3.5 edition \u2013 Wizards of the Coast\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eForgotten Realms:\nMysteries of the Moonsea\u003c/strong\u003e, D\u0026amp;D 3.5 edition \u2013 Wizards of the Coast\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eD20 Apocalypse\u003c/strong\u003e,\nD20 Modern \u2013 Wizards of the Coast\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Jackal\u2019s Price\u003c/strong\u003e,\nPathfinder RPG \u2013 Paizo Publishing\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Graveknight\u003c/strong\u003e,\nPathfinder RPG \u2013 Paizo Publishing\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOathbound: Wrack And\nRuin\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Bastion Press\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOathbound: Plains of\nPenance\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Bastion Press\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOathbound: Oathbound\nWildwood\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Bastion Press\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOathbound: Eclipse\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u2013 Epidemic Books\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eInterface Zero\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013\nGun Metal Games\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eInterface Zero 2.0\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u2013 Gun Metal Games\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNuclear Sunset: The\nPacific Northwest\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Vigilance Press\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReign of Discordia\u003c/strong\u003e space opera setting - Gun Metal Games\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNumerous articles for Wizards of the Coast, Mongoose\nPublishing, Paizo Publishing, and others.\u003cbr\u003e"
