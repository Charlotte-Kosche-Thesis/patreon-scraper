    "summary": "\"Ding dong! \u00a0The witch is dead! \u00a0Which old witch? \u00a0The Wicked Witch! Ding Dong! \u00a0The Wicked Witch is dead!\" \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor artists, the old way of doing things is over. \u00a0No more big corporate record labels breathing down their necks. \u00a0No more contractual obligations tying their hands. \u00a0No more money grubbing middle men fleecing them of their just rewards. \u00a0However, along with the positive advantages of this new paradigm come certain challenges. \u00a0It is now down to the artist to raise financial support in order that he or she can survive and continue to create the work. \u00a0Patreon is the way of now and the future. \u00a0It is also a wonderful way for an artists\u0027 loyal supporters to be actively involved in the production of the art. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving used other \u0027crowd sourcing\u0027 platforms such as Kickstarter with a great deal of success, I have now decided to fully embrace this new revolutionary model with a view to making it my main creative hub. \u00a0I love the idea of being able to create some art, a new song recording say, and then make it instantly available. \u00a0To that end I want to set this up as a pay for \u0027Per Work\u0027 rather than the monthly option as I believe that this is the fairest way of going about it and is also a set up that will be best suited to my way of making art. \u00a0Patreon has a MONTHLY CAP, so for example, if you want the security of only EVER paying $5 a month maximum, because you don\u0027t want to think about it, and that\u0027s what your budget can afford, you can cap at $5. \u00a0That way it\u0027s like paying $5 a month, WITH the added advantage that if I do not post anything in a given month, you will be charged NOTHING. \u00a0And if I am really in the zone and being super prolific, you still only pay $5. \u00a0This\u00a0way it\u0027s technically better for you and I won\u0027t feel like I\u0027m taking advantage. \u00a0That\u0027s the last thing I want to do! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of ideas to make the whole process interesting. \u00a0Including \u0027the story behind the song\u0027. \u00a0Either as a written piece or a little film. \u00a0There will be photos and films documenting the work process. \u00a0Videos. \u00a0Also, the occasional live interactive webcast + \u0027fly on the wall\u0027, \u0027watch me make theatre\u0027 etc. webcasts (for $10 \u0026amp; up patrons) and for top tier patrons ( $100 / $1000 ) personalized, one-off surprise rewards such original art work, personal phone calls, postcards, little surrealist gifts etc. \u00a0I will also occasionally perform requested covers via Skype. \u00a0I will also be releasing extensive archive material (studio demos, \u0027bedroom demos\u0027, out-takes, remixes, rehearsal sessions etc.) either as free downloads or as part of limited edition CD\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from these very limited special releases (which will sometimes include new material) which will be given away FREE to patrons, it is unlikely that I will be releasing actual physical CD\u0027s or vinyl any more as I see this platform as being more immediate, affordable and exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s all a big experiment but it feels so right! \u00a0Let\u0027s take a leap together! \u00a0Not a leap in the dark but a leap in the light! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Special thanks to my dear friend, Amanda Palmer for inspiration and template!)\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "David J\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerry Farrell of Jane\u2019s Addiction once described David J (Haskins) as the Avant of the Avant-garde. Never was a truer word spoken . . .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA founder member of one of the most influential bands since The Velvet Underground; namely BAUHAUS. Bauhaus spearheaded the post-punk Alternative music scene of the early \u201880\u2019s with a string of innovative albums and singles, including, for many, perhaps their defining moment, a song that is ranked as a classic and feasibly the pinnacle of the entire Gothic scene and beyond, the nine minute plus epic slab of industrial dub that is \u0027Bela Lugosi\u2019s Dead\u0027, featuring the lyrics of David J. Check out the astonishing opening scenes of Tony Scott\u2019s stylish Vampire flick \u0027The Hunger\u0027 to witness Bauhaus in all their dark glory, performing that very song whilst David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve stalk the disco for new flesh. Appearances on TV shows such as Top Of The Pops, The Old Grey Whistle Test and Riverside coupled with an electrifying live show propelled Bauhaus to the upper reaches of the UK charts before reaching their zenith in the summer of \u201983 and imploding, shattering into fragments of individual talent. It was that implosion that inadvertently gave rise to David\u0027s long and varied solo career. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe was the first of the four members of Bauhaus to actively make that tentative step outside of the comfort zone of his original band by forming an unusual alliance with poet / painter, Rene Halkett, an original member of the very movement from which the band took it\u0027s name, fusing poetry with music for the highly acclaimed \u0027Nothing\u0027 / \u0027Armour\u0027 single which was released on the 4AD label in 1981. A second collaboration in \u201884, with graphic novelist and highly acclaimed author Alan Moore entitled \u0027V For Vendetta\u0027 resulted in a now very highly sought after 12\u201d E.P. A big screen adaptation of Moore\u2019s graphic novel, adopting the same title, was one of the blockbusters of 2005. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDavid\u0027s debut solo album, \u0027Etiquette of Violence\u0027 was released in 1983, followed two years later by \u0027Crocodile Tears and The Velvet Cosh\u0027. Both albums being exemplary of his burgeoning talent as a songwriter. Next came a brief stint producing and playing bass with another underrated songwriting great, Pat Fish AKA The Jazz Butcher. This pairing producing two excellent albums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDavid then regrouped with two of his former Bauhaus band mates, guitarist, Daniel Ash and drummer, Kevin Haskins to form the hugely successful Love And Rockets, whose debut single hit gold status in Canada, followed by a top three US single with \u0027So Alive\u0027 which the band capped with a million selling album and sold out stadium tours. A self-imposed hiatus meant that David could now resume his on / off solo career. The heartfelt and intimate \u0027Songs From Another Season\u0027 and the sophisticated \u0027Urban Urbane\u0027 being the result. The former producing the first single to top the newly forged US Alternative Charts, namely, \u0027I\u0027ll Be You Chauffeur\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSolo endeavors were once again put on hold in \u201998 when Bauhaus was gloriously resurrected, initially three dates were booked at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, such was the demand for tickets however that all three shows were sold out in fifteen minutes! The success of these initial dates ultimately led a full blown world tour. 2003 saw the release of another solo album, the achingly beautiful and poignant, \u0027Estranged\u0027. Then came a second rebirth of Bauhaus which resulted from a spectacular appearance at Palm Springs\u2019 Coachella Festival in2005 where a memorable inverted \u0027hanging man\u0027 stage entrance by vocalist Peter Murphy ensured their performance was not only heralded as the event of the festival but would forever be included as a stand out it\u0027s annals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA highly acclaimed songwriter, often personal, often observational but not without flashes of influence from the dark underside of both theatre and literature \u2013 David has exquisitely captured incisive portraits of artists such as Jack Kerouac, Joe Orton, Antonin Artaud and more recently Elliott Smith, Jeff Buckley, Spalding Grey and Hank Williams. 2011\u2019s \u0027Not Long For This World\u0027 album, featured a set pertaining to the subject of mortality and achieved high critical acclaim. 2014 saw a thirty year anniversary reissue of that solo debut ,\u0027Etiquette Of Violence\u0027 which featured a lavish two disc set. David J\u2019s most recent solo record, \u0027An Eclipse of Ships\u2019 ( which he describes as: \u201c. . . essentially a journal of the heart and a paean to Woman as muse.\u201d ) was also released in 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn between his own works, guest appearances and production duties, David has also written and directed various stage productions including the spectacular multi-media staging of \u0027Silver For Gold\u0027 (The Odyssey Of Edie Sedgwick) which originally went up at the Met Theatre in Hollywood in 2008 and was then re-staged three years later at the celebrated REDCAT also in LA. He has also written several screenplays with writing partner, Don C. Tyler.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis memoir, \u2018Who Killed Mister Moonlight\u2019 (Bauhaus, Black Magick and Benediction) was published by Jawbone Press at the end of 2014 to critical acclaim.  It is now in it\u2019s second printing.\u003cbr\u003e",
