Or some lazy dude who makes \"eh\" animations. Basically, this guy: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Deremixproductions\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/Deremixproductions\u003c/a\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eI make animated films using Source Filmmaker. That\u0027s \u0027bout it. Thinking maybe some 2d flash animations but idk. We\u0027ll see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eAnyway, my real name is Derek. I\u0027m a 23 year old, married, nerdy loser who aspires to make animation his full-time job. Instead of shitty customer service and retail jobs, since that\u0027s pretty much all that\u0027s around me where I live. Well, that and trees and... leaves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is pretty much my only option if I wanna make a living out of this and not move away from every bit of my wife and I\u0027s family and friends. Cause I\u0027m a big family baby, I guess. Anyway, I made this thingamajig to try and make a little bit of money from these videos I love making and maybe eventually make a career out of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCause God knows I get jack-shit from ad revenue, especially with demonetization. More so now than ever, since YouTube disabled ad revenue for my channel because I didn\u0027t meet their \"quota\". Whatever money I get from this will be used to improve my set up and probably pay bills. So yeah, if I get even just a dollar for making shit I love to make, I\u0027ll probably cry tbh. It\u0027s muh dream, son.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eluv u bbs,\u003cbr\u003eDerek\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ve been doing it ever since I was about 10 years old. I started out with crappy little stick figure animations and moved up. It\u0027s something I\u0027ve always intended to make into a career, it\u0027s just that living where I live, it\u0027s extremely hard to even find one within a 100 mile radius. So, this is probably my best shot unless I want to move away from all of my family and friends.\u003cbr\u003e",
