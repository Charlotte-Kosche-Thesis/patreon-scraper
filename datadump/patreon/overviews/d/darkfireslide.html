If you\u0027re here, you\u0027re probably from my youtube channel, and might know me from videos such as my Top Tens for Europa Universalis IV, or some of my other EU4 content. I created this page because I am serious about making Youtube my career, and with funding from you, the viewer, we can make this dream come true. It\u0027s not just about me--it\u0027s about all of us enjoying this amazing game together, among others, whenever a game finally surpasses EU4. With your support, I can pay the bills, get better equipment, and finally upgrade my internet to the point where I can expand the channel and start streaming on Twitch as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn empire cannot stand without the support of its people. Are you with me?\u00a0"
