    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what is Darkside Magazine?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCheck out the mag here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.darksidemag.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edarksidemag.net\u003c/a\u003e WARNING - OVER 18s ONLY!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDarkside Magazine is a new online magazine aimed at BDSM/fetish lovers the world over. Published six times a year, each issue is rammed with hot photos, sexy stories, lifestyle advice and so much more. Our aim is to create an all-inclusive, fresh, sexy and above all helpful publication about all manner of topics in relation to the fetish lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, who am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHey all, thanks for stopping by and looking at my Patreon page! My name is Paul Donnelly, a graphic designer and film maker by trade. I\u0027ve given myself the grand title of Editor of Darkside Magazine (but you could say I am also the designer, distributor, marketing manager and general dog\u0027s body...I even have to make my own cups of coffee! Sad but true!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did I get to create Darkside Magazine?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it all happened quite by chance really. Several years ago I was made redundant from the advertising agency I was working for. Having tried and failed to get into anywhere else, a friend of mine said she wished there was a fetish mag that was more than just a bunch of photos with the occasional interview (yes, we chat about all manner of things quite openly).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis got me thinking, and I took a look at the array of mags out there aimed at the fetish market. I wasn\u0027t impressed. I think a mag of this type should include real-world issues and helpful advice, as well as all the other stuff that people expect. I had also noticed how other mags just focused on single aspects of fetish, rather than being all-inclusive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why not start my own magazine, I thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd so, Darkside Magazine was born...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began piecing together the first issue, thinking carefully about design and content. It was going to have to be an online digital mag, but that\u0027s great since it means it could go worldwide and become a fully multimedia production, including video etc in time. I\u0027m a member of a well-known fetish website and started to put the word out that I was starting this new publication. I was going to need FREE photography and text, so wasn\u0027t sure how this would be received.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was overwhelmed with the response!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI received TONS of messages from photographers, writers and models (both pro and amateur) who were excited about my new venture and more than happy to help, even on a free basis. In return, I would give them heavy exposure in the magazine and on social media - a method which is still working to this day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere are we now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on issue six of Darkside Magazine, and the response to each issue has always been fantastic. I won\u0027t lie...there are times when I have thought is it really worth the effort? After all, it makes no money (at least, not enough to live on, so I currently still have to do other part-time jobs). But the praise I receive from the fetish community keeps me going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have a subscription service for the magazine, but it has been VERY hard to get this off the ground, and does not allow any well-deserved payments for the talented team of photographers and writers who currently help out on a freelance basis. It would be AMAZING to pay them! Plus, it would be fantastic if I could ditch those crummy part-time jobs and focus on this magazine, which I believe has great potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this. I realise that this subject isn\u0027t for everybody, but if it\u0027s your thing and if you can help, then I would be very appreciative of your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKind regards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaul\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/GMvjsYISAi\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
