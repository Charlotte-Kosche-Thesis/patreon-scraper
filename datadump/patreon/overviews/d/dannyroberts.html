Ever since I was a little kid I always wanted to be an explorer, so I decided to create my own world, 100% to the scale of the Earth. I want to spend the rest of my life building and exploring that world while telling the stories of those that live there, and making art based on those stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/241543740?color=8c7c3d\u0026amp;title=0\u0026amp;byline=0\u0026amp;portrait=0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFiction Book\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy brother and I have already written our first novel based in this new world, and are working on editing the 3rd draft of it!
