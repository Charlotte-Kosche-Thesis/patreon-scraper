    "summary": "Hi there! \u00a0I\u0027m Seri and I love making useful sites/apps for WoW players! I\u0027m looking for folks that find my work valuable to become patrons to fund development and server costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an avid user of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://simulationcraft.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSimulationCraft\u003c/a\u003e and have built\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://raidbots.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRaidbots\u003c/a\u003e to make using it as easy as possible - no downloads, no repetitive item lookups on wowhead, and no mucking with fiddly scripts. \u00a0Beyond the UI, Raidbots runs simulations on powerful hardware, generally more powerful than your own gaming PC, which both limits performance issues on your own machine as well as making the results available faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Raidbots?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRaidbots attempts to make using SimulationCraft as easy and fast as possible for folks both new to SimulationCraft as well as seasoned veterans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany common tasks are handled: generate stat weights for your character, compare gear, compare relics, and compare talents. I plan on adding more features over time to continue making complex simulations easy to run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a patron, there\u0027s a bunch of stuff you can look forward to. Get higher priority in the queue so you can hop ahead in the line, talk to me directly on Discord to suggest possible features, use the site without ads, increase simulation time limits, or just pledge some money to help keep the servers running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning the site is pretty expensive. Patreon lets folks who find the site useful fund it directly to make sure I can keep running the site into the future. Direct funding is way more sustainable than just about anything else. I still run ads for non-patrons to help cover additional costs but make sure to provide an ad-free experience for those that support me directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf pledges continue to grow, I\u0027ll be able to invest more into the site - faster/more servers, better tooling, and a better guarantee of reliability and sustainability. One of the cool thing about SimC is that it scales really well with more power. An 8 CPU machine can crunch stat weights in about a minute, 16 CPUs will do it in 30 seconds, 32 CPUs will only take roughly 15 seconds. In addition, the more servers I can run minimizes queue times so folks get their sims run quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs more powerful machines become available, it\u0027s may become possible to do even more computationally intensive operations like the previously mentioned \"best in bags\" or \"personal best-in-slot list\" features. \u00a0Other possibilities include running reports for an entire raid team / guild or spinning up powerful servers just for your simulations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s SimulationCraft?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimulationCraft is an open source program which rapidly simulates \"virtual\" WoW combat.  It generates a comprehensive report of damage done, damage taken, ability breakdowns, and more.  A lot of theorycrafters use it extensively to determine general stat weights (which stats are best for your character), talent recommendations, best-in-slot lists, and more.  However, to really min/max your own character, you often need to use it yourself because of the complexity of gear and item iterations.  \"Sim yourself\" has become a common refrain in a lot of class Discords for questions about these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimulationCraft has a pretty active community of developers who are doing the dirty work of building the models and simulations so we can benefit.\u003cbr\u003e"
