Are you tired of seeing video after video after video on some new style of AR15 rail system or Glock grip plug? If that has gotten old and boring, then InRange might be the show for you. InRange TV will introduce you to gear that is different and interesting, and will tell you if it\u0027s actually worth a hoot or not. We will do real testing on real products. We will dispel the myths, promote the good stuff that hasn\u0027t gotten the attention it deserves, and tell you when the latest thing on glossy magazine covers is actually crap. Does that sound better than yet another review of a Century AK?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you, anyway?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarl\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a lifelong shooter who has excelled in a wide variety of shooting disciplines. His credentials include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e10 years of NRA High Power and related rifle matches (including multiple trips to Camp Perry and 28 accumulated leg points)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3 years second-place in Arizona Cowboy Action shooting (Frontier Cartridge Duelist)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e10 years organizing and running the Tucson\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twogunaction.squarespace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e2-Gun Action Challenge Match\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eToo many tactical training class certifications to list\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIn addition, Karl has a deep interest in historical firearms use, and merges this with practical shooting to understand firsthand just what it was like to use various firearms during their heydays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIan\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a hopeless gun nerd best known for his work editing and curating the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ForgottenWeapons.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eForgotten Weapons\u003c/a\u003e web site and video channels. If you have heard of a gun, chances are pretty good that he knows how it works and can tell you anything you want to know about it. Ian\u0027s shooting foundation is in smallbore bullseye pistol, but what he enjoys most is running obscure and long-obsolete firearms in practical competition settings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow is InRange TV Better?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInRange is better because of both what it does have and what it doesn\u0027t have. For example, we do NOT have:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBS product shilling - if we say it\u0027s good, it\u0027s because we genuinely think so, and not because they paid us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDumb exploding targets - we have all seen binary explosives inside watermelons or whatever, and we\u0027re tired of it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eZombies - although it seems like the zombie craze is pretty much over now, thank goodness.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDrama - cable TV gun programs all seem to thrive on obnoxious fake drama that we hate.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what DO we have to take up the void?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHonest, non-nonsense reviews. No strings and no artificial loyalties.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDeep knowledge of our subject matter. If some new product is actually a rehash of something from the a hundred years ago, we will notice.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA willingness to butcher sacred cows. So many myths have been perpetuated by the gun media over the decades, and we revel in the opportunity to break them wide open.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is InRange Worth Supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eIn order to run this program right, we need to maintain our freedom from gun industry financing. We can\u0027t be dependent on corporate sponsorship or maintaining corporate goodwill to ensure a supply of demo guns. Instead, we have to be able to buy things ourselves to properly and honestly wring them out - and that takes money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been running InRange TV for a year now, and experimented with a couple different financing methods, all of which have turned out a bit lackluster. We tried a paywall, and we tried online video advertising. We hope that a micropayment model like Patreon will prove to be the secret ingredient that allows the program to flourish. And if it does, we will feed the benefits right back to you, our supporters!"
