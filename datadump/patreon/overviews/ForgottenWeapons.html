    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWhat Is The Project?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little over 6 and a half years ago, I registered the web site\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ForgottenWeapons.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eForgottenWeapons.com\u003c/a\u003e and created my first online repository of firearms information. It was a pretty small site at that time, with mostly archival photos from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 5 years ago, I took the next step and relaunched the site as a regularly-updated blog. This then became a more significant endeavor, posting new content 6 days/week. From the beginning, the focus has been on rare and unusual firearms, the more mechanically diverse the better. I have touched on common guns as well intermittently, as it is essential to have an understanding of the common guns in order to understand the development that went into them and their offshoots.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe content I maintain includes a wide spectrum of media: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWritten articles\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDetailed photographs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOriginal manuals\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTrials reports and other primary-source documents\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo showing disassembly and function\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo showing practical competition use\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy private goal from the very beginning of this project has been to create a comprehensive encyclopedia of firearms development. That is such a Quixotic goal that I don\u0027t generally mention it, but the project has grown so far beyond any of my expectations in the past years that my impossible goal looks a bit less impossible these days. It is still a lifetime\u0027s work at least, but I can\u0027t imagine anything I would rather be doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDollars, Clams, Onions, Bucks, Dubloons, and Greenbacks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, it takes money to do. From basic things like paying for food and rent and insurance to supplying obscure ammunition for shooting to the much more significant costs of traveling to the museums and private collections where the rare and unique guns are housed. Thus far, I have funded my work with video advertisements on YouTube and Full30, and with the help of a couple sponsoring companies. However, my work is distinct from the vast majority of firearms media in that I rarely look at guns which are actually in production - and that really limits the possibility of finding corporate sponsors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, that limitation is also a blessing in disguise as it prevents me from coming under the editorial control of any corporate overlord. On those occasions when I do discuss modern guns, I can say the truth as I see it without looking over my shoulder and worrying about the consequences of not properly buttering up any company. I cherish that independence, and I will not give it up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is the best way to fund an endeavor like Forgotten Weapons in today\u0027s world? Advertising has been the standard answer for a long time, largely because of simple carryover from places like television and print media. The Internet changes things, however. The Internet allows us to find any information we like without the overhead of printing presses or a finite number of cable channels. The potential audience for any information is unlimited, and that offers the prospect of sustainable micropayments. Having our daily lives flooded with advertisements is not a good thing, it\u0027s just the system we are most acclimated to. I think that a tiny amount of support from a huge number of people is a far better system, and Patreon looks like a way to achieve that model.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Proposal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very first HTML web site, I have had a policy that there will never be a paywall in front of Forgotten Weapons. First and foremost, my goal is to create a public archive of this information, and a paywall is anathema to that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy what I am creating and curating at Forgotten Weapons, this is a way you can contribute a buck a month to ensure that it keeps happening. If you want to contribute more that\u0027s wonderful - but a buck a month is all I am asking for. If there are enough people who find value in the work, that will be plenty sufficient to keep it alive and vibrant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost Patreon creators offer a handful of different perks to entice people to donate more, and these usually entail special and exclusive content. I am not doing that, for two main reasons. First, I don\u0027t want to make special content accessible only to people who have paid - that goes against the \"free and public\" foundation of the endeavor. Second, I want to focus my time on the guns and history which are the whole point of Forgotten Weapons, rather than devote time to what are basically marketing gimmicks. You came here (presumably) because you like what I am doing already, so more (and better!) of that is what I am offering you. The perks that I have are about access to my time directly, while the entirety of the content I produce will remain freely and fully accessible to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e"

The video will be public, but questions will come only from Patreon supporters. Got a question about firearms development or history? I\u0027ll find the answer for you.",

I have also increased my video production to one almost every day. This has added a lot to my workload, and to make sure it remains feasible into the future, I would like to hire a second person to help with administrative matters. Hiring someone is a big leap for me, as it is a major expense that I will need to be able to maintain for the long term. This level of support will make that possible!",
