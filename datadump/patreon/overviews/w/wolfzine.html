    "summary": "My name is Valerie Rose and I am a muralist and an illustrator. I was raised in California by deaf parents and American Sign Language (ASL)\u00a0 is my native language. I am also deaf in my right ear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving here in Colorado, I have noticed a hot button topic in the news: the Gray Wolf. In college, I wrote a couple essays about the Gray Wolf reintroduction to Yellowstone. They want to do the same thing here in Colorado! This is a controversial topic due to a huge amount of misinformation, myths, and stigma against the Gray Wolf. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is because of this stigma that I decided to make my Wolf Zine.\u003cstrong\u003e The Wolf Zine is an education-through-arts quarterly digest that will dispel myths and spread awareness about the Gray Wolf (and the reintroduction project)\u003c/strong\u003e. The information provided is based on scientific data and the art is handmade, and words are even handwritten. This is a traditional zine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe costs of the zine are minimal but they exist. I am hoping that my Patreon page will generate enough funds to cover the costs of printing and supplying the zine every 3 months (on a quarterly basis). Any extra funding will go towards wolf murals and paying additional artists/writers to contribute their own work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy very first issue is 100% sponsored by a donation, which means 100% of my funding for this creation will go towards The Rocky Mountain Wolf Project. If you subscribe to my page before the end of April, your contribution will be doubled by a generous donor. So that means your $5 initial payment is $10 donated to The Rocky Mountain Wolf Project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time. You are amazing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently moved to Carbondale, Colorado, where I am making my art whenever I can, working at a cafe, and also teaching ASL to students. It was only two years ago, in 2016, when I decided to uproot my life in LA and go to Nicaragua. I started immersing myself into my art and eventually ended up painting murals. I would never have imagined this for myself, and I am so grateful for the opportunities and support from those around me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2018 comes along and I decided to take a step back and slow down my process. I was extremely productive, but was I 100% passionate with my work? I found myself always saying yes because I needed the work, and I forgot the point of my journey. If my heart is not in my art, then what is the point of choosing such a stressful lifestyle. The most rewarding part of being an artist is that you live outside a box and in the endless world of creation. \u003cstrong\u003eThey say the most dangerous thing a person can do is to belong to yourself. I want to belong to myself and have complete creative freedom. That is why I chose Patreon.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
