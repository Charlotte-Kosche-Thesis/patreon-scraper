After much debate I\u0027ve decided to put this together if anyone out there is feeling so charitable. However charity will be rewarded with many things, among them being a lot more direct control of what I do, as well as being able to help shape the future of what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who do sponsor me here, even if for a tiny amount: Thank you deeply from the bottom of my inkwell heart.\u003cbr\u003e"
