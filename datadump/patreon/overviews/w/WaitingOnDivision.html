    "summary": "\u0027Waiting On Division\u0027 is an evolving documentary project revolving around a street named Division in downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan, nestled in the Heartside District.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDivision Street is a street known for its abundant resources available to Grand Rapids\u0027 most vulnerable populations. In addition, Heartside offers many affordable apartment units for people who may have been without a home, or may simply just not have the means to provide for themselves due to past incidents, mental illness, or substance abuse problems. Some of the neighbors have lived in the area for 30+ years, and have a comprehensive first-hand knowledge of the changes and growth the city has experienced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWaiting On Division started as an idea, just going out on foot to meet those in the neighborhood. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I began in March of 2016, I have made many friends. I have met and filmed with veterans who have been on the street for 20+ years, youth who have been homeless for as long as 9 years, and have listened to unimaginable stories of pain and trauma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that through this documentary, I can explore trauma, substance abuse, and the many myriad of reasons why people have found themselves here, in an area of Grand Rapids that often times feels as though it is a different city entirely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can continue this journey chronicling the stories, trials, and tribulations that our neighbors have experienced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have been fortunate enough to meet Christa McKenna, a contortionist who rose to fame during the 70\u0027s for her appearances on The Gong Show, the $1.98 Beauty Pageant; who ended up in Playboy Magazine, the Marilyn Monroe issue, and also as a homeless alcoholic on the streets of Division. She hopes that I can spend multiple days a week with her, helping her tell her family\u0027s story (which I cannot even begin to put into words here). First, we are conducting interviews so that I can learn her story, and then she hopes we can turn it into book format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, my own home has become a drop-in center of sorts, for friends that I have made that may have nowhere to go during certain times of the day. Small things like this have caused an increase in utilities, household items needing to be replaced at an increased rate, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven so much as a couple dollars per month will help me continue to do what I am doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFilming, listening, driving people for job interviews, taking people across state to open beds at rehabilitation centers, and anything else that comes my way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support this journey, you will have an inside-look at the behind-the-scenes portions of the project, glimpses here and there as I work to understand the interconnectedness of individual\u0027s stories and how they relate to our current society as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho knows, if enough Patrons jump on board, I may even be able rent a home with a handful of the friends I have made, a safe-house of sorts where those in transition can have a comfortable environment to go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
