    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for considering becoming a patron. This world is a little bit brighter because people like you are in it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started editing fiction and helping friends navigate the technical aspects of self-publishing\u00a0more than eight years ago. Working with fellow creatives - fellow writers - and having the opportunity to see their dreams come to life has been one of the most rewarding careers I could ever have chosen. I\u0027ve had the opportunity to work on a bestselling anthology, edit two authors who have gone on to become USA Today Bestsellers, as well support local writers through annual editing workshops.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s 2018, and I want to expand. I recently started offering freelance edits beyond those who I have met in real life (\u003ca href=\"http://writingonpoint.com/editing-services/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyou can submit your first chapter for free\u003c/a\u003e). My writing workshops have been successful for the last five years. Sharing my knowledge of story craft has been happening on my blog at Writing on Point for more than two years. Plus I am the founding editor at Crimson Melodies Publishing, a small independent press dedicated to speculative fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are things I haven\u0027t been able to get to - like hosting a higher number of workshops and publishing anthologies more regularly - that would become realistically achievable with just a little extra income every month. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoining me on Patreon gets you one step closer to being inside my head. (My characters are all waving because I told them to play nice.) You will get an in-depth\u00a0look at all my experiences, plus some of the higher tiers get you automatic access to my editing services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSelf-publishing is ever evolving. Some days things are going great, running smoothly, and other days the wheels are coming off the bus. Book descriptions are a challenge, marketing even more so, and I don\u0027t have the best answers when someone asks, \"how do I find my audience?\" What I do have is the ability to bring out the heart of a story, to make sure readers will always remember the protagonist\u0027s name, and to be a guide through the quagmire of muddling middles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a supportive community can be the difference between good days and great ones, bad days and terrible ones. I want Writing on Point to expand into a true community, where writers can work together, collaborate, and share their processes. It\u0027s being built, right here right now, and becoming a patron means you\u0027ll be an integral part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, there are some pretty nifty rewards to consider.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 1 aka Active Dreamers \u003c/strong\u003e- Patron only posts and discounts on future editing service purchases.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 2 aka Feral Writers\u003c/strong\u003e - Downloadable content crafted for my writing workshops.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 3 aka Story Weavers\u003c/strong\u003e - Monthly chats with fellow writers and access to video\u00a0posts from yours truly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 4 aka World Shapers\u003c/strong\u003e - Participate in a monthly critique session with fellow patrons.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 5 aka Universe Builders\u003c/strong\u003e - Every 3 months, I will critique one of your stories (as long as it\u0027s less than 80k words).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier 6 aka Destiny Forgers\u003c/strong\u003e - Every month is one story critique (still less than 80k) plus a one-on-one chat to discuss the feedback.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what level you support, you\u0027ll have my eternal gratitude because it will mean I\u0027m one step closer to doing more of the things I love.
