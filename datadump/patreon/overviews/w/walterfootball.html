Charlie Campbell provides the best draft coverage on the Web. Dennis, my developer, did a great job of re-designing the site and wants to install some new features. Chet Gresham is routinely ranked atop fantasy expert rankings. Pat Yasinskas, formerly of ESPN, has so much experience writing great content. We also have some helpful part-time workers as well. Again, ad blockers are making things more difficult, so any sort of contribution would help immensely!",
