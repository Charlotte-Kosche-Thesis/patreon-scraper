    "summary": "What is Working Theory Productions?\u003cbr\u003eWorking Theory Productions is a group of gamers and geeks of various persuasions who get together every week to play tabletop games and debate geeky stuff. During one of our member\u0027s wedding we realized that the discussions that we were having at the reception could make for interesting listening material as a Podcast, not just because we\u0027re full of ourselves, but because we\u0027d actually like to listen to a Podcast that sounded like our conversations. There, around a table with nibbles booze and geeks, a plan was hatched. This is the result of that plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do we make?\u003cbr\u003eWe have, depending on how you count it either 2 or 6 shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Our main show is called Geek Fanthology where we engage in an non-moderated round-table discussion that begins on some opening topic and ends.... wherever it ends. Think of it like a Geek stream of consciousness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur other 1-4 shows is recordings of our weekly gaming sessions. The reason it\u0027s 1-4 is because we have 3 ongoing campaigns that we rotate:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Eroth Chronicles: \u003c/em\u003eA D\u0026amp;D 5th Edition game (formerly Pathfinder) run by Ben Reeder. In the homebrewed world of Eroth. The Undying Emperor\u0027s forces are stirring after laying mostly silent for 1000 years. Three heroes drawn from another world are somehow fulcrums of events occurring and their actions may very well change the fate of the whole world\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCandles in the Wind: \u003c/em\u003eSet in Chronicles of Darkness (New World of Darkness) A group of Hunters calling themselves The Protectorate set out to try and actually create a peace between the supernatural forces at work in Chicago. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eStar Wars: Edge of the Empire: \u003c/em\u003eJust after the destruction of Imperial Station DS-1 and completely separate from any sort of intrigue going on with the Empire, the Rebellion or anything along those lines; A ragtag group of bounty hunters are just trying to make ends meet while getting out of debt to a Hutt. They can\u0027t take the Sky from us.\u003cbr\u003eOccasionally we do one off games as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is Working Theory Productions? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeil Cordray: Writer, gamer, geek, occasional voice actor.
