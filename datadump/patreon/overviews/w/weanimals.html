    "summary": "Hi and welcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m Jo-Anne McArthur and I\u0027m the photojournalist behind the \u003ca href=\"http://weanimals.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWe Animals\u003c/a\u003e project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project started almost two decades ago when I happened to witness a chained monkey performing tricks for tourists. While people took photos because they thought it was funny and cute, I took photos because I thought it was wrong, and I wanted the world to know. It crystalized for me then, that I saw the world differently than most, and that my views on animal use and abuse needed to be shared. I could use my photography skills to tell the stories of the animals we share our world with--stories that were so rarely being told. Now, dozens of countries and hundreds of investigations later, the \u003ca href=\"http://weanimals.org/photographs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWe Animals archive\u003c/a\u003e exposes both the beauty and the brutality of other animals in our human environment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always allowed my images to be used free of charge because, above all, I want the stories of animals to be told. My photos have been used by brilliant advocates from all over the world and by organizations big and small. My work \u003ca href=\"http://weanimals.org/links\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehas been featured in\u003c/a\u003e exhibits, magazines, newspapers, books, blogs, videos, and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.theghostsinourmachine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eaward-winning documentary\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eThe Ghosts in Our Machine\u003c/em\u003e. In 2014 I released my own \u003ca href=\"http://weanimals.org/book\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebook\u003c/a\u003e, which Jane Goodall \u003ca href=\"http://weanimals.org/pub/WA_Endorsements.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecomplimented\u003c/a\u003e (I think?) as \"powerfully disturbing.\" My forthcoming book, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.unboundproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUnbound\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, which I\u0027m thrilled to be working on with my co-author Professor Keri Cronin, is a global look at women on the front lines of animal advocacy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want my images to continue to be used freely and as far and wide as possible, which is why I\u0027m asking for your help. With a stable funding base, not only can I stop taking commercial gigs to finance We Animals, but I can people to help get my images before an even wider audience (I\u0027m so busy taking photos, editing, writing and planning that I barely find the time to actually share these stories!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is a stable funding base of $10,000 per month. With this, I can:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay for investigations and other animal-related travel, including planes, trains and automobiles (I\u0027m on the road AT LEAST six months a year), accommodations, food, photography and filming equipment, repairs, hard drives, insurance, and so forth.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eManage and keep adding to \u003ca href=\"http://weanimalsarchive.org/\"\u003eweanimalsarchive.org\u003c/a\u003e, a free resource of thousands of high-resolution images of animals that have already been used in hundreds of campaigns around the world.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTake on longer term projects that allow me and the We Animals team to shine a spotlight on individual industries with books and social media projects. In 2017, I\u0027m releasing my second book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Captive-Jo-Anne-McArthur/dp/1590565622/\"\u003eCaptive\u003c/a\u003e, and running a companion social media project, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/captivebook/photos/?tab=album\u0026amp;album_id=202985230163470\"\u003eA Year of Captivity\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire people to help me with web development, social media, shooting, videography, project management, organizational growth, newsletters and other communications; and scheduling the \u003ca href=\"http://www.humaneeducation.ca/\"\u003eWe Animals Humane Education Programs\u003c/a\u003e and a growing number of speaking events.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading, thank you for your support thus far, and thank you for becoming a patron of We Animals!
