    "summary": "My podcast and stories were born out of my own life \nexperiences: inner city poverty, race relations, military, family, \ntravel, and adventure.\u00a0 I started telling stories on stage in June of 2014. This podcast was launched in April 2016 and is quickly catching on! In just 3 months, we hit our first milestone of over 1,000 downloads per episode.\u00a0 There is no big production staff- just me, an office/storage room of my house, with a microphone and a computer, all from the mountains of rural NC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy family has been extremely supportive of this endeavor, allowing me to divert entertainment/vacation budget money to start and support this podcast. Now I\u0027m asking YOU to thank THEM by becoming a monthly supporter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly contribution would help with things like all the fees associated with a podcast presence and expansion to include a traditional website. It would also allow me to travel to share my stories and the art of storytelling with groups that would otherwise not get a chance to experience it because of limited budgets or difficult life circumstances.\u00a0 Finally, it would enable me to begin to save in order to get mobile recording equipment so I can include some \"in the field\" commentary in some of the episodes as well as eventually purchase a computer dedicated to the podcast (right now, we share a family computer). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening and considering supporting this podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
