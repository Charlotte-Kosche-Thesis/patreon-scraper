After a lot of thought along with advice and prodding from friends and family, I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had a pretty crazy life thus far and I never would have imagined taking my most beloved hobby to the level that it is now. My YouTube and Twitch following has been steadily increasing in the last few months and hasn\u0027t really shown any signs of slowing down. A huge part of this is thanks to my good friend Jester814. Most of you probably found me via Jester and I thank you ALL for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never looked at gaming as a potential job or source of employment and I don\u0027t think I ever will since it\u0027s something I love so much. We\u0027ve all heard the phrase \"Do something you love for a living and it will never feel like work\", that\u0027s what streaming and gaming in general is for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hopefully you\u0027ll decide to join my Patreon family and accompany me in this incredible journey to full time gaming!"
