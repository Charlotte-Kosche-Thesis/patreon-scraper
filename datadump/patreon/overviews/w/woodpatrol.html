    "summary": "Wood patrol started as expanding on an unearthed idea in November of  2015. By the time March of \u002716 rolled around Timothy Phares and Ryan Baker had built a small team to work on illustration ideas, while  the script for the pilot episode was in the works. In August of 16\u0027 Modified Reality LLC was born, our production company began with the purpose of keeping our project safe; legally. Today, we have a  solid team of 13 talented individuals working on bringing Wood Patrol to life.  We crushed our recent goal,  airing on Adult Swim\u0027s Development Meeting, and getting a chance to pitch our Wood Patrol baby. It went so well, that they asked to see more, after telling us we \"set the bar\" for future pitches. \u003cstrong\u003eYou can watch the full pitch to learn more about the plot of Wood Patrol in the video above.\u003c/strong\u003e Now it\u0027s crunch time. We have until January 5th to produce two more 1 minute animatics from later in the season by request of Walt and Cam, the hosts of the Development Meeting, along with the rest of the 22min \u0026amp; 30 second Pilot episode animatic. All in all, this will cost one thousand dollars, most of which will be going to our extremely talented Art Director, Dominic Duca, who has been working tirelessly everyday to make this dream a reality with his epic illustrations.  Finishing this will give us the opportunity to pitch the Pilot in it\u0027s entirety, and prepare us to begin work on the animation itself, which can run anywhere from $15/second-$30/second. Thank you for your inquiry and your support.\u003cbr\u003e  -The Wood Patrol Team\u003cbr\u003eAnimatic- a preliminary version of a movie or cartoon, produced by shooting successive sections of a storyboard and adding a soundtrack."
