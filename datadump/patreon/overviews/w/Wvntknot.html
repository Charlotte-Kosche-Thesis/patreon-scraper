There I participated in a beginners seminar to shibari and from there my interest grew. Not only did my interest grow but my excitement to share everything exploded out of me. I was begging friends to let me tie them up and trying to push my creativity. To my luck, my friends were so supportive and really helped build a fire in me to peruse this as a career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow originally I grew up in Michigan but recently moved to Georgia!! Yeah that\u2019s right, THE DIRTY SOUTH!!! Woot woot lol Since I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve found it hard to gather models but I have made it my goal to push my rope play and really show you what I\u2019ve got. Until I grow my rope army, I will be the model. Eventually I\u2019d love to be behind the camera with a couple glimpses of me in the mix but in good time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT IS SHIBARI?!?!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve never heard of shibari, it flat out means \"to bind with rope\" in Japanese. It\u2019s a Japanese art form that is continued to be used today. Most people might think it\u2019s use is only in the bedroom but I\u2019ve always thought of it being an art form. It\u2019s so aesthetically pleasing to the eye. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon gives me the support and artistic outlet I need to express myself through rope. My life goal is to make a living off using that ability, whether it\u2019s tying people up for events, sexual dominating settings or creating aesthetic art. With this tool I\u2019ve found myself more comfortable in front of the camera and want to interact with my community of support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT I HAVE TO OFFER!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, I offer myself completely to you. I want to connect with those who show interest in this art form and I\u2019m dying to answer any questions or just interact. I\u2019m putting myself out on the table so don\u2019t ever feel afraid to talk with me. Not only am I showing nude shibari art through photography, but I offer video content to show it all in motion as well. That being said tutorials are one of my favorite things to do so if you have a request for anything feel free to let me know. Ive also put an option for private Snapchat to get to know me on a more personal level. Otherwise while I grow and build on patreon I\u2019ll have more to offer. I\u2019m looking to revamp for next year so hold on to your butts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI APPRECIATE YOU ALL\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI welcome you with open arms. I\u0027m so excited to raise my freak flag high and take a full out dive into this beautiful art. With the help of your donations, I\u0027ll be able to support my needs for supplies and also for photographers and models to show you what I\u0027ve been creating. Besides shoots, I\u0027m looking to expand my knowledge through conventions, books, and really all I can get my hands on. Anyways I\u0027m thinking of making a special shibari video but for now here are some old vines that I\u0027m known for. Enjoy!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
