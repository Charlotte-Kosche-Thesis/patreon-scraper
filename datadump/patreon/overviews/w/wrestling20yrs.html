    "summary": "So... you\u0027ve probably got some questions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho/What is the Wrestling 20 Years Ago Podcast? \u003c/strong\u003eSetup in August 2013, the Wrestling 20 Years Ago podcast sees Bob Bamber and an ever increasing group of brave souls trapse through the world of wrestling and MMA from 20 years ago. Now releasing on average nearly four shows a month running to seven hours plus, we\u0027ve released over 80 shows and 150 hours of podcasts covering the WWF, WCW, ECW and the UFC. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Are You On Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003eSimply to cover my slowly expanding list of expenses that the show involves. If I exceed that, then that\u0027s awesome too. I\u0027m not going to be a podcaster that says \"without adverts/donations our show cannot run\". Running a podcast is not prohibitively expensive - we\u0027ll never run ads. But I have been doing this for a few years, and if I can cover my costs (approx \u00a3150/$200 a year) then that\u0027d be excellent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is \"Early Access\" To Shows, Does This Effect The Release Cycle Of The Podcasts? \u003c/strong\u003eDue to the volume of shows we produce, and our once a month release schedule, podcasts are being recorded right across any given month ahead of the batch release. We release shows at the end of each month once the final show we record is edited together. For our Patreons, all we\u0027d be doing is making the shows already edited available once they\u0027re ready. The \"ordinary\" release cycle is unaffected. Note: this isn\u0027t *always* possible, sometimes I\u0027m just editing shows off the reel at the end of the month and shows are only ready a short time before launch. It will be offered for episodes where it\u0027s available. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Other Plans Do You Have For Extra Content? \u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s still being worked on and, to an extent, is dependent on how successful the Patreon is. But all being well we\u0027re looking at bonus shows of some shape or form, along with possibly giving Patreons access to the shows live, as they\u0027re being recorded (if you want to hear the errors and in show edits!). We also might have a run at Mean Gene\u0027s Hotline business!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI Would Like To Appear On The Show - Is This A Way Of Doing That? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve had people ask that, I think it sets a dangerous trend that I\u0027m not particularly keen to explore. Besides, everyone who\u0027s appeared on the show has done so for free, so it doesn\u0027t seem right to \"paywall\" that right. That being said, we are always looking for guests, demand can ebb and flow but it can\u0027t hurt to message me if you\u0027d like to be considered - but being a Patreon won\u0027t impact on that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said... one idea I had for the bonus content was that if you had a show out of timeline that you\u0027d like us to cover (anything pre-August 1993 and after say 2005), then that could form part of the bonus content that we offer to Patreons is you could request a show then come on the recording and help us review it. I\u0027ll explore that down the road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve Already Appeared On The Show, Do I Need To Donate?\u003c/strong\u003e.... Yes :D. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m kidding... depends how keen you are on appearing again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAm I Missing Out On Anything If I Don\u0027t Donate? \u003c/strong\u003eWell, if we reach our \"McGregor Money\" goal then you\u0027re going to be missing out on me, Rory and Del (sorry gents!) going back and reviewing probably the most boring pay per view of all time. But other than that, no. This isn\u0027t being setup as a firewall that will make the existing output any less than what it is now. Any Patreon exclusive stuff will largely be irrelevant (see hotlines or pre August 1993 stuff).\u003cbr\u003e"
