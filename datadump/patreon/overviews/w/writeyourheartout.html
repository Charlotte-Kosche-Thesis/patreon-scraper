It\u0027s always hard to find that balance between too much and not enough, the right start to a piece. It\u0027s like first impressions, it\u0027s hard to override.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Keira. Or Katrina, or Dora, or Blue, or basically anything you want it to be (not Pretty Woman style, I just like names. Apart from my own.). I call myself a writer, and I think I can back it up - eleven years of experience, two national awards, and a bachelor\u0027s degree should validate me as one. I\u0027ve finally finished uni and now I\u0027m starting an AdultLife\u00ae (that\u0027s a joke, I hope everyone gets that it\u0027s a joke, please don\u0027t sue me). I moved to London to persuade a career in acting and writing, and I will need help in this. I am trying to get as many odd jobs as I can to pay my bills and have enough time to focus on my own creations. I write screenplays, plays, an odd novel if I feel like I can\u0027t go without a few months of descriptions, and copious amounts of fanfiction, which I really shouldn\u0027t since I need to earn money, but I find writing for passion alone a very beautiful concept.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you help me with even a little amount, I\u0027ll be incredibly thankful. I understand that I\u0027m not setting this up as a performer, and that I can\u0027t offer you exciting new songs to listen to exclusively, or anything you are used to from other performers. But what I do I do with passion, and I strive to do amazing things in this world with my writing. Whoever helps me - thank you. I appreciate you, and I am so thankful that you chose me as your pet project."
