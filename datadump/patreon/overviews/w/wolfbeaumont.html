The community gets to vote on what direction the plot takes, creating major variables in how the story unfolds.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e~~~***~~~\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWelcome to the Looking Glass friend, may my madness fill you with delights and frights. My name is Wolf Beaumont and if you\u0027ll allow it, I will be your guide through a labyrinth of worlds.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent my life wanting to be a great writer, no needing to be! Believing that a writer can only truly push themselves by tapping into the own experiences. By that creed I\u0027ve lived a wild, strange and wondrous existence. It\u0027s only now that I\u0027ve found the courage to truly dig into that rich vein of memories that I feel I can strive for my potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I can\u0027t do this without you. I find my strength and my conviction through those around me and like many writers I can be a vicious critic of my own abilities. With your support, and I pray, sustained interest I give you glimpses of worlds I have voyaged through for many years.\u003cbr\u003eEvery penny goes towards providing for my humble living costs as I switch over to a part-time job and eventually I hope, a full-time career writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have only one other writing commitment besides my personal projects and that is a tabletop RPG I have been designing and writing with a partner for over 5 years (which will not be included in this Patreon as it will be getting its own this year which will fund art for the books). What I\u0027ll be sharing with you are my short stories, novels and scripts in piece-meal as I progress through chapters and drafts. I\u0027ll also share memories of my life with you every now and again as journal entries which I like to call \u0027Fragments\u0027. You\u0027ll see various content from me a few times a week including video content talking about what I\u0027m working on etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited to meet all of you and I\u0027m looking forward to your feedback and thoughts as I strive, always to be a great writer. Thank you.\u003c/div\u003e"
