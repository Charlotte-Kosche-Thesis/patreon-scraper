    "summary": "Hey, everyone! I\u0027m Wolfen M -- call me Wolfie! As you may or many not know, I have been working for\u00a0over twenty years on developing my own storyverse, which I call \u003cem\u003eGaiankind\u003c/em\u003e. This storyverse basically sets up a system of magic, and then retells mythology and folklore within that system, with a focus on the problems between those who are magically talented and those who are not. \u003cem\u003eGaiankind\u003c/em\u003e is made up of several series, and shapeshifters (especially \"waerwolves\", as I call them) are featured prominently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main one I\u0027m working with these days is called \u003cem\u003eThe Drosselmeier Chronicles\u003c/em\u003e -- it\u0027s largely a \"gaslamp\", or Victorian paranormal fantasy (cousin to Steampunk) story (there are also Regency and Edwardian elements). The first book, \u003cem\u003eThe Solstice Tales\u003c/em\u003e, collects two novellas: Nussknacker, which introduces Drosselmeier, his goddaughter Marie, and his nephew, Eric. I\u0027m working simultaneously on the next two books in that series -- one based on Lewis Carroll\u0027s \u003cem\u003eAlice\u003c/em\u003e stories, and another based on \u003cem\u003ePinocchio\u003c/em\u003e -- and am planning stories about Peter Pan and Sherlock Holmes, with a tentative notion to delve into Jules Verne and H.G. Wells -- we\u0027ll see. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other branch of \u003cem\u003eGaiankind\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027ve been playing with a lot of late is called \u003cem\u003eThe Grimm Age\u003c/em\u003e; it retells faerietales like Snow White, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, The Three Billy Goat\u0027s Gruff, and so on.\u00a0I\u0027m also working\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0\u003cem\u003eNew Idunn\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0series, which an urban fantasy series about a magical community on a man-made island and their interactions with the outside world (there\u0027s a sub-series, Braunburrough, about the brownies and faeries in the community, intended for younger audiences), and \u003cem\u003eOukami-Hanyou\u003c/em\u003e, a story about a homeless American waerwolf of mixed\u00a0Japanese and\u00a0Norwegian\u00a0heritage -- I\u0027m hoping to develop that as a comic series. There are also tentative plans for\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Fool\u0027s Errand Boys\u003c/em\u003e, a spy series set during World War II; \u003cem\u003eThe Complex\u003c/em\u003e, about Gaiankind living in an apartment complex in Chicago;\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eGods of the Gaiankind\u003c/em\u003e, which explores mythology. (I have one more series, \u003cem\u003eHunt for the Shadownmakers\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0about a half-elven thief and his puca during the 12th century, but that\u0027s for adults only, so I won\u0027t be posting about that here. If there\u0027s interest, I may do a separate Patreon for that and other erotica.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m self-publishing the stories, which means that I don\u0027t get the advances a writer gets when working with a publishing company not their own. The intent of an advance is to give a writer something to live on while they work on a book. My hope with the Patreon account is to give my writing muse more incentive to work, both\u00a0by seeing a more immediate return for that work and in knowing that there really is interest in what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce upon a time, artists had patrons, people who loved the artists\u0027 work enough to care of their living expenses so they would be free to create. Patreon was inspired by that practice. There are a couple of different types of Patreon campaigns -- the\u00a0one I chose is to be paid by the work, rather than by the month, in case there\u0027s a month where I just *can\u0027t* get something done. How this works is, you choose a patronage level, and every time I upload a new\u00a0piece of writing (which may include informational essays about the series, posted as part of The Grammary, a sort of encyclopaedia) or of art, or of gaming material, your account gets deducted for whatever you agreed to pay. You can set a cap on your patronage, so if you pledge at the $1 level and set your cap to $5 a month, and I upload 4 chapters and 3 pieces of art that month, you\u0027ll only be charged $5, not $7 -- but you\u0027ll still get to\u00a0see the new stuff! You can cancel your patronage at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I have several different stories I\u0027m that working on, each upload might be from a different work. You might get something from my \u003cem\u003eAlice\u003c/em\u003e retelling one day, \u003cem\u003ePinocchio\u003c/em\u003e another, and Snow White another. If I make massive changes to a\u00a0bit of writing\u00a0or artwork, I will update with\u00a0the altered work for free -- I will never charge twice for the same piece. I\u0027ll also post free posts about my unrelated fanworks, crafts, and articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realise that there\u0027s not much incentive for you, the reader, to be a patron to a veritable unknown, so\u00a0check out this free posting of \u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/1070755/chapters/2148684\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Solstice Tales\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e at An Archive of Our Own, otherwise known as AO3, where I\u0027ll be posting all my future chapters. You don\u0027t have to have an AO3 account to read the stories. In fact, you don\u0027t even have to pay here\u00a0to read -- the chapter posts will be open to the public. Think of me more as a busker, and your patronage is a sign of your approval of what I\u0027m doing rather than paying an employee. The Grammary postings (of which there are already several) are up at \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://gaiankind.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Artwork will be posted at \u003ca href=\"http://wolfenm.deviantart.com/gallery/31972334/Gaiankind\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edeviantART\u003c/a\u003e, and you don\u0027t need an account to view that, either. If you aren\u0027t inclined to become a paying patron, but you do like my work, reposts would be much appreciated as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s all there is to it! Whether you become a patron or not, I hope you enjoy my work!\u003cbr\u003e"
