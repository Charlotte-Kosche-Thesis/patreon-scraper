My name is Samuel Claiborne, a poet, musician and healer. In 1992, a freak accident rendered me completely\u00a0paralyzed from the shoulders down and\nin almost unimaginable and essentially un-treatable pain. I was 32 years old,\nthe sole breadwinner for my two young children and my wife. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am writing a book about the experience, entitled Walking Through Snow.\u00a0This book will be the story of how I refused to accept the dire prognoses of the medical establishment, overcame\ntheir often negligent, sometimes cruel and infantilizing \u201ccare\u201d, and with the\nhelp of many alternative healers and modalities, awakened my own inner healer and in doing so, far exceeded\ntheir expectations. My doctors told me I\u2019d never climb stairs again and that I\u2019d be in rehabilitation for at least six months. Instead I went home a mere five weeks later, under my own power, to a four story walk-up apartment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart memoir, part expose of our flawed medical system, part how-to primer, the book is inspirational and aspirational for all readers. For those facing significant health challenges, and their family, friends, caretakers, it is also directly motivational and concretely applicable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYes, I pulled off a \u0027miracle\u0027, with willpower, stubbornness, ingenuity, thinking way outside the box, and never taking anything at face value. But that was only the\nbeginning of my struggles. Government bureaucracies, terrifying drug\nside-effects, a failed lawsuit against New York City, my struggle for nine\nyears to re-learn how to play guitar, severe difficulties \u00a0with depression and bitterness over the loss\nof my youth and many of my memories, and my years-later battle with brain\ndamage and undiagnosed Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome all propelled me into a\nspiritual quest for greater autonomy, greater empathy for others, and greater self-love\nand self-acceptance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis quest ultimately brought me to a place of incredible\ngratitude, and also manifested a long-nascent desire to render service to\nothers, which led me to leave my affluent career in computers and embrace a heart-centered\nlife as a co-creative healer.\u003cbr\u003e"
