It runs mostly off a queue that allows it to post constantly 24hrs a day. As well as reblogging images, gifs, and videos it is mostly powered by submissions from it\u0027s more than 515k followers. This blog gives people a safe space to show off, enjoy themselves, meet like minded people, and enjoy their own bodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been running we-want-nudity October 2012 and I\u0027ve been fortunate enough during that time to have gained a quality group of followers who enjoy everything WWN has to offer. From day one I have always tried to provide the highest quality material possible on this blog, and I will continue to always do so every day. But as I\u0027m sure you\u0027re all aware, life can get quite hectic and sometimes it gets away from you a little. This brings me to the reason for creating this Patreon, I am hoping some of you will show your support via sponsoring this blog, this will allow me the freedom to continue running the best \u00a0possible blog that I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect everyone to donate, and I definitely don\u0027t want anyone to donate anything more than they are comfortable with, or able to afford. If all you\u0027re able to donate is $1 it is absolutely appreciated, and definitely helps out. On top of working a full-time shift work job I put at least 20hrs a week into running this blog, which requires a lot of work to run.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always continue to try and blog as often as I can, and your support would help make that possible. Every dollar spent in support of this blog will be used to maintain and improve it. The money will be spent on things like domain registration, internet bills, a new PC, and other various expenses associated with running the blog. All the money raised will go towards helping me run the blog, and eventually, if funds permit, I will be able to hire popular bloggers and cam girls for Snapchat and Instagram takeovers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t support this blog by becoming a patron, I appreciate you following we-want-nudity and I hope you continue to enjoy it in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eJay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome info for FAQ\u0027s about how Patreon works: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will charged upon signing up and then on the 1st of each month and the donation can take up to 72 hours to be processed. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll charges will appear on your bank statement as \"VISIT PATREON.COM/INFO\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe names of creators you are supporting will not be included on the statement\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e95% of your donation amount will be forwarded to support the blog, patreon takes a 5% commission.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
