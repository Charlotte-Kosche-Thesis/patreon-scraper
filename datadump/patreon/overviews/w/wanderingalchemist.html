Some of us have been doing it for a couple decades and we want to reach out and be a part of the greater community that continues to grow every day. The main contributors to this effort are John Crowley (The Wandering Alchemist) and Erin Rowan (The Untamed Scribe) and each month we seek to refine our work so that we can make it better and bring more to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNotes of the Wandering Alchemist is already home to a variety of articles meant to help expose you to new tricks to add to your Game Mastering arsenal. From campaign design to session preparation, world building to inspiration, we try to distill down our experiences. What works, what doesn\u2019t, and what we\u2019ve never tried. Additionally we share some of our experiences with you directly with Untamed Dice, an actual play podcast featuring a variety of systems, settings, and players.
