    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eWave Motion Cannon started as a passion project. It was an idea that came out of side conversations and a lot of \u0027what if\u0027s\u0027. But passion is a hard thing to bridle, and we knew: Wave Motion Cannon was something we \u003cdel\u003ewanted\u003c/del\u003e needed to do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt has been a year, and still we remain devoted to providing you with nothing but the best podcasts, analysis, translations, and anime/manga related content possible at every turn! But as we continue to grow, we have begun to realize that the bigger projects of grandeur are not feasible with only a skeleton crew - we need full backing for the Wave Motion Cannon!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve seen a lot of growth over the course of 2016. We\u0027ve on-boarded 5 new staff members, over 100 articles have been written, more than 300,000 words, and countless sleepless hours have gone into publishing nothing but the best we can offer. November 2016 has been a great example of this: 29 posts over the course of 30 days including pieces by 2 new writers - 4 major translations of never before translated articles and 2 interviews with actual animators who had never been interviewed prior - not to mention a continuation of a monthly podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTruly we can say, without a doubt, Wave Motion Cannon is a labor of love. But that love comes with costs: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://wavemotioncannon.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/translation-costs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver $800 (USD) has been spent on translations alone since October (not including procurement of new resources). Annual podcasting services and domain hosting makes up another $400, and that\u0027s just the start of it. Currently, all these costs are handled out of pocket, which makes reaching higher dreams and aspirations slower and harder to achieve. Especially when what we want to do is going to cost more money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll the funds raised will go directly back into making the site even better. Like the translations? -What if you could pick the next one? Big fan of the weekly coverage? -Help decide which one we cover at the start of the season! Got a topic for discussion? -As a patron, you can pitch it for us to talk about on an episode of Wave Motion Cast. Quite literally you are getting the chance to improve the content on our site.\u003cbr\u003e\n_________________________\u003cbr\u003e\nREWARDS\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019re also taking this opportunity to curate our content and offer various cool extras to backers who donate to help us stay afloat. These are offered in various increments that you can see on the right side of the page, but they\u2019ll be further detailed here.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBONUS TIER\u003cbr\u003e\nPledging $5 will give you early access to our monthly podcast, Wave Motion Cast, as well as our long form articles, plus we\u2019ll include monthly bonus content. This may include podcast outtakes, extra recordings, [or short write-ups].\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nINPUT TIER\u003cbr\u003e\nPledging $10 will net you the same as the previous tier, but in addition to that you\u2019ll become an influencer for the site itself. We\u2019ll have monthly voting sessions for podcast topics and article features, and around the time that a new season starts this tier will be able to determine what shows we pick up for our weekly write-ups.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTRANSLATION TIER\u003cbr\u003e\nPledging $20 will not only give you access to all of the prior awards, but it will give you the ability to donate your cash directly towards getting a specific article translated and posted to the site. Not only do we have loads of untranslated material that we\u2019re sitting on, but we\u2019ll consider specific translation requests from backers as well, and every month we will post a set of these to the patreon. Each will have a goal that needs to be met in order to pay for the translation, and all backers will be asked to choose which piece they wish to donate their monthly contribution to. Articles that have their goals met will be translated and posted by the end of the month, and all donated money will persist to the next month until the goal is reached. This ensures you\u2019ll never waste your money on a losing vote.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
