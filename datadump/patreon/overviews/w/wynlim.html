I used to think it was all about scale, but tech has made me skeptical of that. I could work with an organisation to further their goals, but I think good design has a certain threshold \u2013 once it is reached, it will not make a significant difference whether a designer is me or anyone else (I know, this may sound sacrilegious to designers).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI became increasingly convinced that storytelling along with education impacts the world in unseen ways (read\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSapiens\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12743473-the-storytelling-animal\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Storytelling Animal\u003c/a\u003e). The lines between the two is increasingly blurred. While working at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e I discovered a huge passion in designing experimental prototypes. Prototypes which are not polished, but they are enough to demonstrate the potential of an idea.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI took a sabbatical to recover from startup burnout and to spend some time working on these experiments.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eEducation\u003c/h4\u003e\nOne of them is a\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-experimental-year/a-self-directed-learning-network-wip-v0-2-d48e1c6fd6e4\"\u003eself-directing learning network\u003c/a\u003e which I intend to open-source, that will enable anybody to learn whatever they want, however they want, and tap from a collective intelligence\u200a\u2014\u200adrawing connections between silos of content which already exist:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1400/1*_LRFjc3-RKpzFFBh8gxrBw.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is borne out of my frustration as a self-directed learner.

There is so much noise out there, and \n\u003cstrong\u003eI hope these experiments can contribute to the overall progress in delivering stories and truth in the way they deserve, not just long pages of endless scrolling which nobody will read. I hope my writing will continue to create spaces for people to be themselves.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eMeta-experiment\u003c/h4\u003e\nBy setting up a page here, it is a meta-experiment in itself. I do not have infinite funds and there will be a point where I have to return to employment, which will most likely burn me out again. But even if I could sustain my health, I believe I contribute more net value creating this work than working for any organisation. I hope to be part of a near-enough future where people can create value for society out of their innate gifts and self-expression, and there will be more platforms like Patreon that will enable diverse income streams. Why do we insist on imposing a 40-hr work week on people, denying them time to explore what they can truly contribute?\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe small support I am asking for\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\nJust $1. If you feel like patronising more, you\u0027ll have my heartfelt appreciation, but I won\u0027t ask for more. Just $1, less than a bus-ticket in most cities. My goal is simply to reach 2000 supporters with $1 each so I can work on my projects full-time without being anxious about returning to employment. I don\u0027t need more to live for now. I have deliberately kept my expenses low. I have no interest in material wealth, apart from the occasional gadget and travel indulgence. I don\u0027t have worldly ambitions except time and space to do this work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eFor months I do get paid elsewhere...\u003c/h4\u003e\nMaybe from time to time I will take on consulting work if the right opportunity shows up. I do not intend to hoard precious resources, so I\u0027ll re-distribute your patronage to non-profit organisations.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eRewards\u003c/h4\u003e\nI would like to consult your feedback on this. I am happy to provide some perks but maybe you can give me an idea what would you like to see? I want all my content to be available and free so I will not be creating certain-tiers-only rewards.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOther meta experiments\u003c/h4\u003e\nOne of my main grouses is that most organisations that really need design help cannot afford to hire professional designers (well, capitalism). Perhaps every quarter my patrons can propose/vote for an organisation to contribute my design/writing skills to. Other quirky ideas come to my mind every now and then. My intention is to experiment with different ways of exchanging value.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThank you\u003c/h4\u003e\n...for reading this far! I appreciate your attention regardless of monetary support. :)"
