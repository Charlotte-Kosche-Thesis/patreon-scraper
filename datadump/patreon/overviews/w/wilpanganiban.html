    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Wil! \u00a0I\u0027m an artist. \u00a0I\u0027ve been drawing ever since I was in preschool. \u00a0I loved to draw Superman. \u00a0I got in trouble many times for making large chalk murals at school. \u00a0Then, I saw my first Peanuts book. \u003cbr\u003eI was hooked on comics, in all its forms forever. \u00a0 \u00a0I grew up drawing. \u00a0My dream job was to become either a famous comic book artist, or a newspaper comic strip artist, like my idol, Charles Schulz. \u00a0I touched the sky once, back in 1994 when I took over as artist for a single panel comic called Chaos. \u00a0It was syndicated by King Features. \u00a0I was hooked. \u00a0Sadly, the owner and writer of the strip decided to end its run without giving me a chance to take the reigns. \u00a0I was devastated. \u00a0My dreams were over, for now anyway. \u00a0I decided to focus on my new career, in the video games industry. \u00a0Meanwhile, I was moonlighting as a wannabe comic artist. \u00a0I decided to create a story called \"Grace\" and do a six issue comic about it (why am I telling you about this? \u00a0Be patient and it\u0027ll all tie together). \u00a0I got through issue one and two, when my job in the games industry started to take over all my free time. \u00a0In 2010, I was laid off from my job and was forced to rethink my future. \u00a0I declined to pursue Grace (too difficult at the time to do -- Cintiqs and Manga Studio were still a pipe dream) \u00a0I decided to restart my pursuit of comic strip syndication, an easier road, I thought. \u00a0I decided to draw from an old cartoon animation pitch I did for Hanna-Barbera. \u00a0The characters of that pitch were Count Dracula and Frankenstein\u0027s monster. \u00a0the premise was simple: \u00a0Beloved monsters get laid off from Hollywood. \u00a0What do they do now? \u00a0What a coincidence! It clearly mirrors my situation. \u00a0Tons of material! \u00a0For four years now, I\u0027ve\nbeen drawing my comic strip in hopes of reaching that\nelusive dream, Syndication. \u00a0Frank and Steinway\nbegan its run on certain newspapers in May of 2014! \u00a0As you can imagine, I was absolutely ecstatic at reaching such a\nmilestone.  But I\u0027m also very realistic\nin knowing that it still means a long hard climb up the mountain,\nusually for a small financial return.  With\nthe current state of newspapers today, that\u0027s become an even steeper climb. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://frankandsteinway.com/comics/2014-07-06.jpg\" style=\"width: 639px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://frankandsteinway.com/comics/2014-07-14.jpg\" style=\"width: 673px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eCreating a strip that is\npublished both in the papers and online requires quite a lot of time. \u00a0As for money, well, have you ever tried to pay for tools and living expenses with a cartoonist\u0027s salary? \u00a0I\u0027ve got tons of comic material on that. \u00a0To keep my dream going, I\u0027ve taken on a plethora of freelance work, on\ntop of a full-time job.  That leaves very\nlittle time to write draw and color my strips, much less sleep. Now, I know what you\u0027re thinking. \u00a0What is a \"plethora\"? \u00a0I don\u0027t know. \u00a0It sounded important--but let\u0027s move on. \u00a0As I\u0027ve said earlier, I\u0027ve come so far on my dream to give up now.  That\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://frankandsteinway.com/comics/2014-07-13.jpg\" style=\"width: 648px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWith Patreon, I\u0027ve found a place where I can make art and tell stories I\u0027ve always wanted to. \u00a0With newspapers, I\u0027m constricted with size and the typical readership tastes. Gag-a-day humor, and long story arcs if any are frowned upon. \u00a0Honestly, I\u0027d love to tell long stories, and not just with Frank and Steinway. \u00a0Remember \"Grace?\" \u00a0Yep, here\u0027s the tie-in. why not do it here as well? \u00a0I can hopefully get her story out to the public without the headache of printing thousands of comic books that will eventually end up feeding moths in the closet. \u00a0With your patronage I hope to alleviate some\nand hopefully, all of the financial burdens that have come to impede my art creation.  With less\ntime to worry about expenses, I hope to fully concentrate on simply making great\ncontent. \u00a0I would love for my page to become a destination point. \u00a0With your help, I hope it will someday happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/patreon.posts/11977551418474078719.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Note: \u00a0Grace Cover done by Gloria Shih and colored by Shanna Tellez)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://frankandsteinway.com/comics/2014-07-17.jpg\" style=\"width: 662px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://frankandsteinway.com/comics/2014-07-16.jpg\" style=\"width: 667px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/07TzIjikE0Q\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned earlier, I would like for my Patreon page to be a favorite destination place. \u00a0With that, I\u0027d like to showcase more of my skills. \u00a0This includes my illustration skills, as well as my other comic strip ideas. \u00a0All are available as prints and post cards for qualifying patron tiers! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/patreon.posts/1585041482000642914.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/patreon.posts/9342596613068950241.jpg\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/patreon.posts/3162123743432889583.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/patreon.posts/13538634692511081570.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
