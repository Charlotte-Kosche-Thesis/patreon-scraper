In the past couple of years, something changed and I\u0027ve felt pulled to do something different. Something more. Something fantastical. A nugget of an idea came to me two years ago and I\u0027ve been mulling it over and putting it off while continuing to create kid lit art. No more. The idea is demanding I begin. I will be creating a \u003cstrong\u003efantastical oracle deck based on the four phases of the 13 yearly moons\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e The creation of this deck is what  you will see on this Patreon page.

For many years I worked a full-time job as a graphic designer while raising a family. In my infrequent spare time I painted. Before moving to Missouri in 2000, I had even achieved a small measure of success in the gallery world and was awarded signature status with the Connecticut Watercolor Society.\u003cbr\u003e\n            Then my life changed big time. I got married. I moved halfway across the country. And the economy tanked. The graphic design work that had supported me for over a decade dried up and went from a stream to a trickle, to non-exsistent. I turned my sight to children\u0027s books. My first book was published in 2005. I love creating art and story for children, however, royalty checks, when they come are small and don\u0027t fully support me. \n\tIn 2016, I left the man I married and moved to Missouri for. Life changed in a big way, yet again. I\u0027ve gone back to graphic design. It pays the bills, but doesn\u0027t satisfy my mythological hungry soul.\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eI have this Patreon in the hope of scratching that itch. Feeding that hungry soul. To bring mystery and beauty to the world. On these pages I want to work on my personal project and share the progress with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\n\tShould\u003cspan\u003e you find my Moon Goddess Oracle cards  interesting and  worthy of your support,\u003cstrong\u003e I want you to know that every, single pledge is immensely appreciated!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e Your support will encourage me to create the Moon Goddess Oracle deck to add to the wonderful art in this world! \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003eWHAT YOU WILL GET!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n            Patrons will see \n\t\u003cstrong\u003ewips, sketches, exclusive previews \u003c/strong\u003e of  the above project and will have access to \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal coloring pages, step-by-step views of my painting process, uncensored pages and more. \u003c/strong\u003eAs soon as I reach my final goal, \u003cstrong\u003eI hope to reward my top level patrons with the completed Moon Goddess Oracle card deck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis will be along term project.

     "about": "A transplanted New Yorker now living in Missouri, Wendy Martin has been working as an illustrator for 25+ years. Wendy\u2019s love affair with art and illustration began at an early age. One of her earliest memories is of sitting with a pile of crayons and papers strewn around her proclaiming to her parents that someday everyone in the world would be looking at her art. In spite of her parents\u2019 attempts to steer her toward a more practical choice, she never wanted to do anything else.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, Wendy followed her heart and earned a degree in Fashion Design from the Fashion Institute of Technology, then continued her art education at the School of Visual Arts, earning a B.F.A. in Graphic Design. These disciplines can still be seen in her work in her strong lines, textures and detailed patterns.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHer career began in advertising and graphic design in New York, where she was often called upon to create spot art for a variety of clients, which included Fortune 500 companies such as Kraft, General Electric and Sears. After her move to Missouri in 2000, she turned her focus to her true love, children\u2019s books \u003cem\u003eAn Ordinary Girl, A Magical Child\u003c/em\u003e, a children\u2019s book she both wrote and illustrated was released in 2005. When the original publisher folded, \u003cem\u003eAn Ordinary Girl, A Magical Child\u003c/em\u003e was picked up by a new house, edited and re-released in 2008, then went on to become a finalist in the \u003ca href=\"http://www.covr.org/covr-awards/2009-awards/2009-books-children\"\u003e2009 international COVR awards\u003c/a\u003e. Four additional picture books and a coloring book quickly followed. Next year, another picture book and a new coloring book will join her publications.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWendy can still be found sitting around her studio with papers strewn around her creating stories and illustrations for children. She has since traded in her crayons for watercolor, pen and ink, and a computer.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShe is a member of the \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.scbwi.org/\"\u003eSociety of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators\u003c/a\u003e, and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.fromthemixedupfiles.com/\"\u003eMixed-Up Files of Middle-Grade Authors\u003c/a\u003e.",
