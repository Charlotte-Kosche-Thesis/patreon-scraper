Welcome to the Patreon page for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/worldbreakers/list?title_no=9336\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWorldBreakers\u003c/a\u003e, the epic fantasy webcomic hosted by LINE Webtoon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, thanks for even checking this here page out, that\u0027s really kind of ya! Hopefully you enjoy WorldBreakers \u003cem\u003eso dang much\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that you\u0027ve found it in your hearts to help support us while we work on it for you! We absolutely love working on the comic, but unfortunately there\u0027s no income involved (at least, while we\u0027re waiting to break into the Featured section of Webtoon), which stinks because as it stands, we can\u0027t eat a webcomic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mLE2HuA.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be straight here; pretty soon Justin\u0027s living situation is changing up (he\u0027ll no longer be the live-in caretaker for his momma) and it\u0027ll be time for him to get back to working a real job. Doing the artwork is incredibly demanding and time-consuming, so it\u0027s going to be really rough finding the time to keep the comic moving when he\u0027s splitting time between it and a job. So, for every pledged monthly donation, that\u0027s less time he\u0027d have to spend away from working on the comic! Telling this story is \u003cem\u003eimmensely\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0important to us, so starting up this Patreon page seems like the right thing to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that you know why we\u0027re asking for your help, let\u0027s talk about what \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0get out of this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5JmbMho.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, WorldBreakers will be able to\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eretain its weekly schedule!\u003c/strong\u003e Then, once things have changed at home for me (and I\u0027ll keep everyone updated on this), if we can get enough monthly pledges going that I won\u0027t be splitting my time, I should theoretically be able to return to \u003cstrong\u003efull color comics!! \u003c/strong\u003eA staple I\u0027ve noticed for other comic makers on Patreon is \u003cstrong\u003eearly access to each Episode\u003c/strong\u003e, so that will definitely be happening, as well as daily/near-daily previews of the Episode! Also,\u00a0each Patron will have \u003cstrong\u003eadvance access to upcoming merchandise\u003c/strong\u003e (posters/prints, t-shirts, and more!)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the more general rewards, let\u0027s talk tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5/month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe basic pledge package includes the Early Access to comics and merchandise as it becomes available,\u00a0and a \u003cstrong\u003especial thank you message in the comic\u003c/strong\u003e! Make sure everyone knows how awesome you are for helping us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10/month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone who pledges $10 a month will receive a \u003cstrong\u003epersonalized portrait of any WorldBreakers character\u003c/strong\u003e! Want a portrait of Tormir in a sheep-hat? Crash in a business suit? Baron Von Haussen strung upside above an alligator pit? Well now you can! Additionally you\u0027ll get a thank you message in the comic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$25/month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWoahjeeze, thank you!

When he isn\u0027t cranking out the comic-jams, he can be found taking care of his mother, playing with his (very dumb) cat, or getting romantic with his long-time partner and girlfriend, Chrissy. He\u0027s very fond of comics, quesadillas, movies, and binge-watching television series. His favorite WorldBreakers character has yet to be revealed in the comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhil\u003c/strong\u003e is the smart boy who conned his friend Justin into doing all the art for WorldBreakers, aka the hard part. When he\u0027s not juggling characters and storylines he likes to explore the ocean\u0027s depths, fight drug cartel members on top of moving trains, compete in Space Quidditch and lie on the internet. His writing on WorldBreakers is fueled by his love of shonen manga and JRPGs. His co-favorite movies are Labyrinth, Tron: Legacy and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and his theme song is Candy Candy by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*Note\u003c/strong\u003e-- Phil hasn\u0027t agreed to this.
