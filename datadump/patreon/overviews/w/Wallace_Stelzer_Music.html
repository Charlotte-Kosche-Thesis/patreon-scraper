As you can imagine, this is a huge personal time investment, so I\ndon\u2019t know how long I can afford to keep the channel running at full speed\nwithout your support. Rest assured though\u2014with your help, I will bring on new\nmembers to the WSM team to help run things, thereby insuring weekly uploads (minimum) and securing the channel\u2019s long-term viability. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e***\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAs a donor, you\u2019ll be welcomed into the Sidekick Squad and gain access to my special, sponsors-only Patreon feed, watch videos and download mp3s before they\u2019re released anywhere else, and decide what topics and songs I\u0027ll cover in my lessons and Jazzvengers series. I\u2019ll also broadcast live twice a month in a Patron-exclusive stream* where we\u2019ll discuss all sorts of fun musical topics.

The second monthly stream will focus on music education, where you can ask me questions and pitch ideas for new lessons (and expect a few guest appearances as well).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is such a cool platform, as it provides me with unparalleled ability to connect with all of my wonderful supporters (yes, you!).

The CD would feature a couple songs from my favorite game of all time, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, music from the Final Fantasy series, and more! I would also like to commission a few notable big band arrangers to lend their unique styles and expertise to the project. Big bands are capable of exploring a huge variety of musical styles, so get ready to be blown away!!
