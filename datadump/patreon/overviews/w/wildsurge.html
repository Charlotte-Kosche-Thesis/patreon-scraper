Each issue has a theme that focuses mostly on classic role playing games. Past themes include dwarves, villains, thieves, and the city of Neverwinter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarted from the Beamdog community, we are dedicated to bring our magazine to you ad-free and promotion-free. We would like to talk about things the RPG community enjoys instead of what advertisers or game producers want us talking about. We also want to talk about the positives of gaming, what makes gaming fun, and reach out to people in the industry to give insights on what it takes to create a video game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause we operate ad-free, we need to look to other revenue means to help with the cost of producing the magazine. We turned to Patreon and our valued readers since it gives us a way to reward them for their continued commitment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards we have set up will give patrons insights and sneak peeks into upcoming issues or viewing the magazine before it is officially released. Check out our rewards for more information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you don\u0027t want to become a patron with us, we thank you for reading our magazine. Without you, this wouldn\u0027t be possible, and if you want to join our community, visit us on Discord. We love to discuss old and new games a like and share our passion with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for visiting us and we hope you enjoy what we have to offer now and in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTyler Smith\u003cbr\u003eCo-editor, Wild Surge\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
