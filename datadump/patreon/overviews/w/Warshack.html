This place is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to support you gamers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for the valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s gaming videos, tutorials, guides and tips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe this concept can bring my dream alive and add more value to the gaming industry by making the channel financially sustainable long-term. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like) per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gears.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you pledge $1 per month you\u0027re donation will occur at the start of the month. If at any point you no longer can or want to pledge, no problem!\u00a0I know what that feels like to struggle financially and I want you to take care of more important priorities first. I will continue to make videos that I hope will help you through any hard times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I tend to publish about 40+ videos to the channel. Each video depending on what kind YouTube Exculsive or Twitch Footage, takes in total around 1-4 hours each to be ready on YouTube. Recording, to editing, rendering, uploaded, tagged correctly and creating a thumbnail is a lot more time consuming than most expect. Each one of my videos makes roughly $2-4 in it\u0027s lifetime, so you can do the math. Even a $1 pledge helps a TON.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fifa16gold.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Picking-the-Parts.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to invest more time into producing free guides, tips and tutorials to YouTube\u0027s community of gamers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me upgrade \u0026amp; replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do more important things, like making more YouTube exclusive videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/305/733/636124788869826885.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell met, my name is Warshack! Ever since I was a kid, video games have made it to the center of my life like most of you reading this \"haha\". I decided to start up a YT channel dedicated to helping brand new/intermediate players learn the basics and fundamentals of a variety of competitive games. I know some games have a steep learning curve for those who may not have a gaming background. This is exactly why I try my best to give those unfamiliar players a hub for which they can learn, ask questions, and get feedback from a community based around helping each other become an overall better player. Thanks for stopping by \u0026amp; I appreciate all the support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
