     "about": "Hello, we are Ashley Kennedy Turner and Sam. As the hosts and producer of three Disney podcasts, we want to give our listeners an opportunity to help offset some of the production costs that are associated with web hosting and podcast distribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving had the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wdwhappyplace.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWDW Happy Place Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e on the air for 3 years as of July 10, 2015, our show and website have remained ad free and sponsor free. After two years of doing the \u003cstrong\u003eWDW Happy Place Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e, we had the crazy idea of starting the second show,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.earvengers.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Earvengers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. There we bring together the likes of \u003cstrong\u003eThe Disney Dream Girls\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eThe DisGeek Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eThe Mighty Men of Mouse\u003c/strong\u003e. Then we got the idea of starting a weight loss and a transformation journey which became the \u003cstrong\u003eTransformation Thursday\u003c/strong\u003e edition of the \u003cstrong\u003eWDW Happy Place Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe continue to work hard each day, working in a retail environment always seeking better opportunities, while pursuing outlets like the podcasts to talk about one of our many passions all things Disney.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike so many other Disney podcasts that have multiple sponsors on their show which may influence their opinions, we decided to create the Patreon account. Unlike other accounts which might have levels for donations we want everyone to be treated the same whether they give nothing or if they gave $100 per month. So think about the money you spend on Starbucks coffee or an item at WaWa, instead of buying that for a day, put that money towards the costs of putting on these shows. Think of it as a way for you to contribute directly to a show you enjoy and you want it remain just as it is today, ad and sponsor free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for taking the time to read this and consider supporting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wdwhappyplace.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWDW Happy Place\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.",
