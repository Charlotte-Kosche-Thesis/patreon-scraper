    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, boys and girls! My name\u0027s White Rhino PSO, and today I\u0027m going to spend some time talking about why I make my videos, and why you should consider supporting this Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever enjoyed watching a friend or family member play a video game? Maybe there\u0027s a game series you\u0027re interested in experiencing, but the controls or mechanics seemed too off-putting. Maybe you\u0027re just looking for footage of someone playing through a particular game that you\u0027re still on the fence about buying for yourself. Or maybe you\u0027re just sick of watching the same shows on television or video streaming services. That\u0027s where I come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not doing this to get rich, or to be the next big name in YouTube gaming videos. I just want to put out good, entertaining, and informative content. I want to show off the games that I\u0027ve come to enjoy, and hopefully entice others to enjoy as well. Every time I see another view on any of my videos, it really makes my entire day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut why should you become a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNobody likes ads, no matter what form they take. On the internet in general, they\u0027ve only gotten more annoying and more intrusive. YouTube ads can take anywhere from fifteen seconds to several minutes to play out, and they don\u0027t always offer the ability to skip ahead to the actual content. Many people have turned to ad-blocking addons for their web browsers, and I don\u0027t blame them - I use one myself! Combine this with YouTube\u0027s own issues so far as de-monetization of supposedly \"ad-unfriendly\" videos and the people making the content start having a real problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it will be a long time, if ever, before I can actually support myself fully by making Let\u0027s Play videos for YouTube. Even so, I decided to take a page out of the book of someone much smarter than myself, someone who made a very good case for why he\u0027s chosen the direction he has so far as content-based income goes. To make a long story short:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have not, and will not, monetize my YouTube video content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf any of my viewers decide that they enjoy my content enough to support me directly, they have a range of options. They can subscribe to the channel. They can hit the \"like\" button on any video they particularly enjoyed. They can leave their thoughts and reactions in the comments section. And, with the help of Patreon, they can pledge a monthly donation toward helping my dreams of becoming a Let\u0027s Play gamer continue to come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as always.. thanks for listening, and I\u0027ll see you next time.\u003cbr\u003e"
