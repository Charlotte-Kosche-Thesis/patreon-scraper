One of the chief complaints my friends and guild mates had was that to find all of the information you wanted about a player who messaged you that you would have to check multiple sites and the process was tedious and slow. The goal with WoW Passport is to make the process much faster and simpler by showing the most \u003cstrong\u003erelevant\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0data first, and aggregating as much data as possible from the sources that you would most likely check to find more in depth statistics. There\u0027s a lot of features I would like/plan to add to make the process even better and I\u0027m working on it as much as I can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for supporting my work on WoW Passport!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
