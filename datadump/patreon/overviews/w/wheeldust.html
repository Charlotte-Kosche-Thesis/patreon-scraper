    "summary": "Tales from Wheeldust is a fantasy comic that I\u0027ve been working on for about 2 years now. Inspiration comes from too many sources to name and also a lot of my previous written work that I never decided to publish. It\u0027s a comic about a bunch of ordinary people living in a huge fantasy world filled with many secrets that you\u0027ll explore through their partly-comical and partly-dramatic tales.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal is to stay motivated and bring you as much pages as I possibly can so I can advance the story. Having my own universe with characters and story was always my dream, because I just love writing stories and telling them through art :D. I\u0027ve been drawing this comic all-out for almost a year now and while I run into obstacles every now and then I always try to deliver the pages to you guys. Slacking off is not an option for me and I always strive to improve my art, writing and myself as a person. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you ever wanted to support Tales from Wheeldust with money, you now have the opportunity with this Patreon, but keep in mind that every kind of support is much appreciated and will keep this comic going strong and stronger than ever! :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0So what can you expect from the story in the future? Lore, magic, music, sexual humor and a lot more xD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers and thanks - Egoman Freeman\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/Tales-from-Wheeldust\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRead the comic here!\u003c/a\u003e \u0026lt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/boHSqev.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
