After scouring the streets, back alleys, and parking lots wherever I am, looking through trash piles and construction waste, I create planets, stars, and unearthly music with whatever the world provides. Yard sales, flea markets and thrift stores supply my tools\nand materials --- paint, adhesives, dirt, sand, rocks,\nspherical shapes, fabric, nail polish, candles, crayons, as well as objects\nthat make noise.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/laP6CPVc1TM?start=58\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eThe Llywelyn Expedition (FERALCATSCAN) with Khate\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you do this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eI create worlds from trash to inspire\nothers to look at our own world differently: to learn all we can\nabout it, and, more importantly, to\ncare about it. Our activities as a species have poisoned this world\nwith trash and chemical pollutants. Our need to consume has\ndevastated ecosystems and altered climate patterns. I promote\nrecycling, re-purposing, and otherwise reusing objects and materials\nthat are considered trash.   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://the.strangest.space/img/bg_01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy \"The Strangest Space\"?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eIn the process of crafting a new planet, I envision what it would be like if it existed in this universe. What would its core, its surface, its atmosphere be like? What sort of flora and fauna (if any) live there? What manner of intelligent life may have sprung up, and what kind of culture do they have based on their biome?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e These are but some of the themes I\u0027ll be exploring in an exhibit opening November 2018 at the Aurora Gallery here in Roanoke. In addition to a vast visual exhibit of imagined worlds set against illuminated star-filled backdrops, it will showcase performances from various worlds. Costuming and body art will transform dancers into alien ambassadors as live music from extraterrestrial inspiration plays. Visitors will be taken on a journey through The Strangest Space!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will my Patreon donation directly support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m seeking funding to help offset the rent of studio and storage space, to fairly pay \ncollaborating artists for time and materials, and help build the \ninfrastructure for the installation at the Aurora Gallery in November \n2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://the.strangest.space/img/bg_03.jpg\"\u003e"
