I started off making videos on Instagram, which helped me realize that I love creating entertaining content! Whether it\u0027s comedy skits, reaction videos, rants, vlogs, etc., being a creator is my passion. I try to create at least 8-10 videos per month, and for the most part, I write, direct, and edit all my work, with a little help from my friends every now and then. By becoming a patron, you\u0027re not only becoming a friend of mine, but you\u0027re contributing firsthand to my passion and what I love doing: which is not just creating content that inspires, provokes thought, and generates smiles and laughter, but more specifically, creating that content FOR YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your Support Accomplishes?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis might sound cheesy, but nothing makes me smile more than knowing that my work brings joy to others. The overall goal is to continue to do that, while simultaneously growing and improving as a content-creator. Your pledges would go a long way in achieving that goal by:\u003cbr\u003e- allowing me to work FULL-TIME on creating quality content\u003cbr\u003e- making it possible to hire an editor, director, crew, etc.\u003cbr\u003e- better video / sound equipment (camera, microphone, lighting equipment, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Would Your Contributions Do for You?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will benefit you, as you will gain:\u003cbr\u003e- entertaining content that hopefully always makes your day better\u003cbr\u003e- voting for specific content you would like to see\u003cbr\u003e- exclusive early access to videos\u003cbr\u003e- full-length reaction videos\u003cbr\u003e- monthly exclusive content \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003efor patrons only\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter how much you contribute, every bit counts, as it\u00a0will allow me to continue to produce videos, but at a much more consistent and sustainable rate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time, and thank you for supporting my vision -- I am forever grateful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- WorkinGenius"
