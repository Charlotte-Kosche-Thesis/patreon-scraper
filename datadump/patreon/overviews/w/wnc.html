We have 3 regular listeners. Now, January, 2018, We have gone leaps and bounds over.\u003cbr\u003e- We now are on Video Broadcast on FITE TV, the SAME Network that has UFC, Ring of Honor, ACB (the UFC of Russia), ICW (Top Fed in Scotland), and more. We are small still, but in less than 18 months, we have grown, expanded, and covering more News. \u003cbr\u003e- We want to be the CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, BBC, CBC of FITE TV and Wrestling News. We provide the legit news, then we analyze, discuss, debate, \u0026amp; review the topics. We want to do this as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003e- If you donate to us, the Money is used for the show, not our banks. We use it for more equipment, renewal of our systems that we use like Mixlr Broadcast, Audacity, and more, expanding to different systems, and even a Championship.\u003cbr\u003e- If you Donate 10$ throughout the year, you will AUTOMATICALLY be enrolled in our Fantasy Booking Tournament in January where you will face off other donors and if you win, you will be awarded the WNC 20XX Championship for that year and you will keep the belt forever!\u003cbr\u003e- People want a full unlimited, unrestricted, unbound News show where the news is discussed, and all sides can be spoken for the news and each side possible.\u003cbr\u003e"
