     "about": "Hi, I\u0027m Steve Hay and have been a Woodworker/Furniture Maker for over 30 years. I have managed large manufacturing factories, small boutique workshops, owned and operated a Woodworking School and personally completed countless commissions for Corporations, Govenement departments, Private collectors and homes as well as meeting the \u0027at home needs\u0027 as our family grew. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2013 presented a wonderful opportunity in the form of a TV Show on Woodworking. Called \u0027Woodworking Masterclass\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s how all this started. I fell in love with the Camera and found that I could combine my passion for wooodwork with my new found enjoyment of video making. I now have the best of both world to be able to enjoy sharing what I have learnt about woodworking with others without the stress of having to leave home, catch planes, stay in unfamiliar Hotel rooms or, and most importantly, be away from my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2015 introduced us to Youtube. Hoping to make this a viable Career option. We started small but within a very short space of time figured if we were to do it we should do it properly and so invested heaverly in recording and editing equipment. We now have the choice of 6 camera angles and several microphones positioned around the workshop. As well as a new computer system dedicated to post production tasks added to which is an array of editing programs all of which we had no idea exsited 12 months ago let alone knew how to use.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e2015 has been a huge learning curve, it\u0027s with some pride now we can look back on over 60 videos uploads this year and notice the improvement with each one. Another dream of ours is to have a family business where other family members can participate and gain a full wage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the background and forward vision for for Woodworking Masterclass. Your patronage will help it happen and along the way I hope, inspire, encourage, and motivate many others to participate in\u00a0more woodworking projects as I happily share as much as I can with you all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers \u003cbr\u003eSteve Hay",
