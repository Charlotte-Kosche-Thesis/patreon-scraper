My name is Walter as you may have already guessed. \u00a0I am an artist, writer, and comic creator. \u00a0I\u0027ve self-published two graphic novels, \"Cubicles\" and \"Shiver Bureau\". \u00a0For both books I did the writing, drawing, coloring, and lettering. Us comic people are gluttons for punishment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s because I am a huge fan of telling stories and comics have allowed me to tell them in a really awesome way. \u00a0I love that I can write these stories, draw this art, shove it all into a bound collection called comics, and you read it. \u00a0Just like that you\u0027re in my mind. \u00a0It\u0027s insane. \u00a0I love it so much that I put my art and comics online so that you can read it for free. \u00a0The fact that you use your valuable time to read my work is mind blowing. \u00a0I love you for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if my work moves you and you want to support my work financially that\u0027s even more mind blowing. \u00a0Your patronage will help by allowing me to take on less freelance work so I can focus on creating my comics. \u00a0It also helps with supplies, server fees, convention fees, healthcare, and all the other crazy stuff that tends to come up in the weird world of comics. \u00a0Every dollar goes a long way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what, I want to say \"Thank you\". \u00a0Thank you for reading this, looking at my art, sharing my art, and your patronage. Let\u0027s go forth and rock on!"
