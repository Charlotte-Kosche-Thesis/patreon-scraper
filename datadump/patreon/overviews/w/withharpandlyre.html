Because of our love for Christ and for music, it was only natural that we started to make up songs for our son. Taking our lyrics directly from Bible verses, a new tradition was created in our home. Then our friends wanted to learn the songs to sing to their kids too. This is how \u003cem\u003eWith Harp and Lyre\u003c/em\u003e was born. Now we want to share these songs and bless other families with what God has given us.\u00a0",
