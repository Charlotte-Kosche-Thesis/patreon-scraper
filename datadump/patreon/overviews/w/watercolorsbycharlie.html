    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eHello friends! Welcome to my Patreon page. This is a place\nwhere you can fund me directly for my artwork. I am constantly working on\nprojects, from creating new paintings, practicing new techniques, and\ncurrently, illustrating a book with my partner. Becoming a Patron invites you\nto join me on my own personal art adventure through watercolor. I have never\ntaken an art class, only learning through trying to recreate art I found online\nand watching tutorials on YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\nOne of the reasons why I love having people join my art journey is because of\nfinding YouTube. I think there is a lot of value in learning through that kind\nof media, and I think I have the opportunity to help people learn too. I\u2019ve\ndeveloped my style over the past ten years, but I didn\u2019t start with watercolor.\nOnce I picked up watercolor, I seeked out tutorials online. \u003cbr\u003e\nI need your help because I want to add my ability and experience to YouTube. I\nthink I have a lot to bring to the table, and if you check out my rewards, you\u2019ll\nsee you can get a glimpse of that for only $5 a month. I have a few other\nrewards that are very limited. Right now, doing art is something I do in my\nspare time, as I have a full-time job. Maybe one day that can change, but\ncurrently I have to limit what I can give. But I am posting often on my private\nblog. I hope to see you in my ask box over there, because I\u2019ll answer anything\nabout my processes, technique or supplies. \u003cbr\u003e\nPatron pledges will contribute to my fund for getting the filming equipment I\u2019d\nneed, as well as painting supplies, since they don\u2019t last forever. I\u2019d love to\nget a camera and lighting, new paint and some quality paper. Another way you\ncan support my passion for art is checking out what\u2019s available in my Etsy\nshop,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/watercolorsbycharlie?ref=hdr_shop_menu\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWatercolors by Charlie\u003c/a\u003e. I am so excited about what I\u2019m working on right\nnow, and what I\u2019m going to be creating in the future. If you are too, then come\njoin my art adventure!\u003c/p\u003e"
