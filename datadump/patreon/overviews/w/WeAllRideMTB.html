Mountain Biking and Nature are two of the sweetest fruits of life and this channel will be focused on making the most\u00a0out of your mountain\u00a0biking experience. My primary\u00a0focus will be exploring trails in the western United States with my mountain bike and video camera.\u003cbr\u003eI plan to provide a cavalcade of videos on the trail, as well as, short videos concerning the latest bikes and parts. I am a teacher and have very little time to focus on this wonderful\u00a0industry, and believe I can help a lot of working professionals with some much needed, friendly insight into the mountain biking world. \u003cbr\u003eWith your gracious support, I can focus on your needs and have more time to provide a ton of wonderful videos and insights that will bring you the joy this phenomenal and growing industry\u00a0has brought me. I really just want to ride! More importantly, it would\u00a0be better if, WE ALL RIDE! Thank you so very much for reading and even more for supporting me."
