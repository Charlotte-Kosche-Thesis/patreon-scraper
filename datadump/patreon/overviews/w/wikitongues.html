Since we started, we\u2019ve recorded hundreds of video oral histories in more than 200 unique languages, representing 40 countries on every continent, publishing new videos on YouTube every week.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wikitongues.org/wp-content/themes/wikitongues/img/patreon-assets/pullquote2.png\" style=\"width: 920px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, while raising awareness about linguistic diversity is an important first step towards its defense, we need to do more than change the conversation. Communities need simple, connected and intelligent tools to share, and in many cases, preserve their language. That\u2019s why we\u2019re also building Poly, an app that will empower activists to preserve their languages by building shareable video and written dictionaries.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://wikitongues.org/wp-content/themes/wikitongues/img/patreon-assets/8c8475a4-f567-4785-8ff2-cacc861eaa7c.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWhen the Internet went public in 1995, some seven thousand languages were spoken around the world. Today, that reality is in rapid decline, as the side-effects of globalization provoke the extinction of a different language every two weeks (Wade Davis, 2009). Unless something changes, this trend is likely to spell the collapse of more than 3,000 language communities before the turn of the century. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wikitongues.org/wp-content/themes/wikitongues/img/patreon-assets/pullquote3.png\" style=\"width: 916px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of the primary causes driving worldwide language loss is that support for language communities drastically varies. While some languages are recognized by governments and taught in schools, the vast majority go unrecognized, unsupported, and untaught, leaving communities ill-equipped to pass their languages on to future generations. And as language communities vanish, they take with them their art, music, and literature; and their knowledge of the natural world. At its core, our mission to maintain linguistic diversity isn\u0027t about preserving grammar systems and vocabulary\u2014it\u0027s about sustaining all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/293/062/ed6fc6f7373c98db52f7b24f7ba762f5_original.png?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1454440890\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;lossless=true\u0026amp;s=cf2112438cb4351ede82b52543241ab8\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLopez speaks a language called Nafasana, which has yet to be documented by linguists or recognized by his home nation, Vanuatu.

He began posting the videos to YouTube, earning the project a modest following.\u00a0In Spring 2013, Daniel\u2019s college friend and eventual roommate Freddie Andrade joined the project. A native of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, Freddie had been raised bilingually in Portuguese and English, and studied French and Japanese growing up. Like Daniel, Freddie was motivated by a drive to explore questions surrounding cultural experience, intersectional identity, and displacement.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTogether, Freddie and Daniel doubled their efforts, recording dozens more interviews throughout New York. They soon\u00a0decided it was time to look beyond the city, and planned their first language trip: a long, winding route through the southeastern United States, where they recorded speakers of Cherokee, Gikuyu, Louisiana French, American English, and Gullah.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThroughout the course of their activities, their viewership grew, and people began asking about opportunities to get involved. One of their first volunteers, polyglot blogger Lindie Botes reached out to Freddie and Daniel offering her help. A native of Pretoria, South Africa, Lindie had grown up traveling the world, and on top of her native Afrikaans, had come to speak English, Korean, Japanese, Urdu, and French. Together, Lindie, Freddie and Daniel assumed the mantle of organization. By leveraging the power of internet, the Wikitongues volunteer community was born.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/158/502/9dba986efc5799535164a34adc58e05f_original.jpg?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1452132804\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=e105c4a2bb8ba3f999c49958d42847c6\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn the road in the USA\u0027s Lowcountry, Freddie interviews Caroline Jabulile White, a renowned storyteller from the Gullah-Geechee community.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wikitongues.org/wp-content/themes/wikitongues/img/patreon-assets/IMG_3506.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eIn January 2015, \u003cem\u003eDaniel and Lindie finally met in person\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eafter nearly three years of online collaboration, when an unexpected layover landed Daniel in Tokyo, Japan, where Lindie happened to be visiting.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/160/153/e59e39070a5b6927f5ae9af3f3064077_original.jpg?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1452172299\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=465a1f9871c808e22389ab7d480d9ce0\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur community is from dozens of countries around the world.
