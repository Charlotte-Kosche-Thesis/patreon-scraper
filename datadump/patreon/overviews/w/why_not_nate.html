    "summary": "Welcome Patreons or whoever finds themselves here, in the now :)\u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to get a look inside my head and see how my creative mind works and how you can help further my path of discovery and success ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, I want to explain my projects under-construction, Dead-and-Gone, You Me and Tree and the rest of the\u00a0 World of WhyNotComics in General, in a nice layout :)\u003cbr\u003eMy top priority this year is \u0027Dead and Gone\u0027 it is a dark comedy between two abstract characters that share friendship in a world that exist between a place going somewhere and a place going Nowhere. Gone tries to stay blissfully unaware of his reality but Dead is painfully aware of what is going on... Official websites of now:\u00a0https://tapas.io/series/dead-and-gone\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://whynotnate.tumblr.com\"\u003ehttps://whynotnate.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/why_not_nate/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/why_not_nate/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u0027The Adventures of You, Me and Tree\u0027 Is about the world ending before it\u0027s time and leaving behind one little girl That a Demon-Eater\u00a0 finds and befriends. The little girl (aka me) imagines the demon eater as a talking tree and refers to him as Tree... The two of them befriend a little zombie boy (aka You) and the girl and the boy follow and learn their destinies as Tree cleans and rids the world of demons and monsters and keeping other dimensions out of their way and preparing the world\u00a0 for it\u0027s restoration... https://instagram.com/you_me_and_tree/\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Outer-Space messages\u0027 Is my dark comic comedy about my ever laughing alien side projected on paper and not fitting in on video but a god still somehow...?\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7yrBiwuALis9Hrn4n6pz6hfLy7idRlki\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7yrBiwuALi...\u003c/a\u003e  P.S. it\u0027s not very good but animation and me are going to go places ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Mr. Lovebones\u0027 Is a Dark Comedy about an alien with a heart-shaped head that thinks about slaughtering and eating the world\u0027s population in different ways while trying to wittily win over the readers or viewers...\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhyNotComics is an idea I had because I have so many random comics and ideas and artist appreciation and I want to be able to organize myself and prioritize what comics to work on for each issue also could release my longer stories slower but still keep the readers indulged into my World and gives me an a chance to publish and feature other underground comic artist as well including random instagram artist. I also plan to set up an Etsy or big cartel to sell the comics through and pay the other artist who get a involved.\u00a0 Well, \"pay\" as in probable a free copy of the issue or a print of their artwork featured and other merchandise. Hopefully we will make some but gonna keep real about it and say it will probably have a slow start at first lol but I\u0027m going forward regardless...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s talk music now because music is a big part of my world and keeping my head safe... DJWhyNot?! is still producing just slowly because drumming and me have been a slow pickup but my plans this year is to master house beats and trap drums and keep fucking with egs and kick until I understand what I want, I\u0027m learning Audacity\u00a0 and want to master it before I invest in Pro logic which you guys will be my excuse for spending that kind of money lol...\u00a0 And hopefully this year my music will be easier on the ears and something the world wants to hear...\u003cbr\u003e Okay, lastly on here, lets talk painting and experimenting with video and animation, Painting I plan not to stop been loving acrylics and got me some oil paints, I\u0027m just waiting for confidence lol but hopefully I\u0027ll have some oil artpieces coming soon.. Animation is my goal!!! Learn and learn and attempt and attempt and hopefully make at least one short cartoon by the end of this year :) also I want my youtube videos for my music to get better and be more on par with the rest of Youtube and find the right video editor...\u003cbr\u003e Hope this lays out a good picture of where your contributions and support will be directed, make sure you check out my rewards to see the extra goodies you get for your support ;) Thank you so much for taking the time to read and see what I\u0027m about - High Five You ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Big Plans for 2018 and some game changers!!! First off, I am Planning on finally investing into photoshop with the new computer upgrade and hoping to do that when I find a part-time job in the next month or two if all works out or sooner with enough of your guys help ;) I am probable releasing the first episode onto Tapas without photoshop unless cropping is to big of a thing without it...I am Not as happy a I want to be with Issue one of Dead and Gone \"Going Nowhere\" but I can\u0027t keep stalling, I\u0027m hopping to get it into print by March at latest... Then on to Issue two \" Getting Plugged In\" So expect a Comic soon!!! ;)\u003cbr\u003eAlso I want to start an instagram account just for You me and tree to start introducing it to the world but no worries always you guy first ;) I\u0027m going to re-start it as a webcomic this time and hopefully with help from you pay an artist to help color and maybe draw all together but the time has come to get this story into the world!!! I will try to keep it updated bi-weekly same with Dead and Gone and hopefully Tapas can see two episodes from me this year from Dead and Gone.\u003cbr\u003eAlso I want to get all my works complied into one comic and turn the whynot world into a two to three time released a year comic collection including Dead and Gone and You Me and Tree. Also, featuring other underground comic artist and setting up a big cartel or etsy to distribute everything through...\u003cbr\u003eAlso Cartooning is happen and slow because I am new to the whole digital thing but I plan to have one cartoon made this year it might look like a five year old on drugs did it but that will make me feel accomplished :)\u003cbr\u003eMusic I\u0027m always trying to expand and find new sounds, Im starting to understand Garageband more and downloaded Audacity and am starting to learn it as well, I am making beats on Garageband and now learning more fine tuning in Audacity hoping to get more understanding and by the end of the year or sooner with your help download pro logics and actually creating some mixes the whole world can dance too and then also releasing my E.P. hut not until I can actually get a good recording and master Egs... but would love to have that out by the end of the year...\u003cbr\u003eOil painting :) plan to start painting and expanding my knowledge and no worries, keeping the acrylic abstracts going in full swing!!! ;) Should be a great year, everybody!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
