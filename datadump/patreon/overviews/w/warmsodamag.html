We offer a crispy, carbonated gulp of\u00a0 art, music and culture in and around the Alton, Illinois, area, including St. Louis. We strive to give insight and support to the creative side of this community. In addition, we include content covering music and art from all over the world and its impact on the area.\u003cbr\u003eCreativity is the backbone of what brings people together here; however, a physical home has never existed to hold and cultivate, until now. We are a home for all creativity of the area to meet and celebrate. \u003cbr\u003eHere on our Patreon page you can get access to exclusive content we publish, stuff that might not make it into the last cut of the magazine. Those exclusive members take the first sips of detailed articles/interviews with local creators, bands, artists, etc., before anyone else. In addition, they have access to our themed monthly sticker packs, ever-changing postcard sized prints, an 11x17 signed print by the staff and one-of-a-kind custom backpack. \u003cbr\u003eWe also hold polls to hear the opinions of our Patreon users first, along with updating continuously to keep contributors in the know about all warm soda flavors. \u003cbr\u003eSince launching we have grown quickly on social media, but there are areas that need attention to keep up this fizzy momentum, such as video equipment to give viewers a new perspective of our content and screenprinting materials to create endless amounts of T-shirts! \u003cbr\u003eTo achieve this and much more, we invite you to join this awesome soda community. By joining, Warm Soda Magazine can continue to grow, expand and produce quality artistic content. We believe art is a huge part of the human experience and what brings us together. Art allows people to connect in endless ways and offers opportunities to all. \u003cbr\u003e"
