And not just one but are several comics.\nI am planning to run one prime comic and 2-3 smaller comics series. The prime\ncomic will be a long, continuing story. The smaller ones we be same quality as\nthe prime but they will have a shorter plot. And after one is finished, I shall\nstart a new one.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBeside comics, I working on:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eFanarts \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e(adventure time,\npokemon, mlp, etc). I love to express my love of my favorites medias and\nfictions. Apparently a lot of people like it too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnimations: Sometimes I will\nbe doing some animation piece like GIF or full shorts when I will not be too\nbusy with my web comics. But your contributions should be able to create the\nrequired time for my\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAskBlogs\u003c/em\u003e(I already run one\nwith the character from MLP StrongHeart). But I would like to create more of\nthose \u0027cause its fun to do that sort of blogging.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlso:\u003cem\u003eFurry arts, Erotic Image\nsets, One Shot comics, PinUps\u003c/em\u003e are some of the things I do too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd, of course, everything I\nwill make will free of charge for every one to view. But any of you who invest\nin me will be more than just welcome. Your contributions will help me find more\ntime to spend on my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is there a monthly fee?\u003c/strong\u003e\nBecause if I set a payment for each work you might pay more if I suddenly enter my creative-non-stop stage. With your monthly/voluntary support it wont really matter how much of art I create, you still have to pay the monthly amount.\n \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your support?\nCant I just keep making stuff as I did in the past?\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, I can still do that\u2026but it\u0027s slow and I can do more for your entertainment if I have more time. And from my experience; time equals money. Real life usually isn\u2019t generous when it comes to time and very often I need to have a break or two from my artwork not because of a lack of inspiration or being lazy but because I have other things to attend to in ordered to support my living.\nAlso, just like any individual, I need to grow and accept to new changes. And seeing that people carry about my work enough to give a small share will give me good reason to do my best and keep my inspiration high.\nTo keep it simple: more support from you will result in more work made by me.\nBut I\u2019m not saying that I will stop drawing if no one wants to support me. I will make stuff regardless of the amount of support.\u003cbr\u003e"
