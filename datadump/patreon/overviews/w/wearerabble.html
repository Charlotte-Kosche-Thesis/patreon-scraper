This goal is based on a coherent sketch of just how many hours go into our shit tasks. Think copy editing and chasing content, layout and the website uploads, doing the post, maintaining the overall infrastructure we have built and laying the groundwork for a proper functioning media cooperative. Being able to cover this work, means rabble can stop fire fighting and just get on with what we do best, producing banging content for you lot without the admin work grinding us down!\u003cbr\u003e",
