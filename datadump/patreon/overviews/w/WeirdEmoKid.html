    "summary": "Just a humble writer trying to make his passion a part-time job. I\u0027m currently an amateur, striving to improve with every story I write. I\u0027m very self-critical, obsessive with my work, and a bit edgy when I write, but it all comes from a place of love. I cover a wide variety of themes, concepts, and genres in my stories, though I mostly gravitate towards fantasy, science fiction, and horror.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to write stories, including a full-length novel, based on writing prompts from Reddit, for free. I\u0027d like to keep it that way, which is why I created this patreon page. I find myself in the middle of a complicated situation at the moment. Soon enough, I won\u0027t even have time to write at all. I don\u0027t want to put my entire life out in the open, though, because I\u0027m not a fan of internet sob stories. It\u0027s just personal stuff I\u0027d rather keep private. That said, if I can start generating some income, I\u0027ll be able to open up time for my fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to take a moment thank the people who\u0027ve read my stories. The overwhelmingly positive response from you guys is the main thing that motivates me to keep going. I don\u0027t really care about your money (and part of me feels hesitant about asking for it). I know a lot about financial hardship so I wouldn\u0027t want anyone anyone to feel obligated to pay me. What matters is your readership, not your patronage. I just want to keep writing, that\u0027s all. From the bottom of my heart, you have my eternal gratitude for trusting me with your time. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
