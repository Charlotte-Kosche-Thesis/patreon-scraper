     "about": "As a kid, I read a lot. Anything from fantasy to westerns to science fiction. I started making up my own stories and wrote my first short story at 12 or 13. I also started drawing comics\u2013little stick figures with dialogue balloons that later evolved into musclebound warriors and scantily clad vixens. I gave them battle axes and broadswords and unleashed various renditions of the Kraken on them. A silent chaos ensued, followed by crickets chirping and nothing much else.\u00a0Alas, life kept interfering and I allowed it, and so nothing came from my artistic endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduating high school, I served a year in the military where I learned to dig trenches, eat quickly, and miss girls. I traveled to Israel and lived on a Kibbutz for almost a year, working in avocado fields and drinking cheap vodka. I sold pots and pans and educational toys in Africa for a while and almost got shot by Mugabe\u2019s guards in Zimbabwe. I did a brief stint as cartoonist somewhere and an even briefer stint as reporter somewhere else. Of course, the next \u2018logical\u2019 step was to start a business producing stained glass terrariums and lamp shades and weird-looking vases. I did that for a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomehow, and maybe by accident, I ended up in law school and became a lawyer. I did that for almost a decade. Truth be told, I rather enjoyed it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days I find myself in New Zealand with a wife and three kids and a dog named Stella, but I\u2019m back to writing stories and I\u2019ve been doing it for five years now. I mostly write tales of \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Seals-Abgal-Guardians-Tale-Book-ebook/dp/B00AV5STPM/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\"\u003edark fantasy\u003c/a\u003e and the supernatural, which is maybe not such a far cry from my lawyering days.
