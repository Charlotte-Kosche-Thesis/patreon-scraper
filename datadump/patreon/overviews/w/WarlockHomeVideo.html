We want these shows and the content under the Warlock name to be interactive with our community and to make YOU feel a part of the weird and wild world of what we create. With your help we can make the shows and the network a worthy place for you to invest your time and money.

If you\u0027re a fan of the 1980s and want to re live those nostalgic child hood memories, we got you covered with \"It Crept From The 80\u0027s\" a retro 80\u0027s themed show that will do just that. If you love your comic books, blockbusters, super heroes, modren toys and statues than you will love our show, \"GOURMET SCUM\"!

Plus exclusive cheesy no budget b-movies, unboxings, collection, Interviews, guest vids and SO much more! Jump on in and take part in the wild and wacky world of Warlock Home Video!"
