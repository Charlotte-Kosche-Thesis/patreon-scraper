Loaded with humor, superheroes, drama, supervillains, and classic puns galore, this series is a-trope-cious and wonderful and also carries a strong message about a single mom\u0027s heroes\u0027 journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s our pitch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeamstress Terri Kloth (it\u0027s not Cloth, it\u0027s Klooooooth) is a determined\n yet shy single mom raising two precocious children, and works for their\n father, the manipulative and emotionally abusive General Discord. When a\n massive showdown between the Doomsquad and the Brigade of Heroes looms \non the horizon, and Terri begins to break away from the barriers holding\n her back, she has a choice to make and the tension might tear her apart\n at the seams! Will a stitch in time really save nine (of the Brigade)? \nEither way, Terri will prove once and for all that the clothes really do\n make the man.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI consider myself a multi-talented individual who creates Drawings, Paintings, Digital Art, Cosplay and Costuming, Short Stories, Short, Fan, and Feature length Films, and Web Series! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel like I\u0027m bursting with creative energy, and need your help to bring such things to life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from a variety of written and 2D art that always is going on, my first main projects will be an Adult Humor Puppet Web Series (Happi and Treve\u0027s Comedy Children\u0027s Hour), and Sewing Discord - a Web series centered on a young single mom who is the seamstress to super villains and her escape from their control.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dedicate funds raised here on Patreon to materials (paper, pens, paint, cloth, casting compounds, etc), equipment\u00a0 and maintenance (video cameras, microphones, sewing machines, lighting, etc), editing and art software (Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office, CeltX, etc), and miscellaneous expenses related to projects (gasoline for location shoots, feeding our crew during projects, location and equipment rental etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be updating this site with a few examples of my and my team\u0027s work over the next few weeks to give you a visual of our products, as well as posting at least once a week to keep you abreast of our progress. Additionally, there are several patron tiers in the works, and I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll enjoy them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003eI hope you\u0027ll be inspired to support my and my team\u0027s endeavors.
