I\u0027m the translator behind the Chinese web novels \u003ca href=\"https://lordobsidian.com/mkrl/\"\u003eMartial King\u0027s Retired Life\u003c/a\u003e and \u0027Oh No!

It\u0027ll also mean I can release chapters quicker and translate more since I won\u0027t have to edit it myself. I\u0027ll translate whether I feel like it, don\u0027t feel like it, feel good, don\u0027t feel good or have a booboo, because I said I would.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027d like to announce my most ambitious project yet... A completely original Wuxia novel. I\u0027ve got the concept worked out, which I will reveal more details about. I am aiming to have it become a monthly series on top of the other two series. I hope to be able to do this full-time through your support so I can turn it into a weekly series, create original artwork for it, and compose a completely original soundtrack album for the series. The process for creating a series is time-consuming and requires effort. The last I\u0027m in full control of, the first, I would like to kindly ask your help with. I can do it if I\u0027m not worried about putting food on the table. This is a lofty project, I don\u0027t intend to just create another face-in-the-crowd series. I want to and believe I can push it to a much higher level. People always say \"life is a marathon\", well screw that life, I get up and run all-out every day. I can make it a success, and I don\u0027t say that out of arrogance - it\u0027s a result of belief forged from countless hours of work and dedication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0They used to call me \u0027Foreman\u0027, not because I stood at the front, but because I did the work of four men.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not here to participate, I\u0027m here to take over! And I want to invite you to be apart of these projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the best, is there a question in there somewhere?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther, patrons will have early access to chapters 24 hours or more before their release, ranging from 1-3 chapters. Those in the Royalty tier will be able to request two extra chapters of their series of their choice monthly. Make sure to check the reward tiers carefully. I\u0027ll continue to add rewards as I go because \"thank you\" is worth dirt. I\u0027ll let my actions do the talking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of who are not familiar with Charge Upfront, here\u0027s how it works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Patrons:\u003c/strong\u003e New Patrons will be charged on the day they become a patron, giving them access to all content shared with their reward tier. On the 1st of the following month, they will simply return to being charged monthly at the beginning of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eExample:\u003c/em\u003e A patron joins your Patreon community on February 25th for $10 per month. They will be charged $10 on the day they join, February 25th, for February patronage. On March 1st, the Patron will be charged $10 for March patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExisting Patrons:\u003c/strong\u003e Existing patrons will be charged on the 1st of the month like usual, so NO change. However, if you increase your pledge, you will be charged the difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eExample:\u003c/em\u003e You sign up on August 5th for $10/month. You will be charged on September 1st for August patronage. On August 25th, I change my payment type so that patrons are charged up front. On August 26th, you increase your pledge to $15. You will be charged $5 on August 26th. Then you will be charged $15 on September 1st for August patronage and you will continue to be charged $15 every 1st of the month thereafter until they cancel or edit their pledge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE KING IS HERE!!\u003cbr\u003e"
