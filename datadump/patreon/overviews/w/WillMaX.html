Last few months my youtube channel became the main financial income source for my family, as I lost my job at the beginning of this year (financial crisis in Russia and stuff, you know). And that was the main reason I was able to regularly make 3-5 guides a month, 100% of my time is dedicated to making videos now. I really love it, but by now youtube monetization only helps me to stay afloat, as my community small and still grows. Thing is, recently I got a job proposition. Not the best job ever, but definitely better paid than youtube provides me. So, I am now at the crossroads. I should choose whether I shall continue growing my channel and making 3-4 dumb guides a month, or accept job proposition and reduse it to 1 guide a month, or less (cus time for creating vids will reduce to 1-2 hour a day, instead of 8-10 hours a day I have now).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now you can directly influence the fate of the dumb/casul\u0027s guides, make them coming further and forth, as only with your help I will be able to make the decision and refuse the job proposition, to make my dream come true and make the youtube channel become my main\u00a0employment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOmg did I just write all these letters? Damn i\u0027m a moaner :D Anyways, thank you guys for watching my shit and supporting it, you can\u0027t imagine how I appreciate that!\u003cbr\u003e"
