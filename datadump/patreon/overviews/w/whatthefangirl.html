    "summary": "Hi. We\u0027re Alex and Bri, from What the Fangirl. We\u0027re two self-employed people who started publishing a podcast about ABC\u0027s \u003cem\u003eOnce Upon a Time\u003c/em\u003e in 2012. We\u0027ve gone on to publish over 100 episodes, and start two additional podcasts. We\u0027ve done this for three years paying our podcast hosting fees, website hosting fees and assorted costs associated with these projects, such as podcast intros and logo designers. We spend as much time on our content as we do on our jobs, but we want to do \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003eA Patreon will allow us to do this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first podcast was very well-received, and we soon realized that many fans were into dissecting media, and so we made a media playground for us and others called What the Fangirl. This website\u0027s motto is \"Pop Culture. Her way.\" We\u0027re devoted to covering the things you love, and celebrating them, from books to movies to video games, web series and more. We also cover the things you hate, because, come on, we\u0027re us! We cover women\u0027s opinions on pop culture, though anyone is invited to submit! We\u0027ve taken feedback from visitors, and have began traveling to conventions talking to \"fangirls\" about the things they are passionate about, and want to see more of, and applying this to our website\u0027s coverage \u0026amp; reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe now offer three podcasts, all three of which are available in iTunes, plus our website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOther Side of the Mirror, which discusses ABC\u0027s Once Upon a Time\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Litch Line, which dissects Orange is the New Black (and includes breakdowns of some of the issues based on Alex\u0027s experience as a prisoner\u0027s rights lawyer)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat the Fangirl, our newest show for pop culture from the point of view of the not so average fangirl\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe launched this Patreon largely to improve the quality, quantity and consistency of the shows, as well as our website. We\u0027ve had submissions from a number of amazing and talented writers, and would like to eventually pay them when we reach the milestone. In an effort to maintain transparency, we currently fund the podcast fees, web hosting, web themes purchases, and etc ourselves. We have no affiliate marketing earnings, nor do we have a sponsor. We only began running advertisements on our websites in February 2015. We recently launched the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shop.spreadshirt.com/whatthefangirl\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhat the Fangirl store\u003c/a\u003e at the tail end of September 2015, and will use the proceeds to pay for the website and podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, our amazing contributors purchased us a new mic, which has been beneficial to our sound quality. We\u0027ve not sought donations since then, but have now turned to Patreon after being suggested to do so by our contributors, fans, and listeners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money earned via this Patreon will be used to pay for equipment and hosting fees, designs for our store, and other costs. We\u0027ve outlined some of our milestone goals to the left.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you are unable to contribute, don\u0027t worry! We will still post podcasts free of charge just as we always have. Our website \u003cem\u003ewill not\u003c/em\u003e go to a \"paywall\" model\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Patreon only lets our patrons have \u003cem\u003eadditional extra access\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to content. We thank every one of you listeners for downloading us, recommending us, reviewing us, and sharing your feedback with us. It\u0027s been one of the best and creative experiences we\u0027ve had, and we want to do it even more, and better than before.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
