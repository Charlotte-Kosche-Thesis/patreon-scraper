    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003e\n\tThe Pitch\u003c/h1\u003e\nHi. The video is Daniel Marlos, aka The Bugman. This is Daniel Jacobs, the guy that keeps the website up and running, and does all of the techy stuff. Daniel Marlos the Bugman and I have decided it\u0027s time to take a leap forward with whatsthatbug.com. We\u0027d like to generate the revenue to be able to dedicate more time and resources to the site, to redesign the site with more modern web technologies, to bring in more editorial assistance, to engage more with our FaceBook community (which has grown and thrived in spite of our neglect), and maybe even to pay ourselves a few bucks at the end of the day some day.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have always disliked having ads on our site. But they (almost/barely, depending on the month) pay our hosting and bandwidth costs.\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003ewhatsthatbug.com is visited by between 300,000 and 1,000,000 people per month\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0depending on the season (more in the US summer).\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThis is a labor of love, and we will bring it to you without ads\u003c/strong\u003e and add new features and services, if you will help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo please \nPatreonize us! You can contribute as little as $1 a month to show your support, or as much as you choose. You can get priority bug identifications, or even help Daniel out by writing a guest blog post.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur first goal is $1500/month, at which point I will remove all advertising from the site!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eManifesto\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cWhat\u2019s\n That Bug?\u201d began in 1998\n\u003c/strong\u003e when my longtime collaborator Lisa Anne \nAuerbach asked me to write a column for a fledgling photocopied zine \nentitled \u201cAmerican Homebody\u201d and I proposed insect identification as the\n subject matter. I justified the decision by stating matter-of-factly \nthat \u201cEverybody wants to know what\u2019s that bug?\u201d and that mantra has \nproven true through the years. I nostalgically dredged up an early \nchildhood interest in insects as my source of inspiration and I assumed \nthe persona of the Bugman.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen the column went online a few years\n later, I proceeded to respond to the web browsing readership\u2019s letters \nand photographs, attempting to identify the curiosities encountered in \nthe home, lurking on the tomato plants or spotted while on holiday in \nCosta Rica.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIn 2002 whatsthatbug.com became a unique website (we celebrated the 15 year anniversary of registering the domain name on August 15th, 2017),\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eand\n through the years, I have tried to promote an appreciation of the \nnatural world around us, especially a tolerance of insects and their \nrelatives.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nA network of faithful readers began to form\u003c/strong\u003e, and soon \nthose readers began to offer suggestions for unidentified and mystery \nspecimens with links to other websites containing evidence of \nidentification verification. The readership\u2019s fascination with the \nmating habits of insects, the intricacies of the food chain and the \nappalling number of images depicting unnecessary carnage all resulted in\n a further subcategorization of letters within the archive, each \nproducing a tagged component of the website.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nThe fragility of our \nplanet and the interconnectivity of all life forms continue to be \ndriving forces behind the ecology minded tone promoted at What\u2019s That \nBug?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
