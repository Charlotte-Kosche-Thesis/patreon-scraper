    "summary": "As many of you know, rent in Portland isn\u0027t cheap and the cost of living has pushed many of the city\u0027s creative class, especially people of color, out of town. For over 10 years, I have contributed writing, readings, lectures, workshops, translation and other work to my communities, and it\u0027s not something that can easily be given a price tag. I want to keep my work accessible to people of all backgrounds and income levels, and I can\u0027t do that without your help. If you have benefited from my work or would like to contribute to keeping my skills and content available free of charge to the Portland community (and other communities - people as far as Berlin and San Salvador benefit from the work we do right here in Oregon), please consider supporting my efforts on a small sliding scale monthly donation. Not all of us have access to the same resources, so I don\u0027t expect everyone to contribute every time, but if we want to keep the city\u0027s creative and multicultural classes alive and well I believe we must find ways to let them survive, and I\u0027m trying to do that today through the power of social media and content networking. Portland deserves to keep this part of itself, and I think together, we can make sure that happens together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConcrete examples of my support for the city include low-cost work that is distributed free of charge in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://portlandobserver.com/staff/olivia-olivia/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehistorically black newspapers such as the Portland Observer\u003c/a\u003e, free online sites such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://queenmobs.com/2015/05/why-im-not-happy-with-awps-response-to-the-vanessa-place-controversy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQueen Mobs\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://therumpus.net/2012/10/donkey-kong-in-trouble/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Rumpus\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/10/08/castoffs_and_leftovers_the_mixed_benefits_of_working_for_a_white_family/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSalon\u003c/a\u003e.

I have provided free workshops on zine making, letter writing, journalism as an activist and writer of color, trauma writing for survivors of domestic violence, and at every opportunity I have tried to highlight stories and give press to the disenfranchised among us - with a heavy emphasis on Portland\u0027s rental crisis, police brutality, racism, and transmisogyny.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI urge everyone us to recognize labor that does not fit into a traditional pay model. Women have historically performed emotional and psychological labor for communities in ways that we cannot easily survive off of, but I believe a woman raising her voice to power or lifting her pen to condemn a landlord advocacy group is just as valuable and meaningful as a man picking up a brick to build a house. I cannot survive off my meager wages alone, but the work is there, and we are collectively there as people who will not let Portland\u0027s creative class disappear. Young women of color belong here, even if it\u0027s not easy to see how our labor changes the city and atmosphere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I believe I can find a way to stay and survive in Portland and continue to provide work that is accessible to people of all means and backgrounds, and serve communities who otherwise might not have their stories heard."

     "about": "My name is Olivia, and I was born to Salvadoran refugees in the 1980s. I naturalized on my own while attending Reed College, where I graduated in 2009 with a BA in Creative Writing. I spent a few years in Berlin, got married, move back the United States, and tried to start my life as a writer and activist, working at an indigent criminal defense firm as a receptionist and interpreter. My life was side-swiped off your run-of-the-mill woman-married-beautiful-British-national fantasy when my husband acquired his residency. One day, they let him know he was officially a resident of the United States, and a few weeks later, I was living out of my suit case in a dorm room because my husband had thrown me out and cut my health insurance. My story isn\u0027t unusual and a lot of women, I\u0027ve learned, are no stranger to the cruelty of men. I began writing and working harder than I ever have before to ensure I didn\u0027t lose the precious little I had left. I am trying to rebuild my life after an act of unusual cruelty took everything I thought I had from me. Together, we\u0027ll build a path for other women like me, like us, to walk through, so they know they are never alone just because of domestic abuse or devastating loss. I am a writer, public speaker, interpreter, reporter, and activist.\u00a0",
