In settings which focus on ranged combat, especially sci-fi or modern settings, it can be hard to balance an encounter against melee opponents, especially those big brutes which make mincemeat out of sword-wielding PCs in fantasy RPGs. When you can perch at cover and snipe a T-Rex to death, it\u0027s not much of a threat. Of course, WOIN already addresses the encounter reward by basing it on how hard the encounter actually was, not on how hard some equation says it should be, but sometimes you just want your brutes to give your ranged PCs a hard time. This article will help you do that with advice on existing exploits and a range of new exploits like Come Here, Living Shield, Monstrous Leap, and more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/8515470\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e#49.
