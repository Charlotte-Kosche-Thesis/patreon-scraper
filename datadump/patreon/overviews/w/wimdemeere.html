    "summary": "\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page!\u003c/h4\u003eI have trained with much enthusiasm in a variety of Martial Arts and Self-Defense systems for over 30 years. I\u0027m lucky in that I made this my job and have been teaching professionally for over 20 years now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWay back in 1999, I wanted to do something on that new thing they called \u003cem\u003eThe Internet\u003c/em\u003e and started a Martial Arts website. I wrote articles, book and video reviews and did interviews with experts. One thing led to another and I ended up writing several books and making a bunch of instructional videos. But running a website was no that easy back then and the technical side became too big of a hurdle to overcome. Eventually, I stopped working on my site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout ten years ago, I discovered blogging and how much easier the technical stuff had become. So I jumped back in and created\u003ca href=\"http://www.wimsblog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWim\u0027s Blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Since then, I\u0027ve written almost 600 blog posts, ranging from articles on all aspects of the arts, to analyzing video footage of street fights, detailed how-to guides to help people with their training and much more. Along with my blog, I started a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ptccm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and filled it with instructional videos too. My latest project is a\u003ca href=\"http://www.wimsblog.com/category/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ethat has become pretty popular as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to avoid my blog and all these other projects becoming an expensive hobby, they have to be self-sufficient. Via advertisements and sponsors, I managed to cover most of the costs, but traffic has risen to the point where that isn\u0027t enough anymore. So in order to grow and to keep on improving my writing and videos, I started this Patreon page. By becoming a patron, you help me to keep my work going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I offer in return? A whole bunch of things at different reward tiers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to my Patreon activity stream where I post updates, pictures,\n and anything else I can think of that would be interesting to you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA discount on my new books and videos when they are published. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly access to my blog posts and videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to my monthly Quick Q\u0026amp;A videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Video analysis.of actual street fights and a group discussion afterwards.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree electronic version of my new books.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree paper version of my new books.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA private monthly Q\u0026amp;A video of 30 min.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA monthly, one-hour, private video conference call.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can suggest topics for videos, blog posts and articles.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI share my work-in-progress with you, both my writing and videos. \nYou can give input and feedback before the final version is published. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWhen I have ideas for more rewards, I\u0027ll add them to the relevant tiers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support my work, becoming a patron is an easy and practical way to do so. Remember that you can stop at any time, though that will of course mean you also stop receiving the rewards. Thanks for any support you can offer if you decide to do so. I very much appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe safe and have fun,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWim\u003cbr\u003e"
