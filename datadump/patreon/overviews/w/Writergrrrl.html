    "summary": "First of all, thank you so much for considering becoming a patron. Without folks like you life as a creator is one long panic attack in anticipation of some bill not getting paid or a project not being finished because one lacks the wherewithal to eat. You think I\u0027m exaggerating. I am not. Truth is, people like to read, watch cool videos, appreciate art, love music but don\u0027t always think about some of the challenges those of us who make all that stuff have to deal with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, you are one of the enlightened who understands just how essential a good artist/art consumer relationship is. And that\u0027s not just in terms of cash, I hasten to add. A thoughtful comment or a smart question (or, for that matter, a stupid question, because we all know there is no such thing...), or a word of encouragement or an appropriate emoji - all those little communications mean the work has touched someone. And making those connections is really what it\u0027s all about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who am I and what am I doing here? I am a writer, traveller, blogger, photographer, and budding videographer with a deep curiosity about the world and the people in it. I love climbing, sailing, and off-the-beaten-track adventures. I\u0027m also a performer, a storyteller and workshop leader eager to share my experiences with the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you sign up to support my ongoing artistic adventures, you never know what work might emerge - a blog post? The chapter of a new book? An online writing workshop? A photo essay? A video? A new performance of one of my spoken word pieces? Whatever it is, you will be the first to know about it. You\u0027ll also be privy to behind-the-scenes stories about how the projects come to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, you can also be part of supporting a really cool project that involves me walking the last 115 kilometres of the Camino de Santiago with my 82 year-old father and 30 year-old daughter. That makes me the filling in an intergenerational sandwich of artists. My father is an amazing visual artist and my daughter is an author and designer. We\u0027re working on a memoir about the trip together and I\u0027ll also be posting some videos about the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough we are all game and will somehow scrape the funds together to do the trip we don\u0027t have unlimited time to fart around with a sensible savings plan (did you notice the part about Dad being over 80?). We\u0027ll max out credit cards and hope for the best, if necessary. But this trip would be even better if we can take you along for the ride. And that\u0027s just one of several pretty cool projects I have on the go. You can be part of all of them for as little as a buck a month! Man. What a deal! I wish I could support me! Oh, wait... that\u0027s the old model! Now we can all be in this together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, you may want to step up and pledge a bit more. And that\u0027s super awesome. Pledge enough and I\u0027ll send you an autographed copy of the book when it comes out! But whether you pledge a modest amount or a vast amount, look forward to hanging out in some live Q\u0026amp;A sessions, getting mentioned over on my regular blogs, and having access to some private supporter-only blog posts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow often will you see something from me? I am constantly producing stuff, but not everything I write/perform/create winds up online. And, something like a book is a BIG DEAL and obviously doesn\u0027t happen too often (that said, I have published about 30 books over the past 20 years). It\u0027s reasonable to expect something to be posted about once a week. If you are a $1 a month supporter, that\u0027s about a quarter per blog post (which is likely to be the most regular thing I produce). Some months there will be a video. Some months there may be a sneak peek at an excerpt from a manuscript in progress. Some months you may get a photo essay about somewhere cool I\u0027ve been. With any luck, I\u0027ll find that sweet spot where you aren\u0027t overwhelmed, but you won\u0027t be disappointed either.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever level you decide to help out, know how deeply grateful I am for your contributions. In return, I\u0027ll work my ass off to make stuff you enjoy. If things get crazy and we reach some stretch goals together, I have some amazing creative friends who work as artists, musicians, videographers, writers, and photographers and nothing would make me happier than to expand my own creative horizons by embarking on some cool collaborative projects. Stay tuned..."

     "description": "I\u0027ll create a patrons-only how-to video about... well, we\u0027ll decide together through a patron poll. Could be how to tie a bowline or how to draw stick figures or how to write a great media release or how to bake a tasty loaf of caraway rye bread. Maybe you\u0027d like to learn how to gybe your sailboat or how to set up a a bullet journal. I\u0027ll blog about whatever you collectively decide would be most interesting/relevant/useful. The rest of the world can see the video and accompanying blog post a month after you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCamino-specific: Because I\u0027ll be shooting video along the way, I need to upgrade my camera. I currently use an early Olympus E-P1 Micro 4/3 camera, which has done a fine job so far but is now getting on a bit. To be able to shoot better quality footage, I\u0027m looking at something like a Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH4. The basic body is $1218CDN and a kit with a lens and some other handy goodies is $2249.95. Another option would be a Sony A7 (similar price). I\u0027m doing my homework at the moment to see which camera would do the best job for me while still being nice and light. When we reach this funding goal, I\u0027ll go ahead and make the purchase and all of you who helped out will get to see an unboxing video when the beautiful new equipment arrives.\u00a0",

     "description": "Ok, maybe you found it a little bit scary to support a writer you\u0027ve never met. To show just how much I appreciate your leap of faith, I\u0027ll shoot a video in a scary place (hanging from the side of a cliff, for example) thanking you for your amazing contributions. All patrons on board at this point will get their names in the Scary Video credits. Note: I\u0027ll be using my beautiful new equipment procured when we reached the stage 1 funding level. First, though, you will also get to see a mini behind-the-scenes video about how I will be keeping the equipment safe because it would really, really suck to drop my new camera off a mountain on its first serious trip out! P. S. If things progress at lightning speed, I will shoot this piece of video while hanging from a frozen waterfall somewhere in the Canadian Rockies.\u00a0",

With any luck, this adventure will involve some sailing or climbing, or maybe both (depending on your interests). I\u0027ll host one person every six months or so and we\u0027ll determine who the lucky person is by random draw. For every dollar you pledge each month you\u0027ll get a chance at the prize. For example, if you have been a $1/month supporter for 3 months at the time of the draw you\u0027ll get 3 chances in the draw. If you\u0027ve been a $20/month supporter for two months, you\u0027ll get 40 chances to win. \u00a0At the same time, I\u0027ll expand the collaborative aspects of my projects and look to find ways to work with visual artists, storytellers, video editors, musicians, etc. depending on whatever the next project might be.
