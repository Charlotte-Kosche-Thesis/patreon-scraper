The inner struggle is preferred because the reason for a struggle always lies primarily with one itself. While the struggle is often understood as something contradictory, fighting is a contributing and productive process of self-development. This \"inner struggle\" deals the self with the state of being on a deep physical, mental and emotional level.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePreventive curative arts\u003c/strong\u003e from Wudang have Daoist roots and is today\u0027s basis for traditional Chinese medicine. This ancient form of healing is a self-study and has a very practical focus that works and is appreciated in preventive medicine by many western physicians. For all patients who had medical care at the same time, everyone could improve their condition at all levels by adhering to a strict training plan. By means of special exercises, body-specific processes are realized and understood. The willingness and readiness for change is fundamental in order to work consistently on our health.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApplied philosophy\u003c/strong\u003e is the main observation in Sanfeng Daoism. This understanding of our self and the construction of Yin and Yang gives us the inspiration and motivation to turn the thematic Wudang teaching into a living art. This is the key to the principles of the universe according to old school explanations and are in our academy logically handed down and applicable.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wudang.academy/\"\u003eOfficial Website\u003c/a\u003e"
