Why does typing that make me feel like I\u2019m in a\ntwelve-step program?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, yeah, I write, I\ncreate, I make stuff up. I\u0027ve been called a good many things over the years:\nwriter, poet, novelist, journalist, songwriter, fiction engineer, ghostwriter,\nfather, son, friend, nerd, model, actor, producer, director, and coffee\nenthusiast (and so many more).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFrom spoken word\npoetry set over graphics or in printed collections, to articles about concerts,\ntours, and the occasional indie artist being abused by an American Legion post,\nto a paranormal fiction series about ghosts and vampires or science fiction\ntales of deep space or time travel, to opinion pieces about \u003cem\u003eBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u003c/em\u003e, digital vs.\nphysical content, or Bret Easton Ellis, my writing covers all the bases. I\u0027m hard to pin down, but easy to read\n(or so I\u0027ve been told).\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://witlesslackey.blogspot.com/p/dennis-sharpe-media-kit.html\"\u003eMy digital media kit can be found by clicking here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work ethic\ngenerally keeps me creating a minimum of ten pages a day of varied styles of\ncontent. It\u0027s habitual. From time to time, I do far more than that. There are\ntimes when eight or even nine of those pages aren\u0027t worth keeping, but I\u0027m\ngetting a bit better at the quantity of the quality. These things take time,\nright?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI\u0027ve lived all over the continental United States, and have worked in nearly every setting you can imagine, yes, even briefly in the Army. To clear things up for any curious about such thing, New York, Chicago, Washington D.C., and Tucson were my favorite places to live. That\u0027s through the rosy tint of hindsight, to be sure, but they really did a lot for me as a human being and I wouldn\u0027t be who I am today if not for those places and the people I met while living there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days I practice my insomnia in the far west tip of the Bluegrass State. I live with my kids, Sadie and Caleb (my oldest, Arol, has moved out on his own), and they are not only the best things in my whole world, I find that they find their way into almost everything I write in one manner or another. Creating my children was the only thing I am more proud of than the works of wordcraft I have created and continue to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9ctPMEW1YJo/WjMett6zYbI/AAAAAAAADHE/wb7FWtUNalcn_aPZW36FxckdsMwy6iXDwCLcBGAs/s640/Why%2Bdo%2Byou%2Bwrite.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eWhy do I write?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe question was the\nfinal line of an email exchange between myself and a ten-year-old who wrote to\nme with a bounty of questions and a sincere exuberance to write fiction with\nreckless abandon. The plainness of it really struck me, and I debated what sort\nof answer I should give. How much honesty was really called for?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I write?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIs it for sales?\nMaybe it\u2019s for attention, reviews, or accolades? Respect of my peers or the\nreading public at large? Is it because I want to be on bookshelves all over the\nworld and feel that I have, in some small way, contributed to the social whole?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll have to be\nhonest and admit that some of those actually sound kind of nice. Being able to\nsupport my family with my writing, making an impact on the world I live in, and\nhaving others take note of or enjoy my work would all be really fulfilling to\nme as a person. These are facts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHowever, none of those\nare the reasons why I write. None of those are the core impetus that drives me\nto put words together, tell stories, or share my words and worlds with other\npeople.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI have a problem. I\nhave a difficulty connecting with people. I love communicating, and I often\nattempt a lot of it through social media, email, the phone, and\u2014from time to\ntime\u2014I even do it in person. I often feel as though I have failed miserably at\nit. I have an odd social anxiety. I panic inside. I get the sweaty palms and\nthe nervous laughs that make any confidence I truly have seem to vanish to the\nperceptions of those I want to communicate with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe only thing I\u0027ve\nfound that alleviates all those negatives is passion. If I feel passionately\nabout something, I can really talk. I can be articulate and I can connect. I am\ngreater in that than the actuality of who I am. That connection can be made\nwith the things that I write. But, guess what? I fooled you again. While this\nis important, it\u2019s not why I write. It\u2019s just the main reward that I appreciate\nand enjoy because of my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhy, you may ask, are\nyou telling me all this? Why do I even care, why you write or why it matters to\nyou that you do?\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese are fair\nquestions. I\u2019ll get to the point for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am not a writer\nbecause I write. No. I write because I am a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAt the core of who I\nam there are emotions and thoughts. Those fill my brain with words. Sometimes\nthose words are in my own voice; sometimes they come with other voices. I have\nto get them out of me. I have to write them down. It\u2019s an imperative. I write\nbecause to not do so is to let my mind fill with words and voices and stories\nthat garble and babble and scream. I write because it is how I stave off the\nmadness of my own mind and its relentless attacks on itself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI write. I share\nthose words and voices and stories with other people out of a sincere desire to\nconnect, and I\u2019d like to be able to support my family with the earnings. I love\nreading reviews that tell me I\u0027ve connected with a reader. Moreover, I adore\ntalking to people who have read something I\u0027ve written and feel passionately\nabout it, for good or bad. All of these are things that matter to me, and I do\ncare about them\u2026but why do I write? I write because I am a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am a writer\u2026because\nof that, I write.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been publishing\nsince 2010 and have seventeen titles available (not counting newspapers and\nother rags I\u2019ve written for). I\u2019ve managed to keep myself and my family afloat\nby my writing income as well as working a day job (if I\u0027m honest, I was working\nthe overnight shift, but for the purposes of this little text box, we\u0027ll just\ncall it a day job, okay?) to support myself while doing so. Recently (Spring\n2017) I suffered a bit of a setback with my health, and I was left unable to\ncontinue with the day job, and so I\u0027ve found myself in a bit of a pinch. A big\none, really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, income from writing can vary from month to month.\nWildly. Peaks and valleys don\u2019t even begin to cover it, in fact. Will I make enough for\nmy house payment this month? I hope so, but who knows. If I end up back in the\nhospital will I lose my whole life? That\u2019s Possible. Will my next payday,\nwhenever it comes, be enough to buy coffee? Fingers crossed. The glamor of the\nwriter\u2019s lifestyle is most certainly what has led me here to Patreon with high\nhopes. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3bEHIzfEFWg/WjMXHC_WYgI/AAAAAAAADG0/I1cHUKsBVNE6adyKmyOCk8FRItWOjzhDACLcBGAs/s640/Where%2Bdoes%2Bthe%2Bmoney%2Bgo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eBy supporting this\nPatreon, you are supporting me and more importantly, to me, my work.
