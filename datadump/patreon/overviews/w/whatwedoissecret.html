You\u0027ll find that link as you read on. \u00a0Although a work of fiction, the story draws largely from my experiences growing up in an underground scene, struggles with losing so many close to me, my spontaneous nature that\u0027s landed me in some unspeakable places all over the globe and the ability to heal and actually grow \u00a0from the grey wash of such absurd depths. \u00a0I began working with a writing group and would now like to be able to finance private coaching with my mentor in order to streamline my publication goals. \u00a0That is what has brought me to Patreon. \u00a0That, and my love of Henry Miller, who was the first author I became intellectually attached to and who is very well known for having used Patrons to fund his endeavors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the suggestion of my writing mentor, I recently began a blog. \u00a0Here\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://whatwedoissecret.blog\"\u003eWhat We Do Is Secret\u003c/a\u003e you can familiarize yourself with my literary and photographic voices. \u00a0My candor isn\u0027t for everyone, but for those whom it is, the feedback I\u0027ve received regarding my readers\u0027 own insatiable needs to self liberate and their resolute endorsement of my vulnerability on the page have injected me with a hedonistic motivation to keep satisfying them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be honored and humbled to be a productive part of this community. \u00a0Having the freedom to commit to what I believe in and to continuously fuel the creative fire needed to deliver to you what I feel I Must (!) is an immeasurable gift for any artist! \u00a0I can\u0027t do it without you! \u00a0Will you please join me on my journey? I will be adding a \"rewards\" incentive soon! \u00a0I\u0027d like for it to be something that my patrons can genuinely enjoy, so with that, any suggestions are welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I plan to introduce my Patrons to the characters in my book as well as some in my own life. \u00a0I\u0027ll give you sneak looks at how the book is developing. I\u0027ll also share free-writes with you and anything else that will continue to let you know how much I value and thrive off of your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve projected a timeline for my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy January 1st (although I have been working on sections of the book for some time) I will have my working Outline done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy May 1st: Completion of First Draft\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeptember 1st: Final Edit\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDecember 1st: Actively search out an agent and publisher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e~beth\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "When I reach $5000 per month, myself and my dog will temporarily relocate to Upstate New York to complete the final draft of the novel. The novel takes place partially on each coast. \u00a0Its conclusion finds us in the East and \u00a0my goal is to bring an authenticity to my work that I can only do my immersing myself in its key environments. \u00a0When this goal begins to look more like a reality, I will find a worthy non profit similar to 826LA to donate my time and money to for the duration of my stay.",
