However, I do never force myself to be inspired. I will watch a movie, draw and wait until i \u00a0feel like I\u0027m ready to come back, when I\u0027m full of my ideas. All the strong inspirational female icons through time have been my muses, even until now I fill my walls with their photographs.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI also always try to surround myself with fresh flowers\u003c/strong\u003e because I believe it brings positive energy. Woman are naturally delicate and more sensitive, each kind of flower give me different expressions which I can connect with my photographs.\u003cbr\u003eI love to watch everything how from idea to finished photos becomes a one piece. .\u003cbr\u003eMy style and models I photograph are someone that I would like to represent myself. I have a strong belief that my work comes from me as a person rather than my gender. It\u0027s a \u003cstrong\u003econnection between feminine and sensuality\u003c/strong\u003e. Always meaning to have woman in my main focus. I\u2019m always interested in capturing a \u003cstrong\u003ewoman in charge of her own actions\u003c/strong\u003e and her own sexuality. She can be romantic and submissive or to show obvious dominance, it\u2019s always on her terms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I love the most \u003c/strong\u003eis\u00a0that I\u0027m one of not many people who is stubborn in belief that you can love your work. I can\u0027t imagine myself working in repetitive job where I can\u0027t bring my creative side to life. I will do my best to become the best possible me in photography.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/t41LVE1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy models are always treated with respect\u003c/strong\u003e. Before photoshoots I always try to talk with them about the brief, explain the whole idea, where are we going and what is the expected outcome. I usually prefer women who are not girls anymore; I believe that you need to live a little to be able to understand yourself truly and express it, act.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Am I here?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI can create art with almost no budget, develop a photography set with old curtains and flower\u0027s from neighbors. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve worked with natural light for my whole life, However I want\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eto introduce in my work more studio light where I can control it and\u003cstrong\u003e be independent\u003c/strong\u003e on weather and day time. It is also really hard to live when your income is unpredictable \u00a0- always. My goal is to earn for a best photography studio equipment and #goal1 light \u003cstrong\u003eProFoto D1 Monolight \u003c/strong\u003eto keep creating my work better and better for you!. \u003cbr\u003eIn \u003cstrong\u003eAustralia this equipment is very expensive\u003c/strong\u003e; working and studying makes achieving this goal on itself really hard so I hope you would love to help out and join me here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBECOME MY PATERON and receive more than enough of amazing stuff from inside of the industry.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy website\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"http://www.wmamot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.wmamot.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u003cstrong\u003enstagram\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/wmamot\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/wmamot\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/weronikamamot \" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/weronikamamot\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTumblr:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/sadflair\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.tumblr.com/sadflair\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"http://www.littleflair.deviantrt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.littleflair.deviantart.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePinterest:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/weronikamamot\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.pinterest.com/weronikamamot\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AGggzGt.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
