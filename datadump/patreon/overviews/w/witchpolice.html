It\u0027s a DIY labour of love, and since the show\u0027s inception, it has expanded to something we never would have expected, including live podcasts and performances at fantastic venues,\u00a0plus collaborations with other local content creators. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show will continue to grow and improve for the forseeable future, but that growth means our budget of $0 is starting to get a bit tight. Witchpolice Radio is free and always will be, but there are costs associated with producing the best show we can that are out of reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite the awesome work by a gang of co-hosts and contributors over the years, Witchpolice (both the podcast and the website, which dates back to 2009) is essentially a one-man band. That includes booking guests, setting up live shows, and doing promotional work... but it also means maintaining the website and the podcast feed, as well as purchasing any new equipment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Witchpolice brought in money -- even a tiny amount -- it would be huge in terms of improving audio quality, making sure any broken equipment can be easily replaced, and covering the cost of creating an updated,\u00a0professional website to house our extensive archive of content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been thinking about it, and if a small handful of people pledged their pocket change each month for a year, by the end of that year, I might be able to upgrade my recording equipment to a much newer and more powerful model AND pay for a website that doesn\u0027t crap out every couple of days. I\u0027m not asking for (or expecting) any kind of big money to be dropped here, but if any listeners (or fans of the music archive on the site) are willing to chip in some spare change now and then, the benefits could be huge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening!\u003cbr\u003e-Sam\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.witchpolice.com/p/links.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePress about Witchpolice\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9GornhwDIy4/V8brGylbB_I/AAAAAAAAFUE/3cQnnJnvA2A5o1OJDYQ3jKgkKUxchvO6QCLcB/s1600/14195940_10157331913390065_4548515470215456031_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

While it works very well for what it is, there have been a number of advances in the portable recorder field since I originally purchased it. Even something like the H4n model (the thing on the left) would be a step up. It has a built-in four track recorder, allows for external mics, etc. It\u0027s definitely a step in the right direction... especially for future live music recordings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m proud of some of the recordings I\u0027ve been able to capture with the H1, but occasionally I\u0027ll get feedback like \"it sounds like it was recorded on an answering machine\" (\u003cem\u003eactual \u003c/em\u003efeedback I received on social media!) and I get pretty discouraged. Upgrading the equipment would be huge, and would probably be a one-time\u00a0expense rather than an ongoing one.",
