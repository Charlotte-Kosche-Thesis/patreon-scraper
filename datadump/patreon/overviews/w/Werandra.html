Welcome to my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon I hope to obtain my life\u0027s goal of being able to solely rely on my various artistic endeavours (specifically modeling photos) as my main source of income. One day I even hope to get out in the world enough to live comfortably off of my passions, so I may take on bigger and more complicated ideas, as well as upgrading equipment to allow me to expand my artistic range.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe art is made to be shared, to bring thoughts, emotion, or inspiration to the viewer, and I certainly hope you like mine. I aspire to bring a bit of fantasy back into the world. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and have a nice day. Namaste!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eWerandra"
