    "summary": "I\u2019m an artist and creating art informed with realism is my\npassion. Science, science fiction, aerospace design, and a firm belief that\nhumanity has the capacity to dare great things on the road to an amazing\nfuture, are a few of the things which come together in my work. I have a lifelong\ninterest in manned spaceflight and space colonization, and I firmly believe\nthat mankind will, over the course of many hundreds of years, build a solar\nsystem spanning industrial technological civilization, and perhaps one day we\nwill reach for the stars. I believe these things are in our nature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI build 3D models, visualization of space colonies,\nplanetary settlements, in-space infrastructure such as propellant depots and manufacturing\nstations, as well as, what I am probably most well known for, spacecraft real and proposed, often based on\nNASA technical memoranda. I research and apply what I learn to recreations of proposed\nbut never flown concept spacecraft and to somewhat more evolved science\nfictional spacecraft of my own design, and to concepts put forward by authors\nof the science fiction I enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can view my gallery on deviantArt at \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://william-black.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eWilliam-Black\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy you should pledge.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI love SF, aerospace concept art, and I love creating art, and\nI\u2019d like to keep bringing you the very best art I can create. Research takes\ntime and money, maintaining my technology, the computer and software I use to\ncreate my art, and my premium membership on deviantArt, which allows my many\nsubfolder galleries, also costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eArtwork:\u003c/strong\u003e Full resolution and full size copies of the art I\ncreate, and permission to display my art* on your website, blog, or social media\npage so long as I am credited and a link is provided back to my deviantArt or\nmy Patreon page. *Non commercial use only, see my deviantArt page for my\ncommercial illustration rates. The artwork I produce includes both beautiful\nvisualizations and labeled diagrams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eUpdates:\u003c/strong\u003e regular reports on what I am creating,\nworks-in-progress images, my thoughts and notes on whatever project is\ncurrently in process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the near future I intend to foray into animations and\nopen a 3D model store where I will offer digital 3D models for sale, these will\ninclude everything from pieces and parts suitable for kit-bashing (propulsion\nsystems, spacecraft truss, landing gear, habitat or other specialized modules) to\nfull high detail spacecraft and these will be included as option in my patreon\nrewards."
