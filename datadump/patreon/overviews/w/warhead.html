It\u0027s a surrealistic slice of life with a bit more\nstirring below the surface which begs the question of whether or not\nall of the animal and object headed characters are figments in Adam\u0027s\nmind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read the comics here: warheadcomic.tumblr.com\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePresently the series updates with a\npage a week, and the page tally for the comic is presently clocking\nin at 100+ pages.

For me, this is important, and I\nwant to continue to provide this to readers as much as possible. I\nabsolutely understand finding a proverbial anchor, no matter the\nmedium, and it makes a world of difference to an\nindividual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to say that WARHEAD will continue to be free to read as it always is!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eFREELANCE LIFE\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs a freelancer I\u0027ve contributed\nto:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHeavy Metal Magazine:\u003c/strong\u003e #277,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKymera Press:\u003c/strong\u003e Pet\nNoir #1 (Cover Art)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSan Diego Comic Con Souvenir Book 2014:\u003c/strong\u003e\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Anniversary Illustration\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePacific\nArcana Tarot Deck Charity Project: \u003c/strong\u003eQueen of Pentacles Card;as\nwell as illustrating work for a number of other independent\npublishers like myself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe work has been interesting and\nwonderfully diverse, but I\u0027ve really been losing traction with\nkeeping steady WARHEAD updates, as providing for myself supersedes\nmaking my silly little object-head comic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027m hoping that one day I can\neventually support myself entirely through WARHEAD and the support on\nPatreon, I still intend to engage in freelance projects on a case by\ncase basis-- working on those that I truly feel passionate about, and\nhopefully even collaborate with close friends on projects we\u0027ve\nalways talked about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eSIDE PROJECTS, DATING SIMS, AND\nTHE FUTURE\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst and foremost\u003c/strong\u003e, is the ever\nanticipated \u003cstrong\u003eWARHEAD Dating Sim. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel there\u0027s almost more\nfervor for this to be completed than the comic itself!
