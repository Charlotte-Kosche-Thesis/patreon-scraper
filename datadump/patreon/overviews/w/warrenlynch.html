But I was so encouraged just by having a \u003cstrong\u003efew\u003c/strong\u003e people show their support, that I started having all these ideas about Goethe and Szukalski, and The Thing With No Face turned into a feature film in my mind!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first few of these small donations accomplish things like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-giving me more confidence\u003c/strong\u003e that there\u0027s a group of people I can babble about my crazy ideas to. You\u0027ll see more and more\u003cstrong\u003e text updates\u003c/strong\u003e on the Activity page, more frequent public videos, and cooler and cooler secret videos as the donation amounts go up!\u003cbr\u003e-making me feel artistically validated in a way that inspires me to create more and better scenes more easily! It\u0027s not the money at these small amounts, it\u0027s the faith! $1 of patreon support feels like $100 of \"you\u0027re a real artist\"!\u003cbr\u003e-partially justify doing these Scene Spy lists. Each one takes about 5 hours and I know it\u0027s a mitzvah, especially for those of my friends who are more lonely/bored/alienated/new in town. And so much amazing art is happening and I want to tell people about it. But it \u003cstrong\u003eis\u003c/strong\u003e work. I have a lot more fun making and editing more scenes than writing Scene Spies, but having supporters gives me a serious guilt trip to give back! And the scene needs spreading! Please do share the new Scene Spies when they come out, keep showing the faith and I\u0027ll keep TRYING to make one a month...\u003cbr\u003e-getting the first Dreamer Salon going! We\u0027ve got a venue now and some artists, I just need to pick a date and spring for some wine and cheese!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically the things I am doing for free to make this scene happen have \u003cstrong\u003ealready started\u003c/strong\u003e meagerly paying for themselves, in a token way at least. When we get to 50, it\u0027ll be \"official\"!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo celebrate reaching this milestone, I will put out an extra video, which will be NARRATED BY PONIES and POSTED HERE FOR FREE!\u003cbr\u003eAnd the first Dreamer Salon, the \"Christian Miller Happening\" will happen A MONTH FROM THEN! \u003cbr\u003e(update: The Christian Miller Happening is currently slated for October!
