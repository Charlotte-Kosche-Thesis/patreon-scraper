Long before I upload a video to Youtube, I was playing and reviewing video games as a hobby on Gamespot and enjoyed it immensely. Thanks to you, the amazing community that keeps me going from month to month, I can continue that hobby despite having to do things like \"work\" and \"be an adult.\" This has resulted in the creation of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.warcouncil.tv/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.warcouncil.tv\u003c/a\u003e and is now the home for my content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a way for me to connect with you guys more directly, and provide you some benefits in return for your amazing support. I can\u0027t offer you the world, but I can promise I\u0027ll provide you with the best game reviews I\u0027m capable of. Thankfully many of you believe I\u0027m not half bad at it, which is admittedly a pretty big incentive to continue writing as it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t thank you enough for your support whether you\u0027ve been with me for years or just starting now.
