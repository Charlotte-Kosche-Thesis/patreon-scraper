My channel has been around a couple years now and has gone through many changes since I first started on youtube. I started my channel reviewing and reading Erotica, gradually I started dipping my toe into doing live streams and developing a show called Shitlords Anonymous which has gone on to become its own channel. Since then I\u0027ve moved away from making more traditional video content and started a podcast with my husband and co-host Igor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts been a wild ride these last couple years and I hope you will join me going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps keep the lights on and helps me continue to run Wrenilations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink to my twitch page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/wrenilations\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/wrenilations\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink to my Youtube Page: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUinhHaOLh-yxfU-HYkKSZg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/general-to-new-7114353\"\u003eGeneral to new Patrons as you show.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have my account set to per video donation, please be mindful and set an upper limit to what your willing to donate per video and how much of a cap for total donations.
