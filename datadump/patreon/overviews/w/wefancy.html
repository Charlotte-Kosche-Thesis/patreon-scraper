By supporting us on Patreon for any amount you can comfortably spare, you\u0027re one very special person with a huge heart and we couldn\u0027t be more grateful. YouTube is tough for most creators (apart from the real big channels), and with the adpocolypse and ever increasing hardest standards to reach to keep videos monetizable, a lot of YouTubers have turned to their audience for financial support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as you\u0027re reading this, you\u0027re considering helping us out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a bunch of different tiers on the right, pick one you\u0027d like to start with. You can change them month to month, or give just a one time donation by cancelling after the first month. Which ever you choose, just the fact you\u0027ve spared even a dollar one time is something we won\u0027t forget. That\u0027s like 1,000 views on average video in a simple donation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating \u0026amp; supporting us - we\u0027ll promise to keep making the same high quality content we\u0027ve been making for a while now, and we\u0027ll keep looking for ways to be more informative, more entertaining, and show more of Korea so if you decide to come, you\u0027ve had the best knowledge available to you to make sure your visit is an amazing one!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so so much,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe Fancy\u003cbr\u003exoxo"
