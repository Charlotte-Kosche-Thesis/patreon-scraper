I know, kind of an odd greeting, but if it was good enough for Dracula, why not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI go by Bill, and yes that\u2019s me in my internet disguise.  I\u2019ve always loved art, from the classics to contemporary artists like Boris Vallejo, Julie Bell, Luis Royo, and many more.  I\u2019m even a fan of several contemporary CGI artists.  As for my hand drawn artistic talents, I have none.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why I was so excited when I learned about Daz Studio in 2011, thus embarking on my CGI artistic endeavor strictly as a hobby.  To be honest, I wanted to draw the Marvel and DC female characters I thought should be in a superheroine team.  Since then, I\u2019ve gone from just imitating what others have done or using predesigned characters to creating my own characters based on real people.  Of course, that also meant I had to create a Who\u2019s Who of the superheroine team I created.  While I love showing off their powers, I also use them in my everyday art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite how good I think my work is today compared to the first piece I did in 2011, I\u2019m not content.  I want my work to get better, to be as good as or better than the CGI artists I admire.  I decided to create my page on Patreon to offer various dimensions of the art I try to sell on Deviantart for one low price. \u00a0It\u0027s not about how much I can make from one person, but how many people will want to have my art for their own purposes. \u00a0 Depending on many factors, I\u0027ve got lots of plans. At the moment, I have a page on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/wow-creations?asc=u\"\u003eRedbubble\u003c/a\u003e, where my images can be placed in a picture, a clock, or even a t-shirt.\u00a0 I also have plans on making a graphic novel, while including CGI images of specific characters in an actual novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEither way, the adventure I\u2019m on will always be exciting, no matter how things turn out on Patreon.  If you accompany me in my adventure, I hope you\u2019ll find it as exciting as I will.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eAs a Patron, $1 a month will do my best to give you two images a week.\u00a0 Most of the images will offer you a JPG that is 7632x6480, perfect to use in whatever format or personal use you desire.\u00a0 However, for those who don\u0027t want to go through the process of altering an image to do a printout or even get an image for a t-shirt, there is an alternative.\u00a0 You can go to\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/wow-creations?asc=u\"\u003eRedbubble\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e, where you can get such things and more.\u00a0 Other images available will provide you JPG\u0027s\u00a0that can be printed on an 8.5x11 (Portrait or Landscape), 8x12 (Poster), and a 3840x2160 wallpaper for your computer.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
