    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eHello friends! Thank\u0027s so much for making it to our Patreon page. Let\u0027s talk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever wondered: \"Do other dinosaurs pee uncontrollably when you startle them like mine does?\" Of course you have. Do you ever think: \"I wish I could train my dinosaur to do something other than rearranging refrigerator magnets and eating shower soap\"? You know you do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the deal. We have a unique and mutually beneficial opportunity. You have questions about dinosaurs, I have a dinosaur and a camera. My co-worker had a dinosaur named Bradley and, not knowing any better, he kept Bradley in a closed cardboard box in the basement. My co-worker forgot about Bradley for 9 days until he went into the basement to look for a pi\u00f1ata he had stowed previously. I guess what I\u0027m trying to say is, what you don\u0027t know, much like an asteroid, can kill a dinosaur. This web series will attempt to educate you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many things we\u0027d like to do with this series; so many stories we\u0027d like to tell, characters we\u0027d like to explore, locations we\u0027d like to visit, home repairs we\u0027d like to make to our electrical outlets.\u00a0We\u0027d love to push the quality of our videos higher. We\u0027d like to have:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eLonger episodes - There\u0027s only so much content you can fit into a time slot shorter than a Cialis commercial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMore dynamic cinematography and better sound - We\u0027re using pre-moon landing technology here and it would be awesome if we could shoot on a camera that captured sound AND video together. It just slows things down. Which brings me to my next point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eFaster release dates - Do you think we WANT to only release one video every 8 months? NO! If I had my way we\u0027d be releasing one a week! But more realistically one a month. These videos are fiendishly difficult to bring to the screen what with the shooting regulations and permits required to film dinosaurs these days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBetter editing - The last video was edited by printing all the video frames out on paper, giving them to a family of alpine goats. The finished video was assembled from whatever parts they didn\u0027t eat or poop on. An editor I know thinks he can do better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMore handsome dinosaurs - You may have noticed the dinosaur in the second episode looks different from the one in the first episode. Well, the dinosaur in the first episode bit someone  and had to be let go. The wrangler would like to work things out but he was a short, hairy Australian man who screams a lot so we have his number blocked. We got another dinosaur actor but he\u0027s...to put it bluntly, he\u0027s just ugly. And he smells like an old birdcage. We\u0027d love to find one who is more aesthetically appealing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThis series has been quite well received. We have gotten such accolades as: \"I laughed more at Schindler\u0027s List\" and \"This is just an advertisement for cereal.\" and \"I challenge everyone to try to find a more retarded video on YouTube\". Clearly we\u0027ve found our audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve shot five more episodes and hopefully they are on their way to youtube, but they are prohibitively expensive to produce without some kind of funding. We have 20,000+ subscribers and we have received 2.25+ million views on youtube and an additional 25 million views from sites on facebook that posted the video and slapped their own logo on it. If 1% of 1% of these viewers (0.01% for all you\u00a0intellectuals\u00a0out there) offer $1 for each new video we create we\u0027d be able to keep making videos and\u00a0pushing the quality higher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome on, who doesn\u0027t want to see more dinosaurs in videos? We certainly do. We want to produce the most amazing videos possible for the most amazing fans in the world. Please consider joining as a patron so that you can join us on this special journey. Please note, due to the intensive nature of the work involved we will most likely only release one patron supported videos/month. You can set your monthly max so you never go over your monthly budget! For your support, we are offering some pretty neat rewards below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for watching!\u003cbr\u003eEvan E. Richards\u003c/span\u003e"
