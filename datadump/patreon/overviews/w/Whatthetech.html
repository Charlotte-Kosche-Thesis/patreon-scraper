We are striving to limit the amount of advertisers we put on each podcast. Our goal is to finally offer ad free live streaming, and only put one opening ad on What the Tech (most likely Audible, since the viewers love Paul\u0027s Audible picks...). We know you guys are sick of the mid roll ads that many of our distributors place on the live stream, and so are we! In order to realize our dreams, we need your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are asking for \u003cstrong\u003e$1 a show,\u003c/strong\u003e there are 4 shows a month, bringing your \u003cstrong\u003emonthly total to a $4\u003c/strong\u003e. That\u2019s it! That little! That simple! I truely cannot think of anything I could buy for $1, that would be worth more then supporting my favorite show and doing my part to get rid of pesky ads. Every little bit helps and gets us closer to our goal of bringing you high quality ad free broadcasting. That being said, a lot o\u2019 bit helps even more! Feel free to donate as much as you would like, and help get us to our goal even quicker! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
