While a good subclass can be generated from scratch in about 2-3 days, the longer projects we\u0027re so fond of take much more time to create. Our Strongholds and Merchants projects both took around 2 months each, though they likely could have been completed in 2 weeks each, if the time was available.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to make bigger and better projects, things that more drastically push the limits of how D\u0026amp;D can be played. We\u0027d like to generate rules for Level 0 characters, for example, as well as more detailed rules for ships and entire core classes. As of now, these large projects require us to pause all our efforts on the smaller homebrew we make, sometimes for months. Ideally, we\u0027d like to be able to continue creating both our large and small projects at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinally, who do we want to show some love for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best community on the internet! The online D\u0026amp;D community, across its many platforms, has been endlessly supportive with helping us create and edit homebrew content. We\u0027d have never got our start, were it not for the community being so generous, friendly, and helpful. This in mind, we always try to give back, from offering helpful critique to providing resources to creating professional templates for other community members to use in their own homebrew projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, of course,\u00a0a very hearty thanks to all who have donated, on Patreon, PayPal, and even the DM\u0027s Guild! Every little bit you give helps us provide \n\u003cem\u003eeveryone\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0with quality homebrew, and allows us to keep contributing to the community we all love so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
