Every dollar we get through Patreon will help us bring you all even more content than ever before. \u00a0Here are some of the additional projects this Patreon would help us create:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSingled Out Episodes\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile it may seem like we\u0027ve watched every movie out there, occasionally we find gaps in our movie viewing history. \u00a0We\u0027d love to record episodes where one of us has to explain a movie to the other two that they haven\u0027t seen and get their fresh impressions of the film once they all watch it together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Saw Episodes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve already done a few What We Saw episodes for films like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/whatweremember/03-what-we-saw-rings-spoilers\"\u003eRings\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/whatweremember/what-we-saw-independence-day-resurgence-spoiler\"\u003eIndependence Day: Resurgence\u003c/a\u003e but we\u0027d love to do more. \u00a0With the ever increasing number of reboots coming out of Hollywood these days it\u0027s the perfect time to go to the theater and judge them against the originals. \u00a0Your support would help offset the costs of going to see new movies in theaters and allow us to make more of these episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMovie Commentary\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLast Christmas we released a movie commentary track Rifftrax-style on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://whatweremember.bandcamp.com/releases\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e page for that wonderful Christmas film\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://whatweremember.bandcamp.com/track/die-hard-commentary-track\"\u003eDie Hard\u003c/a\u003e.
