Over the years, I\u0027ve had my work posted on various sites including Gay Spiral Stories, Choose Your Own Change, the Erotic Mind Control Story Archive, FurAffinity and my personal tumblr. All of my stories, thus far, have been written while attending college or working full time jobs, and I have found that I am unable to find the time to tackle more substantial writing projects which I want to produce for you all to read, including short story collections and longer works like my rewrite of the \"City of Bears\" series. If you would like to see this content as much as I would like to write it, then I ask that you help me with your monthly pledge. Even a small amount each month would help me free up time to spend getting these stories to all of you sooner."
