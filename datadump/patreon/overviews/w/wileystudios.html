I very much enjoyed doing them and based on close to 3,000 subscribers and over two million views it also looks like people enjoyed them too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last seven years I did not have the time to do any more but after going through health issues and then selling my business (how I actually supported my family) I now have the time to fill this calling. The reason I am asking people to financially contribute to my videos is I plan on improving my ability to make state of the art videos using original content, better software and also high quality music. This all costs money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy reward to you in making this contribution is making you a part of the process. You can be a Supporter and get a chance to give me your input on what the next video subject should be, being a Producer and have your name in the credits of the video or the Executive Producer with your name at the beginning of the video and in the credits listed as the Executive Producer. There will be only one Executive Producer per video."
