    "summary": "The Wizards of Drivel is an independent weekly podcast looking at all things Stoke City. Founded in May 2016, the podcast has gone from strength to strength, reaching Stokies from all around the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe core presenting panel is David Cowlishaw, Ben Cartwright and Chris Brammer but there are other regular contributors, as well as special one-off guests \u2013 Stokie and non-Stokie alike!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast is something we love doing. We try not to take it too seriously \u2013 we\u2019re not in it for huge listening figures, advertising money or to be controversial, we\u2019re just Stokies talking about the club we love. We hope you enjoy it too. We\u2019re not \u2018the voice\u2019 of Stoke fans, our opinions are ours and ours alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re available to listen to for free on iTunes, Soundcloud, Acast and Stitcher. Get in touch with us by social media and email and we promise to get back to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhy are we on Patreon then?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePodcasting is not a good way to make money, especially if your podcast caters to a limited demographic. Maybe when Stoke are in the Champions League we\u0027ll be rolling in ad money but for the moment we want to continue doing the show without losing money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s something we love doing and want to continue to do, but the way it\u0027s going the show may become unsustainable - the three of us don\u0027t have a lot of disposable income to throw at the pod.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, The Wizards of Drivel feels like an inclusive, \u0027community\u0027 show in which the listeners are every much a part of the podcast as the presenters. We listen to your feedback, read your emails and it honestly wouldn\u0027t be the same show without our listeners\u0027 contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney donated will go on our Soundcloud subscription first and foremost - so we can continue to release it for free. From then, any additional money will be used to improve the quality of the show. From getting better mics, editing software etc. to train tickets so we can meet up for studio shows or interview people of interest to Stokies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI can\u0027t afford/don\u0027t want to donate but still want to listen!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you. We appreciate that not everyone can part with money all the time, so for non-patrons nothing will change. You\u0027ll still get your weekly shows straight to your Soundcloud/App/iTunes for free and we won\u0027t think any less of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI still have some doubts about this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFair enough.

Having listened to a lot of football podcasts between us, it\u2019s safe to say that the guys at WoD have created a professional quality podcast which they\u2019ve matched with really insightful punditry and a love for the Potters. In a world that is become filled with the chaff of mediatised content production, the guys at WoD should be proud of what they have achieved.\u201d \u2013 \u003cstrong\u003eJon Mackenzie, The Team of John O\u2019Shea\u2019s Project\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cThe Wizards of Drivel are knowledgeable and opinionated and their shows are laced with self-deprication.
