Whenever time allows, I answer questions about writing and gaming, tell creepy stories, and stream fantasy \u0026amp; horror video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m pretty critical of whatever I\u0027m working on\u2014writing, game making, streaming. That means most of my ventures take considerable time and planning. I\u0027m not really into doing anything half-baked. On the whole, I\u0027d like to devote more time to passion projects like personal fiction, showing off awesome games, and answering more of your gaming questions, but those ventures have to compete with my work and freelance schedules.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s where you come in! With your generosity I\u0027ll devote more resources to streaming,\u00a0giving gaming/design advice, and more\u2014like collecting my scattered gaming digressions (blog articles, interviews, Tumblr posts, etc) into useful content. In the short term, that means more of my writing online, better quality streams and videos, Ask Me Anything events, answering more RPG related queries, and gauging interest in more substantial schemes. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith enough support, I\u0027d love to merge my design advice and streaming, creating instructional videos for crafting game content. I\u0027m also designing new worlds for gaming and fiction projects, plotting various other streaming projects, mulling over min-game projects, and who knows what else? The sky\u0027s the limit, but if you help me get there, then of course I\u0027ll be designing things you\u0027ve always wanted to see!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo let\u0027s get started! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlready have thoughts on what you\u0027d like to see me working on? \n\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rkqE4L3TIqQRMCgZ4VHpnDSNAuRvE1a2S5hlToWlnh0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClick here to take my poll regarding your stream/design preferences\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks a ton for reading and\u2014even more\u2014for spreading the word!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://wesschneider.com/images/banners/W-Bar.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eLearn more about my work at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wesschneider.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWesSchneider.com\u003c/a\u003e, or visit me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMAFY0UeTw-Zu8M1QHuUP_Q\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/wesschneider\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wesschneider.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/FWesSchneider\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
