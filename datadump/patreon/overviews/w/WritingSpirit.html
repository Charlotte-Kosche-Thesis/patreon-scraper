    "summary": "Hey there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWritingSpirit here! You might know me as one of the many people who write stories on FimFiction.net. If not, then hi! I write stories featuring magical talking horses!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing my first story,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/30033/of-laurels-lace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOf Laurels \u0026amp; Lace\u003c/a\u003e back in 2012. It started out as a small hobby where I spend my time working many ideas into the story, all while taking some time writing smaller tales along the side. Now, it\u0027s the middle of 2016. \u003cem\u003eOf Laurels \u0026amp; Lace\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0has long since been completed, but I found out that I still have so many ideas bursting in my head and so many stories to tell!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m working on a couple of stories, some of my most prominent ones being:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/94986/diprosopus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiprosopus\u003c/a\u003e, the sequel to \u003cem\u003eOf Laurels \u0026amp; Lace\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0which features the Mane Six embroiled in a conspiracy involving the return of an ancient enemy.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/94756/perhaps-death\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePerhaps Death\u003c/a\u003e, a crossover with Doctor Who that stars the Doctor trapped in a prison with all of his memories missing with only the help of his journal to figure out how he got there.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/284844/lovely-days\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLovely Days\u003c/a\u003e which features Lyra Heartstrings as she slowly discovers that the Equestria she lives in is not what it seems, and\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/296156/worlds\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorlds\u003c/a\u003e, \u003c/em\u003ewhich stars Sweetie Belle journeying across a strange, new world with an unlikely band of companions as she seeks help to get home from the All-Fairest Queen.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fimfiction.net/story/342642/feyspeak\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFeyspeak\u003c/a\u003e, featuring a magician who meets a filly in a desolate new world.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from those, I\u0027ve also worked on other short stories and one-shots, all of which can be found on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/user/WritingSpirit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003euser page\u003c/a\u003e on Fimfiction itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of a writer am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI write to discover new things, whether it be about myself or anything else. I write to tell lesser-told stories, to push the boundaries that I\u0027m given. I write to challenge not only myself, but the reader as well, to push the limits that the both of us can go to. I write not only to entertain, but to question and polarize.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the process, I\u0027m also a progressive writer. By that, I mean that as the times change, the scenes and ideas taking place in any future, unpublished chapters may also do the same, albeit to the context and themes of the story, of course! This process\u00a0\u2014 which I dub the Changeling Effect\u00a0\u2014 has happened to each and every one of my stories, with the exception of my one-shots. You can call that a trademark of my writing process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, as you might\u0027ve noticed, all of my stories (and their respective prequels / sequels) mostly differ from the other stuff I\u0027d write, from its themes to its audience. That\u0027s the result of me challenging myself to write more and, in turn, encouraging my readers to expose themselves to different kinds of stories as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get from all this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the lowest? You\u0027ll get an honorable mention on my user page and a hug.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt best?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledged a little bit more than that (and I do mean a \u003cem\u003elittle bit\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0more), you\u0027ll have access to a Patreon-only Skype group, where you can see me making jokes, cursing at reality, suggesting music and movies, even commenting on story ideas and giving tips to improve and such.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, if you spare a little more than that\u00a0\u2014 at varying degrees\u00a0\u2014 you\u0027ll have the power to request stories from me, have me review any of your work (be it pony-related or not) and even collaborate on a story with me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you\u0027re a fan of some of my work, you\u0027d know by now how inconsistent I can be when publishing the latest chapters of my stories. Sadly, even a soulless writer like me needs a steady income to lead his life. Once that peg is nailed down, I\u0027ll certainly be able to focus more on writing, especially with the extra comfort of not worrying about almost everything else that reality can take out on me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFew more things to say...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDepending on how things turn out down the road, I may find myself venturing into other things. That doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ll stop working on pony stories, especially when I\u0027ll come to know that this was the place where I first started out in the first place. It may affect any schedules I may have, but that\u0027s about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support, no matter how small it may be, would be immensely appreciated! Even if you pitched in a dollar, that\u0027s enough to make me happy! Remember, only become a patron if you really, really, \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e want to! Pledge support only if you can afford it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, thank you for taking six minutes off your lifetime to read this\u2014 that alone already brings a smile to my face!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a great day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWritingSpirit\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
