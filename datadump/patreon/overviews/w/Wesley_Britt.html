    "summary": "Things have changed a lot for me since I first made this account. I\u0027ve learned a lot too. My patrons have saved me over and over. Without them, I don\u0027t know where I\u0027d be. Thank you. More than I can say, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I\u0027m offering is the work. Nothing more, nothing less.\u00a0I\u0027m on this website because someone very kind wished to support me and asked me to come here to make it possible. I owe her forever. She\u0027s profoundly changed my life for the better and we\u0027ve never even met.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the first incarnation of this page, I was trying really hard to appear to be what all the blogs about how to be successful said I should be. But that\u0027s not who I am, and I couldn\u0027t keep up with it. I can\u0027t create on a schedule. I create when something triggers a desperate desire in me, a fireball of feeling, and creating ceases to be an option and becomes a compulsion. What I do and when I do it is unpredictable for both of us, and I\u0027m okay with that. Luckily, that fireball of feeling occurs pretty often for me. However...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point in my life I have been diagnosed with a chronic illness that is neither deadly nor degenerative. Yet it is debilitating and demanding. It\u0027s been going on for two years now, and it\u0027s still hard to admit or talk about. But it\u0027s been an incredible teacher, and I feel that staying in the closet, so to speak, helps no one. We can only create with the tools that we have, and if there is any wisdom to be gained from this I think it\u0027s worth putting into the world in the hopes that it may inspire even one person. Maybe even you. Or maybe it will be nothing but an echo chamber I can use to reflect on how young and dumb I used to be. :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I give my work with an open hand.\u00a0There\u0027s no obligation here. Not to join or to stay if you do. If my work has deeply affected you and you feel that adding your support is something you can do without hurting your living situation, then words cannot express the warm fuzzies you\u0027ll give me when I see that number go up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being here, for reading these words, and for your consideration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Wesley Britt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://art-full-dodger.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://art-full-dodger.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSoundcloud:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://m.soundcloud.com/amalgamystic\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/amalgamystic\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
