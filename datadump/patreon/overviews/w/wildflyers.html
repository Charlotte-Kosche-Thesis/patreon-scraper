    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e for finding us\nand supporting our activities. We have been hard at work here in Connecticut\nattempting to find places that the Remote Control (R/C) hobby is welcome,\nlegal, fun and free. Our club started in 2016 with just a few and that has\nquickly expanded. We\u0027ve gone from just these few who share the same\ninterest, to a full club of 140+ members that just keeps growing. Most recently\nwe\u2019ve added a weekly podcast, \u0027Wild Flyers Podcast\u0027.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe pride ourselves as being \u003cstrong\u003eFREE \u003c/strong\u003efor all! Unfortunately, as we\u0027ve been\nexpanding, costs have been showing their ugly head. This is\nwhere Patreon comes into play. Just being here means you have a\nsimilar interest. Your selection can really help our club out\ntremendously. In order to maintain full transparency, here is a quick breakdown\nof our current costs. This also is including some estimates based on 2017\nexpenses. For more details, keep reading below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHome Flying Field AMA coverage = $120/year\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFlying Field upkeep = Unknown for 2018\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLiveTime Timing subscription = $120/year\n(starting spring 2018)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePodcast hosting fees = $180/year\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePer Event AMA coverage (4x sched. for 2018\nso far) = $100\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e-------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\nTotals (not including equipment upkeep) = $520/year\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u2019s try to break down that larger number to make smaller. We would only\ncurrently need the support of 44 of you. If each person was to donate just $1 month,\nfor the next 12 months, we\u2019d meet these required costs. That\u2019s just messily\npocket change of \u003cstrong\u003e$12/year per person!\u003c/strong\u003e While others have been\ncharging upwards of $20 per race, we don\u2019t and won\u0027t! You could just show up,\nsetup, fly and have fun. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFurther break down(s):\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt just our current flying field at Wild Bills Nostalgia in Middletown, CT, our\ncosts for us are $120/year! This only covers the field insurance via the\nAcademy of Model Aeronautics (AMA). Being located on a private business\nproperty, this year will be seeing a rise in cost in order to continue there.\nIn the beginning of 2017, we were lucky enough to reach a deal which allowed\nfor free use. However, since that time the site/business owner has passed away\nand times are changing. Being that it\u0027s farm land, they will now need to show\n\u0027profits\u0027 on the books for 2018 and going forward. We have yet to reach an\nagreement for 2018, but rest assured we are doing our best to reduce that\namount as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are also currently Tier 2 within MultiGP which has helped us by providing\nmaterials like gates (5x) and flags (5x, not yet arrived). However, in\norder to receive these, you need to also show progress. It starts as\nProvisional, which simply means getting organized, then moves on up the Tiered\nsystem staring at Tier 3 (gates prize) through Tier 2 (Flags) to finish at Tier\n1. All though they provide the materials, there is hardware that is\nrequired to maintain them (PVC, replacement fabrics, tie downs, etc.). The\npositive side is we are now able to hold Universal Time Trials (UTT) and\nregional qualifiers, but requires a timing system. We have built one\nwith mostly community donated components back in mid 2017. Most recently, it\nhas been undergoing various upgrades. It is changing from just being an\nannouncer of laps and times, to be based on the open source of Delta5. In\nturn, it now makes use of a WiFi router, Pi (Asus Tinker Board)\nand LiveTime web service. The LiveTime subscription adds additional\ncosts of another $10/month (120/year) but with that, it fully syncs\nwith MuliGPs website. This allows for fully recordable and\naccurate timing, lap counts, live video (optional) and complete race history.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow let\u2019s move on to our Wild Flyers Podcast details. It has also grabbed\nthe attention of some really big key players in the hobby. We\u0027ve been able to\nhave guests on such as Joshua Bardwell (Mr. Know-it-All), Cheng Lin\n(CL-Racing), Shawn Shepard (Defiant Wings), Shawn O\u0027Sullivan (MultiGP) and Sean\nCrosby (Crown City FPV) just to name a few. This weekly podcast covers not only\nFPV, but everything R/C and \u0027Nothing is of limits\u0027. To maintain our current\npace of recording and hosting, we have fees that are $15/month\n($180/year).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are also working with various schools and educators in helping\nthem bring the hobby up close and in person to students. As\nan example, we are working together with a program called\n\"Drone Drive for Education\". That program, combined with our\nmembers, take donated used, unused or unwanted gear an than is used\nwithin a classroom environment. These items are not used to\ninstruct how they work, but also how to build. These types of\nevents require a special insurance that is then provided by the\nAMA. The cost to do this is $25 per individual event and allows us\ncoverage of up to $2.5 million dollars.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoal and Promise:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur main goal is to continue to stay as free to all as possible. What we\nare attempting to do here is just help cover these yearly costs. Any extra\nraised beyond those goals will go directly back to our club and community. If\nany additional funding above what is necessary to cover costs is received, they\nwould be going to help cover any future race event fees, prizes, giveaways,\ndisaster donations, community outreaches/teaching and any other items that we\ncan\u0027t yet think of. The point is, we are attempting to grow the hobby, not hurt\nit, at all costs. Safety is always a top concern.\u003c/p\u003e"
