    "summary": "My passion has always been the history of Second World War. Like many people I grew up with stories of the war told by those who were there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy father was called up in 1944, he joined the RASC, and I had two uncles in the RAF (one on \u003cem\u003eLancaster Bombers\u003c/em\u003e and the other on \u003cem\u003eSunderland Flying boats\u003c/em\u003e). Many of my parents friends had served in various roles, from crucial war service such as \"Bevin Boy\" to Radar operators in the Navy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the \u003cem\u003eWW2 Podcast\u003c/em\u003e each episode I interview an expert on a subject. No topics are out of bounds (as yet), and I cover the military history side of the war as well as looking the home front. Hopefully the format allows for close examination of a topic, and makes for absorbing listen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the podcasts why not become a patron? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me each month via Patreon you will help cover the shows costs, and there are more costs that you might think! To try to ensure good quality audio I send out USB headsets for guests if they need them, I use Adobe Creative Cloud (thats \u00a345 pcm), there is hosting and books for research. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all very quickly adds up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, it is very much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003eAngus\u003cbr\u003e"
