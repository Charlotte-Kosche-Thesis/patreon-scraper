I\u0027m creating Wipefest so that players everywhere can view concise fight summaries showing exactly what is going on in raids. Whether you want to find out why your guild is wiping, work out when the best time to use your cooldowns are, or research the best strategy for defeating a boss, Wipefest can help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSince I announced Wipefest, the response has been overwhelming. It makes me really happy to see so many people using the tool and finding it helpful. I\u0027ve spent hundreds of hours developing Wipefest, and I\u0027d love to spend hundreds more, but I want to make sure that I\u0027m delivering in the right direction. I\u0027ve gotten a huge amount of feedback about what to improve and where to go next, and Patreon will give us a platform to channel and refine that feedback into exactly what we want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere are some of the features that I would love to bring to Wipefest:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlayer Overviews\u003c/strong\u003e: Select a player from the raid and view the fight from their perspective, including the usage of their major cooldowns and abilities.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInsight Comparisons: \u003c/strong\u003eWipefest already shows you Insights and Tips for a pull, but how great would it be if it also told you the average values of those Insights for similar guilds? Pulls are rarely perfect, but how perfect do you need to be, on average, to defeat a certain encounter?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuild Insights:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s all well and good knowing how you performed on one pull, but what about across many pulls over time? How have you improved on a particular boss over the last 2 weeks? Who\u0027s name keeps popping up in certain Insights?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSide-by-side\u003c/strong\u003e: Compare two fights on the same page, such as a kill and an almost-kill, to see what could be done differently.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBoss Dissections\u003c/strong\u003e: Articles that dissect top guilds boss kill\u0027s using Wipefest, understanding how they managed to defeat the encounter, and demonstrating ways in which Wipefest can be used to work out what\u0027s going on.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to get involved in the development of these features and more?
