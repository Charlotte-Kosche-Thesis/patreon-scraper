    "summary": "Recently, I was asked to perform a number of works that were prevalent in Abraham Lincoln\u0027s life. During my research I was surprised by two things: 1) Most early war music has not been recorded with string instruments. 2) Many of the songs on file at the Library of Congress have no accessible recordings available in any form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always wanted to give something back to the music community. I believe my extensive background in guitar will allow me to recreate these songs with a fresh perspective while maintaining historical accuracy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be performing pieces that were inspired by war focusing primarily on the Revolutionary war, Civil war, World War I, and World War II.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy focus will be primarily on classical guitar. However, I would love to explore the possibilities of occasionally bringing in some friends for violin, piano, drums, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for supporting me and this worthwhile project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eAre you new to Patreon? Pledging is easy! Just set up an account and click \"Become A Patron\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on posting new material twice (2x) a month. If you pledge $5 per song, expect an average of $10 per month in pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also set a maximum monthly amount. For example: You could pledge $10 per song with a $20 maximum. If I post three times in any month, you will only be charged for the first two. It\u0027s completely up to you! :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can cancel at any time, but I hope you find value in listening to my new projects!"

     "description": "At this level, I will be pursuing the purchasing of more authentic instruments for each war\u0027s time period. While classical guitar has been around for all of these wars, the cittern (similar to a lute) was prevalent pre-1790. Steel strings were just starting to circulate at the time of the Civil War, so a classical guitar is best suited for this time period. Small bodies 000 steel string guitars were popular during WWI. while dreadnought guitars were popular during WWII. That\u0027s just guitars! Major changes happened throughout these periods to pianos, snare drums, and general instrumentation. I would love to explore each period with the most appropriate musicals tools possible.",
