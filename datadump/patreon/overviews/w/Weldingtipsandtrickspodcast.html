It\u0027s not the best idea to watch a video or read a blog post while at work and definitely not while driving, but with a podcast you can hit play, drop your hood and enjoy. Jody Collier, Jonathan Lewis, and Roy Crumrine, have very different background in the welding field but all have the \"all In\" mentality when it comes to all things welding. \u00a0We hope to inspire weldors new and old with our tips and tricks while we share our knowledge and stories from our pasts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support we will be able to cover all the costs associated in making this podcast available to you so that we can continue to publish a new podcast every week. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you from all of us at Welding Tips and Tricks Podcast\u003cbr\u003eJody, Jonathan, and Roy"
