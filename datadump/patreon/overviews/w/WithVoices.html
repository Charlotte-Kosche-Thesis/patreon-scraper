I specialize in video editing and\nvoice acting and I do a little animation as well. \u00a0Taking my cue from both Let\u0027s Players and Abridged Series, I\u0027ve started some independent productions, and am hoping to give you something fun, funny, and thoroughly enjoyable. \u00a0Namely the\n\"with Voices\" series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve found a love for the RPGMaker games after my first time watching a Let\u0027s Play of Mogeko Castle. \u00a0From there, I decided it needed voices, and thus the \"with Voices\" series began, starting with Mogeko Castle with Voices. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Concept is simple: I take an RPGMaker game,\nsomething small and simple, but most importantly unvoiced, record myself playing the game, then add voices to\nit. \u00a0And when we add voices, we do more than read off the game\u0027s script...so much more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s Part Walkthrough, Part Drama and Part Parody.  A little of\neverything rolled up into one production in other words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving finished Mogeko Castle\nwith Voices, I plan to move on and give the \"With Voices\" treatment to other RPGMaker games.\n From there....who knows where it will go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I can only do so much on my own.  With\nyour help I can continue making this wonderful series, and even expand beyond the\nhorizons of the unforeseeable. \u00a0All with your generous help. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheWithVoicesProject\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTropes can be found here!\u003c/a\u003e"
