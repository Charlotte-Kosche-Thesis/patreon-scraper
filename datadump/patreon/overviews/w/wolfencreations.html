Due to this juggle,\u00a0comics such as \"Ordinary Werewolf Adventures\" have fallen to the side since I can\u0027t justify dedicating time to them. So I want to change that, with your help I can continue to work on the comic strips of \"Ordinary Werewolf Adventures!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent will no longer be \u0027patron only\u0027 or early access to full strips, they\u0027re free to the public, but patrons get more! You will be able to see the process, works in progress, workplace photos, everything that goes into making these comics work!

It started from one strip and developed into a whole slew of ideas for these characters. Most of these strips are short, 1-4 panels of content, and often filled with a punch-line. Think of it as a blip in the newspaper, quick and to the point with some wit thrown in here and there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis particular strip revolves around a number of werewolves living day-to-day life. Well, as day-to-day as a giant man-eating wolf-man monster can be. Discover what at-the-carcass conversations occur between werewolves, or how they may deal with werewolf hecklers on the streets. The complications of lycanthropes allergies to silver, or their strange aversion to mistletoe?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis comic is released once a month, and while they may not be released every full moon, they are often representative of that moon\u0027s adventures!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of that and more in this in-depth look into the regular life of a werewolf in \u003cem\u003e\"Ordinary Werewolf Adventures!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron, you are agreeing to donate a select amount of money per month.

In an effort to continue your rewards for supporting me beyond just your initial pledge sketch, I\u0027ve added a points system (inspired by other Patreon artists out there).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAt the $1.00 tier, you receive 1 \u0027point\u0027 each month of paid support.
