I have been fortunate enough to have the support of so many of you over the years, who have followed my work and allowed it to be a part of your days, via the internet.

Known primarily for his mastery at album artwork, (Okkervil River, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Brown Bird, Songs: Ohia, etc) Schaff is also the founder of Warren Rhode Island\u0027s \"Fort Foreclosure\". The building, lovingly named without the least bit of irony, serves as Schaff\u0027s home and studio as well as home and meeting place for other artists (most notably resident musicians MorganEve Swain, and the Late David Lamb, both of Brown Bird).  William, recognizing the importance of art in this world, recently expanded his community to the West Coast, where he started \"The Outpost\", in Oakland, California. There --   financial earnings be damned! -- William fills his days drawing works of art for private commissions, bands,  and his own examinations of human interaction.\u003cbr\u003e",
