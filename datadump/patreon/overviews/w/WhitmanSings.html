    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWalt Whitman Sings\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e began as a teaching experiment. To awaken high school juniors to the music beneath Whitman\u0027s rolling verses, I brought a boom box to school and began rapping \"Song of Myself.\" The effect was electric: a dead white poet was suddenly a powerful presence in the room.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than that, his optimistic voice seemed to be calling to our times. By the time I retired from teaching in 2012, I decided to carry Walt\u0027s warm, inclusive message to even more students, educators, veterans, Civil War aficionados, celebrants of patriotic holidays, spiritual progressives, scientists and theologians, and theatre-goers everywhere, to\u00a0\"scatter myself among men and women as I go, and toss a new gladness and roughness among them,\"\u00a0celebrating persons of every class, race, and sexual persuasion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithin a year I released an album called \"I Sing Walt Whitman\" setting each of Whitman\u0027s poems into gospel, folk, and hip-hop musical frames. The album was a dark-horse runner in the 57th annual Grammy Awards early rounds attracting rave reviews from former Grammy winners and nominees.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the end of year two, a 70-minute script, derived from Whitman\u0027s own writings and documented remarks, reveals the joyous, always optimistic soul of the man whom Harold Bloom considers \"more than our greatest poet. I would go so far as to nominate him as Abraham Lincoln\u0027s only rival for greatest American.\" \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI swear, he sounds more hip and essential than ever!\u00a0Want to help spread Walt\u0027s hopeful vision of America and humanity the world over? Many schools and theaters can afford the show\u0027s fee, but not the cost of transportation and lodging. You can help get Walt to the show on time. There is one very important opportunity coming up I\u0027ll tell you about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bohemian bard reaches out with joy and gratitude to his comrades at this important juncture of the open road."
