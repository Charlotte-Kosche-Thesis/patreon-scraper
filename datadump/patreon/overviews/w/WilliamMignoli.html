I fixed up the place and started doing School of Rock type jams with my students and would video tape the jams and put them up on You Tube for the students and their families to see. I had just produced an off Broadway Rock Opera, \u201cSay Something\u201d and I began loading all the video I had and produced since then of everything I have done. And one of my early goals was to compile as much of my own original music as I could for posterity and as a legacy to my life\u2019s creative works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of Today I have over 700 videos placed on this one channel in 10 years and 6 months. There is a video legacy of everything I\u2019ve done from The Penguinsons, Say Something A Rock Opera Fretboard Korner and RNRU (with my Citifield production).  To full rock concerts of the people I have taught music to over the years including the now famous Brandon\u201dTaz\u201d Niederauer. A full length first concert ever of Taz where he performed NINE songs in his very first show after being my student for just 4 months where I put him in this his first show at Theatre Three in Port Jefferson NY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I am grateful he chose to embrace the \u2018Taz\u2019 nickname I gave him 5 years ago. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a picture of us just a few nights ago, with \u0027Mr Sax\u0027 Colin Logatto, another one on my musical proteges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember.. I am proud of the legacy of all videos I have produced over the last 10 years and 6 months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact I would say that my channel has much better content than most including things like Netfarts and Amazonothing!\u003cbr\u003eAnd you could spend months if not years watching all of the cool videos I\u2019ve put up over the years.
