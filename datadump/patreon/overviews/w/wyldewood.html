There are no age restrictions:\u00a0 all that we require is the desire and impulse to create.  Add - importantly -\u00a0 the desire to work with others for everyone\u0027s mutual improvement and benefit. We are actively seeking young people who have talents that maybe they aren\u0027t even aware of yet themselves.  We look to promote discovery in people regardless of age. Some of our members give formal lessons.  But no one seriously interested in developing their talents is turned down for lack of funds.  Our group is about sharing, collaboration and companionship.  \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our view of creativity is broad, from art, music, theater and dance and other traditional arts to the full range of crafts such as woodwork, jewelry making, knitting sewing crocheting. Our experience is that doing things makes people happy.\u00a0  And doing things with others makes us all even happier. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We look forward to your participation in this process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Wylde Wood Channel:\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKqN86EXa4d_04vO9C8XTcA\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/channel/UCKqN86EXa4d_04vO9C8XTcA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
