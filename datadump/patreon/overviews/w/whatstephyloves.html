    "summary": "Thanks so much for checking out my Patreon page! I am writing about beauty and self care in the context of being a fat woman with chronic health issues. As I learn to love my own body, I want to encourage others to learn to love theirs. My mission is to make self-care, and especially beauty,\u00a0 accessible to those who, like me, have traditionally been shut out of the conversation. In addition to the blog and Instagram, I eventually plan to branch out into a podcast and possibly video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving ongoing health stuff that reduces my ability to work a full-time job means that if I\u0027m going to do this, the blog needs to be self-supporting. Unlike many beauty bloggers, I don\u0027t accept payment from brands to review their products. I feel that I can offer a more authentic review if I am basing my comments solely on my experience rather than being obligated to corporate sponsors. I have used a PayPal donation button, but giving people the opportunity to make a smaller contribution every month is more accessible than asking for an amount up front. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order for the blog to pay for itself, including products for review, hosting, Facebook advertising, and the metric boatload of coffee it takes to write coherently, my initial goal is $500/month. If I can reach $2500/month, I can make the blog a full time job, covering all my expenses (housing, health insurance, internet, etc.) and allowing me to produce more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to exclusive content such as Q\u0026amp;A sessions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdvance notice of new platform launches\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSubscriber-only giveaways\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting StephyLoves and my mission of self-care and self-love for every body.
