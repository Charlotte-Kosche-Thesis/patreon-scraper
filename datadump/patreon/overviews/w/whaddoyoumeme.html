This place is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to fight the much needed battle against anti-christian memes, videos, slogans, and false belief systems. It also allows you access to updates, behind the scenes videos that won\u0027t be found anywhere else, along with personal hangouts with me and other special guests!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you and others. In my case, it\u0027s videos that respond to cultural objections to Christianity in creative and entertaining ways. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping people (like you and me both!) bring more value to the world by making it financially sustainable long-term. Join the Patreon-Meme-Team-Family with a dollar (or however you much you like) per YouTube video that I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your support, love, and prayers! And together let\u0027s help illeviate the illogical objections to Christianity, one video at a time! Whaddo you memeeeeeee?????\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWYM-Jon\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
