    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eThe Women in Comics Collective is an Artistic and Informative Initiative that began in May of 2012. It serves to educate communities about the role and merit of Women working in the Comic Book/Multimedia  industries as well as highlight their artistic endeavors. We also work with schools, library systems, and community organizations across the country to promote literacy through the use of comic books.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a growing organization serving to to help female comic book and multimedia creators grow their brands while helping the community at the same time. The events that we host throughout the country are always free to the public with the hopes that we increase the visibility of our members while highlighting literacy through the use of comics. In order to provide the free events we host, we have a small budget that allows us to do so. However, as our membership and reach grows the more our budget stays the same. We need a larger budget to fit the needs pf both members and the community that needs us! All funds that we receive from Patreon will go to the promotion and production of our events, as well as towards expenses for members traveling to shows and events. We appreciate anything that we receive and it will be utilized to the benefit of the communities that invite us to perform workshops, panel discussions and more! Thank you all so much for coming to our page and we thank you for your support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
