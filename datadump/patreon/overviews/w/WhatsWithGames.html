My name\u0027s CJ, and I run What\u0027s With Games, a YouTube Show in which I look at neat things in games and try to get to the bottom of just what\u0027s with them. I cover all sorts of topics, from mechanics, to games as a whole, and even some player psychology stuff. In general, I touch on a lot of Game Design topics, but my real goal is to just look at things in games in a way that few other people think to look at them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VkSxDidTUo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eUpload Schedule Info\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started the Patreon, I was confident in my ability to maintain consistent uploads every 2 weeks, and I actually did manage to do this for a total of 4 videos. As you could guess, things change, and right now, with other priorities in my life, I\u0027ve fallen back to releasing videos \"when I get them done.\" I understand if infrequent uploads don\u0027t sound enticing when it comes to supporting someone monetarily, so don\u0027t feel pressured, since Patreon is always optional. I put this in the hands of my Patrons to decide whether they will be paying \"Per Month\" or \"Per Video\" as my upload schedule slows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TmT2IDrpca8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I\u0027m On Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all else, I\u0027m most excited about the community I\u0027m going to be building through the Patreon Discord. All the rewards excite me a lot, but I hope to foster a great little community for people who are interested in looking at games in a unique way to hang out, chat, and possibly even help out with future episodes of the show. To maximize the potential behind this community, the Discord is only $1. Of course, if other rewards fit your fancy, you\u0027ll still earn access to the Discord and be able to get the bonus stuff as well, so hopefully those things interest you. That said, your support is 100% optional, and if you don\u0027t want to or can\u0027t support me, by all means do not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5FBtI1tj8E\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re reading this, I can\u0027t thank you enough. Of course, all Patrons are 100% appreciated, but even people who are just interested enough to read this far mean the world to me. Y\u0027all are beautiful people."
