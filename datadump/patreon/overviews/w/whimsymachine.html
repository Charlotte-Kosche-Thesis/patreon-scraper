I never would have thought my art would be something that I could share with the world, so I am so grateful for everyone who offers their support and insight.\u003cbr\u003eMy entire life, I have had a knack for crafts My recent enchantments are clay work, wood carving, and sustainable toy making. Eventually, I hope to be able to 3D print things made from recycled HDPE plastic to be able to recreate my creations for sale on a shop (maybe on etsy.) I\u0027d like to be able to focus on those things I love; a feeling of whimsy and enchantment.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be posting ASMR on here, for those of you interested in that sort of thing. The ASMR will be crafting videos, whispered comedy, good sounds, and show \u0026amp; tells. If you guys enjoy those, I might do full roleplay ASMRs and story telling. We will have to see what the future holds."
