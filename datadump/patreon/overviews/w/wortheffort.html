    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy you should become a \u0027wortheffort\u0027 Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA while back I wrote an article for Popular\nWoodworking \u201cHand Tools vs Power Tools for Beginners\u201d (\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.popularwoodworking.com/woodworking-blogs/editors-blog/hand-tools-vs-power-tools-for-beginners\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.popularwoodworking.com/woodworking-blogs/editors-blog/hand-tools-vs-power-tools-for-beginners\u003c/a\u003e)\nwhere I postulated that power tools should be eliminated, or at least\ndrastically reduced, for beginning woodworkers. My argument was it is more\nefficient and effective in a classroom environment, students would get more out\nof it, teachers would have more opportunities for added learning, and it would\noffset some of what the modern technological world is losing. Additionally it\nwas more cost effective for districts and in the end it would provide a better\nproduct for the work force upon graduation. And for the average home woodworker\nit\u2019d give them a taste of the hobby without much risk either financially or physically.\nIf they decided to venture deeper via power tool commitment they\u2019d end up\nwith a better understanding of wood, it\u2019s interaction with the cutting edge, and end up with the complementary tools and skill to refine what those machines produce to their\nwhim. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe obstacle I outlined at the end of the article,\nand the reason why at that time I was leaning in the hand tool direction but\nhadn\u2019t jumped whole heartedly yet, was finding the teachers. It had been a long\ntime since the majority of woodworkers did stuff by hand hence most teachers in\nthis area (in fact the certification for the subject\u00a0in my home state of Texas) focused on production\npower tools. So making the change would be akin to having today\u2019s technology\nteachers ditch computer labs in favor of mechanical typewriters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the next year I slowly came to a forehead\nslapping realization. Woodworking, especially at the beginning level you\u2019d be\nteaching to middle and high schoolers (or even new adult learners), ain\u2019t that hard. It would be much\neasier to find expert teachers willing to learn a little woodworking than\nfind expert woodworkers who want to learn to teach. Shoot\u2026 most good\nwoodworkers don\u2019t want to teach, they want to make stuff. That\u2019s why they\nbecame woodworkers in the first place. Whereas expert teachers\u2026\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat was the kernel that led to a refocusing of\nmy media creation starting in 2017. I\u2019m going to write a textbook and create\nsome modern media resources for teachers. Resources that can be also be used by\nhomeschoolers, parents, group leaders, and such. Resources that will take a\nstudent thru a linear progression of lessons over a semester or two that teaches\nbasic woodworking skills and relates it to their overall education to show the true value of learning. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn doing so we\u0027ll also create a body of work that better\ncommunicate with the general public wanting to self-educate and give the more\nexperienced prompts to better communicate their own skills to the uninitiated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut that is the end result of years of content\ncreation that\u2019ll require more time than I have if I continue working\n70-80 markets a year selling stuff I make to subsidize wortheffort\u0027s media creation. So\nfor 2017 I\u2019m going to attempt to follow in others example and transition to\nonline commerce with one branch being Patreon (the others being online sales and\nwriting).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe plan is to utilize Patreon much differently than others in this DIY/Craft/Education segment who set up monthly subscriptions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYouTube is how most people know me as a woodworker. My\nsilent \u201cartsy fartsy\u201d build videos and long-form educational videos have been pretty popular and making them is fun thou time consuming. So for 2017 I plan on focusing only on those two types of videos\nfor YouTube with the long-form educational ones now lining up with the chapters I\u0027ve outlined for the future textbook. This also means keeping a steady\nschedule of publishing will be impossible because the long-form videos often times take several weeks longer to produce and videos are\u00a0not the only income stream I have to work in order to subsidize the textbook creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile in theory an hour long video is as much\ncontent as a multitude of 10 minute videos, marketing wise it\u2019s not the same\nimpression to the public. So instead of a monthly subscription for a weekly\nvideo I\u2019m choosing to set Patreon as a little tip jar for each video created. That\nway if I have to skip a few weeks here and there people won\u0027t feel cheated. Also it gives me the freedom to post some videos without putting out the \"tip jar\". These might be\u00a0smaller videos that support the overall project but might not obviously fit in the woodworking realm. (I have a cool lecture I\u0027ll eventually get to on Diet Coke and Design via mathematics which would fit in this category.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd sometimes I might need to do a commercial for something I\u0027m making to sell (have to pay the rent somehow) and that wouldn\u0027t be fair to charge patrons for. In 2018 I\u0027ve also started a \"WW\u0027nTip-of-Day\" series which are short-form lessons so they will not be \"patronized\" (i.e. - you aren\u0027t charged for them.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA really cool thing about this type of setup is a person can also set a cap to their monthly donation. So a $3/video donation set to a max of $3/mo. would mean you\u0027d donate for the first video only whereas a $1/video with a max of $3/mo. would mean you\u0027d donate for the first 3 videos but no more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe this is the best way to utilize Patreon fairly for my work and future goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if after reading in various magazines and websites my: articles,\nblog posts, op-ed pieces... if after seeing my\npast work on YouTube, and if after seeing my goals here you think my work might\nhave some benefit for you and future generations of woodworkers then I hope you\u2019ll\ntake the plunge and become a wortheffort patron. It\u0027ll help alleviate some of the financial pain in creating a unique body of work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks,\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nShawn Graham\n\u003cbr\u003e"
