    "summary": "Perhaps when you look at the title, you\u0026#8217;d think that this was more of\n an interesting question back in late 2011 when the initial buzz was \nkicking in for Minecraft. But upon coming across the recent UK gaming \ncharts, the fact that I was surprised to see Mojang\u0026#8217;s smash hit creation\n was in a respectable 11th place, it had me questioning just how it has \nmaintained its popularity for such a long period \u003ca href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/internet-security-expert-links-massive-botnet-ddos-attacks-to-minecraft-disputes/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eof time\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0026#8217;s plenty of explanations as to why its so beloved worldwide. \nIts accessible to all age groups, which is aided by releasing on \nnumerous different platforms to reach a vast audience. Its easy to pick \nup, has a simplistic yet effective art design, offers different \napproaches to playing, and ultimately you are only limited by your \nimagination, which is something that many gamers seem to strive for.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg height=\"359\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/mmoexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/minecraft-deathmatch.jpg?resize=711%2C400\" width=\"636\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSales statistics speak for themselves, its well documented after all \nas to how successful the franchise is financially. But its interesting \nto look at the core of what makes it so relevant, and how it still \nappeals (and sells) in 2017. Me personally, I was a latecomer to \nMinecraft, having only played the demo many moons ago, I was introduced \nto the full game by friends back in 2016. Maybe it was my fondness of \nLego growing up, or the sheer amount of freedom that was on offer, \neither way I found it to be an enjoyable experience that took up far \nmore time than I \u003ca href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/19/microsoft-drops-support-for-minecraft-windows-phone/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eexpected it\u003c/a\u003e to (especially when spending hours trying \nto build the tree house from Adventure Time).\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0026#8217;ve got console editions, pocket versions, a Virtual Reality \nrelease with Oculus Rift, seasonal and other additional content, and \neven a Telltale adaptation in Minecraft Story Mode. Top that with the \nsheer amount of merchandise on offer and other ways of immersing its \nvast fanbase with its product. It was also something that had very \nlittle to no advertising budget prior to its release, similar to many \ncases with indie games. Yet no indie \u003ca href=\"http://unblockedallgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eunblocked games\u003c/a\u003e has so far been able to touch \nMinecraft in terms of how it skyrocketed to fame.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg height=\"358\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/mmoexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed.jpg?resize=711%2C400\" width=\"636\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nClearly the idea of Minecraft still serves a purpose as proven by \nsales, but the core principle of your imagination being the only \nlimitation in such a simplistic game is something that continues to \nwithstand the test of time.\u003cbr\u003e\nDo you still play Minecraft? Do you have a theory as to why its still so \u003ca href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/news/351141/support-for-minecraft-on-windows-mobile-devices-expected-to\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epopular\u003c/a\u003e?
