Our world is filled with lies and dis-information.  I have chosen to stand on the side of Truth, to inform the masses of what is really going on in the world around them.  Through my research, I have come to realize that there is a spiritual element to things.  After thousands of hours of research, I have concluded that the only real Truth in this world is present in the Scriptures.  For this reason, I am a Bible believing Christian who is determined to rebuke Satan and his lies.  I specialize in symbolism, occult teachings, Evolution vs Creation, global propaganda, social psychology, false flags, mind-control methods, fallen angles/aliens, and the New World Order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMission Statement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission is\u00a0to reach as many people as possible, share the truth, expose the New World Order, and help lead souls to Jesus Christ. \u00a0I promise to stay on the side of Truth at all costs! \u00a0I strive to present new and compelling information that will benefit my fellow brothers and sisters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I need your help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMaking these videos is a full-time job! \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0The videos I make take an enormous amount of time to produce. \u00a0Every minute of completed video you see on my channel represents (on average) between 1-2 hours of editing alone. \u00a0More elaborate videos represent an average of 10 hours of editing for every minute of completed video. \u00a0Depending on the amount of research, and various other factors, some videos take weeks (or even sometimes months) to complete. \u00a0For this channel to continue it\u0027s current rate of production, I\u0027m asking for your help. \u00a0Please, consider contributing and help me spread the truth!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, my goal is to make full-length documentary films, covering an array of topics, that would be showcased on major video platforms (i.e. Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc). \u00a0I hope to one day create a website to archive important videos, to promote other truthers, share important/relevant information, and to be an all around hub for truthers across the world. \u00a0I would like to assemble a team of creative, motivated individuals to help me produce daily content. \u00a0And as a whole, I hope to make great strides in waking up the masses.\u003cbr\u003e"
