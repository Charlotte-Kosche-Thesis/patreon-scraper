    "summary": "Hi! Thank you so much for stopping by my page, and maybe even becoming a patron! Artists rely on the financial and psychological support of our communities to keep us able to continue laboring at our crafts. I strongly believe that poetry is a vital part of our human\nexperience, and is a tool to help us understand each other and ourselves on a\ndeeper level, creating empathy. While my nonfiction writing is largely focused on\nbig-picture ideas and storytelling, my poetry is often\nfocused on singular moments in time. My multi-media art aims to blend the two concepts and engage with writers on a deeper level by incorporating elements of sight and sound into the philosophical and emotional layers of writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the month of December, I\u2019m offering a special deal for my patrons: for \u003cstrong\u003e$3 per month\u003c/strong\u003e, you\u2019ll receive a haiku each day, plus special access to an Instagram account that has photos of daily haiku in my advent calendar. Late sponsors need not fret: you\u2019ll receive a digest of past haiku and can still flip through previous Instagram posts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs my patron, you will be my muse, encouraging me to continue writing, knowing there is an audience out there. You\u0027ll support the publication of my first\nmanuscript, \u003cem\u003eThe Sea, Like Air\u003c/em\u003e, as well as the writing of my second manuscript.\nYou\u0027ll also help me keep my website alive. With your support, once December is over, I will start posting videos, audible clips, and ultimately chapbooks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatrons get a deep look into the creative\nprocess of a poem, seeing the very first drafts and how those change to become\nwhat is ultimately published. It\u0027s a vulnerable trade, and a leap of faith for\nboth of us, and I hope you\u0027ll take it with me. \u003cbr\u003e"
