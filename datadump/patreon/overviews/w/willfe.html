And none of that matters one bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI play for the fun of it, for the experience of sharing a game with good friends and entertaining people with light-hearted commentary as we hunt for those elusive moments where, despite the odds, something amazing or hilarious happens in-game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI play alone and I also play with friends; it all just depends on the game and on everyone\u0027s mood (and availability).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re watching one of my livestreams, you\u0027re a friend too -- please never hesitate to say \"hi\" in chat, because you\u0027re always welcome. You can join us in our antics, or you can lean back and watch from the relative safety of the gallery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSerious Stuff\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI play a variety of PC games on a semi-regular livestream schedule. Game genres I enjoy include space sims (like X3: Albion Prelude), 4X (like Distant Worlds and Star Ruler 2), world builders (like Cities: Skylines), the occasional action RPG (like Grand Theft Auto V), RTS (like Defense Grid and Zero-K) and puzzlers (like Talos Principle).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eLivestream Schedule\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eMost weekends (usually Saturdays), usually starting at either 11:00am EST or 1:00pm EST, time permitting. Livestreams are usually announced at least one day in advance on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/groups/willfe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSteam Community group\u003c/a\u003e and can be viewed live at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/willfe\"\u003ehttp://twitch.tv/willfe\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eLivestream Archives\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter each broadcast, livestreams are split into episodes and uploaded to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/willfe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e. I do my best to keep all videos online and viewable, but on rare occasions copyright holders (or YouTube\u0027s own Content ID system) might claim their material appears (or is used) in a video. Sometimes this has no real impact, but occasionally a video can be blocked in certain countries or removed entirely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003ePatreon Funds\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eAny patronage is sincerely appreciated, but never solicited. Funds received via Patreon will be used primarily for gaming -- acquiring new games, maintaining equipment, service fees (i.e. game subscriptions, if we ever get into an MMORPG-style game), etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, this is a hobby, not a profession. I won\u0027t use Patreon funds to pay my rent or utilities, buy groceries or gas up my car -- they\u0027ll only be used in support of my gaming efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for considering supporting my efforts, and whether or not you ultimately choose to make a pledge, sit back and enjoy the games! There\u0027s always an open seat at the table!\u003cbr\u003e"
