Awesome melodies etc. Most of my music will be free to download and i\u0027m hoping to write some sheet music and piano tutorials too in the future for those fans hoping to learn playing the piano or even learn how to produce themselves. \u00a0Be sure to drop a comment on my music posts, i\u0027m always open for honest feedback. That\u0027s the kind we - producers - can work with to improve our work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why i\u0027m on patreon is pretty obvious I think. I\u0027m really hoping I can build up a monthly income with music. By reaching out to fans and the internet in general i\u0027m also hoping i\u0027ll find people who like my music. And I hope that in these strange times I can bring a smile to atleast some faces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
