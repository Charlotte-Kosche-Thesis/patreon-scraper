Expect some adult situations, nudity, and sex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e This is an adults only series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories will focus on the many characters of the Cape from the Willy Bear Beach visual novel, and introduce characters in the upcoming Willy Bear Beach 2. Notes from the Cape will put the focus on other characters, and sometimes take place in the past, exploring characters\u0027 histories and lives from many angles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeet the cast \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/15578232\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003eFull episode list \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/16349712\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.artdecademonthly.com/patreon/header_small2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides the novellas, patrons will be able to ask questions of the characters in \u003cstrong\u003eillustrated Q\u0026amp;A\u003c/strong\u003e sessions, and you will have access to general production updates that will include WIPs and similar stuff.
