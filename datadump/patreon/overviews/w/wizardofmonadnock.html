    "summary": "Even ordinary people deserve meaningful, magical lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we all know by now that it\u0027s not easy. It sure wasn\u0027t easy for me. Five years ago, I went through each day in a cold sweat and a cloud of anxiety, wasting away in an abusive office, the majority of my waking hours spent in a cubicle that may as well have been a cell or a kennel. It all seemed so pointless. I yearned for connection and\u00a0 passion, yet received only alienation, found only despair.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that there was actually more to it than this. That was actually faith, just a tiny scrap of faith, even if I didn\u0027t realize it at the time. That\u0027s when the magic crept in, just a little bit at a time - until finally I decided to do something about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s when I started wizardofmonadnock.com. I did it so that people like me might have a better shot at finding the sacred, the mystical, the real - and live in THAT even as we must live in dismal circumstances beyond our control. If sharing my thoughts, stories, rants, daydreams, and meditations could help even a handful of regular folks enjoy their time on this planet just a little bit more, maybe that\u0027s all that matters. Now I had a purpose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a few years, I expanded the project, launching The Wizard of Monadnock Radio Hour podcast, exploring the cosmos with special guests and discovering a brand new way to just talk directly to people like me. Both the website and the show are alive and thriving - and they\u0027ll always be free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubscribing is for the fans who want more, who want to go deeper.\u003c/strong\u003e Subscribers have the opportunity to connect directly with me, to share in the wizard\u0027s journey, to participate and even collaborate in the project. For the first time, I\u0027m sharing my own private practices and experiments (including the failures), and I\u0027m offering services, support, and advice that\u0027s personalized just for you. And by \"you,\" I mean the ordinary people who deserve magic most of all, and you don\u0027t even have to be rich. \u003cstrong\u003eIn fact, I guarantee you won\u0027t find a cheaper spiritual adviser anywhere on the internet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSubscribing also allows you to give a small token of support for my humble efforts. \u003cstrong\u003eContrary to public perception, most wizards don\u0027t live in castles or attend private school.\u003c/strong\u003e We rent flawed apartments and drive old Toyotas, we\u0027ve got kids, debts, obligations. Even the writing and hosting associated with the website and podcast cost money - and just because I found a purpose doesn\u0027t mean I ever got free of my office job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s be partners in this. Let\u0027s help one another out.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
