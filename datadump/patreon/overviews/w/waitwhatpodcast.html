    "summary": "For five years, Wait, What? has been \u003cstrong\u003eJeff Lester\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eGraeme McMillan\u003c/strong\u003e\u2019s podcast for discussion of comic books, pop culture, and their shared love for Belgian Waffles. With new episodes released every second Monday, it\u2019s a place where news, reviews, and countless digressions about television, movies, and half-remembered comic characters combine to create something that\u2019s one part informed comic book industry analysis and commentary, about the comic book industry and one part ongoing conversation between two friends.  If nothing else, Wait, What? is a comic book podcast with more mentions of Jack Kirby and Steve Englehart than any other podcast out there\u2014we (almost certainly) guarantee it!*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFreewheeling and only occasionally nonsensical, Wait, What? has a following of tens of thousands of \u201cWhatnauts\u201d who tune in to hear discussions on everything from the latest Marvel or DC event comic, to 2000AD characters of the past, or Jeff\u2019s latest \u201cerotic\u201d webcomic discovery--all treated with the same mix of irreverence and affection. After more than 150 episodes as the official podcast for the Savage Critics website, Wait, What? is going it alone for the next 150 and beyond \u2014 with your help, of course. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the regular Wait, What? podcast will remain available for free every two weeks as always, we\u2019re looking to expand our horizons, with a new website (at \u003ca href=\"http://www.waitwhatpodcast.com)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.waitwhatpodcast.com)\u003c/a\u003e where we can host written posts, as well as \u2014 just maybe \u2014 some additional audio special episodes and other extra content in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we can\u2019t do it without you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to provide the kind of additional material we\u2019d like to offer, we\u2019re asking for contributions from listeners. We\u2019re not asking for a lot \u2014 as you can see below, we tried to keep our pledge levels as low as we could \u2014 but every little bit helps us free up our schedules to have more time to put towards All Things Wait, What?. In exchange, we\u2019re offering chances for you to suggest comics we should be reviewing, ask questions we\u2019ll answer on-air, and receive exclusive audio unavailable anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re both very conscious of our audience, and also of what we\u2019re asking with this campaign. You can cap your monthly contributions, or offer a one-time pledge if you want; we will be eternally grateful no matter what, (and not in the \u201cyear-long Batman mini-series\u201d meaning of the word, either). Please check out the reward tiers below, watch the video above (Seriously, we cut about three minutes of us cracking up at each other out, so be grateful that it\u2019s not longer), and then decide to give us all of your worldly goods \u2014 sorry, we mean \u201ccarefully choose which tier seems best for you.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out this Patreon! We will try our best to entertain and earn our keep, but apologize in advance for our probably-inevitable future failures in that regard."
