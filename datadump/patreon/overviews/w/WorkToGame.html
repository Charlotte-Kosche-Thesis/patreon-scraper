Brian \u0026amp; Chris here coming at you with the power of Patreon.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBEFORE YOU CONSIDER BECOMING A PATRON: \u003c/strong\u003eWe want you as a subscriber and as an active part of our community. We love making these videos and sharing our passion with you all!\u003cbr\u003e\nWatch, comment, share, critique.\u00a0Since we started, your support has been overwhelming, and we\u0027ve discovered how much fun it is to do this, and make these videos and interact with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe started Work To Game with the idea of promoting balance in gamers lives. One being that we all have jobs, families, hobbies outside of gaming, and many other things to do, and those are all awesome things. Balance is something that can be hard to achieve with games, especially MMOs that can require a lot of time. So we started out making guides to help promote efficiency, respect, and fun without worrying about Best In Slot Gear, or having to play forty hours a week just to keep up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what brings us to Patreon? We talked about it for a very long time. We didn\u0027t want to introduce Patreon as a process to have you pay for what we are already doing, we want to do more, and after encouragement from many of you, asking how we could put out guides faster, or do more with our content, the answer was Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst and foremost, if you are watching our videos, and subscribed on YouTube, thank you! That\u0027s an amazing way you support us and our mission. But if you want to help us grow, and support us even more, we want to give back to you in some way, and this is the best system for that. With YouTube Ads being something that can be hit or miss, this is a way we can offer more content, better content, and better interaction with you. \u003cbr\u003e"
