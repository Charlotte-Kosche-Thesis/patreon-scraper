An unconventional group of artists with a quirky, often controversial sense of humor, Wckr Spgt has remained a vital and vibrant force deep beneath the underground scene in the Inland Empire of Southern California.\u003cbr\u003eThis versatile and unpredictable act has toured as a rock and roll band, performed soundtrack music for art shows, presented performance art \"rock operas\", and built themselves into an 8\u0027x8\u0027 box onstage. \u003cbr\u003eThe recordings, of which there are over 1000 songs and more than 50 full-length albums, have included experimental noisescapes, punk rock, pop radio songs, anthemic fist-pumping sing alongs, improvisational rock and roll, and hip hop. Currently the band performs a blend of the driving rock sound they honed in the early-nineties with a bit of performance art thrown into the live shows and a dash of improvisation sprinkled on top. Whatever shape the music takes, Wckr Spgt\u0027s unique outlook and avant garde humor slices through the heart of it all.\u003cbr\u003eA plethora of musicians have been a part of Wckr Spgt at one time or another, sometimes to form side projects and sometimes as band members. The members of Wckr Spgt (\u003cstrong\u003eJoel Huschle, Mark Givens, Dave Carpenter, \u003c/strong\u003eand\u003cstrong\u003e Kyle Brodie\u003c/strong\u003e) have likewise played with a wide variety of other musical acts. \u003cbr\u003e",
