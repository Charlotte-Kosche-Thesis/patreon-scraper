     "about": "I was born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire in 1967. I worked as a plant breeder/laboratory technician for 14 years before a change in career to follow my childhood dream of filmmaking. I have worked as a cinematographer, director of lighting, editor, composer, scriptwriter, special effects technician, producer and director.\u003cbr\u003eForming MoonCloud Productions in 1999, I made several short films and music videos. 2003 saw me experiment with animation and rotoscoping resulting in two films shown at the Meniscus Film Festival, A Devil\u2019s Heaven (a collaboration with Japanese artist Ankoku Koubou Maki), and the competition entry, Atmosphere. I also made the United Nations music video Crazy World for singer Andrea Meadows in 2004.\u003cbr\u003eIllness saw me withdraw from film production until 2009 when, working for WeKnowMe Productions and Patchwork Pictures, I made 12 music videos and short animated films; Storyboard: Robert A. Heinlein\u0027s Starship Troopers, Black Bikini and Black Bava Sabbath are among my more notable works. My last effort for French Composer Josue Pelissier was the short film Origins.\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately the pressures of production resulted in my having to again withdraw from all film work and put my fragile health first. In the last few years, I have begun to experiment with canvas and digital painting as a means to keep creatively occupied without the stresses or pressures of my chosen career. This work has resulted in The Dreaming Fly series of abstract paintings \u2013 which were exhibited in Hull in 2011.\u003cbr\u003eI have debilitating and soul destroying mental health issues, struggling with chronic mixed depression and stress type F33.11. I am also awaiting assessment for autism. My art has been an absolute lifeline and in my darkest hours has kept me sane and been a constant ray of hope that all will get better. It does. I bounce up and fall down only to bounce again.\u003cbr\u003eI am a friend of Bill and Bob\u2019s for those in the know and have been in their fellowship for over nine years. I am deeply spiritual and live my life by a 12 step programme of discovery, honesty and enlightenment.\u003cbr\u003eI am 6ft tall, balding, now on the larger size. I am happily getting fat due to poor culinary skills and lack of excersise. I do walk most places in Scarborough and have started a walking regime to improve said lousy fitness. I am a simple man, the same one that Lynyrd Skynyrd sing about. I am a man at peace with myself and the world.  \u003cbr\u003ePeople often perceive me as a serious, enigmatic and studious man when in fact i am rather playful, have a very dark sense of humour and live with a riotous blend of humour and sarcasm permeating my mind for most of the day.\u003cbr\u003eMy fashion is non existent and usually begins with a pound. I am poor yet content.\u003cbr\u003eI am an aficionado of world cinema, French and Japanese being particular favorites. All time classics for me are as diverse as Alien, Stalker to Delicatessen and The Thing. I am passionate music listener from prog rock to techno. On any given day I may switch between Spock\u2019s Beard and Infected Mushroom. I also enjoy the classical music of Mozart and Vivaldi and especially enjoy the operas of Verdi, he is a musical genius!\u003cbr\u003eI much enjoy photography and lazy walks alongside water! I derive much enjoyment being besides a river or the sea. I have an eclectic range of interests especially history, from museums to old castles. Astronomy, true crime, conspiracy theories, science fiction, horror, fantasy, art of all types, live music, good coffee or Yorkshire tea, camping, live theatre, are just a few things which appeal to me.\u003cbr\u003e",
