Profound spiritual experience through meditation - specifically awakening - is recognised, normalised and accessible to anyone interested in realising the truth for themselves about reality, their identity, and life and death, through a \n\u003cstrong\u003eprofessional institution\u003c/strong\u003e: safe, regulated, and research-based, as an alternative to the amateur, superstitious and dangerous spiritual guru.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nb. The origin of problems is understood to lie in false conclusions we have the personal responsibility to correct, informing our understanding of the nature of the psyche and our approach to mental health issues.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo create a Wiser culture, we need ~100,000 professionals (new vocation + modified existing professions) demonstrably benefiting society, backed by sufficient research to create a non-controversial consensus of scientific belief about the nature and structure of the psyche as demonstrated through awakening and Wiser Practice. This means testing our hypotheses.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHere\u2019s how we do it\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSTEP 1:\u003c/strong\u003e Create an interactive, gamified Master Class in Wiser Practice, making high-end wisdom available to the public that\u2019s 100x better than anything else for a fraction of the cost. In tandem with retreats, this should fund:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSTEP 2:\u003c/strong\u003e the development and implementation of a decades-long research program to validate the claim that Wiser Practice is both effective and beneficial, and to inform improvements to STEP 1.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis will include comparison studies with current psychological therapies, including placebo, with a particular focus on treating mental health issues that prohibit sufferers from living a meaningful life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nResearch carried out on Wiser Retreats - with a particular interest in the phenomenon of transmission - will be part of the program.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSTEP 3:\u003c/strong\u003e Create the new vocation of the Wiser Practitioner: a qualified, regulated, research-based profession to render the amateur and dangerous spiritual guru redundant.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith sufficient success from steps 1-3, we can then do the following simultaneously:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSTEP 4:\u003c/strong\u003e Develop and implement the Wiser Counselling program, an introduction to and training in Wiser Practice for existing counsellors and therapists.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSTEP 5:\u003c/strong\u003e Develop and implement the Wiser Purpose program, an introduction to and training in Wiser Practice for professionals/businesses/organisations, specifically for people to lead a personally meaningful work life, especially where personal problems prevent this from happening.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd this will conclude Part 1 of the Master Plan. Part 2, which includes an expanded (or shall we say, further reaching) aim, will be published at a later date.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eProgress\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSTEP 1 and STEP 2 are underway. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Master Class is about 80% complete, with version 3 of parts 1-3 available, and part 4 dropping in 2018.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve completed the Wiser Research Pilot, to measure the efficacy of the Master Class in facilitating awakening, resolving problems, and to what extent personality traits are changed. The results serve as the basis for the forthcoming Wiser Research Strategy, where we will attempt to develop a gold-standard in self-reporting and study design to test our hypotheses.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2018 we hope to begin research on retreat, and the development of the Wiser Practitioner training for STEP 3.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can take these first steps with us towards a wiser culture by becoming a student today!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca class=\"s13i1bso-2 kVNXzL\" href=\"http://app.wiserbydesign.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSign up for free\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLearn the basics of Wiser Practice in 30 seconds, with 10 kinds of sitting practice, 9 videos to watch, and 12 badges to earn.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nResolve your problems with Wiser Dialectic Practice, through exploring your dramas, dreams and daydreams using the interactive form and instructional videos with examples.
