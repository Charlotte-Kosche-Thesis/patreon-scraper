I\u0027m glad to have found Patreon as a new and direct way to connect with the people who are interested in my art.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been an illustrator and screen printer for years. I make prints and greeting cards, collages and paintings. I\u0027ve developed a personal style working with vintage tins and other repurposed materials. My subject matter varies but is mostly influenced by the things that directly surround me: animals, the woods, birds + bees, natural shapes and patterns. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been featured in and at the Andy Warhol Museum Shop, The Westmoreland Museum of American Art, the American Folk Art Museum in NYC, West Elm, and the Beekman 1802 Mercantile. I also exhibit at as many regional craft and art festivals as I can throughout the year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI am working harder than ever to support myself and my family on my own steam. My goal is to always have as many creative irons in the fire as I can and to connect with as many like-minded people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading this far and even considering to join and support me.

I pay tribute to life\u2019s simple offerings of beauty that exist all around us in such abundance that they can easily be overlooked.\u003cbr\u003eI am as drawn to the laborious aspect of creativity as I am to its unpredictable outcomes. I gain almost as much from the process of cutting apart tins and sourcing the wood as I do from the assemblage of the art itself. My inspiration is formed by my surroundings, by my life in a city in that exists in the midst of both decay and rebirth, set against the dramatic beauty and constant change of the Pennsylvania landscape.\u003cbr\u003e",
