    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon Page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are here, you are possibly considering helping support me and my team so that we can continue to do the work that we love to do. Of course you might be here because I bombarded you with links and you finally gave in to come to the page and are getting ready to click away. Before you do, here are a few reasons why you should consider becoming a patron of Wandering Gypsy Publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. You love gays, and the LGBT community, and realize that some of the best work in literature has come from people who were LGBT. Great names like Oscar Wilde, Virginia Wolfe, Gertrude Stein, and T. S. Elliot only make up a few, but deep down in your heart, you know the LGBT community needs to continue writing great works of literature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. You like feeling good, and who doesn\u0027t feel good when they help someone else out! I know I do, and I also know that myself and my team will be eternally grateful if you decide to help us, and will take every opportunity to tell you how much you mean to us! Thanks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Part of your goals this years is to cut back on sweets or coffee, but you have the money burning a hole in your pocket every time you go to Starbucks, so you want us to provide you an outlet to spend some extra cash so you don\u0027t get the extra sweet, Venti, Frappuccino and donut. (Okay, this is probably pretty unlikely, but it could be a reason.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. You love to read and love books in general and want to help those who want to keep you up to date on everything that is books, self-publishing, small-publishing, and writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Finally, you know me or someone on my team directly and you just love us\u00a0so much that you wanted to help us out because you know that for us, this is both our passion project, and our way of pouring our creativity and heart back into the gay community and into the world to make it a brighter place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever your reason, check out the video along with this post (sorry for the extra cheese, I am still uncomfortable on camera) and help us make our goal! Future goals will be released, we don\u0027t have just one financial need, but I will keep all of you up to date each step of the way and will make sure to give new perks with each update so that you can be proud to be one of our patrons!\u003cbr\u003e"
