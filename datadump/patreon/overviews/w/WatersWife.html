I never expected vlogging to become my \"therapy\" through life\u0027s journey, but I am so grateful it did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m married to my scruffy faced husband, Tyson. He has been my biggest support and inspiration to keep going in life. \u00a0He has encouraged me to follow my dreams ... wherever they take us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February 2016, we were surprised with the news that we were expecting our first child after years of infertility and finally abandoning the idea of children. Unfortunately, we are lost our sweet son, Beckett, at 26 weeks on 6.24.16. We are devastated, but we know that Beckett\u0027s memory will forever push us to give back to others. \u00a0We created the hashtag #GiveBackForBeckett to encourage others to give back also. Even just a friendly smile can change someone\u0027s day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live in Salt Lake City, UT, but have dreams of moving to the Pacific Northwest where I hope to spend my days creating art, writing, and of course vlogging all the adventures.\u003cbr\u003eMy heart belongs to the ocean.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on a mission to get fit. I\u0027ve lost over 100 lbs so far and am pushing to lose another 100-150.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, our journey is that of a grief journey.  We are just taking it day by day. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eJoin us as we brave the waves together?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t donate money, we honestly appreciate your support and kind words. \u00a0Just sharing this with your friends and family will be a huge help!\u003cbr\u003e"
