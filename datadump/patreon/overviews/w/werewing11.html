I know it may seem like all my problems would be solved by getting a new job, but the problem is that I can\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003eWell, it\u0027s not that I can\u0027t, but it\u0027s just that it takes months for anyone to respond, and I live in such a small town, it\u0027s basically a no-go, since EVERYONE and their dog needs a job. So they\u0027re pretty much all taken.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking on my passion is something that seems so out of reach these days, because I have no extra money to spend on making it better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m assuming that most of you are here from Game Jolt. Which is cool.\u003cbr\u003eThat means you\u0027re wanting to help see HOME to its completion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind that HOME is not the only game that will be helped through this patreon. After HOME is complete, this page will be used for future \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal\u003c/strong\u003e games as well. So, if you just want to help HOME along, that\u0027s cool, but just remember that if that\u0027s all you wanted to come here and support, you can always discontinue your donations at a later date.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart, for even checking this page out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll see how this goes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
