    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eBuilding the Movement for this Moment and Beyond\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMillions of people in the U.S. spent the past year watching communities of color rise up against police murder, racism, deportations, and theft of Indigenous lands. Millions more watched Trump become the 45th President of the United States. ICE agents are demanding papers from people disembarking from domestic flights; protest is becoming increasingly criminalized; decades of gains are being rolled back at the stroke of Trump\u2019s pen. We must ask ourselves: where do we go from here? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years now, the US press has faithfully reported that more than half of millennials reject capitalism. Many millions of us believe socialism is the answer. We need to reach today\u2019s anti-capitalist militants with revolutionary politics and organization that can shake this decaying system to its roots. We need to build broad public support for a network of resistance. We can\u2019t do this without your active support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuilding the Party\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSince November 2016, Workers World Party has grown exponentially by connecting with fighters who are interested in joining an anti-racist, anti-capitalist and anti-fascist revolutionary organization. New branches have popped up across the United States, and we are scaling-up the Party to operate successfully in this next phase of resistance and fight in ways that match the rapidly changing political landscape. We need your support to build a revolutionary socialist vanguard party. Historically, throughout the history of the United States and abroad, communists have provided the most effective fightback against racism \u0026amp; white supremacy. Without a strong organization capable of building the ranks of people who want to fight, we will soon find ourselves under the tank treads of the Trump regime. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolidarity Centers\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eResistance requires community, and communities need a place to meet. Our solidarity centers across the United States provide the physical space necessary to coordinate action, serve the community, and educate one another. Many activists eat a few meals a week at solidarity centers. We learn self defense and upstander strategies. We make signs and copies of literature to cover our cities. We ship newspapers all over the world. Many groups including the Peoples Power Assemblies, Philly Coalition for REAL Justice, Michigan Emergency Committee Against War \u0026amp; Injustice, International Working Women\u2019s Coalition and the Brooklyn Anti-Gentrification Network meet at our Solidarity Centers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSelf Defense\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSince January 20th, the movement has faced serious repression. Record numbers of people have taken to the streets, and the state and its right-wing vigilantes are cracking down in response. Hundreds of protesters face up to 10 years in prison and felony charges. People of color, migrants, women, queer, trans and gender non-conforming people are facing escalating violence from the right. Workers World organizes with those under attack to defend each other and fight back against this racist, misogynist, capitalist system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Newspaper \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe paper is the backbone of our organization. It helps get out our message and coordinate our national strategy. For many people it is their first introduction to revolutionary politics. It is one of the few weekly revolutionary socialist newspapers still printed in the United States. The paper contains news and photos from a network of national and international correspondents at the front lines of resistance. The material is written, edited, translated, printed and distributed entirely by volunteers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than 30% of our current subscriber base is incarcerated. Political prisoners such as Mumia Abu Jamal, Leonard Peltier, the MOVE 9, and Rev. Edward Pinkney and so many other prisoners receive newspapers from the party. We produce a print edition of the paper in order to reach the incarcerated, as well as those without homes or reliable internet access. It is a critical tool for outreach, and one of the last print publications in the United States reporting faithfully on fightback in the streets. \u003cbr\u003e"
