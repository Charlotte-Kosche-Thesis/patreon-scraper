Apart from commission work, I try to focus my energy on a project that\u0027s only recently been resurrected. This is a story inspired by The Legend of Zelda, you\u0027re welcome to view the first (attempt) episode here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC4JNxksb6k\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTLoZ: Sundial of Shadows, Episode 1.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally, this project began back in 2010, and was unfortunately ended a few years later. For a long time my heart for it had been put aside, and now that I have the freedom, I\u0027ve decided to pursue it once more! For the past collection of months I\u0027ve been actively ploughing through the pre-production stage; the writing, concept art, etc, and I \u003cstrong\u003ehope\u003c/strong\u003e to begin production of the first episode within this year. But that solely depends on the completion, and my satisfaction, of the planning. And judging by my past mistakes of being up the creek without a paddle, I\u0027m being as careful, and thorough as I can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the purpose of this Patreon..\u003cbr\u003eThe reason for cancelling the project all those years ago, was that I could not receive the financial support at the time, and life got in the way. Now, as doubtful and fearful as I am for the unknown, I have too much passion for this story to let it go, and so, I hope you\u0027ll lend me your support during the making of \u003cstrong\u003eSundial of Shadows!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-End Note-\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began submitting artwork online back in 2008, and since then has sharing my work been one of the most rewarding parts of my journey as an artist. Despite my passion, if not for the moral support of my friends and followers, I wouldn\u0027t have had the same strength to persevere. The fact I\u0027m even able to make a living from my art is made possible by you guys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that, you\u0027re welcome to throw me a tip, otherwise no pressure. Every little bit makes all the difference, and is hugely appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions or you\u0027d like to say hi, g\u0027head and send me a message!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake care, and have a lovely day~! :-)\u003c/div\u003e"
