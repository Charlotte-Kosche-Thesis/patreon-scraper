Unless you can raise a budget that pays you a living wage, most of the time you have to keep working elsewhere to pay the bills. This eats into development time on the games, pushes back deadlines, and means we\u0027re likely to lose focus to work and other commitments. I\u0027m hoping this Patreon will help to buy the development team more time to work on projects we love and you love too. This page is mainly for those of you who would like some more previews and goodies on our upcoming games, and also don\u0027t mind helping out a development team to keep up running costs, pay the bills and focus time and attention on producing these wonderful playthings. In time we hope to offer you guys some physical rewards too, but for now it\u0027s all about updates and digital goodies!\u003cbr\u003e"
