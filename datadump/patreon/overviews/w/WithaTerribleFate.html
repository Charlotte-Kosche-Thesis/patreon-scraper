We believe that people have only just begun to scratch the surface of analyzing the special storytelling of video games; we\u0027re trying to develop a new, rigorous way to think about this young, powerful medium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith a Terrible Fate \u003c/em\u003estarted when founder Aaron Suduiko decided he wanted to study the storytelling of video games as part of his philosophy degree in college. He grew up playing video games the way other people read novels, and always thought there was something special about their stories. When Nintendo announced that they were remaking \u003cem\u003eMajora\u0027s Mask \u003c/em\u003efor the 3DS, he decided to spend three months analyzing what made the story of \u003cem\u003eMajora\u0027s Mask \u003c/em\u003eso artistically groundbreaking. This blog grew into \u003cem\u003eWith a Terrible Fate, \u003c/em\u003eas he brought on more writers and began the task of understanding how video games tell such amazing stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus far, our content has primarily long-form, extremely analytical and precise articles discussing both the stories of particular video games, and also the storytelling of video games more generally. We\u0027ve also presented our work at venues like PAX Australia (fully documented\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://withaterriblefate.com/2017/07/03/pax-aus-2016-press-x-to-scream-full-presentation-content/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), PAX East (full video\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/VNveucchvBw\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), PAX West (soon!), Harvard, and the British Society of Aesthetics. Our work on games like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://withaterriblefate.com/xenoblade-chronicles-nintendo-2010/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eXenoblade Chronicles\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://withaterriblefate.com/nier-square-enix-2010/\"\u003eNier\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eis also frequently cited on reddit and other game discussion forums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that it\u0027s absolutely crucial to understand the stories of video games on a new level. People, especially children, are increasingly engaging with video games rather than traditional media like books. Learning how to seriously understand video games as stories, then, can allow gamers to see them as more than mere \"entertainment\": we can come to discover some of the deepest and richest themes that stories can offer us within the code of video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, the site generates no revenue: everything that happens on the site is the result of volunteer hours, because we love thinking seriously about video games. That means funding is the biggest bottleneck in growing the site. We would love to be able to work on the site full time, creating way more content and growing it in exciting new ways\u2014but we need your help to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t want to rely on ads for funding because we want the focus to always remain squarely on serious video game analysis, not on any sort of sponsored contents. That\u0027s why we want to give you, our readers, the chance to contribute to our success and growth. If you love what we do, please help us do more of it! You\u0027ll get special rewards as a bonus\u2014rewards that are geared towards giving you more intimate access to how we think about video games on the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does the Money Go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are nice-to-have\u0027s, and there are have-to-have\u0027s. Right now, your contributions would go towards securing the team\u0027s basic needs so we could spend more time developing the site. Once we gain some basic support, we can start looking to exciting ways to grow the site. We have lots of ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave-to-have\u0027s: \u003c/strong\u003ebasic income (the writers currently make no money for any of their work), games (we want to analyze the latest games for you, and most new games cost $60), convention travel (we want to speak at as many cons as possible, but airfare and hotels add up), and site development (we want to improve the actual structure of the site, but contractors like web developers and graphic designers aren\u0027t cheap).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNice-to-have\u0027s. \u003c/strong\u003eHere are just a few ideas of how we\u0027d develop the site if we had the funds and flexibility to do so: a podcast where the team discusses ideas they have about games in a more relaxed manner than our articles; a book about video game analysis based on our work; a YouTube channel of video-based, rigorous game analysis; sending analysts to E3 to analyze upcoming, big-name titles; and (Dream of Dreams) a conference dedicated exclusively to the analysis of video game storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your continued support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Whether or not you decide to contribute, we hope you continue to enjoy our work!"
