To me those words echo a truth that I have always known at some deep part of my being.

I believe that we live out the stories in our heads as though they are real whether or not they actually are. And therefore when we understand our stories, we understand the kinds of lives we create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI help become become not only better storytellers and presenters, but also better integrated individuals who can face the darkest, most painful elements of our past and change the negative and diminishing stories into stories of strength. \u003cbr\u003e",
