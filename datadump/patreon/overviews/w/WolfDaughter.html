It\u0027s my passion.\u00a0I created many award-winning pieces of art back in high school and university. I was selling a good number of my pieces back then as well. Why did I stop creating? I was doing so well. Never time like the present to start again. Being laid off from my job at the first of the year has encouraged me to make a living working for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy previous works already contained elements of surrealism, and I really enjoyed that. My new work will continue to include surrealism and I want to begin experimenting with automatic drawing as I explore my connection with nature, spiritual experiences, and nightly dreams. I\u0027m improving my skills of digital painting, so some of my work will be digital, but some will be traditional pieces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYoutube Art and Adventure Vlogs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to record as much of my process as possible, and create videos and tutorials for Youtube, so that others can see how I work and maybe learn something from my techniques.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support will help provide basic needs and resources for projects. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with your help, I will create: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOriginal traditional and digital drawings and paintings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArt Vlogs on Youtube\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eexperiment and expand knowledge of videography to create exciting adventure videos of hiking and camping trips to share that knowledge and experience with you\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand experiment with nature/landscape/waterscape photography.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s the breakdown: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$750 - \"Dreaming of Shelter\" - This amount covers my rent each month.\u003cbr\u003e$1,000 - \"Dreaming of Lights, Heat, and Water\" - This amount pays my utilities, keeps the heat and lights on, the water running, and the internet on. (FYI - I don\u0027t have a cell phone, cable, or TV. So you\u0027re not wasting your money on that stuff.)\u003cbr\u003e$1,300 - \"Dreaming of New Clothes\" - I have a little extra money to replace old clothes.\u003cbr\u003e$1,500 - \"Living!\" - Your patronage is allowing me to have all of my basic necessities and pursue my passion of creating art full time!\u003cbr\u003e$1,600 - \"Paying it Forward\" - I become a Patron and start supporting other artists, because I want them to flourish too.\u003cbr\u003e$2,000 - \"Dreaming of a New Computer\" - I start saving money to replace my six year old laptop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have set a few smaller pledge goals along the way for fun (money goes towards necessities first). These are here so I can give away free art.
