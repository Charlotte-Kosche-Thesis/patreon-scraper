    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Ashton Sperry, but most of you know me as N\u0027wah, WhoDrewThis, or one of my similar avatars all over the net. Once, long ago, I created the Pathfinder Paper Minis line, licensed by Paizo Publishing, LLC- one of the biggest names in pen and paper gaming to this day. I\u0027ve also hired myself out as a freelance illustrator to many smaller 3rd-party gaming developers, including Kobold Press/Open Design, Rite Publishing, and Legendary Games. During my heyday, I produced, on average, 7 to 8 illustrations per month on my DeviantART page alone (which precluded the hundreds of illustrations I did professionally, in 95% of cases).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I kinda lost my mind for a while. Sorry about that. I won\u0027t bore you with the details, but like more than plenty of artists, I\u0027ve struggled with depression and other mental issues for decades. Recently, I acquired a new antidepressant that seems to be working well, and it seems at long last I can produce art again. Which should hopefully be good news for all of you folks. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may know me as the guy who made, funded, then failed to produce the IndieGoGo project, Astounding Minis, something that still haunts me to this day. One of my major goals is to get to a point where I can finally fulfill that IndieGoGo project. At the moment, with ever-growing poverty being a consistent issue, I need to put my money towards paying off debt and feeding my family first, but once I get past the absolute poverty level (at about $700 a month consistently) I can finally get to my long-lost-but-not-forgotten donors, who generously donated to me way back before I\u0027d heard of Patreon. If I had, I would have set something like this up long ago, letting folks donate a few bucks a month for art in small batches, like I am doing now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s the general idea for this Patreon. Months and months of not producing art had left me worse off than ever before, and I\u0027d like to get back into it in a way that lets me follow my heart but gives you fine folks some creative input and allows for a fun and enjoyable series of illustrations that anyone can use for pretty much anything they\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, That Was a Wall of Text. What Do I Get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully a lot! On top of early access to the finalized art at the lowest tiers, at higher tiers you can have more say into my creative output. I hope to hold polls on a variety of mediums, and will find some way to hold them so that only Patreon supporters can vote. Communication being key, I\u0027ll look into ways to share the current voted-on project ideas with all of you. As I move beyond bare-minimum living, I can afford things like better art gear (computers, tablets, software, etc.) and go beyond that to allow for things like art streams and the like. With your help, we can do all sorts of interesting stuff! Thanks, internet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more detailed info, check the stuff over there on the side of the page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo How Do I Know You\u0027ll Deliver?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis used to be an issue I was concerned about myself- then I made over 500 tokens, an illustrated campaign journal the size of a decent novel, and random other stuff on top of all that. If you like images of critters inside octagons, you\u0027ll be well satisfied at the $1 mark- anything beyond that is between you, your wallet, and your willingness to support a magical dream.\u003cbr\u003e"
