    "summary": "My name is Waylon Wesley Hicken. I am an aspiring web comic illustrator from South Africa.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI remember drawing my first couple of comic strips during 5th grade and right throughout high school. I would only end up taking it a lot more seriously when I went on to college. This was when I decided to pursue it as a career, the only problem was that in South Africa there isn\u0027t much of an industry for comics, so I had to attempt to submit my ideas to comic publishers overseas which would usually result in my my work being rejected numerous times. So I decided to take matters into my own hands and use Patreon as a platform to self publish my work and forge the way to making this dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the first projects I have started to work on is a cyberpunk web comic series called Divinus Machina (The Divine Machine) The story is set in the year 2063 and follows a secret religious cult of cybernetically enhanced assassins who believe it is their divine duty to seek out and punish the wicked. The story will follow one such assassin named Angela De Silva as she begins to unravel the truth about this \"ancient\" order and the conspiracies behind it whilst trying to discover what it means to be human in a world where advancing technology seems to overshadow individual identity. I will be uploading new pages every week on Web Toons for free but those who support me will get to download entire issues in PDF format which will feature extra content in the form of concept art and additional lore and character Bio\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to all those who pledge to support me and lets embark on this journey together of cyberpunk awesomeness!!"
