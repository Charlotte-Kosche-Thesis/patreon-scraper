It\u2019s now two years since WiSP Sports was launched and during that time we have built a network of podcasts across all sports and topics in the world of women\u2019s sports. We have been fortunate to have talked with many female athletes and other women who have made sport their life and it this community that has enabled us to establish the world\u2019s largest podcast network for women\u2019s sport. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith the rapid growth of the network, we continue to appreciate the potential that we have to create something special.

To take WiSP Sports Radio to the next level requires production dollars. We recognize that a live podcast needs to be the main focus of our next programming phase, specifically a daily magazine-style show that will appeal to a wider audience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also want to offer even more for women who enjoy sports but do not take part in competitions, for example, yoga, pilates, and other recreational activities. These, together with other lifestyle topics, sportswear, nutrition, and health would be featured on a morning show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for supporting what we are doing to increase our programs because women in sport deserve equal coverage - and you deserve to hear about it.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
