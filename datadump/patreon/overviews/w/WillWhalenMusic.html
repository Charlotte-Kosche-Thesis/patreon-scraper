    "summary": "I like to create and perform songs that range as widely as my mood, and that explore and revisit the truths that I\u0027ve come to understand over my lifetime. The vital but elusive focus required to live in an increasingly overwhelming and distracting world, the tension between reassuring certainty and exciting mystery, the danger of mistaking isolation for self-sufficiency... Not to mention, songs about train thieves, grumpy bartenders, bad jobs, good booze, and kind women.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about the act: I use guitar, effects, keyboard, and a loop station to create a show that stays interesting, but I\u0027m always looking for new ways to spice up the act. I\u0027ve made up songs onstage, played using found items as instruments, and walked among the audience \"minstrel style\" when my gadgets have stopped working. Just give me an instrument, point me in a direction, and I\u0027ll make it interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m a solo singer-songwriter, I like to be creative in non-musical ways that still serve my performances. Graphic design for flyers, illustrations for album art, recording and mixing techniques, and all the different uses there are for clear, concise writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, join me. Become a Patron and see what I\u0027ve got in store.\u003cbr\u003e"
