If you look back at my videos from only one year ago, you can see a huge difference in quality. I\u2019ve learned so much in my short time on Youtube, and I have loved improving. However, I\u2019ve gotten to this point where there\u2019s not a ton more I can do to improve my craft without more resources. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve started this Patreon. This isn\u2019t some thing where I need this money to continue doing what I\u2019m doing\u2014it\u2019s for improving what I\u2019m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nEvery dollar contributed to this Patreon will go straight into the channel.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI mean that. At the end of each month, I\u2019m going to release a report showing how I spent your money. With this Patreon, you can be sure that the dollar you put into it will come back to you in the form of a better video. I\u2019m absolutely committed to this. I can make the money I need for living through advertising on videos, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve made this policy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy initial ideas for improvement are the following. There are certain videos that could benefit from very specific visuals. I rely heavily on stock footage for my videos, but there\u2019s only so much that you can find online. For certain topics, I just need to go on location to properly show what I\u2019m trying to explain. I\u2019m not trying to change the format of my video and become Tom Scott. I just would like to be able to travel on location for certain videos to capture visuals, learn more, and perhaps do interviews. That will be one of my first priorities. I also want to improve the production quality of my video. I\u2019m fairly inept at video production, so that would entail hiring people to do things like sound and animation. Again, I\u2019m not going to change my style, I just want to make it cleaner and more professional. As of now, it\u2019s my idea to do a search process among my fans for an animator once I have enough contributions to support that. A small amount of the money might go to hardware and software purchases and other trivial things (like taxes\u2026 eww.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStickers will look like this: (I\u0027ll update this with a real photo once they arrive)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/d61e82e865948a1e26ea26774c5cc1c2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eT-shirt design isn\u0027t finalized yet, but I promise it will look good.
