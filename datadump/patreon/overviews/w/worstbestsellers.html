If \nsomebody only ever reads James Patterson books, or vampire books, or \nmagazines: more power to them, we say. We\u2019re reading these books because\n we\u2019re curious about what\u2019s popular, and also, reading these books gives\n us a better idea of what\u2019s popular and how to give good readers \nadvisory. We make jokes about the books we read, but our intent is never\n to make fun of \n\u003cem\u003ereaders\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve been coming out with a bi-weekly podcast (plus a few bonus episodes) since September 2014! We make a small amount of money through the Amazon affiliate links on our website, we but run a free and ad-free podcast. (Despite our running joke, we have never taken--nor been offered--money from Christian Mingle dot com).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support will cover our hosting costs, as well as the cost of when we have to buy used books for 1 cent on Amazon because our local libraries have already discarded the books we want to read. (Or when we have to actually purchase \u003cem\u003eGrey\u003c/em\u003e because there are too many holds on it and we wanted to talk about it when it was still popular. For example.) It will also help us pay our editor Becca for her many hours editing out all the times Duarte knocks over Renata\u0027s microphone. Also, it will allow us to purchase adult beverages to help us cope with our literary life choices. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much for your support, Best Listeners! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l4hLHJCwpscYLkArm/giphy.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s What Our Fans Say\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\"You\u0027re going to pay everyone $1 to listen to your podcast?
