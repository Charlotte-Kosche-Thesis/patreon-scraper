    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For over five years now, we\u0027ve worked hard to build a community of people dedicated to the first-ever crowd-sourced non-religious holiday. With the power of absurdist activism we have inspired hundreds to join us in generating this holiday alternative, igniting creativity, creating community, and ultimately\u00a0awareness of Native American marginalization. For many, Wizardsgiving has become their favorite time of year, and in these few short years has managed to light candles in\u00a0New York, California, Virginia, Washington, Oregon, and Michigan. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCelebrated by families and friends on the third Saturday of November, the rest of the year is spent in anticipation, where we as producers generate stories, ideas, characters, history and traditions to flesh out the fictionalized holiday as though it were real.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Much of our time, love, and money has gone into forming this absurdist vision of protest, and we have so much more we want to share, so many things we want to give, and thousands more people we want to reach out to. With as little as $1 a month, you can help us turn the third Saturday of November into a globally-celebrated weirdness, garnering the attention, aid our small staff in updating the website with new information, supplying social media, and moderating forums to generate more ideas from our fans. Eventually with enough support, we can guarantee Native American charities can receive a hefty percentage of our donations and our fans can start seeing the story of Wizardsgiving unfold through new forms of media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Currently, we work as a small team of actors, inventors, designers, writers and event managers to try to form the world framed by artist Sean M Dooley and filled by our own community of fans. While we have succeeded in making the world worth celebrating as well as bring it to life, it isn\u0027t enough. We want everyone who is curious about this holiday alternative to participate on a greater level, whether that be meeting like-minded folks more easily, getting free merchandise from us to show your hamomancer pride, watch short videos of canon characters at their craft, or even go to a giant public Wizardsgiving, with sets, effects, and fully immersive character interaction. It sounds crazy, but with 1500 fans contributing just one dollar, we could begin the groundwork to achieving that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 At our third-level goal, our wildest dreams come true and we get to do this all the time AS OUR JOB, for you, the fans. Three books will be released, \u003cem\u003eThe Greenhorn Guide\u003c/em\u003e (a beginner\u0027s magic guide from the Wizardsgiving universe),\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Ultimately\u00a0Neverending Wizardsgiving Handbook, \u003c/em\u003eand of course the fabled \u003cem\u003eFestumnomicon\u003c/em\u003e, (the Wizardsgiving cookbook). All three will feature input on traditions, characters, settings and concepts from our fans, making that information printed and ultimately canon to the universe. Along with the books\u0027 release, we will be creating a dungeon crawl text-based adventure, an 8-bit game that crawls the Ordo Artes Magicae castle of Galdr\u0027s Fell, and of course\u00a0continue our effort in creating more\u00a0contests, merchandise, and\u00a0large-scale events than ever before, bringing our crazy community of magic-users together to share their characters, stories and local traditions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 So help us build this world with you, one step towards Galdr\u0027s Fell at a time, and use our awesome nerdiness to do some good in the world while having fun and making a strange mark in history."
