    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi friends! Thanks for checking out my Patreon page. I\u0027m creating some fun stuff and I would love it if you would join me on this crazy adventure.\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, have you ever had an idea for something, say, a comic that was just too weird, bizarre and really not suitable for anyone? Hey me, too! Mine is called Wicked Crispy and I created it at a tough time in my life as a way to make myself laugh. I had no real intentions of trying to pitch this to many publishers, or really anyone for that matter. In fact, it\u0027s just kinda gross, juvenile humor but it does the trick for the 12 year old living inside me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eOver the last few years it\u0027s been going online steadily, and sometimes more sporadically than I would like, but ever onward. Most of the starts and stop link directly to other comics/freelance workloads and as I move thru the deadlines, I always find my way back to my weird, little webcomic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of my Patreon page is to allow me more time/resources to be able to take on less \"extra\" work and focus on my own stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo check it out at Wickedcrispy.com why not? If you like it maybe think about tossing a buck my way or there\u0027s even just a flat donate button if that\u0027s your cup of Joe. The more I can justify making this abomination over doing real work, the better I\u0027ll sleep. I\u0027m adding a few rewards tiers, but the comic is free either way. Thanks for your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eC.G. Rine"
