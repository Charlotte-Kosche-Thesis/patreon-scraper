I am a professional entertainer and an unprofessional traveler. I have a YouTube page about my adventures, which at the moment is almost entirely about Fruit Hunting (tracking down rare fruit around the world).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon will give you a chance to help support my video series in exchange for rewards and lead to better content overall. Don\u0027t worry, videos will be FREE whether you contribute or not!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I give you my hard earned money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the thing. I\u0027m not asking for contributions to make a profit, I\u0027m doing it to feed a habit! I spend a lot of my time and money making these videos and it only brings in a small amount of revenue. I would like to get my hands on more weird fruit, expand my series, travel further, bring you more content and have better quality videos! To do this I need a bigger budget than what YouTube provides.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also will get some great rewards, including exclusive content and access to videos before they are made available to the public. My regular videos are of course free, but as a supporter you get VIP access!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would my money go toward?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith a bigger budget, I will be able to afford to spend more time creating videos. Right now I post one video a week on fruit hunting. With more funding, there will be a new series on\u00a0traveling to the strangest places around the world and plans for other exciting series as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts also getting more difficult and expensive to find new fruits to review, so with a bigger budget I can spend more to find even rarer and more interesting fruit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThanks to the contributions here on Patreon, I have decided to increase my output of videos to TWO a week.

To reward your obsessive fandom, I will personally take you on a fruit market tour in NYC, film it and post it online. You must pay for your own travel/food/accomodations and you must NOT be insane to qualify for this reward. For example, If you show up at my doorstep with a traffic cone on your head and start waving a dead squirrel in my face... you will lose this reward. The money you spent to pay for the tour will be used for the inevitable therapy I will need after meeting you and therefor will not be refunded. You will however continue to receive the other rewards.",
