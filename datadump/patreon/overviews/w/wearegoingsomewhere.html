She\u0027s been fighting very bravely so far (November 2016) but the challenges ahead of us are very stressful and very difficult (especially the financial ones). We are not giving up, in fact we are trying to live our lives as fully as we can, because... nothing makes one feel more alive than a cancer diagnosis! Therefore our daily vlog, even though it is INCREDIBLY hard to maintain is what keeps us going!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are daily vloggers. We are filmmakers and photographers with a vision, skill and complete dedication. We do what we love and love what we do. We care a lot about every single client and every single person we meet on our way. Our basic business is the very competitive field of wedding photography and wedding films. It is not enough to support ourselves in those challenging times but we won\u0027t stop! We\u0027ll keep fighting till Blonnie becomes cancer free! Please help us achieve this goal and save her life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Providing entertainment for you our dear Patrons will be #1 priority. No excuses. Just quality videos. We\u0027ll go to the other end of the World to prove it (wait, we already are doing that...) so this time we would do it for the sole purpose of creating GoingSomewhere films that will be a large tv network show worthy! No no, we\u0027re completely serious about this!",

We have ideas, plenty of ideas actually. We are creative people after all. Our combined 21 years of career in photography and film and HUNDREDS of hapy clients prove it! What do we want? Be the killer filmmakers. Content creators that everyone talks about. We want it BAD! Let\u0027s make it happen!",

Script writers, make up artists, lighting crew, additional shooters - they would all be our in house crew at a new location. Sky is the limit!
