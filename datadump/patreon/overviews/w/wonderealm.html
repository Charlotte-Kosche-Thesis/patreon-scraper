    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eLegend of the Sunset People\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the title of my latest passion - the untold epic of the people who first encountered the icy winters and unrelenting summers of the ancient boreal forests on the Canadian Shield. During a grueling trek, driven relentlessly by their enemies and fending off dangers both mundane and unearthly, the tribe experiences loss and love, sacrifice and joy. \u00a0The myths and legends of the Anishinaabe... based on a true story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhat exactly are we doing here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking comics, that\u0027s what.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA 180 page original graphic novel isn\u0027t a project which is undertaken lightly, nor is it easy to complete. That\u0027s where you come in. \u00a0Having been inspired by the history of the Northern Ontario town that I lived in for the better part of a decade, I researched, plotted, wrote and began drawing the saga of a people who will never surrender to their enemies, nor to the harsh and demanding environment into which they find themselves running. \u00a0This story is not only important to me, personally, but provides content to the under-served demographic of native teens and young adults who rarely see themselves portrayed in any media, much less comics. \u00a0In addition, it provides insight into some of the best myths and legends I was able to find from local elders, library and museum research and the internet - but most of all, it\u0027s a fun and thrilling adventure tale, set against the pre-historic Canadian wilderness; a romp filled with tall tales, larger than life heroes and villains, dramatic action set pieces and supernatural and fantasy elements seemingly designed to spur the imagination! \u00a0If you become a patron or not, the book is well underway to completion - but that deadline can be shorter if you decide to help out. \u00a0Every time I present a new page of story I\u0027ll earn a little extra income, and if that income grows large enough, it\u0027ll allow me to take off time from my other commitments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ePretty simple, really. When I hit 4 (or more) fully illustrated, coloured and lettered story pages posted in a calendar month, I\u0027ll invoice you through Patreon. If I don\u0027t, well, too bad for me, and I\u0027m sorry for you that I didn\u0027t get you that new content you were hoping for: but here\u0027s the thing - you still get to look at all the archives and see the extra content \u003cem\u003eAT NO CHARGE TO YOU!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, for example, if I only do three pages? \u00a0You get those for free! \u00a0On the1st of the next month, the calendar rolls over, and we start again - I have to commit to getting you 4 pages posted, or there\u0027s no charge, for that month also.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would you do it like that? \u00a0Are you some kind of masochistic psycho?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eYes and no? There are certainly drawbacks to doing this way, but I thought it was the most fair way to offer this to my patrons. \u00a0Also, I hope this method will help motivate me, even when other work has me worn out, to make sure that I can get some content out, and continue to make progress on this story. \u00a0Let\u0027s see if it works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eSo is that it?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot at all! There are, in fact, even more incentives for you to contribute. \u00a0As a patron, you\u0027ll be awarded with giveaways, free art prints and original art, behind the scenes looks at the development of the work, and a direct line to the art and the artist. \u00a0If we\u0027re successful in our partnership, you\u0027ll also be among the first to own a printed copy of the finished graphic novel. As well, I hope to provide a chance for contributors to enter contests to win original art or other great prizes. \u00a0If we all work together on this the sky is the limit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, the fun doesn\u0027t stop there. \u00a0I\u0027m a creative person, and as such I\u0027m constantly coming up with new ideas. \u00a0I have several of these, which I will bring to the Patreon site and you\u0027ll be able to provide feedback into the development of these new and hopefully exciting story ideas! \u00a0Along the way, we\u0027ll have more and more special content for those who subscribe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what\u0027s the deal then? \u00a0Well, the fact is, you don\u0027t have to contribute anything... I\u0027ll still be here, doing the work, still cooking up the stories and making the (presumably) pretty pictures. \u00a0As I mentioned before, any income generated from the site only helps me produce it faster - and the more donations we get the more content I can provide to those who have helped out! \u00a0So, really, it\u0027s a win/win situation... and the BEST part is: you get to decide when and how much (including monthly limits) you feel comfortable helping out with! \u00a0Of course, if you don\u0027t find it interesting anymore, you can also cancel at any time. \u00a0And if I don\u0027t produce, you don\u0027t contribute anything - that\u0027s your guarantee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks for taking the time to read this far and see what it\u0027s all about. \u00a0I hope you like what I have and will continue to create, and if you decide to join me on this experiment, I appreciate it so much, it\u0027s beyond words!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re ready...? It\u0027s time to enter the Wonderealm."

Shawn\u0027s first professionally published work, the graphic novel \u003cstrong\u003eDrive\u003c/strong\u003e, proved to be an incredible learning experience and Shawn has continued to grow as an artist with every subsequent project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to his ongoing solo graphic novel \u003cstrong\u003eLegend of the Sunset People\u003c/strong\u003e, Shawn loves to experiment with subject matter, form and style and is an avid collaborator.
