Debating brings insight, intellectual challenge and motivation into my everyday life, and I decided it was my ultimate passion, and have been doing it ever since. I grew up initially in New York, and am the oldest of five brothers, who I try to see as often as I can. I spend my free time writing, and developing interesting articles, and with my brother that lives closest to me in TN. It has always been my vision to bring people together and turn negative destructive argument into an outcome that is not only positive, but influential.\u00a0",

This tier can also come on air as many times as they would like with We Suppose, and invite who they would like to have on air. There is no limit to how many topics they can discuss on air. They can also promote their own YouTube, or Facebook community, or any other endeavor they are working on while they are on air. The Great Debater can also have the opportunity to join the owner of We Suppose. (Michael Ringrose) when he attends other programs on air with experts on other popular channels that are on air and debate different topics. This Tier will provide you with the ability to reach more people, and have full open communication with any member of We Suppose. The Great Debater can also make new categories if they see fit for debate topics, and have a say in change in rules, and policy, and how the group is run after they cast their vote with the administrators of the group. The Great Debater will also have a vote in any changes made within the group, as well as who becomes the new moderators, that are in charge of keeping the group a good place to be to voice your claim\u0027s and positions on all topics.\u00a0",
