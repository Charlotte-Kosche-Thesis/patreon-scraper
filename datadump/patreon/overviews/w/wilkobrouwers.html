    "summary": "Dear friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYears ago I was a member of a jury that had to judge newly written children songs. I then\u00a0realized how hard it is to write something simple, which yet has both originality and high quality. These three features are always on my mind when I am composing: I want a piece to be understandable (which doesn\u0027t mean: easy), original and of high quality. The desire to write\u00a0understandable music comes from the desire to reach people. I think the contemporary composer needs to find a way to motivate singers and players to perform\u00a0his music\u00a0with ardor\u00a0and to offer the\u00a0listeners\u00a0beauty. This is why I\u00a0am fascinated by\u00a0Gregorian chant. Its melodic idiom is relatively simple and extremely rich in the same time. It conveys a message in which the messenger himself tries to stay in obscurity as much as possible. I am fascinated by the human voice with its countless colors and expressive possibilities. I am fascinated by language and by the borderland of speech and song. I am fasinated by the sacred act of playing, playing as a child does, which is the unlimited exploration of limited materials. I am fascinated by music as the language of a united mankind. I am fascinated by people who inspire each other, even without knowing that they do.\u003cbr\u003eI truly hope not only to be supported but also to be inspired by you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace to you all,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWilko\u003cbr\u003e"
