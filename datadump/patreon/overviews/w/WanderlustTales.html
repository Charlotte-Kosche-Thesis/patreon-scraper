    "summary": "Hello there, I\u2019m Meesh! I\u2019m a freelance artist living in Austin, TX. My husband Dyslexicoedr is a software engineer here working in video games. We\u2019re both avid pen and paper RPG players and have enjoyed the hobby for decades. We often talk about things we like and dislike about the games we play, which led to us deciding to take a crack of making a world of our own which embraces the good things and tosses out the bad. With this goal in mind we began working on\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b240/rahsyk/Patreon%20assets/Wanderlust%20Tales%20logo%20transp%20small.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is the Wanderlust Tales?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Wanderlust Tales is a project my husband and I have been working on for a year now. We want to create a fantasy setting in which to write stories, comics, and more. Traditional fantasy media is peppered with tropes that we just don\u2019t like, and we felt we could remove or change them to make a more open and enjoyable world for us and others to work in. It\u2019s very important that other people be welcome to join in the fun with us. We take great joy in creative collaboration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese stories all take place in a world we created called Yende. I\u2019ve always wanted a land filled with dragons, and that\u2019s what we set out to create here. In this world dragons are people, same as humans, and often live alongside the smaller folk. There are magical races and creatures galore in this place. World building is one of our favorite activities, and my husband and I aim to fill Yende with all manner of amazing things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b240/rahsyk/Patreon%20assets/Yende%20map%20transp%20small.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would love to be able to devote a large chunk of our time to working on this project. With the backing of Patrons we can spend more time fleshing out this world with art and stories. Comics, visual novels, and RPG rules to run games in Yende are all attainable goals. There\u0027s no limit to what we can do! With your support we can make this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b240/rahsyk/Patreon%20assets/Bob%20and%20Raz%20Patreon%20transp.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to make this an open world: the stories, art, and world building that goes on here will eventually be passed on to the public. We update the Wanderlust Tales tumblr regularly, and I don\u2019t want to cut off people who cannot afford to support the project. That said, Patrons who support us get everything FIRST and they will get more robust content. Longer posts, more art, more color, more interaction with the creators, sneak peeks at upcoming projects, rough comic pages, and more!  Patrons will also have a chance to have their characters canonically included in the stories and comics of this world, view private livestreams, and have a chance to give input on what to develop next in Yende. Any and all Wanderlust Codexes (digital publications full of art, info, and stories about Yende) that are released will be in the hands of Patrons before anyone else gets to see them. There\u2019s going to be a lot of treats for our supporters! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this project builds up steam and gets rolling, we\u2019ll add in extra stretch goals and reward tiers. I\u2019d really love to offer physical goodies to you guys. I put a lot of energy into things I care about, so if we jump into a milestone goal before we hit the money goal, I\u2019ll add new ones as we go. With the help of you lovely Patrons, I think we can make amazing things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b240/rahsyk/Patreon%20assets/Patreon%20portraits.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFollow us on Twitter and Tumblr!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MeeshDrawsGood\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@idrawgood \u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dyslexiCoedr\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@dyslexicoedr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://idrawgood.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eidrawgood on tumblr\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://dyslexicoedr.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edyslexicoedr on tumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmail: Meesh.arts@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow \u003ca href=\"http://the-wanderlust-tales.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Wanderlust Tales\u003c/a\u003e on tumblr!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
