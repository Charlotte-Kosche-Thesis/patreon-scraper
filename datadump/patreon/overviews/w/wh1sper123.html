    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho am I?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one very private person who doesn\u0027t really like to talk about himself, but that is not really the story being told here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a rabid RPG fan where my favorite game and main focus of all my videos is Dragon\u0027s Dogma. I made quite a few so far and based on receipt I guess I am not doing bad job. You can watch them here\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZSazQkanwU8oJ2sctVCFwA/videos\"\u003eAll videos\u003c/a\u003e or in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZSazQkanwU8oJ2sctVCFwA/playlists\"\u003eSorted playlists\u003c/a\u003e. Not all videos are in playlists\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other thing I am working on is a full blown Dragon\u0027s Dogma inspired RPG since by now it is painfully obvious that Capcom doesn\u0027t plan on making any sequel and even if they did, it would end up disappointment like DD Online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDragon\u0027s Dogma\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e videos in the first place?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, it is best RPG in history that definitely deserves that kind of attention. Some mechanics in that game are just off this world when you compare it to other games in the genre.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I really hope my insights will help new players in making game far more enjoyable. And I hope even more on getting insight feedback from other people\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird and actually most important to me and probably a little bit selfish... The main reason I started doing this is to get in contact with as many Dogma fans as possible for the game I am working on in hope to get the feedback on my own game based on the parts I deem ready when they are by presenting them to exact type of player as I am targeting with my game\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow are Dragon\u0027s Dogma videos even connected with the game making?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, that is the thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDragon\u0027s Dogma did some things so right and better than any other RPG that I hope I will get some insight on my videos from other people in order to make mine better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the same time Dragon\u0027s Dogma also pulled some really hardcore crap that should\u0027ve never passed through any kind of testing phase. Just case example, who in the right mind puts blocking commentary in the middle of the action where action continues, but you\u0027re unable to move until you click away the comments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetting the feedback on my own game from the very people who I am targeting is probably the most valuable feedback I can ever hope for. The big plan is to showcase things when they are ready and hope to get as much criticism as possible in order to be able to fix things preemptively or just plain make them better because people saw things I didn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you tell more about the game?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the thing. I really don\u0027t want to as making that would put me in a bind of what I promised and how I promised which is a really bad start. This is exact reason why I am hoping on feedback to parts when they are ready on my channel where subscribers are exact type of person that is my target audience and then if needed approve/scratch/fix/redo in order to make it better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would guess that my description of what I like and what I dislike in Dogma should paint good enough picture of the direction I am taking and my Dogma videos should very well tell the story of how much I think about internals of that game. These two should probably paint a really good picture what I want to make\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I like in Dogma\u003cbr\u003e- Drop dead gorgeous environments. As graphically inferior as it is to other games, the environments are not bland, they are more like work of art where it is obvious how much thought they put into that. You just move a little and whole environment changes completely, each area has something unique vibe going on\u003cbr\u003e- Combat system, climbing and big monsters... need I say more? Well, the first two could surely use improvements, but they are still ahead of any other RPG\u003cbr\u003e- Pawn system, no matter how many faults... it simply grows on you\u003cbr\u003e- Choice penalties... create character in a certain way and you get benefits and drawbacks. Create it differently and the two change. This is certainly aspect that I really want to expand on in more ways than just character creation\u003cbr\u003e- The things you can do in that game. Some things are just off this world imaginative. Probably best case is something like this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/09ZjvpsI8xM\"\u003eVideo\u003c/a\u003e I made\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhat I don\u0027t like in Dogma\u003cbr\u003e- Story... was there one at all? That is certainly one aspect it is best to avoid completely. And the worst part is that story has no intriguing plot or anything whatsoever\u003cbr\u003e- Interface... it is god dawg terrible no matter if you use controller or keyboard and mouse\u003cbr\u003e- Killing myself whole time... I mean, if I ever made graph of which enemy killed me the most... My bar would be so high that you would need 100x zoom in order for the second highest to even be visible. There are definitely good ways for that to not be necessary\u003cbr\u003e- Cinematics going in the way of playing that cannot be disabled or camera changing because game thought it would be good to do so. Some cinematics completely ignore the option to disable them.\u003cbr\u003e- Level up system and enemy (not) scaling\u003cbr\u003e- Lack of making game harder. As it is you have to go through almost insane hoops to get it working for you\u003cbr\u003e- Disturbing effects. I doubt there is one player that could say he likes Exilaration effect or how game turns black and slows down on enemy spawn\u003cbr\u003e- Late enemy popup\u003cbr\u003e- DD take on the R in RPG. Making gear only usable for certain classes really bogs down the imagination as well as some other missing aspects that could improve that a lot\u003cbr\u003e- Save system. I really like one single save idea, but the limitations imposed by DD are not good choice at all. Who likes one single character?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStrangely, there are far more bad things I named... still, the good ones outweigh the bad into almost nonexistent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I miss in Dogma?\u003cbr\u003e- PvP and Coop, but I can already say that this will come much later in my game. As the old saying goes \"First you learn to walk, then you start running\". Game should be done well before even tackling the two\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can tell one thing for definite though. It will be multiplatform with Linux as first target since that is where it is developed on. That doesn\u0027t mean other platforms will be crippled since Unreal 4 does really good job of being consistent as long as you have multiplatform in mind whole time. The only reason for bogus ports in the games is simply lack of planning during initial development. I only specified Linux especially since Linux is exact platform that suffers bogus port syndrome the most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhy the Patreon?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one,... I have been asked few times now if there is a way to donate on my youtube channel and privately. And since I always addressed more or less every video request so far it is only right to finally address these too\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor another,... making it a little more self sufficient would help my game to progress faster and there are definitely tools and assets I could use to bypass some of the work as well as invest more times into making videos about Dragon\u0027s Dogma\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat does my money actually pay for?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is another story for itself. I myself don\u0027t know how to say this, but if there is one thing I like... it is brutal honesty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would keep making both videos and work on my game even without the funding and that is because I want to do them. The only difference funding would do is alleviate more and more strains in life in order to be able to focus more on the two of my tasks. So... here... I said it\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough, there would be one big difference. I would most probably invest into my recording PC in order to make better quality videos\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in case if someone decides what I am doing is worth supporting... big thanks, but not so much for the money as much as for giving vote what I am doing is worth supporting and it is not just meaningless work\u003cbr\u003e"
