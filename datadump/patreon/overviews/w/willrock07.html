    "summary": "Howdy!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Will Harby, better known by my artist moniker \"WillRock\" in the video game music community. I have made over 70 free video game remixes, and also release original music. I love both making music and video games, so putting the two together was always a forgone conclusion :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m probably best known for my work on OverClocked Remix, having over 40 remixes of free video game remixes accepted on the website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can listen one of my remixes, The Moon theme from Ducktales right here:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHr174DB1Ak\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make original music, both for fun and as in video game/film.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d say my signature style is Progressive synth rock with chiptune elements, with a strong emphasis on melody and big epic sound design.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can hear one of my original tracks here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuwXh5Zszs0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VuwXh5Zszs0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to be able to do this as a full time job, in order to do that, I need your help. So I ask that if you enjoy my music, please consider supporting me! Its for a good cause! ^-^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... why should you support me? Well, you will have access to all my tracks as soon as they are finished! Everything will be posted here before they\u0027re officially released! That includes WIPs and tracks I\u0027m unlikely to finish, which means there will be work I\u0027m posting here that won\u0027t see the light of day anywhere else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince i\u0027ve set an amount per song, I guess you\u0027ll be wondering about my output consistency. The plan is to do 2-3 tracks a month, if time and inspiration permits me. That said, I will not be going over 3 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to earn a living from my music is my dream, and if you enjoy my work and want to see more, please consider being my supporter on patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this and for all your help and support. I can\u0027t do this without you and I fully appreciate the opportunity i\u0027ve been given to be allowed to do this. Help me make my dream a reality! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Can I change my pledge?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf Course! If you suddenly think what you\u0027re pledging is too expensive, by all means, bring down your pledge. In regards to the remix request reward, you have my blessing to do the $80 pledge and change it when the initial payment goes through.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Is the remix request a 1 time offer? I don\u0027t want to keep paying $80 per song for one remix!\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, the remix request is ongoing, BUT bare in mind that I will be only taking one request per person at a time. Plus, depending on how many pledges I get, it may take me a while to finish your request. I generally expect it\u0027ll take me 2 weeks per remix, so if I had 3 pledges, expect a 90-120 day wait, very roughly. At this level i\u0027d be sending you all private updates on how i\u0027m getting on, so you\u0027d always been in the loop, so don\u0027t worry about me not being in touch regarding it. Its possible that I could get overworked with too many pledges at this level, in which case I will be putting up a limitation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
