I went to East Tennessee State University for two years studying illustration. Some things about me NOT related to art: I can\u0027t play any instruments, but I do love indie music and I\u0027d like to learn the banjo. I enjoy cooking but I\u0027m not great at it. I play a lot of video games, but I\u0027m not great at those either. Really art is all I have. I\u0027m just mediocre at everything else.\u00a0I live in Northeast Tennessee with my wonderful fiance and our little dog. I\u0027ve traveled around the country a LOT, but I\u0027ve \u003cem\u003elived\u003c/em\u003e in some part of Appalachia pretty much my whole life. It\u0027s a beautiful place that can easily suck you in and make you a part of it. It\u0027s a part of the world that\u0027s older than time and bathed in history, mystery, and the special kind of magic you only see on a misty Blue Ridge Mountain morning.",
