I was never supposed to be a writer, but found solace after I started to write my deepest thoughts and emotions down.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support Me\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow me to continue to write poems and raise awareness for the Veteran community. Your support will also help bring my writing into print and also allow me create video content and short films. Currently I am working on my first book of poems titled \"War Poems:Over There.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWar Poems: Over There is a gut-punching journey into the soul of a soldier, with striking imagery relating war experiences in Iraq and the later acclimation to civilian life. It is a collection of deep and honest thoughts on war and its aftermath without glamour or flag-waving. Regret, suicide, love, lost, na\u00efvet\u00e9, destruction, are deeply woven within the candid poetry of Over There. If you have ever wanted to feel and discover what Veterans face both in the heat of battle and in the silence of suffering, Over There will open your heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3874/14398138354_a0423d729e_d.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
