    "summary": "Head over to Netflix right now. Find the \"Trending Now\" section. $10 says the NBC long-running mockumentary \u003cem\u003eThe Office\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is somewhere on that list - a show that ended its original broadcast nearly 5 years ago but continues to be incredibly popular among fans. People everywhere talk about how great this show is, so we decided, \"hey - let\u0027s make a podcast about it!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe (Chad Hopkins and Katie White) dive into each episode of the show with incredible detail - some may say \"too much detail\" - dissecting the show\u0027s character arcs and interactions, laughing over the funny and cringeworthy, and also exploring the deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes commentaries and other bonus materials that Netflix doesn\u0027t give you. Though we each have watched the show in its entirety multiple times, we approach the podcast as if we\u0027re watching for the first time, avoiding spoilers so that new viewers of the show can follow along without fear of having future episodes ruined for them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re currently approaching the last few episodes of Season 4 (March 2018), and the reception for the podcast so far has been amazing! We\u0027re so thankful to have an active community of listeners who are as passionate about the show as we are. For that reason, we\u0027re wanting to do even more for our most dedicated listeners!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcasting takes a lot of time and, believe it or not, money. We love to do it, but in order to make doing more a possibility, we need your help! By pledging a small monthly amount here on Patreon, you unlock special tiers of bonus material, but you also help us to pay for our monthly hosting fees, time spent preparing and recording, and perhaps equipment upgrades in the future so that we can continue to improve and sound the best we can for you! We hope that you\u0027ll find these tiers fair and rewarding - we\u0027re not asking for donations, we\u0027re asking you to pay for additional material that you think is worth your money!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all of your support - we\u0027ve said from the beginning that this podcast isn\u0027t about us, it\u0027s about a show that all of us - you included! - love and hold so closely to our hearts, so we\u0027re thankful that you\u0027ve joined us on this journey through \u003cem\u003eThe Office\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0together!"
