Each week\u0027s topic is intensively researched. We do an immense amount of prep work to make sure the show is jam-packed with facts and stories so that even longtime fans of the subjects we cover will find them new and interesting. All this is in addition to the time spent by the incredibly talented producers and engineers who have worked unpaid hours to build the show into something resembling a professional product.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwMTN3mXYAAKFRk.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 80px; text-align: right;\"\u003eartwork by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MushfaceComics/status/793499124935032832\"\u003e@MushfaceComics\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThat\u0027s why it\u0027s up to YOU, dear visitor, to keep this show alive. We started this as a labor of love because we wanted to bring the crazed energy of a comedy show and still tell the tales behind the comics, games, and movies that ignited our imaginations and squeezed our adrenal glands dry. If we meet our goals it will help us take the show to the next level and you\u0027ll be on the ground floor for a whole new batch of shows and ideas with the same manic (and slippery) attitude our fans have come to enjoy week after week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much, and may our destinies someday C-C-C-Crossover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Holden, Jake, and Superproducers Marcus and Megan\u003cbr\u003e"
