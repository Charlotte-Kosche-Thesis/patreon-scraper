You can explore some of my work\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.stevenwinkelstein.com\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer and an entrepreneur I have huge plans and aspirations to create wonderful, inspiring works to share with the world. I want you to be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create stories that inspire imagination again. We live in a fast-paced society where it\u0027s easy to forget why we are here in the first place. My work is meant to be a delicious reminder that life is curiosity. Those of you who decide to support me in these endeavors will be contributing to that mission. Your support means the world to me and the countless others who will be inspired by our work. Thank you for helping me turn imagination into reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve published seven books, have about a dozen in the digital draw, and even more stewing in my noggin. My writing tends to be fantastical and adventurous in nature, spanning several genres including poetry, children\u0027s book, short-stories, young reader chapter books, young adult novels, and novels. I\u0027ve worked hard to get to where I am, but there is still so much more to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I\u0027m working on several projects at once\u2013 A fantasy / comedy novel for grown-up people, a trilogy of space stories for young readers, a series of children\u0027s books called The Sneakrets, and many other pieces that lay in waiting. As a patron, you\u0027ll have access to this community, and at certain reward tiers access to these early works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy posts will be focused around tiny insights into my wild world, delivered throughout the month in the form of a Winky. What\u0027s a Winky? Well, a Winky could be just about anything\u2013 an original poem with an accompanying drawing; a snapshot of my notebook, revealing glimpses of my process; a fact or tidbit about an upcoming piece; a history of a character; or simply some words of Winky-Style wisdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon? I\u0027ve started this page to help fuel my work. Your contribution buys me time, materials, editors, collaborators and eventually a path to change the world. Join us and discover more."
