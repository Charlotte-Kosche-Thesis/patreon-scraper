    "summary": "This is my dream.\u003cbr\u003eThis is the thing I\u0027ve wanted most to accomplish in my lifetime, but haven\u0027t had the fortitude, freedom, or faith in myself to do.\u003cbr\u003eThis book is every bit about me as it is NOT about me.\u003cbr\u003eHere, I\u0027m going to tell you about both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to be painfully open and forthcoming about myself now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer. I went to school for writing. This is who I am, and what I\u0027m meant to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut less than a month ago, I wanted not to be alive anymore. I felt that everything I had put my hands to in this world had fallen apart, and that the constant in all of it was me. I found no redemption within myself, and no end to the cycle of failures, disappointments, broken relationships, and forced rebuilding I\u0027d had to endure. I felt as though within me was a black hole into which all hope, love, faith, and joy went to disappear and die. I was on the verge of ending my life, but saw fit to reach out to my girlfriend and ask her to help me before I followed through on my threat against myself. Fortunately, she did. I was voluntarily admitted into a psychiatric hospital, clinging to the hope that I could have one last chance to live a fulfilling life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5 days later, having been properly diagnosed and medicated for my depression, and being equipped with the coping mechanisms needed to overcome the kind of self-doubt and defeatism that had prevented me from writing this book for the past 8 years, I was released from the care facility a brand-new person, ready to kick life\u0027s ass and share a love in my heart I had never felt so purely and genuinely emanating from my being. Mission #1: write the damn book already.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8 years ago, I watched a BBC special with Dr. Michio Kaku discussing the science of immortality. Immortality is a subject that has intrigued me since I was a child. We see superheroes who are virtually unkillable like Superman, but the ramifications of just one man (or Kryptonian) being effectively immortal are a fleck of dust in comparison to an entire swath of human society having defeated aging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile it is incredibly compelling to think about the experience of being immortal in and of itself - reference your nearest vampire fiction for one easy example - what is often left under the proverbial tarp is the big \"what if?\" at the species level of humanity. With the absence of a short lifespan of less than a century, human society is utterly reconfigured. The effects of extended life upon global economics, politics, religion, and even intellectual and artistic pursuits are magnificently intricate and sprawling. What of overpopulation? How will we feed a species that grows but never dies off? Who gets to be immortal and who literally gets left to die? All of these questions deserve answers, as do a multitude of others I have prepared to challenge the reader\u0027s very idea of what the human experience really means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yes, this is a book about immortality. This is near-futuristic science fiction, in the strictest sense. But this isn\u0027t really a genre piece, despite being a graphic novel about undying human beings. This is a book about humanity: our values, cultural mores, characteristics, traditions, collaboration, conflict, and dreams for our future. I have no delusions about this being \"The Great American Graphic Novel\", but I do want it to be good enough to be called \"a well-written and accessible examination of the human experience\" by at least one critic... or in short, a work that people can pick up, read, and be better off for the experience. This is to be equal parts thought experiment, labour of love, legacy, and quasi-philosophical text. But if you enjoy it simply as a book about immortality, or as a sci-fi novel, I can get out from being up my own ass far enough that I won\u0027t feel I\u0027ve failed as a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set this Patreon up because I\u0027m a realist. I know that I will need to dedicate a substantial amount of time and effort into the creation and cultivation of something high-quality. I\u0027m not setting out to get a cash grab on trashy pulp. And to dedicate time and effort to something, I have to reallocate time away from something else, as we\u0027ve not yet solved the dual problems of a 24-hour day and the human need for sleep. I\u0027ll be doing my best to balance being a relatively new (read: poor and unestablished) real estate agent (my day job) with being a professional writer. I cannot afford to sacrifice more of one for the other and still pay the bills, and I refuse to put off writing this book any longer. The selfish side of me needs to have this book written uncompromisingly, and to have it read by people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best part about Patreon for me is the accountability and consistency factor:\u00a0I am GUARANTEEING a certain output of work at intervals, so you\u0027re not going to get the typical \"well, um, it\u0027s taking longer than we expected\" excuses some creative Patreons make, like ones for video game creation and so forth (where the creator almost always underestimates the time needed). When I say you\u0027re going to get X number of character bios by Z time, you\u0027re going to get them. No excuses. This book is getting written if I have to write it with two broken arms and two broken legs and a pen in my mouth to type. I am taking this as seriously as it deserves to be taken by someone asking other people to pay him money to make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe various tiers of Patronage will include accountability updates, like weekly/biweekly progress report emails/videos, photos of my physical notes I write during the process, and so forth. You will ALWAYS be keyed in on where I\u0027m at with the book. Not happy with my progress? Pull your monthly donation. Want to see me push even harder? More Patronage equals more time I can dedicate solely to the book. Think of me as a pilot light, and you\u0027ve got your hand on the temperature gauge to decide how hot the stove is going to burn.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I\u0027m touting this as a way to see the inner workings of the novel writing process for a first-time author. I think I can provide the kind of insight to people considering whether or not to write a novel or long-form piece that will inform their decision to push forward or run screaming. Writing is an ugly-beautiful process. It is painful or delightful, depending on the minute. There is nothing easy about it, and nothing clean and simple about it. But it can be managed effectively and strategically, so as not to get paralysed by writer\u0027s block or fear of failure. My journey will demonstrate one way to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you can contribute, whether it\u0027s top-tier monthly contributions for the life of the project or simply a few words of encouragement, it\u0027s all appreciated and welcomed. This is scary, uncomfortable territory. But that\u0027s where the best, most fulfilling things happen. The more of you who join me on this journey, the less scary and uncomfortable it will be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Will Bloodworth,\u003cbr\u003esoon-to-be published author"
