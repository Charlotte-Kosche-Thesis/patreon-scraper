    "summary": "Hey guys, it\u0027s Andrea (\u0026amp; Sallie). We love making this podcast for you, and we\u0027ve enjoyed it since the day we debuted in March of 2015. Some of you are new listeners (hello!) and some of you have been with us since day 1. Though we have thousands of you who listen to the podcast each week (how crazy!), we haven\u0027t made ONE CENT from doing the show. We\u0027re not in it for the money (obviously) but it would be \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eso helpful\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e if we could recoup some of the costs we\u0027ve taken on to make this show special. So that\u0027s our first goal! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we receive anything beyond that initial break-even goal, that\u0027ll be such a blessing for the time we\u0027ve spent over the years to bring this podcast to life. Each episode takes roughly 2.5 hours to create, and we\u0027ve got well over 100 episodes, so we\u0027ve basically worked for free for over 250 hours (10 days!). Think of all the books we could\u0027ve been writing! Haha.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all, we love making the show for you, and we\u0027ll continue to do so. Since we fund the show ourselves without sponsors, we would be helped greatly by anything you\u0027re able \u0026amp; willing to contribute. Thanks for taking this journey with us!"
