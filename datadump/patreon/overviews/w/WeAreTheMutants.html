A number of foundational texts, films, and games launched speculative narratives - along with the fandom that quickly grew up around them - into the commercial mainstream, including J.R.R.

Disco, punk, skateboarding, personal computers, CB radios, and fandom are just a few examples of the arts, entertainments, and hobbies that inspired subcultures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the early 1960s, the occult (supernatural or paranormal beliefs not associated with organized religion), including ufology, have surged to the forefront of Western culture. From Kenneth Arnold\u0027s sighting of nine UFOs in 1947, to the Patterson-Gimlin Bigfoot film of 1967, to \u003cem\u003eThe X-Files\u003c/em\u003e, and now to \u003cem\u003eAncient Aliens\u003c/em\u003e (on the History Channel, no less), the airwaves and virtual book and game shelves are inundated with all manner of creatures and experiences that resist the scientific worldview. The more technological our culture becomes, and the less traditionally religious, the more people seem to embrace occult subjects, especially in America, where faith and dissent play out in equal measure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Are We?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eK.E.
