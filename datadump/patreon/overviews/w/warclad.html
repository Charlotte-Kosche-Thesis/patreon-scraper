All of the crafts produced are made with techniques as close as possible to those used in the iron and middle ages, up to the early renaissance. Warclad currently produces leather armour, pouches, and bags, but with the help of patrons like you that selection can grow!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlong the way I hope to share my philosophy, research, and methods with people who share my interest and would like to know how I do what I do. By supporting this Patreon you will be helping to keep my shop get on its own two feet, allow me to devote more time and resources to producing cool new stuff, and maybe learn some things along the way. In addition I\u0027ll be able to provide ever better content for everyone to enjoy. Together we can help make a more adventure friendly world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you enjoy my work or would like to learn more you can always find me on\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://warclad.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/warclad/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/116530795@N05/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFlickr\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/Warclad\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e."
