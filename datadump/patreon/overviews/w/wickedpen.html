    "summary": "Greetings and Welcome! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so pleased to have reached this point on the path towards publication. Movies seem to portray two types of writers: those who have always feverishly written since childhood, and the aloof sort ensconced in a leather clad study. Books, on the other hand, describe messy lives with an unavoidable pull.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI land definitely in the latter category, although I can claim to have always written; if not feverishly. In my perversity, writing was something that I continued to engage in sporadically while \u003cstrong\u003edoing other things\u003c/strong\u003e! Yet I always returned to the page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is my starting line where I\u0027m hurling myself off the blocks. I\u0027ve been hard at work the past five years focusing on learning the craft of writing. My struggle has not been about settings, ideas, plot-lines, or characterization. My struggle has been about \u003cstrong\u003ethe doing after the rush\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad you wish to come along with me on this home stretch! For the next year, I will need you, and in turn, I hope to give back by laying bare the day-to-day struggle in a full life to realize such a project. As someone who has consistently written in fits and starts, I am well qualified to get down in the trench and with rolled up sleeves expose the dirt down there where the work lies. You may not have the drive to be a writer, but if there is one thing I\u0027ve learned is that some teachings are universal to all projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
