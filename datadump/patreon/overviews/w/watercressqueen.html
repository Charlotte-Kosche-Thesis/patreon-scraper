David is a trained fish farmer and has worked with many species of fish over his 30-year career.\u00a0 Lucie loves to grow and make things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHaving seen the problems caused by poor farming - lack of nutrients in our food - lack of quality\u00a0and freshness - plastic packing - high prices environmentally and money wise we want to do something about it!\u003cbr\u003eTo do this we are using our skills to develop the first aquaponics farm in the New Forest (south UK.) - we have the site, we have a huge amount of equipment (recycled of course), we just need financial support to be able to turn this into a productive aquaponics farm.\u003cbr\u003eAs a community is an important part of any farm we want to share the journey with others, both our children are home educated so we would like to provide a\u00a0 learning space for other home ed families.\u00a0Especially teenage boys who need to find their \"village\" to guide them through those lost years.\u003cbr\u003eThe other group of people who we wish to help is stroke survivors, as a family, we are all living day to day with the effects of a stroke, having experienced Lucie having a stroke at 48.\u00a0 It would mean so much to us to give meaningful opportunities to help rebuild lives after the devastation of a stroke\u00a0 - not just the stroke victim but the families as well.\u003cbr\u003ePlease support us on our journey - so we can go on and support others with food to love."
