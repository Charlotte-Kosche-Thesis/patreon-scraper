With that in mind, we\u0027re debuting a new series called Songbird Sessions! It\u0027s a bit of a songwriting challenge for us: create a new song in \u003cstrong\u003eone hour\u003c/strong\u003e! With this series, you\u0027ll get an insight into our songwriting process and be able to see what comes out of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the lowdown: Songbird Sessions will be a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly\u003c/strong\u003e, live streaming event (usually the first Sunday of every month), starting at 12pm Pacific Time (1pm Mountain/2pm Central/3pm Eastern), and it will be broadcast on Facebook Live. We\u0027ll give ourselves an hour to attempt to make a song, and you\u0027ll get to see the process! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the livestream is done, we\u0027ll make a simple recording of what we\u0027ve got and offer that as a patron reward; later on in the month, we\u0027ll have a full recording of the song (which may - or may not! - have changed) and offer that as another reward tier. We also have further stretch goals that will allow us to do more with this concept and come up with more ideas in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of our original music and want to hear more of it, we really appreciate your support! You allow us to keep doing what we\u0027re doing, and expand on what we already do as a full-time touring duo. See you on the road!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ash \u0026amp; Ed"
