    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/Writerleft/pseuds/Writerleft\"\u003eWriterleft from ao3 here\u003c/a\u003e, a little shy about all this, but a reader suggested and hey, why not. I started a fundraiser to reach a personal goal, and I truly love my Korrasami community for it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo then I thought, how can I give back? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all like Korrasami fanfiction. We all like fanart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s encourage more of both! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHALF OF ALL PROCEEDS RAISED HERE AND FROM MY TIP JAR will go toward my community encouraging fund. What\u0027s \u003cem\u003eTHAT \u003c/em\u003edo? Glad you asked! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone that donates to the fund can nominate a Korrasami writer or story from the past 3 months, available on any public platform. Each time enough money has been raised, I\u0027ll hold a vote, and l commission a piece of artwork for the winner--hopefully without the writer knowing it\u0027s coming! (So no nominating yourself! Or me, for that matter!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s it! Your donations help me out a little, encourage other writers in the community, give a fanartist a commission, AND give us all another lovely fanart to pass around! How is this not a great plan? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAQ - \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Why are you only putting HALF of our money towards this? \u003cbr\u003eA: C\u0027mon, that\u0027s fair. I\u0027m putting a lot of legwork into this, and to be honest my share pretty much all goes to Korra-related goods. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How do we know you\u0027re being honest?\u003cbr\u003eA: Um... this would be a pretty small-time amount of money to ruin my reputation over? C\u0027mon, chat with me, I\u0027m about the most forthright person in the world. I really do just want to help keep the community active, healthy, and positive! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: You\u0027re sure we can\u0027t nominate your stuff?\u003cbr\u003eA: That would negate the point! I certainly would love fanart for my stories, but that\u0027s not what this is about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What if people pick a story you hate?\u003cbr\u003eA: Then I\u0027ll be happy for the writer and thank them for writing something so many people care about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Can we vote for smut!? \u003cbr\u003eA: Ah... no. Let\u0027s keep it SFW, shall we? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Oh, ok--\u003cbr\u003eA: And furthermore, nothing hateful either. The whole point is positivity, so I will veto anything that is, say, explicitly trashing part of the fandom, or another writer, or anything meant to be negative. The scene can be a dramatic or sad one, often those are the most gripping, but just to be clear, I won\u0027t be party to any axe grinding! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Can I donate a lump sum? \u003cbr\u003eA: Recurring is preferred, but I\u0027m not gonna turn down any contributions to the cause! I set up a ko-fi here: \u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/A84320TT\"\u003ehttps://ko-fi.com/A84320TT\u003c/a\u003e .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: One of the stories that won has something really offensive in it!\u003cbr\u003eA: :/ I\u0027m... not gonna be happy about that, of course, but think as I might, I can\u0027t think of a reasonable way to police this. I can\u0027t physically read everything that gets nominated, and it\u0027s not my place to act as a gatekeeper. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, if a problematic aspect if a story is brought to my attention, I will investigate, and append a warning to any editable posts I\u0027ve made about that particular story. I can\u0027t un-commission fanart, after all, and its not my place to police what readers enjoy, but I also don\u0027t want anybody to feel unwelcome. This is supposed to be about positivity and encouragement, after all! I realize this isn\u0027t a clean solution, but this is a pretty murky problem. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: So this all started because of a doll? \u003cbr\u003eA: Yeah. I wrote a story involving cute Korra dolls, and, well... just look! \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bhcrafts.tumblr.com/post/145668719883/commission-info\"\u003eIsn\u0027t this the cutest thing?!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n was in a lonely, depressive place, and one of my readers suggested \ndoing a patreon fundraiser. I raised enough for my happy little Korra \nwithin a week(!!!), and soon hopefully I can have her to hug and love, \nboth as a symbol of this character and show that means so much to me, \nbut also now as a sign of community support. I can hug you ALL and \nthat\u0027s wonderful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Your hair is pretty.\u003cbr\u003eA: Thanks? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Banner art from Round 4 commission by beroberos,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fverororoni\u0026amp;t=N2I4NjI1ZDQzNWFlNWJlOGM3OGNhZmVlMzRlZDAxY2ZhNmUzMTFjNCxJbTFjMDVoMA%3D%3D\u0026amp;b=t%3A_4z9axOscPkUjcZybTxn8Q\u0026amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fthreehoursfromtroy.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F162011634028%2Fkorrasami-fanwork-positivity-campaign\u0026amp;m=0\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/verororoni\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e"
