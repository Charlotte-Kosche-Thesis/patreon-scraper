     "about": "Hi! My name is Alden. I was born and raised in Tulsa Oklahoma. I had a pretty okay childhood with a pinch of drama mixed in. I did okay at school, excelling in the classes I liked: Math, Art, and Math. The others... well, I graduated at least. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first paying job was at Bells Amusement Park, where I worked for three summers as a Ride Operator. I met a wonderful person while I was working there. Jen was joining the Navy after she graduated High School. Seemed like a good idea at the time, so I followed her in. But first I married her :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both went the nuclear field, she as a mechanic, I as an electrician. Jen was discharged early, when John was born 3 months premature, even though at the time she had wanted to stay in. During my 8 years in the Navy we had three incredible children. We made lots of friends... But as it is in the Navy, people moved away. Eventually we followed suit. I was honorably discharged in September \u002706. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I moved home to Tulsa I became an Engineering Service Representative for ASCO services. I\u0027ve started to learn about corporate America. Jen \u0026amp; I are active adult leaders for our local Boy Scouts. It\u0027s a load of fun being back in scouting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I work at Google as a Data Center Facilities Technician in Mayes County, OK. Working for Google is awesome. I work with a great group of people\u003cbr\u003e. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a gamer. I\u0027ve managed a small multi-world server, and moderated /r/AdminCraft and currently run the Slorum at WorkWebPage.com. I have a small games collection, including some arcade cabinets, a medium Transformers and other action figures collection, and a huge steam game collection. I\u0027ve been known to have played a bit of Magic the Gathering, and I\u0027m currently getting into Heroes of the Storm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an internet junkie, a introverted thinker, and I try to be a good friend. Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e",
