    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IF\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003etwo people watched every project an actor has ever done and made a podcast about it?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s the question we\u0027re trying to answer with\u00a0Walken 101, a weekly podcast in which we watch and analyze, in chronological order, every film, television show, or video game (yes, Walken has had roles in video games) that Oscar-winning actor Christopher Walken has ever appeared in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn each episode, we\u0027ll discuss the project we watched, review it, talk about Walken\u0027s performance, and whatever else comes to mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBUT WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s a certain amount of novelty to it. Certainly, we don\u0027t think anyone has done this before, and for good reason. It seems like a colossal waste of time.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOr is it? We happen to think that a great deal can be learned from watching an entire actor\u0027s body of work. Specifically, with Christopher Walken, it\u0027s going to be an exercise in breaking down who he is and why he makes such unique decisions as an actor. Hopefully, either through actual facts or our own speculation, we can extract some useful information for any budding filmmakers and actors who may be listening. The thing about Walken is that he may be known to our generation as kind of a spooky, sometimes goofy guy, but as Walken once said when he played the title role in Hamlet decades ago: \"Though this be madness, yet there be method in it.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClose to two-and-a-half years. There are approximately 129 credits on Walken\u0027s IMDb page, five or six of which seem impossible to find. We\u0027ll be releasing one podcast a week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY A PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost expenses will come from hosting the podcast, website fees, and most importantly: finding a way to watch everything. Some of these projects are little hard to come by. For example, Walken\u0027s performance in a couple episodes of \"Naked City\" only exists on a complete season box set of the show. The 1977 film \u003cem\u003eRoseland \u003c/em\u003eis only available on DVD. These may seem like small expenses, between $20-30 depending on where we can find them for purchase, but they add up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also a vast amount of projects available on streaming services. Thankfully, some will be free, others won\u0027t be. Again, they\u0027re small expenses ($2.99 or $3.99 here and there), but they will certainly add up. We\u0027re eating the expenses as of right now, but we\u0027d love to get enough support to allow us to not have to worry about that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support can go to other things as well, such as better equipment, promotion through social media, or funding a short road trip to Yale University, which is seemingly the only resting place of a 1956 short film on DVD called \"The Boy Who Saw Through,\" which stars a 12-year-old Christopher Walken as a boy with x-ray vision. We\u0027ll also need a whip, a fedora, and a bag of sand to replace it when we lift it from its weighted slab.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from those expenses, we\u0027re simply trying to create something that people will enjoy, and if people dig this, maybe we\u0027ll do similar projects in the future. It all depends on how much people are listening, sharing, and supporting the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
