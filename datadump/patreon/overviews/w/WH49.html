Building upon the roots of arcades and gaming cafes we will be taking the gaming center to the next level by not only having a place to play games (of all types) but also by serving great food and drinks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to thank you all for supporting us while we find our way through the crowds of people who still think gamers are a bunch of nerds who are antisocial and live in their parents basement. Never have we ever felt like we were back in high school. But the times are changing and we are starting to open people\u0027s eyes to what gaming actually is; a social and often team based activity filled with supportive friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe longer we are on this journey the stronger we can feel that we have been needed by our community. The Alaska gaming community has been craving a better, more professional gaming scene and we have put all our efforts into providing for that growing niche.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only have we been working with the gaming community but we have helped many local organizations in the process by benefiting them with our events. For example, we worked with the Blood Bank of Alaska for our event,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/448688038803282/\"\u003eLifeLan\u003c/a\u003e, by making the entry fee a donation of blood.

The bar will cost near 1 million dollars so that will have to take investors and other sources of funding, while we work on that we still want to promote gaming in the community. All money raised will go to making the LAN events we host better and to make our reward tiers benefit you more. There is a lot that goes into a LAN event like power rental, venue rental, switches, ethernet, tournament prizes, gaffers tape, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21083458_1415193431869093_1836392950633357656_o.jpg?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeFOpPt1srcW9AvAlbPH3Cj9VhBPAfwVQiZBhgYz1AGY5i9xvsxFOhgvyPF6RHgtRKdA7u8s1u0H3mB6W2GQix3CovVw48q9qXf5VgeuI6903Q\u0026amp;oh=60afa9049a7d54d3f81607737116934c\u0026amp;oe=5B3BD474\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
