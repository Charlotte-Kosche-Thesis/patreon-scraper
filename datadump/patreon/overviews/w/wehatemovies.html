From its humble beginnings in Eric\u0027s bedroom in Astoria, Queens, just barely making episodes out of short talks on films like\u00a0\u003cem\u003ePsychomania\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eCongo,\u003c/em\u003e to putting out entire theme months like Listener Request Month, the Summer Blockbuster Extravaganza and the incredibly popular Halloween Spooktacular, to taking the show on the road and performing live in venues across the country, WHM has been going strong for almost a decade! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we still want to do so much more... But we need your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming part of our Patreon family, you\u0027ll be assisting us with not just the day-to-day operations of WHM, but also helping us plan for the future. With your patronage, you\u0027ll be allowing us the time and resources to not only produce the weekly show, but also create much more content, purchase better equipment, design new merch and get us out on the road to perform live in your town\u0027s comedy club, movie theater, or college campus! In a perfect world, we\u0027d do this for a living, and with your help, each month inches us closer and closer to that dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Break Down\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore content:\u003c/strong\u003e We\u0027re looking to step up production on sync-able commentary tracks and bonus episodes. These take time \u0026amp; scratch to produce. We\u0027re also looking to develop different projects including new WHM shows, video series, and maybe even e-books.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter equipment: \u003c/strong\u003eWe think our show sounds great, but everything can always sound better. Your patronage will help us acquire better mics, mixers and other recording gear. The show has come a long way from where we started -- the pilot haunts Andrew to this day -- but we can always sound more polished. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDesign new merch: \u003c/strong\u003eSure, the \"Probably Secundus\" T-shirt was a big hit, but we\u0027re always coming up with new ideas for shirts with no time to actually get them produced. With your patronage, we\u0027ll be able to follow through on new merch ideas and hire the right people to get them made. You\u0027ll also help us bulk order select merch to take with us when we...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet out on the road more:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe love the online community we\u0027ve developed through doing the show all these years, but there\u0027s nothing more rewarding for us than playing live for fans and meeting folks afterward. Whether it\u0027s doing an episode of the podcast in a comedy club, or a real time commentary in front of a theater audience, WHM Live is something only a select few cities have been able to experience so far. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand that the places we\u0027ve played (or play frequently) are not close for the majority of our audience. With your patronage, we hope to be able to cover all the costs that go into touring including travel, lodging, venue fees and, for some live commentaries, film licensing! We\u0027d like to be able to cover all corners of this continent and venture even further to play for our fans in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Brazil, and beyond!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut what do you get out of this, you ask? \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell we \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e a comedy podcast, so the thing you\u0027re going to get out of becoming a patron of WHM is more bonus comedy podcast content that non-patrons won\u0027t have access to! This includes all your favorite WHM bonus shows like: \u003cem\u003eAnimation Damnation\u003c/em\u003e (moving exclusively to Patreon, sorry!), \u003cem\u003eA Side Order of Sleaze\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(possibly, we\u0027ll see how these signups go!), access to WHM commentaries earlier than the public, and exclusive access to an all-new WHM side show,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Nexus\u003c/em\u003e, where the guys will be talking about episodes of \u003cem\u003eStar Trek\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eStar Trek: The Next Generation, \u003c/em\u003eand other \u003cem\u003eTrek\u003c/em\u003e-related properties\u00a0at length!

First and foremost we do the show every week for you, the listener. Without you folks, there\u0027s no reason to even do a show in the first place. But time is moving on, and we\u0027ve realized that if we\u0027re going to turn WHM into something even greater, now is the moment to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re super excited about all the new ideas and directions we have planned for the WHM brand as we head into the \u003cem\u003eeighth season\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of this show,\u00a0and we can\u0027t wait to have you on board helping us out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch thanks for being there for us then and being here for us now,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndrew, Steve, Eric \u0026amp; Chris\u003cbr\u003eThe WHM Gang\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fzzath0dshQ/VX-xybR2ivI/AAAAAAAACBc/o0WgcP2hd6w/s1600/IMG_0335.JPG\" style=\"width: 587px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
