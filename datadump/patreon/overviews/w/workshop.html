    "summary": "I would also like to make a shameless plug, so prepare yourselves. \nOver the next year and beyond, inlight of the new sexy workshop, there \nwill be a lot of videos and the bike teardown vids, this (unfortunately) \ncosts money. Because my porn star career has fallen flat on its face, I \nask you guys to help. To this end I have a Patreon account. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \nBasically if my videos have helped you out or are in anyway entertaining\n and you wanna say cheers and buy me a pint please send said pint to\n P.O Box 904 ..................... obviously this won\u0027t work out. But \nyou can help by donating through Patreon, they take 5% of the donation \nfor staff parties etc, but it means that I get 95% for the channel. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonations can be as little as $1 a month. So if you stay subscribed to \npatreon they take $12 per year, which is not a bad deal, well that\u0027s what\n I think. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you wanna \ndonate say $5 and then stop as a one off that\u0027s fine, just donate then \nafter a month quit, and its really easy to quit. I currently donate to \nAvE, Clickspring, 2 Stroke stuffing, and a few other awesome channels on Youtube. So I\u0027m not asking you to do something that I wouldn\u0027t.\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChWv6Pn_zP0rI6lgGt3MyfA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n At the end of the day, you either wanna contribute or you don\u0027t. Either way this money helps me buy shite for the channel, usually so we can test it. One this is if your here for extra vids then sorry that\u0027s not what this is about. There are rewards and if you wanna claim them then email/message me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Thanks for reading - I\u0027ll see you in a bit........\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMatt\u003cbr\u003e"
