    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Daniel--an editor, teacher, freelance writer, and native New Yorker. I\u0027m creating a text-based Online Roleplaying Game in my own setting of Dungeons and Dragons.\u00a0I\u0027d love to have your support in order to make it the most intense, challenging, and rewarding online roleplaying experience out there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWalpurgis uses 5th Edition of D\u0026amp;D, and is run in the style of \"West Marches\" campaign. In it, players gather at the central hub of Aleister\u0027s Rest, a ruined town that lies at the heart of a hostile jungle near the center of an island that is dominated by the tyrannical Lords of the Realm of Yura. From their humble start, the players will work to rebuild the town, while at the same time defending it, investigating rumors, and venturing out on epic quests to increase their power and strike back against the Lords.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlayers are free to hop in the tavern at Aleister\u0027s Rest and roleplay together at any time. There, they\u0027ll form their own stories, and their bonds with each other, which they\u0027ll take with them on their adventures. When players want to take on a quest, they\u0027ll form up a party, and schedule a game session with me, the DM--and from there it becomes just like the tightly-focused, hand-crafted adventure that would you expect from a tabletop roleplaying experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m aiming Walpurgis at an audience who loves a challenge. I\u0027m appealing to people who prefer Dark Souls to Skyrim; who prefer Game of Thrones to Lord of the Rings. The game certainly has a \"rogue-like\" element--where player-characters will be exposed to genuine dilemmas and excruciating trials, with a real and constant risk of permanent death; but through those sacrifices, players will see the town develop and come more and more to life. My belief is that those kinds of stories are the most memorable, the ones most worth telling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInterested?
