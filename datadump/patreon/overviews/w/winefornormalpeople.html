    "summary": "THANK YOU! For checking out my page and for your support!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWine for Normal People is a one woman (with one-man and one-dog contributions!) wine podcast made by me, Elizabeth Schneider. I worked for a huge winery after business school, I have a few wine certifications and I wrote the book, \"Wine for Normal People\" which will be released in fall of 2018. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had the podcast for 8 years and I LOVE making wine easier for people to understand and enjoy. I try to talk about wine in a, well, \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003enormal, \u003c/i\u003eway since I had a career before I went to work for a big winery and I know how complex and daunting the subject can be when you\u0027re trying to learn about it. I\u0027m a really honest, \"emperor has no clothes\" caller-outer, so my communication style works well for people who want wine knowledge without the pretense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy crowdfunding through Patreon? Atlhough I occasionally have ads on the podcast, they don\u0027t cover the costs of creating the content, producing events and classes, and maintaining the equipment (and trying the wines!) that I need to run WFNP. I keep a high standard of integrity and I don\u0027t want to work with people who ask me to endorse stuff that I don\u0027t believe in (I don\u0027t want to sell out!). Your support means I can give you more great podcasts, videos, Facebook lives, classes, and, hopefully, book signings in your town as an independent person. \u00a0I love what I do, and I love helping you love wine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your support and for letting me continue making wine more fun! You are amazing!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
