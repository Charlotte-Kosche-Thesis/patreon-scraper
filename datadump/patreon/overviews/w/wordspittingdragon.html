    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my page! My name is WordsSpittingDragon and I\u0027ve been a fanfic writer for about, well, forever. However, in the past couple of years I started using the medium to explore character development, write novel-length works, and generally prepare myself for my one, true dream - WRITING A BOOK! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s getting ahead of myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here you most likely like my silly little stories and I\u0027m here to say I\u0027ve got on my big-kid pants and will be consistently updating my works for AT LEAST one or more of my fanfics every month. These chapters will typically be between 4,000 - 6,000 words (although sometimes when the muses take me they get twice that).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry, I will NEVER, EVER withhold any of my works as a way to squeeze out funds (no matter how broke I am) because fanfiction has always been a hobby that I have loved. My works will still be free to view on my FanFiction account by the same name. This is more a way to motivate myself to get serious and to give fans who might be interested a way to show support. This is also a way to get myself to practice original works, as in addition to the monthly chapter updates I will also be posting a monthly patreon-only original work, also between 4,000 and 6,00 words. In short, I am throwing down the gauntlet to myself and trying to give myself accountability for pursuing my passion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patreon you\u0027ll have access to my original content and have the chance to vote for upcoming chapters on stories you like (and yes ALL my stories are up for the vote - I WILL revive the zombies if people would like me to) - I will also be using my patreon to create new works when the time comes or to take pairing polls for oneshots. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know a payment for each chapter may worry some, especially if I get in a rare mood of writing A LOT but my current plan is only to update once or twice a month and you can always set a monthly cap for yourself if you\u0027re worried about your pockets. Seriously, please do whatever works best for you as I honestly don\u0027t really expect much with this and I am so, so grateful for any and all support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to look over my page and, if it sounds like something you\u0027d like to get behind, please consider becoming a patreon! \u003cbr\u003e"
