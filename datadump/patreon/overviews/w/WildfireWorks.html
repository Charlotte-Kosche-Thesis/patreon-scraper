Our story is one of a lot of Love, and of a fair amount of luck.\u003cbr\u003e\n    We met at a local fire-jam in Davis,CA. It was \nLove at first sight. Clark was performing there, and as soon as we locked eyes, we were in Love. Jess\n stepped up beautifully into the role of step-mother and has been the \nlinchpin to Clark\u0027s success as a father. \u003cbr\u003e    Jessica, a retired \nballerina, and Clark, a world-weary circus freak, started making a life \nfor ourselves from the ground up. We put all our effort into duet shows \nand finding clever ways to combine fire, dance, and classic literature. \nHaving both studied art on opposite sides of the county, we had a lot to\n learn from each other. And learn we have! Thanks to our wonderful years together, we\u0027ve grown into an \ninseparable, dynamic duo!\u003cbr\u003e    When trendy, mainstream fire acts and \nmodern ballet took over our chosen fields, we had to find other ways to \nmake a living with our talents. Oddly enough, this took the shape of our\n very first D\u0026amp;D game together on Roll20; a little over three years \nago. Jessica, being a very talented artist and designer took up the role\n of making beautiful maps and portraits. While Clark DM\u0027ed, having \nstudied Film Directing/Acting at NYCDA, he transmuted his Love for \nstories into tales of sword and sorcery for players worldwide.\u003cbr\u003e    \nSince then, with many lessons learned. We\u0027ve taken the D\u0026amp;D world by \nforce! Clark and Jessica have repeatedly published work on \nDMsGuild.com, and our table-top games have been running for a little \nover two years now. We host workshops here in Martinez, CA, and appear at conventions to run games and host panels about game mastering. We also still run games on roll20, using our own setting designed for high-quality, one-session games called GEEX. If you become a patron, you can get free access to GEEX, and play!\u003cbr\u003eWildfire Works is the culmination of everything we have learned \nover the years. Our hope is to continue selling our products, and to \nstir up enough income so as to quit our dayjobs to write/perform full \ntime. Aiden is a constant source of \ninspiration, and many of his brilliant ideas bring joy and laughter to \nthe players that experience them. One day, we hope to carve out a living making the products we Love. With a little \nhelp from patrons like you, we can get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e     Thank you for your time,\u003cbr\u003e          Clark, Jessica, and Aiden.",
