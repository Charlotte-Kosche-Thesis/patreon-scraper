    "summary": "We have a concrete and actionable plan for improving democracy: make all public spending easy to find on the Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me elaborate. Via direct and indirect taxes democratic governments take and redistribute between\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Freedom_Day#Tax_Freedom_Day_around_the_world\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e30% and 50% of our income\u003c/a\u003e. However, we usually have no idea where exactly the money goes. This has two effects:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMany people are disenfranchised. They think that state spending is somehow secret because \"all politicians steal\" and \"the system is evil\". This leads to low participation in elections, or worse, populism and radicalism.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEven if we try to be good citizens, we are forced to make uninformed decisions. We are supposed to choose - figuratively - between a Trident nuclear submarine fleet and 100,000 public teachers without even knowing which one costs more. More importantly, on the hyper local level we cannot efficiently compare the cost of the newly-installed dog waste bins to the yearly dog licence revenue.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eAs a result politicians try to appeal to our hearts instead of our heads.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA personal story: during the Brexit campaign someone on my FB feed shared a charged meme depicting how much we spend on X and how little on Y. I thought it would be a good idea to verify the claim before reacting. I started to Google, but, after a while, I realised that it is impossible to quickly find how much we spend on anything. Later, after hours of research, all I was able to find were puzzling .gov websites, unsearchable PDF documents and CSVs too big to open in Excel, all heavily obfuscated by impenetrable accounting jargon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompare it to this: if I asked you to Google the gross revenue of the first\u00a0movie directed by whoever played Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972), you could probably find the answer (Al Pacino, Looking for Richard, gross $1,361,420) on IMDB in less than a minute. Why can\u0027t we have something equally easy for our own money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd when we say public spending, we don\u0027t mean only government budgets - we mean the whole public sector, everything funded by our taxes. Departments, bureaus, agencies, offices, cities, towns, courts, libraries, schools, hospitals, public corporations, etc.\u00a0If you think about it, there are only three ways how tax coins can leave the public sector: \u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eas a salary to employees,\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eas a payment for goods and services from the private sector or\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eas a transfer to another organisation or individual.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe we can build a crowdsourced website where exploring public spending will be fun, not a punishment. And, if we succeed, we will hope we will\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center; color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRationalise Politics\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tKill Alternative Facts\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPierce Filter Bubbles\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tStop Corruption\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
