My name is Winter Hart, artist\u0027s name \"Elise Shepard.\" I\u0027m 25, a community college student, and I create mainly original written works of fiction, paintings, and vlogs! I mostly write anecdotal slice of life, high/dark fantasy, and science fantasy, sometimes even an amalgamation of all of them at once! As for painting, I tend to focus on color blending and shapes a lot, so I\u0027m partially abstract, though I\u0027d also venture to say that because my work also includes landscapes and certain recurring objects or animals, I\u0027m not as abstract as it sounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e All of my currently finished paintings are viewable on my Facebook page! Please, feel free to check them out if you\u0027re interested in what I have to offer with them. In the future, I also hope to be able to create prints of the paintings themselves in order to sell them on my Etsy store. And as for crocheted crafts, again, everything I\u0027ve finished is also posted there, and I hope to be able to sell them on Etsy as well as utilize them in rewards on here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting-wise, I\u0027m currently working on a science fantasy young adult novel titled \"Between The Dimensions,\" a fantasy young adult story titled \"Winterland: Pendragon\u0027s Light,\" and several intermittent young adult short stories. As you can see, I write mostly young adult works, particularly because those are the types of stories I find myself interested in reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow, you will find overview information regarding my current in-progress stories! I will keep updating this page as I continue working on them, so check back often!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGENERAL OVERVIEW: \"Between The Dimensions\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- PLOT\u003cbr\u003eTaking place in the Ravuia Galaxy, an alternate dimensional galaxy overlapping that of our own Milky Way, Alice von Flare and her unlikely companions join together to fight against the Menace, a force of dark, evil energy infringing upon the entire universe. Alice has been a \"vampire\" for the last hundred and fifty years, only just now meeting Captain Tsye and Lieutenant Eclipse of the Aurora as they scour the Ruined Crater in Chicago, Illinois for some clue as to why Earth has suddenly come under attack by pirate aliens from the Ravuian planet Mjallavir. The future of Earth threatened, the planet itself facing an impending, frozen, irreparable death, Alice must join with Tsye\u0027s crew and discover for herself how to stop this foreseeable demise of the home she\u0027s known her entire life. When she meets Sleet, a blue alien woman from Pluto\u0027s frozen satellite Charon, the two have an instant connection, not just in the attraction either feels for one another, but also with how their conjoined powers as White Knight Initiates allow them to see between the dimensions, finding the loopholes to jump through in order to save this particular timeline they inhabit. Together, they figure out a solution to save Earth from its untimely destruction, allowing the universe peace for the time being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- MAIN CHARACTERS\u003cbr\u003eThe story of \"Between The Dimensions\" features several characters. There are a few plot-turning characters not listed here, for they\u0027re very spoilery and thus \"secret\" until they\u0027re gotten to in the plot itself. However, here are the main characters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; Alice von Flare, protagonist, \"vampire,\" and White Knight Initiate\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; November von Flare, projected antagonist, \"vampire,\" and fellow White Knight Initiate\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; Captain Gin \"Silver\" Tsye of the Aurora, the Seer of Time itself\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; Lieutenant Dusk M\u0027Alore Eclipse, Silver\u0027s vowed protector\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; Chief Kazami, an android in charge of the Aurora\u0027s operations, and Yun\u0027s teacher\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; Yun Cha, student of Chief Kazami, fellow White Knight Initiate, and eventual energy vessel\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; Den Mech, the Aurora\u0027s resident prototype artificial intelligence robot\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; Sleet, fellow White Knight Initiate alongside Alice, and ultimately an energy catalyst\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; Head Seer of the Elemental Seers\u0027 and White Knights of Ravuia\u0027s Orders, Hydrogen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you think you\u0027re interested in seeing what I have to offer, please feel free to become a patron! It\u0027d mean a lot to know there\u0027s an audience I\u0027m working for (other than my mom, of course). If you do decide to become a patron of my works, I do sincerely want to thank you, for you\u0027re one of the major reasons I\u0027m continuing my writing and art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons of $20 and above will all receive one crocheted pumpkin as a personal thank-you from me! Patrons of $75 and above will also receive one personalized two-tone crocheted scarf as an additional thank-you. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be editing my goals and rewards as time goes on, because as of right now, I\u0027m unsure about some of them. But I\u0027ll maintain what I say in them all the same! I just may add things in the higher tiers at some point. In which case, I\u0027ll also post about it!"
