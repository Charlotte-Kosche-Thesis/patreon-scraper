On this page you are given the opportunity to find out who we are, what we believe to be the truth, what essential service that we provide, what our goals are, how we are impacting lives, how you can partner with us, and what exclusive rewards you can receive. After reading, if you care about what we do as a ministry, and you wish to see this ministry grow and bless more and more people, please join our close knit Patreon community, where you will be able to financially assist the ministry, and gain access to our exclusive ministry rewards \u0026amp; benefits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is What God Says Ministries?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat God Says Ministries is a unique and distinct ministry, as we focus primarily on educating people about sexual activity outside of marriage, based on the true truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So what is the truth (that you can trust 100% of the time for all facets of life)?  Romans 3:4 states clearly that God is the truth. And as God is the true truth (above all else), know that as a ministry, we educate people about sexual activity outside of marriage, based on the truth - and that truth is what God says about sexual activity outside of marriage, in His Word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Is This Ministry Critically Important?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present, there exists a considerable amount of misinformation and ignorance regarding what sexual activity outside of marriage truly is, and the profound consequences that arise from engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage.  That being said, many make sexual decisions that are harmful and damaging to their lives, based on the said misinformation / ignorance.   As a result, What God Says Ministries is critically important, because its primary focus is combating and destroying the misinformation / ignorance that exists regarding sexual activity outside of marriage, among people.  How do we do this?  We do this by educating people with the truth (what God says), the whole truth, and nothing but the truth regarding sexual activity outside of marriage.  This ministry\u0027s intended design is to eliminate all misinformation and ignorance regarding sexual activity outside of marriage, via accurately teaching people about what God (truth) says about sexual activity outside of marriage.  Always remember that God is the true truth, above all else - therefore when you want the true truth, you have to look to what God says.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Is This Ministry For? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis ministry is for all people (non-Christians, Christians, pastors, churchgoers, atheists, males, females, agnostics, seniors, young adults, LGBTs, teenagers, secular individuals, all races, all ethnic groups, all creeds \u2013 \u003cstrong\u003eall people\u003c/strong\u003e). Why? Because all people are sexual beings, and as they are sexual beings, they need to know the truth (what God says) about this very popular and attractive act called sexual activity outside of marriage, that is presented by many as harmless, healthy, and benign. If you wish to find out the true truth (what God says) about sexual activity outside of marriage, what consequences it truly brings, how to accurately address it, how to arrest sexual activity outside of marriage temptation, and how to effectively extinguish it from your life permanently, then we are the ministry for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Use Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat God Says Ministries made the decision to create a Patreon page, as we simply cannot continue to accomplish our ministry goals without you.  As stated earlier, our strategic intent is to educate as many people as possible about what God says about sexual activity outside of marriage.  Currently, our main method of education is via our weekly You Tube channel, podcast, etc.  At present we upload one video per week, to our ministry You Tube channel, but we will like to offer you much more.  In particular, our goal is to offer you 5 You Tube videos per week, live streams, panel discussions, debates, taking the show on the road, practical teaching segments, new segments, strategic collaborations, guest interviews, - and on a macro level, we eventually strive to create our very own ministry broadcasting studio, a production company, and broadcasting network.  Why strive to add these educational facets?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sole purpose of striving to add these previously mentioned facets, is so that this ministry can provide more educational opportunities to learn what God says about sexual activity outside of marriage.  On that basis, we literally cannot do this without your financial assistance.  As a result, we made an executive decision to create this Patreon page, so that you can have the opportunity to assist this ministry in our quest to change more and more lives with the truth (regarding sexual activity outside of marriage).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you choose to become a  Patron of this ministry, this means that you will be making monthly financial contributions to What God Says Ministries.  And in exchange for the monthly  financial contributions that you make, you will automatically become a member of our close knit ministry community, where in return you will be the recipient of our exclusive monthly / quarterly ministry rewards and benefits.  Thus far, the feedback that this ministry has received from across the globe, since its launch, is totally encouraging and it is iron clad proof that this ministry is providing an essential and life changing service, when we accurately educate people about what God says about sexual activity outside of marriage.  People are being properly educated with the truth (what God says),  credible godly knowledge is being shared / received, truthful  (godly) understanding is growing, accurate understanding is growing among people, lives are being changed for the better, better decisions are being made (based on the truth), lifestyles are being delivered, sustainable rehabilitation is being achieved - guilt, shame, and condemnation are being put to flight, via the truth (what God says).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you care about the unique and distinct service that this ministry provides, and you wish to see this special ministry grow globally, in breadth and depth, then please sign up today, to be our Patron.  We literally cannot do this without you.  Partner with us today and lets change lives dramatically, by teaching more and more people about what God says about sexual activity outside of marriage.

Alone this ministry has great potential, but with your assistance, we have unstoppable potential to educate and change more lives, for the better. Some of you will be able to give abundantly, some of you will be able to give just a very small portion, and some of you will be able to give somewhere in the middle.
