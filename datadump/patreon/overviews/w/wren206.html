     "about": "I\u0027m Alexander Petrov Sanchez,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI was born in June 30, 1990 and been creating music since I was born. I discovered Psycle Modular Studio in 2007 and started composing with it, to my surprise obtaining very nice music. After a while, when I turned 18 my dad gifted me a copy of FL Studio 8 (Formerly known as Fruity Loops), I was amazed by how well and quick you could compose a song with it, after some years, my dad gifted me a nice Midi Controller Keyboard (An M-Audio one!) and I was double-amazed since it fit my desktop and also had an octave switcher! Not forgetting to mention the long the keyboard was, with so many keys to press! That made me think about composing for serious and I began since 2012 to compose for the Indie Videogame Market, but it\u0027s not easy to get in there, there\u0027s so much competition and you need to be known by others to be heard, and to work with them. Today, as of the endings of March of 2015, I thought it would be excellent to start a Patreon Campaign and show the world and help the world create Orchestronic Music! That\u0027s why Wren Sound, my service, is offering to you free songs with your support for you to listen, and not just your support: YOUR IDEAS! So it\u0027s not just me offering you my own content, but putting what you want on the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make audience love Orchestral and Electronic Music combined!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to Alexander Petrov S\u00e1nchez\u0027 Journey into Orchestronic Music!",
