    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eWOW!!!  \u003cstrong\u003eThank\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e so much for visiting\n my Patreon page!!!  My career has been an epic adventure, and without \nthe support of fans and patrons I would not be where I am today. I will tell you a little anecdote. I grew up very poor. I did not know exactly \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e\n poor because my mother was amazing. When I told a close friend\u0027s \nmother that I was dropping out of high school to attend a professional \nactor training program, her first question was, \"How are you going to pay\n for it?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI said: \"I dunno, but I got in and they can\u0027t keep me out! I\u0027ll figure it out when I get there.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo which she replied, \"\u003cem\u003eYeah\u003c/em\u003e,\n that\u0027s not gonna work. You have to pay tuition, and it\u0027s not like \npublic school, they can totally keep you out if you don\u0027t pay.\" She took\n a deep breath.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"How much is it?\" She asked. I told\n her. \nShe was quiet for a second and then she looked deep into my eyes. \"I \njust saw you in that Lanford Wilson play. It blew my mind. You are \ngoing to be a very successful actor. I just inherited some money, so I\u0027m\n going to pay your whole tuition, and one day, you will pay me back \nwith money you make from acting.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe wrote out the check, which \nwas by far the most zeros I had ever seen written on a check. She \nlooked me in the eye intently as she handed it over. \"This is for \ntuition, nothing else, and you \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e pay me back.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeeping her gaze, with tears in my eyes I proclaimed: \"YES. I will, and holy mackerel, THANK YOU.\" Sure\n enough, I graduated with honors and received several merit based \nscholarships to cover living expenses. Fast forward to many years\n later. I was starring in a Broadway tour making \u003cem\u003egreat\u003c/em\u003e money and I was able to pay her back, with \u003cem\u003einterest\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e!!!\u003c/em\u003e \n It was an extraordinary moment of fruition, of dreams, but also \npracticalities. Let\u0027s face it, it\u0027s a gamble being an artist, \nyet I was able to follow through on a promise made on a sidewalk on a \nhot august afternoon in Ashland, Oregon many many years prior. Truth\n be told, without her, \u003cem\u003emy first patron\u003c/em\u003e, I would not be a \nmulti-award winning Broadway actor who has starred in projects from \nHedwig to Hamlet, released albums, produced original musicals and be an \nartist who has aspirations to produce the myriad of original plays, \nmusicals, albums and books I have lined up ready to go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOlivia \n(the tuition patron) is only one of so many stories of generosity and \nfaith that have propelled me throughout the years, so \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eYOU!\u003c/strong\u003e Because\n of your generosity and faith I am able to keep taking risks and\n jumping into unknown creative terrain so that I may co-create something brand new, \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eseen\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e.  I believe that my gift is to create \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003enew\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e works. I am a generative artist. Generating new material \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e bear fruit, but it takes \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enutrients\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\n You are those nutrients, and though I may not pay you back with actual \nmonies this time, I will give you a cornucopia of creations that you can\n say \"I nourished those directly.\" \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with infinite gratitude and a sublime reverence to the power and beauty of art I say: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWade McCollum\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
