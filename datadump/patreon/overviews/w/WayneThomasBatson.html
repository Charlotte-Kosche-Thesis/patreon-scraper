I\u0027ve published 15 books since 2005, several of which became bestsellers in Young Adult niche markets. But the publishing world has changed. Authors no longer have to accept the pittance royalties that legacy publishers offer. We can step out on our own. We can write the stories that make our hearts leap and our imaginations thrum. We can write the stories our readers ask for and maybe even a few stories we all need. But being on our own means a ton of money up front. Cover art, interior design, editing\u2014all come out of pocket. No easy thing for a father of four teenagers, several of whom are entering college age. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a beautiful thing. It harkens back to Renaissance times when patrons would monetarily support the artists they loved. I\u0027m hoping to be a part of a new Renaissance, one that prompts Christian artists to again lead the way by being excellent at their craft, not shallow and preachy. I will support those who wish to contribute to that end. Won\u0027t you consider supporting us too?\u003cbr\u003e",

Each front cover costs @$700 out of pocket, plus and additional $300 for spine and back cover. This adds up to @$1000 per full cover. Again, this is a very low figure compared to industry standards, but the artist is willing to stay low to help a fellow-creative\u0027s ministry. And, if you\u0027ve not seen Caleb Havertape\u0027s work yet, you really need to check it out. He\u0027s better than the industry standard. \u003cbr\u003e",

I used their service once for my supernatural thriller GHOST, and in one day, sold 1700 copies. It\u0027s an incredible service, but it comes with a pretty high initial price tag, esp. for large, very popular genres like...epic fantasy. I estimate the Bookbub cost for promoting Sword in the Stars AND The Errant King will be approximately $2,000.\u003cbr\u003e",
