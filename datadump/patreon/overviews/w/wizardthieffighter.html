    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWelcome to the Ultraviolet Grasslands\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe Ultraviolet Grasslands (UVG) is a rules-light rpg pointcrawl module inspired by psychedelic heavy metal, the Dying Earth genre, and Oregon Trail games. It takes a group of \u2018heroes\u2019 into the depths of a vast and mythic steppe filled with the detritus of time and space and fuzzy riffs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/ultravioletgrasslands-freeversion1\"\u003eGet your free, introductory version here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.lukarejec.com/wp-content/uploads/the-rusty-arc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe UVG is for referees, game masters, judges, players, and fans of role-playing games who want to run a months\u2019 long science fantasy Marco Polo-style voyage across a weird, old world. The UVG is for any gamer who wants to mine it for inspiration, adventuring locations, odd characters, maps, items, and random encounters. The UVG is also an artbook knitting together my art and maps and writing. Yes, every nut and fault, from layout to lamarckian monstrosity, is my own work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is encouraged, and made possible, by the fantastic support of my fans on patreon. Thank you, the heroes of the stratometaship.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is also still a work in progress. The responsibility for every typo, every error, and every missing statistic, is entirely mine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, enter the silver machine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePsst: How does that work in Patreon terms?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n1. I\u0027m creating a long-distance pointcrawl sandbox and I\u0027ve covered 22 areas so far (of 30 total). With each monthly update I add two areas. It\u0027s full of words, about 50k now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. It\u0027s full of art. I draw a few new pieces for each update, so we\u0027ll hit about 100 pieces soon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3. It\u0027s rules-optional. Though I write rules and stats to simulate a weird para-apocalyptic world and wilderness adventuring on a scale of weeks and months, you can take them or leave them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. It also has maps, NPCs, and a lot of cats. The story (and setting) started in the Violet City and went West from there.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/stratometaship/purple-land-800.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMy patrons: the heroes\u003c/h2\u003e\nI must repeat my thanks to my patrons. You are the true heroes of the WizardThiefFighter story. I started this patreon with no clear idea than a donation box for my fantasy and rpg art, and you responded. You stuck by me as I turned it into an illustrated choose-your-own-adventure. You stuck by me as I refined that concept into the psychedelic sandbox of the Ultraviolet Grasslands.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd more than that, you inspired me and continue to inspire me.
