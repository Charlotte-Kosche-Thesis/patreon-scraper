    "summary": "Hi! We\u0027re Kiki and Riley, and we are the Wonder Bears.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like food. We like drinks. We like going places and exploring, and staying at home and playing video games. And, perhaps most of all, we like enjoying life together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we hope this space will become is a catalog of adventures. From reviews we write about restaurants, to streaming video games, we want to welcome you into a cozy space where - if only for a moment - you can forget about the woes of the world around you and share with us in some wonderment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a per month subscription that you can pay to access exclusive content provided by the creators that you love. Payments are predictable, monthly, and can be either small or large in order to help sustain those who make content without having to resort to sponsorship and advertising. Patreon gives a voice to everyone, from small time creators like us to the patrons who can interact and give feedback for what you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eKiki and I want to be able to give you quality content. That means going to interesting restaurants, exploring good food, editing videos, and generally spending time getting premium content directly to you. Unfortunately, we don\u0027t yet live in a world where all of that doesn\u0027t require money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge will go directly to us being able to purchase equipment, do wilder and even more restaurant reviews, and help us set up services for ourselves so that we can deliver even more quality stuff that you can digitally gobble up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get from pledging to you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst and foremost, you get our gratitude. It\u0027s only via donations by people like you that content creators like us are able to do anything like this. So our thanks is first and foremost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the goodies, subscribers $1 and up will get access to our donors-only Patreon feed, which includes behind the scenes content, regular updates, and other opportunities to give us feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who donate $3 or more will be able to vote in polls to decide where and what we eat next, bonus videos of us cooking and or just goofing off, and a once a month live stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to those who pledge $5 or more a month, you will receive your name as a credit in all reviews, streams, and videos we release, be able to vote in a special poll to decide our once a month stream\u0027s topic, and receive a special invite to our Discord channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our channel grows, more opportunities for rewards and activities will too. But those who start with us now will have the unique opportunity of helping to shape this endeavor\u0027s future. That in itself is worth something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy \"Wonder Bears\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe value nourishment, security, and comfort; one of the first things we did together was build a pillow fort and hang out in it all day. We called it a den, and from then on, we affectionately referred to each other as bears. It just felt right."
