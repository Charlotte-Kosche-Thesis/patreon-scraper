This time keeping things simple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m releasing 3D models for free! For everyone! As well as making new art and animations. I\u0027ll modify my current models for the public and I will make new ones. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese models can be used by anyone for their own art, like animators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on this Patreon will allow me to do this for a long time.

As well as future models.\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s the plan?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n-I\u2019ll clean up each one of my old models to upload the first workable version, like fixing their Blender rigs, or adding clothes. Since they were intended just for renders, not for general use,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Eventually do the same with each model and release them little by little. Not all at once, though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Keep updating the already released models as new versions, with fixes and small upgrades, either things I had planned or suggestions. That\u2019s the best way to not keep people waiting!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Work on lowpoly versions of the models and texture work, so the materials at least are compatible with Unreal, Unity for VRchat, SFM\u2026 But it will mostly be modelling and material work, I\u2019m still undecided on rigs. There are people with more experience than me in VRchat and SFM rigs, some of them are already in our Discord group.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Make art renders and animations with the models\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Eventually make new models and characters\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-More random updates like unseen renders, small tutorials, small prop models (like DONGS) etc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFollow me here, or at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nsfwo262\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e (nsfwo262) or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nsfwo262.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e to see updates.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe models will be initially uploaded to \u003ca href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgumroad.com%2Fwo262\u0026amp;t=N2UwN2U0ZjRiZjEwMjI0NzA2YjZmYWYyZjZiYjgwNTcxMzZlYmFiZCxuY1Z0YW8zeg%3D%3D\u0026amp;b=t%3AazCszv77NeLdF8PJpk2krA\u0026amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fnsfwo262.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F172103210560%2Ffree-3d-models-and-im-back-on-patreon\u0026amp;m=1\"\u003eGumroad\u003c/a\u003e as 0$ product, since there\u2019s pretty much no filesize or bandwith limitation, as well as being able to update a file.
