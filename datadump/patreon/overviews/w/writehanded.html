My life was very much focused on these things, and they are still a big part of my reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I have come to terms with having a chronic illness, I have been able to create a new life, where my identity as an activist sits alongside my work as a freelance writer and journalist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing is strongly influenced by the New Zealand political landscape, and explores the real impact of ideological decisions on vulnerable people living with chronic illness and/or disability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnkylosing Spondylitis limits my abilities in many ways, but it does not stop me writing. My work at Writehanded covers many things - disability, welfare, feminism and feminist issues, books and poetry. I share my experiences of living with autoimmune arthritis in my spine. I also write about being a writer, books, and poetry. This is aligned with my writing for Folks magazine, which profiles people living with different illnesses and disabilities, and features essays about a wide range of health issues.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps me do all of these things, and I am incredibly grateful. My patrons mean so much to me. Without you, living would be quite a lot more difficult. So, thank you. Really, really, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
