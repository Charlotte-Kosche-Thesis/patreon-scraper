    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon Page. Brad Swift here, though most of my amazingly awesome readers know me by my publishing names: W. Bradford Swift and Orrin Jason Bradford.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy journey to becoming an author started when, as an eleven-year-old boy my next-door neighbor, a children\u0027s librarian, took pity on my single-parent mom. Bored out of my gourd with no one to play with but good \u0027ol mom, I drove her crazy until Mrs. Crabtree brought home a stack of books (mostly sci-fi and fantasy) she knew would hook a young boy and give my mom some relief. It worked. I\u0027ve been hooked ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor the past thirty years, I\u0027ve enjoyed a \"combo career\" as a life coach (www.lifeonpurpose.com) and author of visionary fiction and nonfiction (www.wbradfordswift.com). Since selling my veterinary practice in the late 80\u0027s to pursue this combo career, I\u0027ve published over 350 magazine articles in such publications as \u003cem\u003eFamily Fun, Boys\u0027 Life, Body and Soul (then New Age Journal), Yoga Journal,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eBetter Homes and Garden,\u003c/em\u003e to mention just a few. Many of these have been part of a pet writing project: \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eProject Purpose: to write and publish articles about people whose lives are dedicated to a bold and inspiring purpose or vision.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn 2007, I wrote my first visionary nonfiction book, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLife On Purpose: Six Passages to an Inspired Life, \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e which was an award-winning finalist in the Self-Help: Motivational division of the Best Books Awards sponsored by USA News.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor me, visionary fiction first and foremost entertains the reader while also engaging and inspiring them in a new possibility for life so as a reader you come away with a deeper appreciation for the gift your life is. My book, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDominion Over All\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e -- book one of the Zak Bates Eco-Adventure series is just one example of such a book.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eVisionary nonfiction does much the same thing, though it tends to first and foremost informs, instructs and inspires while also being entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in the power of words to inspire and transform. I believe we need much more visionary fiction and nonfiction in the world, so not only am I writing as much of it as I can, I\u0027m also here to inspire and support other visionary writers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eWords do not label things already there. Words are like the knife of the carver. They free the idea, the thing, from the general formlessness of the outside. As a man speaks [and writes], not only is his language in a state of birth, but also the very thing about which he is talking\u003c/em\u003e.\" \u2014 Old Eskimo saying\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. I would also like you to know that my longest range goal and intention in my visionary writing is to leave my daughter a legacy of a body of work that she\u0027ll be proud of. Perhaps it will also allow her and her future family to live a little more comfortably. Who knows, perhaps one day they will see some of my stories on the big screen or made into Virtual Reality Holo-stories. Wouldn\u0027t that be cool?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kindred-3-Book-Bundle-Orrin-Bradford-ebook/dp/B01NB0T5DB/ref=la_B001JPA0CI_1_10?s=books\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1498851021\u0026amp;sr=1-10\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003eNow Let\u0027s Take a Look at Those Rewards for Becoming a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
