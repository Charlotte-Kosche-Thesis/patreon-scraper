It followed the adventures of Doug Eiffel, the communications officer on board a deep space research station, the U.S.S. Hephaestus, and the rest of the station\u0027s crew. With a dysfunctional family dynamic, creepy mysteries, and crazy hijinks around them at all times, life\u2019s anything but easy 7.8 light years away from Earth. \u003cstrong\u003eWolf 359\u003c/strong\u003e was a little space thriller, a little character psychodrama, and a whole lot absurdist sitcom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started writing the show in early 2014, and we put together an \u003cstrong\u003eamazing\u003c/strong\u003e team of performers, musicians, and technicians to work on it. In three and a half years, we produced four seasons of original, free-to-download content. And in that time, it\u2019s been downloaded over six million times, so we must have done something right! Before releasing our final episode on Christmas Day, 2017, we won multiple podcasting awards, produced multiple giant-sized specials, and even put together a sold-out live show in New York City!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54b2fadfe4b09dfd24afc55d/t/58924194cd0f6884a00a4182/1485980060252/IMG_1727.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/92553d6.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tGood question! For a long time, we did it to cover the production expenses of the show. Each month we had to pay for hours of studio time, several trees\u0027 worth of scripts printed and copied, travel expenses, sound asset licensing, food for our hungry, hungry actors, and more. That\u2019s a lot of stuff! And rather than doing something silly like looking for advertisers or putting the show behind a paywall, we decided we\u0027d rather partner up with our fans - that\u0027s you! - to really make the show everything it could be. \u003cbr\u003eWe created this Patreon to see what \u003cstrong\u003eWolf 359 \u003c/strong\u003ewould look like with additional funding behind it, and the results blew us away. Thanks to the support we received, we were able to tell bigger stories, more formally inventive stories, stories with better production values. We produced longer episodes with a larger cast, mini-episodes, behind-the-scenes content including AMAs and videos; we held giveaways and public meet-up events. We got to make huge special episodes that explored the history and the past of the story\u0027s universe. We were able to do things that we\u2019d only dreamed about doing when we started the series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the show\u0027s over now, so that\u0027s it... right? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell... \u003cem\u003ealmost\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54b2fadfe4b09dfd24afc55d/t/589241aaa5790a096e933d23/1485980081365/FullSizeRender.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027s still a couple of things that we want to do with this team and this universe before we close the book on all things \u003cstrong\u003eWolf 359\u003c/strong\u003e. For the past three years, we\u0027ve been fully focused on making the show, and haven\u0027t made quite as many things \u003cem\u003eabout\u003c/em\u003e the show as we would have liked. Now that all the episodes are out, we want to make some of the DVD bonus features, as it were. We\u0027re going to put out audio commentaries for some of our favorite episodes, as well as a couple of other behind-the-scenes and retrospective bonus features. (And while we\u0027re doing that, we\u0027ll be hard at work on making the full book version of Pryce and Carter\u0027s Deep Space Survival Procedure and Protocol Manual available for you all.) All of this will be available exclusively to you, our Patreon backers, until the doors to our Patreon finally close for good on \u003cstrong\u003eMay 31st, 2017\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously this doesn\u0027t cost as much as making the show did, but, trust us, it\u0027s going to a good cause. Over the past three and a half years, the amazing team that worked on the show largely did it out of the goodness of their hearts and their dedication to getting this story told. Now that the production is done, all the contributions we receive will go directly towards paying the team behind this amazing show. Obviously we think that everyone that worked on the show did a world-class job, and we want to give them back as much as they gave the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have been one of our long-term Patreon supporters and, now that the show has ended, you feel it\u0027s time for you to direct your generosity to other sources, we totally get it! Thank you so much for helping us to tell the story in all it\u0027s crazy, out-of-control glory, and we hope our paths will meet again before too long. But if you want to take some peeks behind the curtain, and hear a bit more about what happened backstage during the making of the show, we hope you\u0027ll hang around for one more trip on board the U.S.S. Hephaestus! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/jkD6Bm/Full_Size_Render.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
