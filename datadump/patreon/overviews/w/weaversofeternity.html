    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eHey Weavers! It\u0027s great to see that you\u0027ve landed on my Patreon page. I\u0027m asking for your support because I absolutely love making paracord projects and tutorials on how to create them!\u00a0As you\u0027ve seen by my YouTube channel, I aim to produce high quality and easy to follow tutorial videos to assist you in learning the coolest and most interesting paracord weaves and projects out there. I strive to only put my best work out there as I never upload a video until I am 100% happy with it. Whether you are a beginner or seasoned veteran in the world of paracord weaving and bracelet making, I hope to provide you with new knowledge or tips and tricks that you weren\u0027t aware of. With your support, I can spend more time making tutorial videos with even better quality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking the paracord tutorial videos in the way that I do them takes time, effort, and energy. I\u0027m most definitely not complaining as I LOVE the entire process! However, it does incur costs to a degree for materials as I have all necessary materials shipped directly to me. Paracord itself is relatively inexpensive, but to keep things interesting I still often by new products and colors to incorporate into videos. So your donations would go towards new materials for tutorials each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for equipment, I\u0027ve got a decent setup, but if I were to be able to fund better lighting, an even better camera, and perhaps even a dedicated microphone, I\u0027d be able to have even better technical quality in the tutorial videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, just to be clear, all donations would go into the YouTube channel and Patreon rewards.\u003cbr\u003eMy videos will always be 100% free to view on Youtube. Do not feel obligated to donate, this is only for people who want to give and want to receive the rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Any leftover funds would help me pay for things such as living expenses and what not. I\u0027m not by any means trying to get \"rich\" from donations, as I live very modestly. However, if one day I could quit my \"day job\" and make tutorial videos for a living, I would be ever so grateful. \u00a0I firmly believe that doing what you love is the key to true the true riches in life.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo sum up the benefits for you of supporting Weavers of Eternity:\u003cbr\u003e- Increased tutorial production. (More videos, more frequently!)\u003cbr\u003e- Better production. (Better lighting, audio, camera)\u003cbr\u003e- Potentially launch a WOE line of products and supplies in the future.\u003cbr\u003e- Rewards! (Giveaways and perks!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for even taking the time to read and consider supporting me on this journey!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Tim :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m no complete expert on paracord weaving for that matter, but what I do believe I excel at is learning how to do a weave and then translating it into a video tutorial that is easy to follow and understand. I hope you will support me on Patreon as my dream is to keep making tutorials on a regular basis for all to enjoy in this awesome hobby!",
