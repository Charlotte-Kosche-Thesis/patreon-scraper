The goal is that the books will be unique because they come with an unlimited print option. The coloring book is purchased once, and you can print individual pages from them as many times as you like - forever! The art is unique because it will not be available anywhere else aside from Patreon and the coloring books themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour role as a Patron will allow me to afford to do that and will give you some great rewards in the process! \u00a0Depending on the tier, you can get downloadable pages, access to art live streams, commission original artworks, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere will be coloring books of specific subject collections, each one of them taking approximately 100 days to create because I will only compile a book with at least 100 unique images. \u00a0Each of these images will have 3 main variations on them (basic, intermediate, and advanced.) \u00a0Each of those variations will have 6 further variations - patterned (think zentangle or henna designs), paisley patterns (think fabric like a quilt), mandala versions, page doll / sticker book style, gray scale, and a light gray version to allow coloring without the bold black lines and also allow you to edit the image while coloring. \u00a0This means each coloring book will have 100 unique designs in 21 versions meaning a coloring book will have \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e2,100 MINIMUM images\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will also be an \"Everything!\" coloring book which will be a massive grouping of every coloring book page I have designed which will include some from books not yet created. \u00a0Currently, I have coloring books already in the designing stage for unicorns, farm animals, horses, and dragons, aliens, and tree houses. I would love to do ones for birds, trains, angels, abstract designs, scenery, dogs, and many other subjects. \u003cstrong\u003eWith all the planned coloring books, the \"Everything!\" book will have at least \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e25,200 images\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e in it!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to produce a finished image per week, but this takes time and time needs to be spent where it is most financially responsible. \u00a0Sometimes I might go a while without an image if I am having to scramble to find work in my business, or a client has a huge project. \u00a0I will keep updating via posts alerting you to the status of the work being done on specific pieces\u00a0(but they are not necessarily the only ones I am working on at the time.) \u00a0I am just posting about one image at a time until it is completed through the entire range of versions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat this means for you is eventually, the works will be completed in what appears a shorter window of time as my efforts are constantly being focused in a wide range of areas. \u00a0When the one I am working on now is complete, I may well have 2-3 versions of another done, which can and will be released to you as a patron, and so on until there is relatively no time between completion of one and another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you check my goals, there are milestones that promise more art at a faster pace (at $300.00/per month via Patreon I promise 3 finished images per week, etc.) \u00a0This is because I can relax that much more about keeping my business going (continue providing support to current clients, less time looking for new clients, etc.) and put that extra effort into my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some other coloring page ideas I have been developing:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://orig08.deviantart.net/0eea/f/2017/186/5/4/looking_for_space_groundwork_small_by_weavingmagic-dbf5iaa.jpg\" style=\"width: 329px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig14.deviantart.net/d170/f/2017/186/a/4/steampunk_dragon_small_by_weavingmagic-dbf5i5x.jpg\" style=\"width: 196px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig08.deviantart.net/2700/f/2017/186/b/1/mini_horse_small_by_weavingmagic-dbf5i5e.jpg\" style=\"width: 329px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 89, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMilestones Reached!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003ehe following milestones have been reached and I have included more information about them:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e$50.00 Comment Drawing #1 \u003cbr\u003eThis was completed and uploaded on 2/5/2014.

     "about": "I am a multimedia artist with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Visual Arts and a minor in English composition. \u00a0My concentration in school was in Studio painting. \u00a0I studied oil, watercolor, acrylic, as well as drawing and composition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfterwards I found I had to get a regular office job for 9-5 type work, and by the time that was over, I was exhausted enough I had no energy to create. \u00a0I wanted to create, and multiple times set out to focus on creating, and tried different angles, but nothing came together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI needed something like Patreon. \u00a0Somewhere that (in a modern version of the Renaissance era) someone who liked my work could support me in a way that I can keep the necessities going and not be stressed over making ends meet. \u00a0Stress destroys my creativity flow. \u00a0I needed freedom from stress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now Patreon comes around and I am able to do this. \u00a0I can create a little art each day until I can afford through your patronage to create more and more art per day. \u00a0This is the perfect first step of the transition into my accomplishing the initial goal of being a full time artist. \u00a0I am going to keep going on Patreon, and through the support and patronage of each month will be able to create great works of art, large or small, that will tantalize and spark the imagination for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks once again! \u00a0Without you, I wouldn\u0027t be here having the time of my life!",
