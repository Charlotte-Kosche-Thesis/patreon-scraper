I\u0027m a writer who lives in California, and I\u0027m the\ncreator of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Wilderness.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e This page is a collection of my\ntransformation-themed writing and content, ranging from transformation short stories and illustrations, to poetry, comics, and more. I\u0027ve been writing short stories and poetry for many years now, and I welcome the chance to share my work with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy writing is influenced primarily by Native American folklore along with other\ncultural mythology and more contemporary subjects. I choose transformation as a running theme in my\nwork because it\u0027s an essential element of life itself.  We all grow and\nchange with our experiences. I\u0027m fascinated with the concept of physical transformation in particular since it serves as a powerful metaphor for reacting to all manner of life-events. My stories challenge my characters to resolve their identities in new and changing bodies, and wrestle with both the benefits and consequences such changes would bring about. Writing\ntransformation-based literature grants me an opportunity to explore\nthe dynamic, magical character of humanity and life itself, in both\nits highs and its lows. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t Patrons will gain early access to all of my posts here, which will\nbecome later available for all to view one month after their initial\npost date. Once a month, I\u0027ll post a VLOG where I answer Patron questions about upcoming projects, transformation in general, or anything you\u0027d like to learn more about. You\u0027ll also find that supporting \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Wilderness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e at higher tiers allows you to participate in monthly polls which influence the choices that some characters have to make as they navigate their changed lives. The most generous\nof supporters will even find their own characters meshed into the\nstories. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIt is my hope that I will be able to provide regular content for\nyour enjoyment and grow my skills as a writer and storyteller through\nthis endeavor. It would be a dream come true for my writing to be my main source of\nincome and to be able to devote my time to fully developing the worlds\nand storylines here in \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Wilderness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo won\u0027t you wander in the wild of your heart with me awhile?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n~ Lupus\u003cbr\u003e"
