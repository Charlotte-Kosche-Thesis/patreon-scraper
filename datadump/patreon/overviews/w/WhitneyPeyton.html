    "summary": "I\u0027ve always been a homegrown artist with a Firecracker vision! When I created \"Team Underdog\", the movement, it was with the mindset of representing determined, positive, open-minded individuals that go against the grain. I\u0027m still an indie musician, but I\u0027ve been able to climb exponentially from humble beginnings because of you. Due to the growth, I wanted to create a platform where I can have the biggest Underdogs in one place to view official videos before they\u0027re released, get exclusive merch and art, help me choose my set list for shows, choose the songs I remix, get free mp3\u0027s, have access to exclusive live streams and vlogs, and much more unique perks and prizes I\u0027ll be brainstorming and creating constantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years I\u0027ve had fans tell me I should make street teams and for years I sat down with specialists in the music industry as we tried to figure out how mailing physical flyers and promo material to thousands of fans in such a digital age could be accomplished financially. We\u0027ve set up email lists and FB pages to represent the movement.. but nothing like THIS. THIS is what we\u0027ve been looking for all along... a way to share exclusive bonuses for the long-term, hard core TOP DOGS and a way for me to communicate more directly in a medium that can allow you as supporters to actually take part in molding my career. I\u0027ll be adding more tiers and rewards as we go.... Welcome to the Dog House!\u003cbr\u003e"
