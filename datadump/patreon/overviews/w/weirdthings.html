Goblins, ghosts, ESP, and full-on shouting arguments over space elevators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is the Weird Things podcast.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFive years ago on a Skype call between us, we realized that one of the things that made us friends was our love of strange topics while still being firm critical thinkers and lovers of science.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shwood.com/weirdthings/guys-smmmm.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWe\u2019d been looking for a way to share this love of science and weird things with others. We wanted to promote critical thinking, yet not belittle oddball ideas or ridicule (in a mean way) the people that hold them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe answer was right in front of us; let\u2019s have these conversations with anybody who wanted to listen. We could share what we found interesting about Bigfoot, killer AI, the perils of using an ape as a guard animal and everything else. People could participate as Andrew forced Brian and Justin into his little philosophical mind games and scenarios. They could watch Justin try diffuse the tension as Andrew and Brian argued about space elevators and the ethical dilemma of cloning your dead child so you\u2019re wife won\u2019t know about the horrible fireworks accident in the backyard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom that, the Weird Things Podcast was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shwood.com/weirdthings/battle.png\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); width: 381px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWe had no idea how it would grow.
