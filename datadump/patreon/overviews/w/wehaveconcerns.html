    "summary": "Hi! We\u0027re Jeff Cannata and Anthony Carboni. Last month we started hosting a podcast together in our spare time. It\u0027s called \u003cem\u003eWe Have Concerns\u003c/em\u003e and it\u0027s \u00a0a mix of science, philosophy, and improv comedy. It\u0027s also where we get all of our weird out. We have a lot of weird to get out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can listen to it here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wehaveconcerns.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewehaveconcerns.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking this podcast was a bit of an experiment, but it turned out to be a lot of fun. Even better, we\u0027ve heard from a lot of people who really love it. \u00a0We decided we want to keep making it. \u00a0There are a few ways we could make that happen. One would be to join a podcast network. Another would be to sell advertising on the show. But we didn\u0027t want to do either of those. People seem to like that our episodes are short and contained, and we like that, too. \u00a0We don\u0027t want to mess that up with a bunch of extra stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re doing something weird and different and new with this show. It\u0027s still growing and changing and figuring out what it\u0027s going to be. Right now it\u0027s just us and the awesome (and weird) community of listeners, figuring this thing out together. We\u0027d like to keep it that way for as long as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the show we hope you\u0027ll contribute. We want to be a bright spot in your day, three times a week, and hope you\u0027ll find enough value in that to support our efforts. \u00a0We\u0027ve tried to put together some fun extras for those of you that do. You can check them out down below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo give the show a listen. If you like it, tell your friends about it. And if you can, please consider donating to help us continue to make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eJeff \u0026amp; Anthony\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - The blood thing is not a joke.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDude, you have to stop saying that. They\u0027re going to think you mean that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eReally?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYes, really.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood. \u003cstrong\u003eThe blood thing is not a joke.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
