There will be commercials, but it\ndoesn\u0027t look like it will be any worse than before. At least, for\nnow. As part of this move, I gave up control on where commercials\nfall and how many of them run... to Radionomy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are new listen\nlinks posted on the website now. TuneIn and other aggregators will be\nupdating their links soon. For now, you can listen and grab playlist\nfiles for your media players at WQQN.NET\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe music was rather\nhastily uploaded to their servers over two days. So there will be\nsome errors, and the songs won\u0027t flow from one to the next as\nsmoothly. There may be a second or so of silence between some of the\nsongs, for now, but I\u0027ll be fixing those over the next few days and\nweeks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo those of you that\npledged your money, THANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am canceling your\npledges, because I did say that if we did not meet goal, I would do\nthat. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I\u0027m\nrepurposing the Patreon page as a tip jar. So please, if you love\nWQQN.NET, please consider pledging (or re-pledging) to help offset\nbuying things for the stream or to show your appreciation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe outpouring of\nsupport to keep WQQN.NET alive has been awesome and humbling. Thank\nyou!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd thank you for\nlistening to WQQN.NET!\u003cbr\u003e"
