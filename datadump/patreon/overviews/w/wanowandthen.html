    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eTHE STORY BEHIND MY FIGHT TO KEEP WANOWANDTHEN.COM ONLINE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnline funding via Google Adsense is drying up and keeping wanowandthen online is becoming a real struggle but not just due to the lack of funds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube is an essential part of wanowandthen due to the videos I post there. These are embedded in my website and until recently this had been slowly gaining ground and was starting \nto make up for some of the losses on my main website, where revenue from Adsense has \nbeen plummeting like an airliner with all engines shut down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Jan 2018, I, along with thousands of other small YouTube \ncreators, got a lovely little message saying that we were about to be \nkicked out of the \u2018partner program\u2019 because we don\u2019t have 4000 watch \nhours per year and less than 1000 subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been fighting to bring those figures up, but a month is simply\n not enough time to get them to the stipulated level, so another source of funding \nthat I was relying on seems like it is about to dry up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been slogging away for about 8 years and have always had the \nhope that one day, the work I have been doing will be \u2018discovered\u2019 and \nthings would turn around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI write online books as another way to try and fund what I have been doing but nothing seems to ever take off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are no grants available for individuals, commercial businesses \naren\u2019t interested. Government, apart from DPaW, has completely ignored \nme and the issues with my brain (I have early onset dementia) are taking more of a toll on me every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nwanowandthen has been doing better and better. More hits, record \nnumbers of click-troughs to adverts yet income from Google Adsense has \nplummeted from close to $300 a month to around $50.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the time I have been using Adsense, (plus all other funding \nmethods I have tried) I have received a little over $10k. Sounds good \nright? When you look at what it has cost me to keep everything going, \nthe story isn\u2019t anywhere near as rosy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nExpenses, including vehicle repairs to our expedition vehicle, \nupgrading cameras and equipment, paying for web-hosting and organising \nexpeditions have all cost in excess of $19k. That is $9k that has come \ndirectly out of my own pocket just to keep everything online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery cent I have been able to get via my PDF book sales, \nadvertising and donations from kind supporters has made a difference. \nNow that our funding is drying up, there is just no incentive for me to \ntry and keep going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI struggle every day with the problems my dementia is creating. All \nit takes is for someone to talk to me while I am working on something, \nfor me to completely lose track of where I am. Sometimes I can get back \nto working fairly quickly, but other times I am just lost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to leave something behind that is really meaningful, I want\n to contribute for as long as I am able to, but having the rug pulled \nout from under me by greedy big business is just heartbreaking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo be honest, I would be lost without having my website to work on \nand I will probably end up going down-hill faster, if I do walk away \nfrom it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see Google posting thousands of adverts on my website for\n virtually nothing and to see YouTube take my other tiny income away but\n continue to place adverts on my content so that they can continue to \nmake money, just disgusts me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI haven\u2019t given up yet and I am still fighting to get the required \nfigures on YouTube but if I don\u2019t get there, I just don\u2019t know where \nthat will leave me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do is worth something. 16 million hits a year on wanowandthen means a lot of people are using the information I provide. I need your help to keep going. A dollar a month from a hundred people will make all the difference in the world. If I get more, I can do so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe time I have left to work on this is going to be limited by my condition, it would be such a waste not to be able to do all I can, while I can. Won\u0027t you consider making a difference and becoming a Patreon supporter?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t help any other way PLEASE subscribe to my YouTube channel : \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/mgglasby\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/mgglasby \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
