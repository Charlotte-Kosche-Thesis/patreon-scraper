     "about": "An alternative multi-genre crossover singer-songwriter solo project hailing from Vermont and on the road among those lonely streets of America gave birth to a transgender female singer-songwriter/musician named October Evans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last 8 years, Evans has gone on an incredible and rather emotional hellish journey to get to where she is today, having lost her former bandmates of Empty Existence, Dead by December and Asphyixaphiliac Heart to different tragic situations (from drug overdoses to car accidents and suicides) and overcoming the losses of her late beloved daughter and wife, she has stood alone, withstood the tests of time and traveled all the roads known and lesser known just to find herself again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter several failed attempts to form a band with members in Florida, she left to rediscover her musical roots back in Vermont and thus gave birth to her long overdue solo project, known to be called Wanderlust Grrrl. Her vocals and lyrics/songwriting styles are something to behold, combining multiple genres/sub-genres and the influences of her musical heroes she grew up listening to, ranging from Staind to Rage Against The Machine, from Godsmack to Linkin Park, from Cold In May to Rob Zombie and many other metal/alternative/industrial/hard rock/grunge/post-grunge/gothic/electronica acts that she grew up idolizing until one day, she finally found her own natural sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a new solo debut album coming soon and many other creative multi-industry projects and ventures she\u0027s currently involved in, such as the BDSM adult entertainment art smut porn industry, her work as a photographer, writer/poet/journalist/blogger, artist/painter, model/actress, filmmaker/producer/screenplay writer/director/videographer, and many other creative entrepreneurial careers she\u0027s involved in, she is excited to launch a new solo career that\u0027s just her and her alone, which was always the best path forward since many of her friends has had encouraged her in the past to just do it solo and fuck everyone else and what they thought of her, and solo she went!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, she resides in Vermont temporarily and is working on several creative entrepreneurial projects, including the recording sessions for her long overdue solo album. Stay tuned for more updates and details as this amazing solo musician/singer-songwriter/recording artist gets ready to finish what she started years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a92012-2017 Wanderlust Grrrl Music/Wanderlust Beatnik Studios.
