    "summary": "Hello!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Wouter van Wijhe, a Dutch pianist who is creating music videos for Youtube. I\u0027m 23 years old, married and working in the field of Human Resources, in the future I\u0027m hoping to become a philosopher or in the best case scenario fulltime musician of course.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI play piano in various genres like soundtracks/scores, pop, original tracks and classical music but I would like to do more and specialise in preferably soundtracks/scores.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I want?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though music is my passion I currently have little time to learn arrangements, to record them and to share them with you. I have many ambitious plans of recording my music on beautiful Dutch locations, of collaborating with other artists (singers and more), of performances/live streams based on your suggestions/requests and making more entertaining video\u0027s and arrangements. Because my video quality now is very basic. Besides that I\u0027d love to be able to provide you all with sheet music of my arrangements and with midi files.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of those things I\u0027m already doing for free and I would definitly want to keep it that way. So Why Patreon? My main reason for starting a patreon account is to be able to make more time for creating better and more music videos/arrangements and for buying better equipment (for example an (affordable) stage piano for outside performance videos). Besides that I would like to get to know you better and want to offer more exclusive \"services\" such as livestreams, piano coaching (one on one), giving you a say in what I do next and sharing my audio files/original albums with you all. And perhaps even some exlusive covers special for you from time to time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs listed in the rewards you get many perks like a vote in my next cover, free audio files of my original music, livestreams, even piano lessons at higher levels. Actually these are just suggestions, if you can come up with something better that is suited to your support-level we\u0027ll work something out you like!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeel free to donate!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those interested in such perks and/or for those who are so kind to support me I\u0027m happy with any donations you can afford. There is no obligation, no set amount of time you need to donate or any catches. Even a 1 dollar subscription a month helps me a great deal :) With patreon I can also prevent having annoying commercials before my videos or asking money for everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions or suggestions I\u0027m open to it and much is possible if you just ask.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith kind regards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWouter\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow you can find 5 examples of things I\u0027ve done so far, but it\u0027s only just the beginning!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
