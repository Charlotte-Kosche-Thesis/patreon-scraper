    "summary": "Hey guys, I\u0027m gonna be as up front about this as possible.\u00a0 I put a lot of effort into making videos.\u00a0 Some weeks more than others, sometimes I want to, and sometimes I don\u0027t.\u00a0 But I enjoy doing it.\u00a0 I like interacting with subscribers, I like \"performing\" or whatever you would call the act of making videos.\u00a0 However while I do all this the real world carries right on. I still need to work, I still have to pay bills.\u00a0 I would very much like to do this full time some day, but that\u0027s still pretty far off, if possible at all.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s my thought process.\u00a0 Maybe when I first start this I make maybe $10 a month? Hey thats a nice little bonus at the end of the month! Say by some crazy fictional generosity it gets to $50-100 a month.\u00a0 Well shit now my car insurance is paid without me having to worry about it.\u00a0 Now I\u0027m not even going to put a number because I can\u0027t fathom it getting higher than that.\u00a0 But let\u0027s say in the middle of riding my pet unicorn \"princess muttonchops\" and hanging out with my friend Sean the leprechaun that I manage to get more than that.\u00a0 Well now we\u0027re talking serious things.\u00a0 New equipment? less shifts at work to focus on videos? This is where things start getting crazy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s my pitch.\u00a0 If you donate it makes my life slightly easier and with less things to worry about I can focus more on the YouTube channel.\u00a0 That\u0027s it, no more sarcasm or jokes, thats the honest truth of me starting a patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a monthly subscription isn\u0027t your cup of tea then you can always donate once or at your own whim at \u003ca href=\"https://twitch.streamlabs.com/wrathofzalis\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitch.streamlabs.com/wrathofzalis\u003c/a\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e"
