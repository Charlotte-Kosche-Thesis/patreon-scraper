This is where WACUP comes into play by trying to do what can be done by the Winamp community which is where almost off of the good things about Winamp came from anyway :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThankfully for us, the \u003cstrong\u003e5.666\u003c/strong\u003e release (when patched\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003ee.g.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.filehorse.com/download-winamp/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efrom here\u003c/a\u003e) is a solid version of Winamp (more so if you only install the parts of it that you want to use as has always been the case despite some misconceptions about 5.x vs 2.x) and which can be used as a basis to work on top off. Making my own player is still beyond my skill level and I honestly think it\u0027s better to use what we\u0027ve already got as a basis than taking even longer to get something that works as writing a player from scratch involves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for Winamp is not available (I won\u0027t get into the open sourcing argument) however for the majority of features being considered this is not really a problem and it just means certain things can take longer to implement than would be liked\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003ee.g.\u003c/strong\u003e basic streaming support to listen to what is playing in Winamp elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://getwacup.com/images/wacup_about_new_streaming.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to Winamp being very modular in how it is built and provided, this makes it much easier to either add new features or replace existing plug-ins for better re-implementations that do what you (the Winamp user) actually want out of Winamp.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo by supporting this patreon, it will allow me to keep working on creating new features and maintaining WACUP to keep Winamp working on current and modern versions of Windows to come for those that want to keep using an equivalently \"actively developed\" Winamp.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of the launch of this patreon in September 2017, I have already committed 20 months of my time (I started out working on Winamp plug-ins as a 3rd party plug-in developer back in 2003 so I have a little bit of experience with Winamp and plug-ins, etc) to get to the initial release being sent out for closed beta testing In \u003ca href=\"https://getwacup.com/changelog/beta_0_9_9_1316.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNovember 2016\u003c/a\u003e with then at least one beta release (often more on average) a month to the registered \u003ca href=\"https://getwacup.com/#beta\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebeta testers\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to get involved?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently WACUP is being developed as a \u003ca href=\"https://getwacup.com/#beta\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclosed beta\u003c/a\u003e which is to save some users from installing and breaking their Winamp installs due to WACUP replacing large parts of Winamp which can cause issues with some of the beta builds. If you want to help out beta testing then join the WACUP \u003ca href=\"https://getwacup.com/community/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecommunity forum\u003c/a\u003e and drop \u0027\u003cstrong\u003edro\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027 a pm to show your interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll state now that I\u0027m not having beta access be a patreon exclusive as I\u0027m more than aware that people cannot necessarily financially commit to helping (as everyone\u0027s time has some value) but can still help out as much as they can via feedback, suggestions and if possible beta testing, etc. Plus it wouldn\u0027t be fair on the existing beta testers from the last year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about rewards for supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a very good question as isn\u0027t updates for Winamp via WACUP enough of a reward already? I\u0027ll honestly admit I don\u0027t know what would be a good reward other than what I\u0027m already doing by working on WACUP other than including your name and maybe an associated website for some promotion of your things within the \u0027\u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027 section of the WACUP preferences\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003ee.g..\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://getwacup.com/images/wacup_about_new_thanks.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve got suggestions then please do let me know though please try to keep them to not be costly or too time consuming as the point is to allow me to do WACUP coding :)\u00a0 As I need you to help me to be able to help you so we all get the best out of things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally I just want to thank you if you do decide to help support this patreon and for having the belief in wanting to see it succeed. For anyone reading this but is not in a position to help out financially, if WACUP is something you like then you can still help out by promoting it or offering your time (if you can) to help with the beta testing or to just make suggestions and other constructive feedback to help shape the future of what is looked into and eventually provided.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-dro\u003cbr\u003e"
