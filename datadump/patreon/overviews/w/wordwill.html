Some of these will come to you, the supports, before they go out to the public. Sometimes these will go out into the world, for free or for sale, \u003cem\u003ebecause\u003c/em\u003e you helped summon them into existence. Your participation here gets you early content, often at a bargain price, and a chance to weigh in that the general public doesn\u0027t always get.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, I\u0027ve got my notes and materials from talks at Metatopia and PAX Dev to adapt and share with you. I\u0027ve got one more post to add to that GUMSHOE series at Medium. Lots more coming in text, audio, and maps. Our episodes of \u003cem\u003eDesign Games\u003c/em\u003e are funded via Patreon, for example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also get some direct electronic correspondence from me in the form of messages for patrons only \u2014 because sometimes a letter beats a blog entry. (And because blogging sometimes feels like singing to an empty house.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I buy and write pretty terrific thank-you cards, if I do say so myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(151,72,6);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(151,72,6);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003eHow Does This Work?\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I can, I produce a new thing \u2014 be it an essay, an adventure, a podcast \u2014 and when I share it, you and/or the public gets the thing. It might be a post someplace, a PDF, or an MP3, for example. If you\u0027re backing at an apt level to receive bonus rewards, you get those, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to produce a new creation most months, but some months you\u0027ll get more material than others. I don\u0027t anticipate charging patrons more than twice per month and I\u0027ll warn you first. I can\u0027t fault any of you for not wanting to pay twice or thrice per month \u2014 I\u0027m grateful for whatever you can spare to help me pay for these hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your assistance, I can shake loose some new notions and help us explore wondrous, imaginary places.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
