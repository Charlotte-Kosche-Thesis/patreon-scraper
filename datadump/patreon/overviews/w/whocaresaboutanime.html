    "summary": "Hello, hola, and konnichiwa! The name\u0027s Jonny Lobo, and I\u0027ve been actively involved in the anime-viewing community since 2009.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom abridged parodies and AMV\u0027s to conventions and forums, I\u0027ve dabbled in nearly every facet of appreciation for this Japanese-turned-global phenomenon known as \"anime\" at one point or another.\u00a0I began viewing localized versions of several series in the late nineties, and in more recent years I\u0027ve since returned to this favorite pastime of mine as a writer and trained film critic to delve further into anime as an artistic and commercial medium. Whether I\u0027m addressing hardened film theorists, longtime connoisseurs, or casual consumers, I hope that I can play a small part in helping others better understand this fascinating edifice of Japanese culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo this end, when I\u0027m not assisting my long-time friend Michael Perge with \"Did You Know Anime?\" or tending to the typical minutiae of a freelance writer\u0027s life, I regularly gather a few of my friends from the world of anime critiquing to shoot the breeze on various titles and topics. It\u0027s truly a mixed bag of insights as each episode may feature different participants or a special guest: you may end up profoundly empathizing with a cast member\u0027s poignant takeaway, or you might wind up laughing hysterically as the conversation takes an unexpected left turn down an off-topic rabbit hole. The point? We all have fun, and I think you will too if you take the time to tune in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for checking out \"Who Cares About Anime.\" Although my involvement with anime has never revolved around money, as I grow older I find there are mysteriously fewer hours in each day. I can only allocate so much time to fun projects like podcasts anymore, so any little bit of support helps. Regardless of monetary sponsorship, the podcast remains freely available to anyone and everyone, all while being open to insightful comments or suggestions for future topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope I\u0027ve made clear by now that I definitely care about anime! Who \u003cem\u003eelse\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0out there cares? Let\u0027s find out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Jonny"
