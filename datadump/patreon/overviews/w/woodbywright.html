I love to create things\u00a0\u00a0for the joy of the process and not just the end goal, but even more then that I love helping others learn to do the same!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why do I need your support? \u003cbr\u003eIt is my goal to pump out as much info and content, ideas, and support as possible. The average video takes around 14 hours or more and I try to put out 2-3 a week. That takes supplies, training, and most or all equipment (video, audio, tools)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, your support would help me dedicate more money to supplies and new tools, as well as audio/video equipment. This helps me keep making better videos, of better projects for you to enjoy and learn from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost all of my projects are documented on YouTube, and I am wanting to soon be giving out free plans and step by step guides when I can devote more time to that. It is my goal to never sell anything but provide training and content free to everyone. You can be a huge part of what it takes to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for checking out my page, and any type of support that you give. I hope you enjoy my projects and are inspired to try new things and ideas!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWood By Wright\u003cbr\u003eJames Wright\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/WoodWright\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/WoodWright\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
