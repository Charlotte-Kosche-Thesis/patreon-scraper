I\u2019ve been cosplaying for over 10 years creating lots of costumes along the way.  Before I got into cosplaying, I used to paint, draw, sculpt and created mix media art.  Cosplay allows me to combine all of that into one giant wearable piece of art.  Furthermore, it allows me to express my love for things that I enjoy and inspire me.  I love sharing my creations with this loving and growing community, but I also love helping fellow cosplayers grow in their own creative costume pursuits!  That\u2019s why I\u2019m on Patreon.  My hope is this little area will become our own intimate community where can grow, share, learn and create some really awesome stuff together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://windofthestars.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhy Patreon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI want to share everything with you.  From my creative process, to every step of my costume progress, every photoshoot, and Patreon is going to make that possible.  With your monthly contribution, I will be able to dedicate more time to producing the content that you have asked for and that I want to give, plus some extra fun stuff along the way to thank you for your generosity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also want to emphasize that you DO NOT have sign up for Patreon!  I will continue to post the same level and amount of content you currently see on my social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.).   I can express enough how much I appreciate everyone\u2019s support, even if it is just a simple like on an image.  Patreon is simply here for those that wish to support my costume art and see it grow, who want to be apart of every step of the costume creation, who want to learn how to improve their craft, and who want to see exclusive content you can\u2019t see anywhere else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eHere\u2019s what you can expect to see here on Patreon:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive Cosplay and Sexy Photoshoots and Photos\u003c/strong\u003e - Completely exclusive to my Patreon, you\u2019ll see themed/conceptual cosplay boudoir, pin-up, and sexy shoots.

I want you to be apart of this process too, so I\u2019ll be open to suggestions and you can tell me what you want to see!\u003cbr\u003e I\u2019ll also be doing monthly cosplay shoots featuring new or old costumes. This is where I hope to be able to create those dream photoshoots and create some pretty rad-tastic photos.

I\u2019m hoping with Patreon, I\u2019ll finally be able to act on these creative aspirations!
