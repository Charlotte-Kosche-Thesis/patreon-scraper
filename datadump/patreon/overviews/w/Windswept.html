Projecting the viewer into the piece, the viewers mind drifts to worlds where anything is possible. With a visual resonance, Tyrone sets the dominant color, settling into lighting the environment. Guiding the observer into the fantasy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUtilizing the fine spray paint art medium, Tyrone J, Webb II, is one of the rare artists establishing a clear set of techniques in HD imaging.
