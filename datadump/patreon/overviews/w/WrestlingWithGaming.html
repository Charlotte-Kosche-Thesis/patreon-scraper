My videos aren\u0027t lazily made opinion pieces. They are well researched and meticulously edited mini documentaries, made with the goal of preserving gaming history and educating others about it along the way. Some of the topics I\u0027ve covered include the history of the Game Genie, Sega\u0027s 32 bit internal war, the 3DO, the story of the Philips CD-i, the making of Superman 64, the story behind the Super FX chip, and the story of the Power Glove, just to name a few.
