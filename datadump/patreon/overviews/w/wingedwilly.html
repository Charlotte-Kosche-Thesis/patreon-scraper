Life became awesome and never a boring place. There\u0027s no time for even one boring minute - all my time is filled with drawings now! I really enjoy and LOVE drawing stuff, it feels amazing and AWESOME! Yet, life is not a one-sided coin, there\u0027s always a \"but\". Everything has changed a lot since I drew my first sketch. It was childish and naive, yet I was happy to bits. I\u0027ve grown up, and my art grew up as well. Its not a one-minute thing now, it takes a lot of time because it\u0027s not a few circles and lines now - it\u0027s an art I\u0027m doing for myself and for you! :) I LOVE working with pencils and paper, markers and rubbers, drawing is totally my thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2014/162/d/9/call_upon_the_power_by_wingedwilly-d7lxf1k.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s few more picture I want to show you for you to have a better idea of stuff you\u0027d patron for.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m doing two types of comic - \"Born to be a Hero\" page comic -\u003cbr\u003eA blazing neon story about the adventures of a sneaky (ninja-style) young dragon Flay in a medieval setting.

It\u0027s not like its the end of life, but I reaaaally prefer to do what I like and not what I should, right? So that\u0027s where you guys show up on the scene like the heroes to save the day. I would be able to ignore a full-time job much longer with your great patron help here, on Patreon. You can help me draw more, and you guys would totally get more comic pages and art from me. People say an artist\u0027s life is no way making a living, I say - \"We can do it!\". But I\u0027ll be able to defend these words only one way- \u00a0with your help, my great friends. I would be really grateful to have you as my Patreon patron, since that would make my dream come true - draw for living and live for drawing for you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://th09.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2015/054/0/1/progress_by_wingedwilly-d8j7czu.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
