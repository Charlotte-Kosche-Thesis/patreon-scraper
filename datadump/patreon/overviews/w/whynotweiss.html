    "summary": "Greetings! My name is Sean W. Adair and I am a professional VFX artist with credits on major Hollywood films, TV series, music videos and commercials including \"Fantastic Four\", \"Skyfall\", \"Godzilla\", \"Jupiter Ascending\", \"Flash\", \"Supergirl\", and many more. You can see a partial list of my credits:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3272039\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.imdb.com/name/nm3272039\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a lifelong fan of former child star Shaun Weiss (Goldberg from \"Mighty Ducks\", \"Heavyweights\", \"Freaks and Geeks\", \"Drillbit Taylor\", \"King of Queens\" and many more) and after a chance meeting 4 years ago, we hit it off immediately (maybe because we have the same first name). Though he had fallen on tough times, I found him to be a hilarious actor and comedian who is still as funny or funnier than anyone in comedy today and I began\u00a0developing \"Why Not Weiss\" as a vehicle to make his comeback into international stardom a reality. Together, we have written and produced three episodes of a fictional comedic web series which you can watch at the links below. If you don\u0027t think they are funny, I will eat my Mac.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 01 - Shaun Makes A Podcast\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Avs1Vd4Zn9w\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/58pBXumb4Mw\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eEpisode 02 - Personal Assistant\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/wOLNsfcxqR0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/sJfAL4TBVa0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eEpisode 03 - Comedy Buddies\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/0PGYce4cZOE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/cfSr-Qjrhkk\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know I am not the only fan who wants to see Shaun Weiss perform comedy or for him to make a \u003cbr\u003ecomeback. Please join this effort by making a minimum contribution of $1/episode. That\u00a0will help us pay crew and actors, increase production value and continue making hilarious episodes released for free on YouTube while not starving to death in the process. Our goal is at least one hilarious multiple Webby and Emmy award winning 100 episode series and with your contribution, we can make that a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Help out by supporting my art. $1 isn\u0027t a hand out. If I made a movie it would cost you $15 to see it. If 1000 fans donate $1, I can follow my passion, writing/performing comedy. Artists nowadays can make work for their own fan base without having to rely on the politics of mainstream media, that chooses content and performers that promotes the agenda of their advertisers. Thanks to sites like Patreon, creators of content have the chance to create unique, groundbreaking content that wouldn\u0027t otherwise be possible. So if you\u0027re a \"true fan,\" PLEASE help us.\" -Shaun Weiss\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDucks fly together. QUACK! QUACK! QUACK! Or...

But there are lots of comedic ideas I come up with that I can\u0027t film because they involve renting locations (such as hockey rinks), buying props (such as Hockey sticks), or paying A-list Movie stars Shaun has worked with in the past even a fraction of their regular salary\u00a0(Mighty Ducks reunion anyone?). With at least $500/episode, the only limit to the comedy on screen is our imagination.",
