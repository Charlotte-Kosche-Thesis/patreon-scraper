    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m William Freeman. I love to draw weird illustrations and comics. Ideally I\u0027d like to create that sort of content full-time! If you like my work, you want to support me, or you\u0027re looking to give your money out arbitrarily then you\u0027re in the right place!\u00a0My work is pretty weird, very dark, and at times even...humorous. If that\u0027s something you\u0027re into join my little community and get access to my crazy world!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a wide range of ways that you, a concerned consumer can support my artistic endeavors, AND you\u0027ll get cool stuff out of it other than the warm-fuzzies of altruism (just like Ayn Rand predicted, that slimy twa-) COOL STUFF you say!? Like What!? I\u0027m glad \u00a0you asked! For just a dollar you can see my patron only feed and you can tell your parents you\u0027re a part of something bigger than yourself! For $3 you can even see that feed earlier than those plebs in the $1 tier. At $5 you\u0027ll get a super-secret feed that those faux-elitists in the $3 tier can\u0027t get their grubby $3 eyeballs on! At the $10 level, I\u0027ll bundle everything up from that month into a zine with extra super-secret special images only in the publication and mail it right to you! $20 tier members call no man master! And as an added benefit of masterlessness they\u0027ll receive a one time merch exclusive to that tier. You can wear it around your $10 tier friends and make them feel like $1 tier members. And, whenever I release a new merch item I\u0027ll automatically ship one to you as long as you\u0027re still in the $20 tier! Finally, the $100 tier. Honestly if you\u0027re in this tier I don\u0027t even know what I could possibly do to say thank you and repay you...but I\u0027ll start by sending you a new original work every month, plus all tiers get their previous tier\u0027s reward, so you\u0027ll also receive the merch and the zine!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll jokes aside any amount of support is greatly appreciated, and I hope that you feel you are getting something out of it. Thank you so much for even considering supporting me and feel free to share with anyone who you think would enjoy or benefit from my stream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
