I kind of think in 3D, and I love making things out of wood. My sculptures are like an extension of my paintings in that they tend to exhibit the same Will Reardon patented organic layered and distressed texture. Often geometric, mathematical or typographically inspired, my sculptures are an expression of my philosophical thinkings brought into the real world. By supporting Sculpture you stand in line to receive actual real 3D stuff in the post (depending on how much you pledge). I\u0027ll make little things to give away, or if you\u0027re a major patron we can chat about a special commission. Either way exciting times are ahead for amazing sculptural works. Your money will help realise a few things I\u0027ve had in mind for some time - chiefly getting stuff cast in bronze. I plan to make 3D designs on the computer, get them 3D printed and cast, which will result in a marketable product. I\u0027m constantly thinking of ways to monetise my work but need a bit of cash to get things up and running! Thanks for supporting this endeavour. You will not be sorry. I am going to be mega famous, so imagine the rewards down the line for being one of my first Patrons! Yes.",

There\u0027s more?\u003c/strong\u003e Will, how do you expect to, like, do all this stuff? No wonder you ain\u0027t making shit - you\u0027ve spread yourself too thin man. Nah man, its all good. Prints and small cards are a great way of getting my work out there and generate a bit of income. In fact there\u0027s way more to it than that. I\u0027ve got an important message to get out there right? Often the best way to express these things is in black and white. And bold geometric forms and compositions translate well through the medium of print. I\u0027ve only done screen prints so far but I want to get some digital prints done of stills from my animation work. Also some works I have in the pipeline are paintings with screen-prints on them - so using printing techniques to generate a single outcome. There\u0027s more: I want to get prints done of high res close up photos of my paintings - the organic textures work really well close up and these prints create really interesting random (and therefore pleasing to me) compositions. Thanks so much for supporting my prints! Guess what you get as your reward??\u003cbr\u003e",

I told you I have a problem. My brain keeps on coming up with ideas unto the point of explosion / collapse. I try to remedy this by writing the ideas down.\u00a0One day I get my act together and collate it all into a publishable tome. Probably under some sort of impractical heading like \"Everything\",\u00a0\"The Philosophy of Technology (and the Technology of Philosophy)\", or \"Quantum Thinking\".
