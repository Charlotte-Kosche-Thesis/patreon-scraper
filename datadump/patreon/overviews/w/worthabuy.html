I don\u0027t pretend\u00a0or claim to play games all the way to the end, I play them until I know if they are \"Worth a buy\".  This could mean anywhere from 2 hours to 18 hours, it all depends on the game and how complex it is to play. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI think \"Prey\" was the video that caught out all the liars, it was one of the few games I was given by publishers and no single reviewer was given a copy before launch day. Yet many people posted video\u0027s 11 hours later claiming to have completed the game which is around 20 hours long, all their game play was from the first 5 or 6 hours of the game. Stop believing these fakers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI am a dying breed of gamer, way too honest for this industry, I could make far more money just telling lies and pleasing the \"Fan boys\" but I simply can\u0027t do that, I have to tell it the way it is and that gets me a lot of enemies from different communities. \u00a0I honestly think most reviewers check out how big and toxic the community is for a game before they make their review, channel protection comes first! \u00a0It\u0027s totally obvious and this is why the gaming industry sucks, the publishers read their lies and think \"oh wow they like it, let\u0027s make more\" \u00a0while people like me get branded haters.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eEarnings\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI am going to be transparent so there is no hidden numbers, you guys deserve to know the truth, I have nothing to hide. \u00a0I am not asking for a huge wage unlike other reviewers, I am simply hoping to get a fair wage for my time, effort and money that I spend bringing you my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need $4800 per month to justify what I do, it sounds a lot but it\u0027s under the minimum wage and you have to remember I am in UK which has a poor conversion rate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere is a breakdown of my current earnings for you all to see.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon grants me $3600 Paypal about \u00a3120 by the time they take their cut I am left with \u00a32600 which is a lot of money until you take off my tax, expenses and national insurance contributions. \u00a0Then I am left with around \u00a31700 per month to live so basically, rent, food, council tax, pension, electricity, gas, water, car, petrol, internet etc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt still pays my way with a bit left at the end of the month but I work 75 hours a week to get this.  I could earn more as a car salesman doing 20 hours a week less, company car and company pension.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue with this as it\u0027s a passion but I am also a realist and passion does not pay the bills. \u00a0So I hope you can support me even with a small donation, help keep one of the only honest game review sites going. \u00a0Even a few pence/cents a week makes a huge difference and don\u0027t forget you also get rewarded for your loyalty, I may even introduce DLC and pre order bonuses ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMack\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
