About 5 years ago, I decided that I wanted to experience the other side of being a musical artist and so I went back to school to get my degree in Audio Production.  I wanted to score music to film, I wanted to create SFX for movies, commercials, you name it I wanted to record it and get it out there in the highest quality possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started WorkitBirdStudio Sessions this past October and I\u0027ve done 5 episodes so far and have had some really great responses from it. My goal was to create a live studio session feel with these episodes modeling my efforts after KEXP, from Seattle music videos. I wanted to host, engineer, edit and mix the show all with the help of one of my best friends to shoot and edit video. I want to put out a great promo piece for these bands to use however they please.  There is no cost to them only their time and a little promotion on their end with social media and a website appearance if they are so inclined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does your money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing these shows do not come without a cost, although it\u0027s mostly time and resources, as life gets crazier and crazier time becomes more of a commodity. \u00a0Through research and word of mouth I found Patreon thankfully, and I feel like this could be a great platform to get my videos out there and get these artists some recognition. \u00a0It also seems great for sponsorships and a chance to make some money to pay the people involved instead of having to beg them to do it for FREE! \u00a0My first 5 episodes were done completely with no budget and I only was able to pay my videographers in wine:(( \u00a0This year, I\u0027d like to be able to do more than that, and really put some great content out there and help support these artists get to where they want to be."
