    "summary": "Hello. I\u0027m William O. Tyler, an openly queer nerdy black guy with a love for pop culture, nature, darkness and the macabre. I\u0027m also an artist (working mostly with traditional wet mediums), a writer and and a maniacal cinephile.\u00a0I\u0027ve been working in the independent comics industry since 2004 and my work often reflects or revolves around themes of love and death, romance and nihilism, fantasy and horror, social consciousness, diversity and inclusion. As such, my work seems to be becoming more and more related to activism, whether subtle or blatant, but that\u0027s the way these things go during times of political roughness, isn\u0027t it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I absolutely love comics, and have always loved reading them, I stumbled into creating them by accident. My studies were always more focused towards writing and creating for film. In addition to my degree in Communications: Visual Media, I minored in Critical Cinema and also managed to associate most of my non-major and minor classes in school with film in some way. I love film. I think in film, and first found myself creating comics because of the similarities to storyboarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, my love of both comics and the movies would mash into WoT\u0027s Cinephilia, a weekly webcomic currently running right here on Patreon where I am able to share my thoughts on the movie industry and how the art form shapes the world around us, and vice versa.\u00a0While Cinephilia focuses mostly on pop culture, my other comic projects throughout the years have been original stories for print that I\u0027ve self-published including The Goth Queen, Ratboy and others. I\u0027m currently working on new content for both of those titles mentioned, as well as developing something brand new with the working title Kuroneko Tails. I\u0027d like to use Patreon to share more information, work in progress art and updates for all of these projects and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a presence here at Patreon, with support from patrons of the art like you, means that I can devote more time to creating these stories and comics and get them out to readers. I\u0027m truly honored by any generosity I might receive here, so I\u0027ve tried to pack in a lot of goodies for patrons including sneak peeks and exclusive art, movie reviews, live video streams and art demos, the list goes on. There\u0027s even a chance for you to suggest subjects for some of my art and to obtain original pieces of art! Please check out my pledges and goals and if anything interests you, feel free to join the fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you don\u0027t pledge, feel free to follow me here and elsewhere. And if ongoing patronage through Patreon isn\u0027t for you, you can also support by commissioning or buying original art, as well as comics, shirts, prints and other merchandise, through one of my shops. Thanks for checking out my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://williamotyler.format.com\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/WilliamOTyler\"\u003eetsy\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://society6.com/williamotyler\"\u003esociety6\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/williamotyler/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamOTyler\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://letterboxd.com/WilliamOTyler/\"\u003eletterboxd\u003c/a\u003e .\u003cbr\u003e.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWQ08PDvmyqlC7kHDwCAIrQ\"\u003eyoutube\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://williamotyler.tumblr.com\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/williamotyler\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/div\u003e"

You know what I think we need to celebrate? A pizza slumber party! Reaching this goal means I\u0027ll do an exclusive live video chat every month available to all patrons so that we can Q\u0026amp;A, get to know each other and eat pizza. Monthly time and date to be determined, but if its a slumber party, it\u0027ll probably be at night and I\u0027ll probably be in my jammies surrounded by stuffed animals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, since its a video chat, and honestly I don\u0027t know what your dietary needs are, you have to bring your own pizza. Sorry!",

Reaching this monthly goal will help me keep stock of various traditional art supplies like paper stock and watercolor paint, as well as hardware, software and other tools for creating digital art. Y\u0027know, the stuff that is much more important than food to a starving artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a thank you for helping me reach this goal, I\u0027ll do a monthly art giveaway of an original 11x14 illustration based on one of that month\u0027s sketch suggestions (which can be suggested by anyone who is a Sketchy Creep or higher). The suggested subject and the traditional medium I use to create the illustration will be chosen by me and the original art will be mailed to the patron who first suggested the subject. It could be you!\u003cbr\u003e",

I\u0027ll be gobsmacked upon reaching this goal... So, thank you, thank you, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReaching a goal this high would help significantly with real life, month to month expenses. It also means more people should definitely be getting some original art! I\u0027ll up the monthly giveaway from 1 to 2 original 11x14 illustrations, each based on one of the sketch suggestions (which can be suggested by anyone who is a Sketchy Creep or higher). The suggested subject and the traditional medium I use to create the illustration will be chosen by me and the original art will be mailed to the patron who first suggested the subject.
