    "summary": "Welcome to the Patreon subscription portal for \u003cstrong\u003eWellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings\u003c/strong\u003e, your one-stop shop for satisfying all your Pok\u00e9mon Go needs around Wellington, New Zealand!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho or what is Wellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings is a group of local people who love hunting Pok\u00e9mon, and helping other local Pok\u00e9mon hunters on their journey. Donations to Wellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings go to paying for the services required to run the Wellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings scanner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are dedicated to helping the Pok\u00e9mon trainers of Wellington, whatever their needs may be: whether you\u2019re looking to \ufb01nd those elusive mons still needed to complete your Pok\u00e9dex, build a portfolio of gym-ready bruisers, take-down raid bosses, want to know about (or report \ufb01nds relating to) current nests and EX-raids, or just because all things Pok\u00e9mon-related are fun. Whatever the people of Wellington want or need to improve their Pok\u00e9mon Go experience, we\u0027ve got you covered!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do you need my money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePreviously we used Pokefetch scans paid for by donations from generous local Pok\u00e9mon Go players but the coverage was limited due to the cost. By building our own local scanner we are able to cover a much larger area without more cost and also access extras like IV scanning. The servers, hash keys, proxies, captcha solving and bandwidth required to run a scanner all cost money, and without these things there would be no scanning services to start with. This is where you, our supporters, enter the picture. However, Wellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings is strictly not-for-pro\ufb01t: all funds received are dedicated to maintaining the quality and reliability of existing services, and expanding our platform as required to meet the needs of our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does it mean to be a supporter then?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe major bene\ufb01t for being an o\ufb03cial supporter is gaining access to all regional and special (IV) channels and the live sightings and raids fed directly to them (compared to the feeds that non-donating members can access). Supporters also get better access to the power of NovaBot, our fully integrated custom-built bot - and unique in New Zealand for the services and power it provides - that personalizes your Wellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about the supporter tiers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporter tiers are designed so that you can choose how much you can, or want to, give to keep Wellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings operational and scanning for the people of Wellington and its connected communities. As a supporter, you are valued equally, regardless of your supporter tier. It remains a matter entirely for yourself as to which tier you choose. We will only ever ask for enough donations to cover the costs of the scanner. The costs may go up or down in future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a number of di\ufb00erent services that are required to support scanning operations such as those provided by Wellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings, as noted above. These many resources are required to run the scanner effectively and efficiently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019d like to contribute an amount each month to keep Wellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings operational, then we\u2019d love to have you as a supporter! Simply register with Patreon and then (\u003cstrong\u003eimportant!\u003c/strong\u003e)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266\"\u003econnect your discord account\u003c/a\u003e to your Patreon account. After that follow the prompts - you should be automatically registered as a supporter soon after, and have all the access that comes with this status. However, if it looks like it has not happened automatically then please go to our discord server and tag @Admin in a message in #feedback_suggestions and we\u2019ll get it sorted for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do I get charged?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon bills supporters on a monthly basis for their pledged amount. This will generally happen between the 1st and 5th of the month, commencing the month after you pledge. Please note that this means that supporters are getting full access in advance, but are not \u201cbilled\u201d for this until the end of the month; your payment, then, is always for the month preceding. We have set this up so that no one is ever billed without \ufb01rst having received full supporter access; it allows you the opportunity to evaluate our services, decide whether you\u2019d like to support them, and do so without obligation. We trust that when you see what we are doing for the community, and experience the great vibe of our community, you\u2019ll want to stick around :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE: Patreon is a US subscription processing company. As such, all pledge amounts are in US dollars. Please take current exchange rates into account when considering subscription costs. There are NO additional fees or deductions for you - it is a straight conversion from NZD to USD and that\u0027s it. Patreon does charge Admin and Transaction processing fees totalling\u00a010%, but these are charged to Wellington Raids \u0026amp; Sightings, not our subscribers.\u003c/strong\u003e"
