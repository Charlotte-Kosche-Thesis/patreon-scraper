In 2018, I longed to offer a more interactive and safe space to create and offer resources for your soul. The blog still exists for poetry, reflections, and some of my favorite things! With this new community space, you will receive interactive and virtual encouragement and listening tools for your whole self - breath, body, and spirit. Your on-line forum offers private space for tending your soul with less distractions (than most other social media forums or groups) AND it gives back!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis space was created thanks to YOU. Did you know? The number one request after hosting Yoga \u0026amp; Silence retreats is to find safe ways for us to continue communing together from afar. That desire led me here to create on Patreon.

Every single dollar of your support (minus the cost of this Patreon platform) - from as little as $1 per month - goes toward creating a creekside retreat space for individuals in rural Tennessee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you join us on the journey of exploring the gift of God\u0027s peace?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
