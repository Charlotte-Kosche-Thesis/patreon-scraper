    "summary": "Hello, my name is Aaron Roudabush and if you\u0027ve been a part of the 13th Age community for any length of time on social media, you\u0027ve probably seen my creations around. I am the GM of \u003ca href=\"https://forgottensagas-13thage.obsidianportal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eForgotten Sagas of the 13th Age\u003c/a\u003e  which won Obsidian Portal Campaign of the Month and finished second in the voting for Campaign of the Year. I am also the Online Play Czar for Fire Opal Media (you can see all of my many online play sessions here on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Phelanar/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e) as well as one of the writers for the \u003ca href=\"http://pelgranepress.com/site/?p=12301\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTales of the 13th Age\u003c/a\u003e organized play program. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo be completely clear, this is a personal project and is not an official Fire Opal Media product. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue creating unique and interesting content for use with the 13th Age system. I want to create one-of-a-kind NPCs for use in your campaign along with monsters, organizations, magical artifacts, places, and anything else that will enhance the experience at your game table. My initial plans are to focus on well-fleshed-out NPCs and their associated plot hooks, themed groups of monsters, and custom organizations which can be antagonists or allies in your game. Now that I\u0027ve largely gotten the hang of how the flow of creating on a monthly basis goes, additional types of projects like multi-part adventures are now among the topic choices that patrons can suggest and vote on each month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027ll be making is what I\u0027m referring to as \"\u003cem\u003ecapsule content\u003c/em\u003e\". These are self-contained 4-8 page documents that have what you need to incorporate these NPCs, monsters, places, or whatnot into your ongoing campaign. I\u0027d just use the term module, but that implies just adventures. Think of capsules as small, focused sourcebooks about a particular topic. Each month will potentially have a different focus and topic. One month might bring you a specific locale, the next might be a group of themed monsters. I want to work on a variety of projects and will use this opportunity to do so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost everything I make here at Patreon will be released for free to the community at large in some fashion or another. Nothing I write will be exclusive to any particular site, though I intend on using \u003ca href=\"http://13thAge.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e13thAge.org\u003c/a\u003e as my primary source because it is already an excellent archive of free materials for 13th Age. Patrons will get first access to the capsules as they\u0027re released, but after a period of time they will be made available to everybody. I feel the best part of being part of the 13th Age community has been how much fan-created content there has been that\u0027s been shared freely with everybody else and I want to continue that tradition with what I make here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a big part of the 13th Age community for a very long time and I really enjoy putting material out there for others to use. Your support here will help me continue to be able to do that in the best possible way. It will allow me to devote time specifically for writing and creating and, at higher levels of funding, allow me to enhance what I\u0027m doing by adding on additional content that I otherwise would find it difficult to devote time to. Already, in the year that this Patreon has existed, the average size of each project has grown from one project at 3-6 pages to two projects that usually begin at 8 pages and grow from there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me here will also give you a voice in what I create, which I enjoy just as much or more as I do creating stuff for my own use. Although the end decision on what to make each month is up to me, it\u0027s important for me to allow community input and indicate the sorts of things they want to see. Even if I don\u0027t use your exact suggestions, it lets me know what kinds of material I should think about in the future. \u003cbr\u003e"
