    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://weirlands.com/wiki/Main_Page\"\u003eThe Weirlands\u003c/a\u003e is a tabletop roleplaying system, inspired by tabletop and computer-based RPGs alike, including Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, World of Darkness, Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, The Elder Scrolls, Divinity, Diablo, Path of Exile, and even E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy (hey, no one said all inspiration had to be \u0027we want to do this\u0027).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing RPGs for almost 15 years, and in that time, I\u0027ve never found one that I believed to have a perfect system. There were good systems amongst them, but each one had noteworthy flaws and issues that I felt I could solve. The Weirlands is my attempt to address some of these. Will it ever be perfect? No. But my goal isn\u0027t perfection, it\u0027s to create something that could be considered \"good\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may notice that the page is lacking in any significant graphical assets. I am, by trade, not an artist. In fact, I\u0027m terrible at it. I\u0027d love to have something to spruce up the page a little, but alas, that isn\u0027t possible at the moment. I also believe that artists and content creators should be paid for their work. Therefore, \u003cstrong\u003epledges beyond hosting costs while I am still employed will go towards audiovisual assets first. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFurther, \u003cstrong\u003eall first-party game content will be provided for free via the wiki\u003c/strong\u003e. Patrons may see early cuts of various pieces of content, but the release version will always be available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease be aware, all content is currently in alpha form. Systems are in place, but not fully developed, so values and methods can and will change.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my hope that you\u0027ll see the potential in the Weirlands, and decide to help it along. In doing so, you can gain access to various methods of feedback, with which you can help shape the future of the game, and, should it become a fully fledged system worthy of print, perhaps even secure yourself some kind of preferred access to future nebulous merch (books? books with fancy shiny covers? signed books?!) in a few years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, thank you for taking the time, and thank you very much if you do decide to support the Weirlands. It means a great deal."
