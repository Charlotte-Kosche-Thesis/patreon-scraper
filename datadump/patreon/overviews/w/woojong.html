    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eWho am I \u0026amp; why should you support me?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\nCurrently, I am a full-time student at seminary school in\norder to enrich \u0026amp; cultivate my mind/soul/heart before I plant a\ngospel-centered church in the future! I consider myself a social media missionary\nbecause of the countless number of testimonies I have been blessed with that\nshow the power of social media to introduce the gospel into people\u2019s lives!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, let\u2019s back up a little bit. I became an official YouTuber\nand Social Media Influencer in October 2016 - I can reassure you that I am NOT\nyour average guy on YouTube. My mission statement as a YouTuber is to\npositively impact as many lives as possible before I pass away! As a public\nfigure, I use my social media to inspire change for the better, challenge\nindividuals for positive growth, and address topics that many seek advice for.\nWith that said, I\u2019m never shy about going against the popular opinion of\nsociety and standing up for God. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDid you know about 90% of Millennials use YouTube on a daily basis? That\nis why I have chosen YouTube as my platform to impact lives! There are not\nenough good role models for the younger generation to look up to and I want to\ndo something about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat is Patreon \u0026amp; Why do I use it?\u003c/h1\u003ePatreon is a website that\nallows you the opportunity to support an online content creator (Such as a\nmusician, artist, or motivational speaker) financially for each piece of work\nthey produce or in our case; monthly. This Patreon is for those who have been\nblessed by my work, believe in my mission, and want to be a part of the\nbackbone that supports the man fighting all these battles. I answered the call\nto ministry from God and been given a new life purpose of making videos that\nspread a message of higher values, morals, and ethics. I honestly want to see\nchange happen and I want to make the world a better place before it is my time\nto leave this earth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe reason I use Patreon is because I don\u0027t\ncreate viral content. I create videos people deserve and need. As a result, I\nget a low amount of views which means I do not generate enough money to fully\nsupport myself. It\u2019s not every day, an individual stumbles onto YouTube and\nactively searches \u201cSuicide Intervention\u201d or wants to click on a \u201cPrayer\u201d video\nto bless their day. I understand the game but I want to stay true as a genuine\nYouTuber that is all about blessing lives, rather than the numbers. As\nsuch, I am putting my full faith into God, and choosing to do His work on earth\n\ud83d\ude0a\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eWhy don\u0027t you just get a real job?\u003c/h1\u003eWell, to be honest with you, I wish it were that simple! Let\nme explain myself. I am a Full-Time seminary student (grad-school) taking 5\nclasses right now. But I also run an online\nministry to serve my neighbors. I\u0027ve got a servant heart for God\u0027s people and I\nam using my platform as a blessing for others. So with\nthat said, it is very difficult to juggle a part-time job along with YouTube (writing\nscripts, filming, editing, etc.) + Social Media + Essays + Readings + Projects\n+ Homework as it is. But I\u2019m getting by because I have so much passion in my\nheart for Jesus and love for His people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo what\u2019s so important about using YouTube and Social Media\nto do ministry work in lieu of a \u201cnormal\u201d job to me?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI see the potential in this technological platform that is a\nblessing and a curse. There are MANY negative influences that flood our minds\non a daily basis. How beautiful we should look, how materialism can satisfy our\nhunger in life, and even promotion of living promiscuous lives. I want to be different.\nI want to share the Gospel, teach about the Word, mentor/disciple people to be\nmore Christ-like; lift up, encourage, and love \u003cem\u003eour\u003c/em\u003e neighbor. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow do I achieve this? Well, I do this through a handful\navenues of approach. Mainly, I try to produce YouTube video content with the\nidea to serve people. I also utilize Instagram live-streams to counsel, give advice,\nand preach! Twitter/Facebook/Instagram posts to give a daily dose of positive\nvibes. And finally, there is A LOT that goes on behind the scenes. Which is\nalso the biggest contribution. So what is it? There are many private\nconversations through email/messages where God does miracles in which NO ONE\nwill ever hear about. Oftentimes, I don\u2019t even get a thank you after I help an\nindividual out with a situation or after offering my shoulder for hours at a\ntime. It\u2019s okay, it is \u003cem\u003eenough\u003c/em\u003e when I\npat myself on the back and give all glory to God.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease, please, please look at the bigger\npicture by becoming a Patreon supporter, you allow me to continue to be a\npublic speaker/ figure that will speak the Truth, set a good example, and fight\nthe good fight. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGod has blessed me with a talent of public\nspeaking and a gift of being able to impact lives through my words. THIS is my\npassion. THIS is a real job. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cAnd we know that in all things God works for\nthe good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.\u201d\n- Romans 8:28\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is my calling. This is my purpose. If you\nsaw the emails, private messages, and testimonies that I get from viewers \u2013 you\nwould understand that this is the exact line of work I ought to be in. I have\nhelped a countless number of people on a whole range of issues such as\nreconsidering committing suicide to more importantly finding God! ALL of that\nis made possible because of Jesus and my Patreon supporters! We are doing this\ntogether. Don\u2019t forget that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t have money to support?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\nNo worries. I understand \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t\nwant to be a financial burden upon you. However, if you still want to support\nme, then your prayers would go a long way for me. Also, please share my videos\nwith your loved ones, on your facebook, twitter, church small group, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy Prayer Request? That my heart would stay\nhumble and that I do not grow weary from living a life helping others - often,\nit is absolutely draining to be there for people. So more strength would be a\nhuge blessing for me. It\u0027s an everyday battle for me as an introvert; the\ndesire to hide in my room, but I know God has bigger plans for me to serve His\npeople.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\nI appreciate you for being alive. God bless you\n:D\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd for the record \u2013 there will be the invaluable reward\nof using Patreon as an online journal. I will be sharing personal updates and\nlife experiences on here. Essentially, you\u2019ll be a part of my inner circle of\ntrust ^^\u003cbr\u003e\n-Woojong\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
