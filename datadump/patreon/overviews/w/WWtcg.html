    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the official Patreon of the Wizards and Warzones TCG! This page will be mainly used for donations to help fund the game so we can finish it just a little faster. You see the creator only works a barely above minimum wage job but their nearly done graduating college with a degree in Graphic Design. They\u0027ve been working tirelessly on it since 2017, and have brought it to a convention, play tested it vigorously, and keep bringing it to conventions and game shops to introduce more and more players to the game, while the game is essentially in beta. The creator has a small team of 3 artists that are being commissioned to do the artwork for each and every card (So far there\u0027s over 100 different cards) and they are being paid by the creator of the game when funds are available, which is where you the patron come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what the creator is thinking he could do is offer previews of artwork being worked on for new cards, as well as sneak peaks on some cards that will be released in the new sets. And the discord server is for those who would like to give feedback on rulings, new cards, and talk about their favorites or new races they\u0027d love to see in the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all that being said, thank you for taking the time to read this, we hope to hear from you soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
