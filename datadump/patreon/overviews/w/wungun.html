    "summary": "Hi my name is Alvin Snerling a.k.a Wungun, and I\nam an animator and comic book artist. I have been using Iclone for about a\n2years and a few months now. I also use Motionbuilder,3d max and sometime\nBlender to make animations, renders and effects. I refer to myself as a Virtual Cinema \u00a0artist than an Machinema artist . I am working on my next project it is going\nto be a bout a female space pirate hunting for treasure. Just be on the lookout\nfor it when it drops!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe reason I came to Patreon is\nbecause I like sharing what I do with others. I want to keep doing this and that\u2019s\nwhy I am reaching out to all my subscribers and fans. It takes a lot of time to\nand equipment to bring my ideas and knowledge to you. With your support through\nPatreon I can get what I need and devote more of my time to bring you more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat is Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is the best way for\ncreators to earn ongoing revenue directly from their fans.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a way to join your\nfavorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love.\nInstead of literally throwing money at your screen (trust us, that doesn\u2019t\nwork), you can now pay a few bucks per month or per post that a creator\nmakes.  For example, if you pay $2 per\nvideo, and the creator releases 3 videos in February, then your card gets charged\na total of $6 that month.  This means the\ncreator gets paid regularly (every time she releases something new), and you\nbecome a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts.  That\u2019s right--Imagine you, in a long frilly\nwhite wig, painted on a 10-foot canvas on the wall of a Victorian mansion.  And imagine your favorite creators making a\nliving doing what they do best\u2026 because of you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCurrently I am working on getting\nmy animated project-Archive of Infinity finished. It is a project that won Best\nCharacter animation in the Reallusion Game character animation contest. The 10\nminute short was popular that I had to make the decision to make a series out\nof it. With your Patronage I can achieve that goal with you. That\u2019s right you\nmy supporters can make this dream a reality.  Also I can make bigger and better award levels\nand giveaways along the way. So what are you waiting for ! Become My\nPATREON!!!!!!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWeb site\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://wungun74.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttp://wungun74.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzS0GQMkVR6qpfKduwrHftA\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzS0GQMkVR6qpfKduwrHftA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/ICMMG/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/ICMMG/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
