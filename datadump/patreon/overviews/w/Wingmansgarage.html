    "summary": "Welcome to Wingman\u0027s Garage, a Nashville, Tennessee-based podcast, hosted by Chris \u003cem\u003e\"The Wingman\"\u003c/em\u003e, Daniel \"The Track Rat\u003cem\u003e\"\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand Will \"The Wrench\", and home of the craziest motorcycle fanatics you\u0027ve probably never heard of. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, who are we? We are normal dudes that all share a common interest in motorcycles and all things related to our two-wheeled passion. Chris and Will both actively work in the motorcycle industry, holding positions in the ever-glamorous role of parts department counter jockey and Privateer Technician, while Daniel is a frequent flyer in the track day and road racing world, who has worked as a corner marshal through the heyday of AMA\u0027s superbike era.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin us on our weekly adventures as we share our rides through country roads, city streets and the daily commute to share riding tips or maintenance tricks, and discuss new gear, trends, and of course, motorcycles. And you can bet there\u0027ll be some rehashing of some great stories from the pits and paddocks of race tracks around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love motorcycles, old, new or anything in between, jump in and give it a listen! In fact, we dare you to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut, this is where you play a part in the story:\u003c/strong\u003e You see, it goes without saying that we aren\u0027t too proud to beg, so here we are doing just that: Begging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen, what we do is funded purely by the change in our pockets, and more often than not, the lint too. With your help, we can be everything you ever could hope for: true, honest motorcycle and gear reviews, more shenanigans on and off of the track, and even more adventures to hear AND see!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right, true believers, we want to expand our repertoire out of just podcasting to visual media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut... and there\u0027s always a but... We need your support to make this all happen. We aren\u0027t asking for your firstborn child, or for Daddy Warbucks to show up with a blank check, but anything and everything helps. From simple things, like the provision of liquid propulsion for the show, to upgrading our low-tech recording solutions, your kind gestures will only improve what we can provide you. After all, the whole reason we do this is for our listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. Are you feeling generous yet? If so, click on and become privy to patron-only content that ranges from the malarchy that occurs before the show starts to behind the scenes looks at upcoming projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe truly thank you from the depths of our hearts for supporting Wingman\u0027s Garage!"
