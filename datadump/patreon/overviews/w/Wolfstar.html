If you\u0027re having little to no sexual encounters, it will come with a hefty cost, as the Tax Man has imposed sexual quotas to all citizens living in his city.  Players can of course make up the difference by paying cash to the Tax Man, but that means spending more time at work as a stripper to pay off those debts\u2013and a stripper\u0027s job is not without its share of dangerous encounters!\u00a0 Choose wisely who you want to spend your afterlife with, as there are no second chances just like real life on any given day.   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTM1NDMxLzkxMzQ1MS5wbmc=/original/tT2kG6.png\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTM1NDMxLzEwMjI4MDMucG5n/original/cE5ibO.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduction Cycle and Budget\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon page\u2019s success will determine the majority of the money to fund the project.

There are plenty of stories touching on the afterlife similar to this one, but they do not explore in depth the sexual frustrations nor truly seem to grasp what is actually going on in the mind of \u201can everyday gay man\u201d.  Instead most stories are just about the \u201cstereotype\u201d gay man who is over the top, over dramatized, and extreme in their flaming homosexuality (not that THAT is a bad thing, but IT HAS BEEN DONE and there are other gay types and points of view that are never explored).

Failing his life\u2019s mission to finally destroy the demon Dagio Seiga, he has fallen in spirit.  He is a quick study, a sharpshooter, loves detective novels, and embraces all the qualities of a knight.  His alien dna even in the afterlife has a major flaw with the popular sports drink known as BFP which has a nasty habit of reducing intelligence proportionately with increasing muscular physique, essentially leaves wolfkin like Wolfstar and Hyper as big dumb horny brutes with a serious lack of inhibition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHyper  \u003cbr\u003eLike Wolfstar, Hyper is an alien and true friend who also took a major hit to the pride belt with the recent loss.  Though he\u2019s typically energetic and carefree, this is merely a facade that hides the true painful past that lurks within.  As a berserker, Hyper is an extremely destructive force of nature.  He specializes in swordsmanship and taunting.   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Tax Man\u003cbr\u003eA powerful and mysterious figure head of the city of Paradise.  He comes to tally the sexual acts and collect money from all the people living in the city once a  month.\u00a0 He\u0027s responsible for determining rates, and suddenly after twenty years of stable living, he hikes up the price with each passing month...and those who cannot afford to pay or reach their ever increasing sexual/ monetary quotas have their souls taken away.  The Tax Man is an ever loaming danger, always watching from the shadows, a lecherous dread horror whose sense of justice is herald by the virtues of greed and lust.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ve enjoyed reading this treatment document, and want to get involved in this visual novel.\u00a0 You can help me out greatly by spreading the word that this game even exists, bookmarking and visiting the site, following the game\u0027s updates, sharing links when I post them, and especially help me out by becoming a supporter here. I can\u0027t thank you enough for supporting me, that kind of help motivates me and adds much needed fuel to keep me going strong.\u00a0 Thank you thank you thank you! \u003cbr\u003e"
