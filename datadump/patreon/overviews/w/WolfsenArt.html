    "summary": "My absolute favorite student is one who says, \"I can\u0027t draw at all, good luck with me!\" because I guide them through making an artwork and watch a light turn on inside. I then get to hear them say, \"it looks like I can make art!...what else can I do that I thought I couldn\u0027t?\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI remember being a student and having no idea where to start and what to do. I love art and knew I wanted to be an artist, but my teachers had a sink or swim approach that was along the lines of, \"figure it out and it better be great\". After 20 years of \"figuring it out\" I\u0027m excited to show and explain everything I wish someone had taught me. My drawing, painting, and sculpture lessons teach color, value, and composition, while you create stunning work. I invite you to create new things and share them with your friends, children, or students. I promise you art is something anyone can do! Please join me and find out for yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"At the age of fourteen, I wanted to leave home and become something amazing. While visiting a friend in San Diego, I learned about the Coronado School of the Arts. When I saw the art department, my jaw dropped at the sight of so much beauty, \u201cNow this is impressive!\" I drew and painted furiously to prepare a portfolio in time. The teacher said, \u201cYou\u0027re really not very good...but the program is new and not very many people applied\". I was in! For an entire year, I was the worst in every class, but I kept drawing and painting. Slowly my skills improved and self-esteem grew. I graduated from that high school and went on to study art in college, where I was suddenly one of the best in every class. I marvel at the work I am now able to produce and how it has given me the freedom and confidence I so desperately craved at the age of fourteen. Now I teach people of all ages to create their own impressive art. It gives me endless joy to reveal that truly anyone can be an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eErica Wolfsen is a working, professional painter who is passionate about teaching others how to create stunning artworks. Erica has served as Art Director at The Huntington Beach Hebrew Academy for the past 10 years and has taught all ages in San Diego, Orange, and LA counties. Originally from San Diego, she graduated with honors from both the Coronado School of the Arts and the University of California San Diego.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"
