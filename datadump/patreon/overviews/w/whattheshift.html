Is it any wonder to you that the intro video was posted 5 years ago?\u003cbr\u003eYes, the evolution of humanity, in general, has been growing and changing since the dawn of time, and yet these last few years have been particularly shifty.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor consciousness.\u003cbr\u003eWhat is consciousness you may wonder?\u003cbr\u003eBefore you go and google anything.\u003cbr\u003eHere is Wikipedia\u0027s answer:\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cstrong\u003eConsciousness\u003c/strong\u003e is the state or quality\u00a0of awareness, or, of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. It has been defined variously in terms of sentience, awareness, subjectivity, the ability to experience or to feel,\u00a0wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood or soul, the fact that there is something \"that it is like\" to \"have\" or \"be\" it, and the executive control system of the mind.\"\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you want to define it as or call it, it\u0027s shifting fast. In everyone alive today.\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re aware of this phenomena or not right now isn\u0027t important because you will be soon.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll bet you\u0027ve seen this around---\u0026gt; #woke\u003cbr\u003ethat\u0027s what they\u0027re talking about.\u003cbr\u003eSo who cares?\u003cbr\u003eExactly! everyone who is #woke does.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the point.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo if you don\u0027t care yet, you will.\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who is in tune with this frequency, at some point, has agreed to this unspoken bond.\u003cbr\u003eOne that is of service to all other beings, to get to a higher \"vibration\".\u003cbr\u003eSo we may unify our differences, come together as a human family, and make this life more livable for everyone, every day.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s pretty simple, right?\u003cbr\u003eSo how can I help your shift? How can you help mine?\u003cbr\u003eWell, we are mirrors for each other. The key here is information+experiential wisdom.\u003cbr\u003eOnly then with both of these keys can we unlock the secrets to our human potential.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s just say the lessons of experiential wisdom are already in place and on their way for everyone. At different times in very different ways. You could think of this as Karma and Dharma.\u003cbr\u003eWe are all on our paths and they are set. So in this way, everyone alive will receive this wisdom, but not all at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo where do we come in?\u003cbr\u003eHow does this Patreon account help?\u003cbr\u003eThis part is about the purity of information.\u003cbr\u003eIf we get this pure information (inspiration) out to anyone who can understand it due to their \"experiential wisdom\" or even partial wisdom, then it can make an impact on their lives. In a way that they will want to continue the cycle. We cultivate this inspiration and circulate it around for everyone to hear, see, feel, taste, and touch!\u003cbr\u003eReady?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/51bxco.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo Inspire With Truth and Love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI personally feel that the power of the internet is an unstoppable force! \u003cbr\u003eHaving a constant information feed to inspire, play, activate, levitate, facilitate all forms of goodness with access to unlimited data, right at our fingertips, now that\u0027s a holy shift.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u0026amp; you\u0027ll have the ability to tune in and out when needed.\u003cbr\u003eI will be sharing this inspiration in various forms:\u003cbr\u003eAwakening Stories, Memes, Videos, Spiritual Teachings \u0026amp; More\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e{[Please Note !

Having Compostable packaging and Ready-To-Plant seeds right there in it! So when a customer is done they can plant the packaging instead of recycling plastic or sending it to a landfill! (note all seeds will be native to the state/area that friends of Bambi Records will be touring in! As to be conducive and helpful to the natural and native occurring habitats!)
