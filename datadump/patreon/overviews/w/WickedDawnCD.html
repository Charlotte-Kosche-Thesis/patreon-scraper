My name is Michael! some know me as The Wayward Moogle and others still as just Wicked Dawn. Whatever you might come to call me I hope that you all can come to know my artwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a 28 year old student who is working\u00a0 to make his own web comic or graphic novel. In the meantime I find myself working on lots of little projects and artistic ideas. I\u0027m hoping to build a fan base as well as get more exposure in the art community by making friends and customers by providing this page with new art frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith patreon\u0027s support I plan to expand my portfolio and eventually work up to serializing a web-comic right here for my future pledges. in the meantime the creations gallery will be full of character design sketches, NSFW pin-ups, and other miscellaneous doodles and sketches. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to ultimately share this crazy story with the world and to one day meet at conventions and other events promoting \"Oasis\" and making it a phenomenon. This all begins with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pitch\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSet on a desert planet turned prison wasteland. The story follows a young boy named Wander who follows one of the strongest inmates he has ever seen named Cage-0. The two unwittingly find themselves searching for the fabled \u201coasis\" a place or object of immense power that could change the fate of their world, all the while fighting off a plethora of bad guys, bandits, and the worst their galaxy has to offer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDetails\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWander and Cage\u2019s world is known as \u201cDest\u2019Ogra\" and has been used by the galactic federation as a prison planet for the worst of the worst. Those criminals who are caught are thrown onto the planet and left to die on the surface (think space-Australia). This has been going on for a long time and in the ruins and broken settlements of old gangs and ruthless world conquering triads a native civilization has flourished. Wander was born here and although he has no galactic bounty he is treated as a inmate nonetheless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA main interest of most criminals is a \u201cleaderboard\" that the galactic federation provides the inmates to track the rising bounties due to actions inside and outside of dest\u2019ogra. Most inmates carry an arm mounted display to keep track of their place on the board as well as who they have to kill to rise. Your place on the board is the only thing that matters in the prison hierarchy and the wardens like it that way as it keeps the population in check, the stronger you are, the bigger the target on your back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe secondary interest are artifacts known as \u201ckadar\" special devices that grant immense power and utility. Kadar hunters often scour every inch of the unforgiving desert in search of even one Kadar to tip the scales of power in their favor. Most main characters are in possession of a unique kadar that sets them apart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInfluences\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOasis is a love letter to shounen battle manga and properties like Mad Max and Trigun. Its meant to follow the cliche monster of the week format as wander and cage face down another gang or big bad that stands between them and their fabled prize every chapter or so. \u003cbr\u003e"
