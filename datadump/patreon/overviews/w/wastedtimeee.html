    "summary": "Hey guys, they call me \u003cstrong\u003eWasted Time\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m a furry smut artist who moonlights as a part-time middle of the road writer. \u00a0Although at the point most of you coming here probably know me from writing the story \u003cstrong\u003e\"The Rehabilitation of Dawn Bellwether\"\u003c/strong\u003e which a great deal of you seemed to really like. After much delay and deliberation I have finally decided to launch a Patreon page. Now, the big question is well...why? Welp, to be quite honest it would make it a heck of a lot easier to keep up with regular content without having to worry as much about bills and survival.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s where you come in. With your support it will make things easier for me to survive, ergo more time to create and more content for you! Now, the main reason I had been avoiding this for so long was due to what I could offer for rewards. The main problem is two fold...I don\u0027t want to paywall content and even if I did there is no way to prevent it from leaking. So until I figure out some incentives for you guys this is primarily a tip jar of sorts. If you like what I write and what I draw and want to see more then consider donating like...a dollar or something. Every little bit makes it easier for me to create and share what you love. In the meantime I\u0027ll get to thinking of some type of rewards to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-WT"
