So that\u0027s convenient.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you somehow managed to stumble upon this page at random...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.writeups.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWriteups.org\u003c/a\u003e is a large site with a lof of character profiles from comic books, video games, novels, movies, etc. (5,494 profiles as of this writing).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means illustrations, biography, characterization, quotes, RPG stats, capabilities analysis, discussion of those aspects of the setting related to the character, etc. Yes, it\u0027s for geeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs to me personally, I\u0027m S\u00e9bastien. I write a lot of the profiles on writeups.org, and do an awful lot of webmastering and editing work. I\u0027m 43, I currently live in France, I\u0027m a MIT graduate and I\u0027m almost nicer than I look.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eState of the project\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriteups.org has been going on in one form or another for 18-ish years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May, 2016 we made a big jump to a much better, much more modern web site. Which is awesome, but took 20+ months filled with soul-destroying grind. And while it *is* delivered, there\u0027s an enormous amount of work left to bring everything up to speed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat this Patreon pays for\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur income sources are used like this :\u003cbr\u003e- Our AdSense adverts pay for the hosting itself (at leats for now, because adblockers)\u003cbr\u003e- Our PayPal donations are used to build a war chest to pay contractors when upgrading the site\u003cbr\u003e- Our Amazon recommendations reimburse the years of hosting and development costs accrued before we had adverts and donations\u003cbr\u003e- This here Patreon is meant as a symbolic pay for the time spent managing and editing the site. Both the ongoing work, the aforementioned 20+ months marathon, and all the years before that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much work goes into running the site\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn recent years, my own work on writeups.org (writing, images processing, webmastering, editing, outreach, etc.) has been about 80 hours/week for 50-ish weeks a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is chiefly because of chronic pain and exhaustion issues that mean that conventional work is no longer an option for me. I have to stay home. Writeups.org is something that allows me to focus past these hindrances and endure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m significantly slowed down by these health problems, so I guess the actual output is the equivalent of a 30 or 40 hours week.\u003cbr\u003e"
