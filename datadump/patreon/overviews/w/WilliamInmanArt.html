    "summary": "In the days of antiquity and Renaissance there were the Patrons of the Arts. Artist\u0027s would be funded by one or two wealthy Patrons and the results are the classics we know and appreciate today. We are now living in the age of Social Media. Instead of one or two patrons/matrons Artists now have the power of a connected community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be like the Artists of old. \u003cbr\u003eI want to be Michaelangelo and paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. I want to be Davinci and invent. I want to be Dali, astounding! And like Bob Ross, to teach, sooth and help others find their gifts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI not only want to encourage people to contact me about doing personal pieces but also businesses and investors \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBusinesses if you want me to come do portraiture become a Patron or Matron. Or if you see any of my Art you\u0027d like in your place of business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInvestors contact me about my ideas. Big ideas to aid humanity. Inventions. Product design. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got an ability I want to use. \u003cbr\u003eI wanna shine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a power in my Art that I feel when I\u0027m working. It\u0027s like a channel of energy I tap into. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to change my life and show my Art to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want everyone to have my Art, I\u0027d just give it away if I could. \u003cbr\u003eHow many days will I live? Isn\u0027t everyone of you worth at least one of my days?\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eWho am I? \u003cbr\u003eWilliam Inman;Artist\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my dream to be a Full-Time Artist. My goal is to be famous and a fully fan supported Artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is my motivation?\u003cbr\u003ePursing Art is a lifelong passion of mine. It\u0027s not about money or fame or glory, its the connections I make with people that fuels the artistic engine within. I tell people that I paint things that people love. I believe that having a personal piece of Artwork made is a wonderful experience, whether its a portrait of yourself or of your ride or your cherished pet. I want to give that to you. Everyone deserves the time a day, everyone\u0027s idea is valid. If this campaign is successful I will be able to make art at a much faster rate and for more people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider supporting me and if not me then an Artist close to you.\u003cbr\u003eThank-you to all my Fans and Supporters. Thanks for believing in me"
