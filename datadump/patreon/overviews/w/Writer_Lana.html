My time is limited, and all too often, I\u0027m choosing jobs that pay the bills over jobs that will fulfill me (and you) creatively while also ensuring I can do things like eat and pay my rent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working \u003cstrong\u003e80 - 120 hours a week\u003c/strong\u003e, and a horrifyingly small fraction of that is spent writing stories that \u003cem\u003eI \u003c/em\u003ewill actually get to publish and \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003ewill actually get to read\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I think it\u0027s time we changed that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s your chance to make me a full-time writer \u003cem\u003efor you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/531c0371e4b03e512acae5a6/t/5994ff71893fc0d570a3fe09/1502936954651/?format=750w\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause Amazon keeps moving the goalposts as to what they pay authors. It\u0027s been dropping like a stone for about two years now, with the most egregious losses occurring in the last three months. As such, I\u0027ve had to focus on writing for others and taking on editing clients\u2014but that kind of work is unstable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no way of knowing what I\u0027ll make per month. I can, of course, make educated guesses, but a lot rides on me being right or wrong. Will we make rent on time? Will I be able to afford new clothes for my growing daughter? Will I be able to pay a cover artists for my newest release, or put any money at all into advertising it? Can we afford groceries?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the scramble to answer these questions as reliably as possible, I\u0027ve had to sacrifice publishing \u003cem\u003emy \u003c/em\u003ebooks and giving \u003cem\u003emy \u003c/em\u003efans what you want and deserve. This resulted in last year\u0027s lack of \u003cem\u003eany \u003c/em\u003enew releases for myself, and has contributed to a delay in new releases this year that can only be mitigated by steady income through patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only that, but working for others has become essentially all I do, and that\u0027s not conducive to my ability to provide you with quality material. Living in a constant state of anxiety keeps me from focusing on what\u0027s important, as well as accepting opportunities like book signings and collaborations with other authors. In the interest of providing you with the best reading experience possible, I have to be able to funnel my skills into this endeavor, and that means having the ability to say \"no\" to projects and jobs that won\u0027t help me achieve that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/531c0371e4b03e512acae5a6/t/5994ff87b8a79b7502c45b27/1502936978044/?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour investment in me will allow me to invest in you.
