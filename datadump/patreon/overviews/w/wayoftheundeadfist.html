I\u0027ll post more about that soon. =)\u00a0 However style change will only get me so far and there are lots of smaller goals between now and then.\u00a0 When I reach a goal, I will try to come up with a fun reward for all the current Patreons who got me there.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to check out my Patreon page.\u00a0 Regardless on whether you decide to become a Patreon supporter or not, I hope you continue to check out and read \u003ca href=\"http://www.wayoftheundeadfist.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWay of the Undead Fist\u003c/a\u003e and enjoy it and all of the Chop Socky fun.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
