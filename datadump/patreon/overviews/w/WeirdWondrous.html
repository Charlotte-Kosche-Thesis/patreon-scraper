    "summary": "Creating things of beauty is my great passion in life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eActually, as far as I remember I\u0027ve been better at handling tools than people. \u003cbr\u003eAlways finding solace and comfort in what my hands could make. Started making silver wire work at five, sold my first necklace at twelve, -the same year I made my first medieval dress. \u003cbr\u003eMother wasn\u0027t home. Mother had sheets. Mother came home. Daughter had \u003cdel\u003ecamping tent\u003c/del\u003e medieval dress. It still fits me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreation always been my life. My mother always encouraged me to use proper materials and dare to experiment. I mostly take pleasure in learning from books and so far it seems to go quite well. Pretty much all of my glasswork learning comes from books and internet. A class costed more than the basic tools and a book. So I got the latter instead of a weekend in a classroom. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA friend of mine claim me to be autodidact. I beg to differ since I use books. Basically I see the writer as my teacher. My friend just shakes his head at me. Quite often. And told me to get my arse on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd why shouldn\u0027t I? Crafts is the one thing in life I\u0027m really good at.\u003cbr\u003eIn crafting, I am fearless! I can\u0027t help myself but keep experimenting in new materials. I combine all kind of techniques; metalwork, glasscrafts, amber carving, textile work, scrapbooking and resin casting to bring my ideas to life. It\u0027s an endless process of curiosity combined with trial-and-error!\u003cbr\u003eSome days I combine 2.500 year old technique with pure gold leaf with stickers from the local toy store. Dare to shine! Dare to dare!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not only want a crafted piece to be an item but part of a statement, expression, memory or identity. A piece with a thought. Something to treasure and to bring joy and a lot more than what just meets the eye. I live by the craft. no matter where I go I see material or connections or inspiration. It doesn\u0027t matter what I do, it\u0027s like a constant background noise of \"Make this! Combine these!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen struck by inspiration there is no stopping me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mean, I\u0027m a mad, secluded introvert exhibitionist who tried pretty much every craft in the book at some point. I worked in fabric shops, yarn shops embroidery shops, sang in the street, knitted on the train, crocheted in the rain, played the fiddle, played the lyre, beat the drum, danced in the forge, made glass melt, learned to juggle, done silversmithing on the subway (boy was that impopular!), baked penny cookies, reveled in beadwork, played with fire, sculpted masks, sewn wedding gowns, cast molten gold, hunted tourists with crossbows, fenced with rapiers, carved drinking horns, battled with swords, attended archery contests, caught jellyfish, photographed in snow storms, read tarot cards and somewhere in the middle of all of this I\u0027m also a trained FX make-up artist who love whisky and have a part-time job at one of the largest theaters in Sweden as a techie. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI forgot what it\u0027s like to be bored. \u003cbr\u003eIf I want something I make it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in Sweden and is one of those struggling crafters stupid enough trying to make a living from their passion. It pretty much starves me but I just can\u0027t stop. also 25% VAT. Holy fu.. Yeah. That part-time job is a relief even though it drains me from all energy. There is inspiration in overload, but time and energy..?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to help me, I would be ever grateful for you to be a part of my journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking an interest in my Crafts\u003cbr\u003e/Sarah Burchill - Artisan of the Weird and Wondrous\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
