Along the way my supporters will receive extra perks only exclusive to them from this site. Supporters will see growth on my website and blog and help me meet monthly costs of keeping these systems running. At present (to host all the free material) I am currently paying for multiple subscriptions that I could use help meeting the costs of. All additional funds can be used in the future towards new feature film/short video projects, extending the archives on my website and new writing projects.\u0027 Thank you for all your help, much love \u0026lt;3 Wade\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver View\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnown originally under his stage name Wade Radford. Wade was an LGBT film maker and actor whose credits included Sex Lies \u0026amp; Depravity, More Sex Lies and Depravity, Twink \u0026amp; 1 Last Chance at Paradise.\u003cbr\u003eAs an exploitation Guerilla film maker he also starred in Boys Behind Bars 1-3 and his contributions to low budget horror include \u0027Fluid Boy\u0027 \u0026amp; \u0027Necrophiliac: The Lustful Dead\u0027.\u003cbr\u003eBetween 2012-2016 Wade worked on these titles alongside filmmaker Jason Impey. He regularly also co-starred with dear friend and Punk Icon Honey Bane in titles such as the Boys Behind Bars films and 1 last chance at paradise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing both titles Wade Radford \u0026amp; Jay Proctor, he has also released a series of books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Film Years 2012-2016 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the film years Radford \u0026amp; Impey had become known for their low budget Guerilla films; and controversy never followed far behind them.\u003cbr\u003eFrom starting out as the gay, street hustler Ethan in Sex Lies \u0026amp; Depravity, Wade went onto portray a variety of roles without fear. From the deranged Prison top dog Darrell in the Boys Behind Bars films, to a washed up former porn star in \u0027Twink\u0027. \u003cbr\u003eIf that wasn\u0027t enough he tried his hand at the loving Kai in \u00271 Last Chance At Paradise\u0027. A top selling post apocalyptic art house film  released in 2014.\u003cbr\u003eHis contributions to roles in Snuff and Horror films include- Maximilian in \u0027Fluid Boy\u0027 (2015); and then for his final performance, he played the bisexual, psychotic Necrophiliac (Hayden Reef) in \u0027Necrophiliac- The Lustful Dead\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring his active years as Wade he achieved high grossing gay films on minimal budgets; and a best actor nomination for \u0027Twink\u0027.

The year out took Wade on a journey of self discovery, and presented him with fresh challenges that were far removed from his life as a film maker.\u003cbr\u003eUpon returning in November 2016 Wade released a brutally candid collection of private poetry and prose titled \u0027The Ideation of Six Feet Under\u0027. Around the same time as the release, he also announced a special re-issue of \u0027Master Crotch \u0026amp; The Sex Hungry Human Minions- The Poetry and Prose Collection 2010-2014\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2017 saw Jay embrace the boy behind the persona, the memories of a heart breaking summer in Bexley, a battle with mental health and a person he\u0027d left behind a decade ago. On June the 19th 2017 Jay released his first entry into the non-fiction genre;\u003cbr\u003e\u0027A Vision of Life\u0027 on Paperback \u0026amp; Kindle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn November 25th 2017 he released his third poetry anthology \u0027Seeing Red\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2018 promises Jay\u0027s come back to film with his directional debut \u0027Caught in a Landslide\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
