    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Damon Davis and I had the incredibly good fortune to be reunited with my biological mother after 36 years in adoption. Every where I go I tell my story and hear the stories of other adoptees who are searching for their biological relatives or have connected with someone in their family of origin. Their journeys are such emotional roller coasters of ups and downs, jarring twists, and unexpected turns.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this podcast is intended to do two things:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst to my fellow adoptees my hope is that the stories told here will help you explore your own feelings about adoption, accept your desire to try to understand your own personal history, and decide for yourself whether a search to connect with biological relatives is right for you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor those who are not adoptees, this podcast will help you understand \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e of what is in the minds of your friends, family members, or others who are adopted, but you didn\u2019t know if you should ask some of the questions that will be answered here.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSo, I hope you\u0027ll help me bring these stories to life with a little support. I love hearing and telling these stories and I hope you\u0027ll help me to continue to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDamon Davis\u003cbr\u003e\"Who Am I Really?\" Podcast"
