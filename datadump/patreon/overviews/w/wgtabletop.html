However, keeping up with new releases to review, and trying to upgrade recording equipment for what is still essentially just a hobby can get really expensive. I love doing my videos, and I\u0027d do them for free as long as people keep watching. However, after being approached multiple times from fans wanting to assist with donations and denying them out of pride and my feelings on that, I felt it was time to try this out. The only paid content will be my Previews, Reviews and major shows, but smaller announcement videos will be posted as Free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content will always be free, but I appreciate any support, monetary or otherwise, that I receive from people who watch my content. These funds will help pay (or supplement) better equipment to increase the production values of the reviews, newer releases to review, as well as helping me get to some big game conventions like GenCon or BGG.con.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for taking the time to check out my Patreon, and double thanks for supporting me!\u003cbr\u003e"

You have seen the beginning of this with series like Big Game Hunter, and I want to continue to do more series like this. However, time and funding are the main limitations. However, I figure if we can hit a goal like this, I could start putting the pedal to the metal and crank out one of the series I have planned! I already have one new series in production, but hitting this goal would allow me to put something like Table Ready, a show where I take a miniature game from unpainted to game worthy, into production.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter that, if we somehow make another 50, I would start moving other new series into production that are on the backburner at the moment.
