F-List is the perfect place to find a partner for almost any kink combination, as tens of thousands of people visit it daily from all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor ears I\u0027ve been playing there, and one thing kept bugging me - lack of any systems suitable for fight RPs, other then basic dice roll function. So, three years ago I went ahead and created Rendezvous Fighting system, which eventually turned out into a bot with it\u0027s own room, where fights are held.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve learned from my mistakes on that system, and now creating a better bot with a more interesting and flexible fight mechanics, as well as stat system. I\u0027m trying to make it both simple and flexible, to allow people to both have fair fights, or set up fights with pre-determined ends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, fight results and progress are recorded in a database, which allows to create cool roster and leader boards, and later even setup events and monthly challenges!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent working features of UFL system:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eF-List chatbot, through which all interactions with the system are performed\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRock Paper Scissors on steroids battle system with stats\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMatchmaking based on power points\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnonymity.

Website also requires domain. Unfortunately there are no free VPS or domains. Even if there are, most likely are unstable or won\u0027t fit the system, with no guarantees of privacy of stored information and no guarantees that some day they won\u0027t just shut everything down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have to pay monthly for those things. I found the cheapest VPS I could, and cheap-ish domain name. But eventually the system will need more, if it grows, to support more features and people. For that VPS will need more CPU power, RAM and Disk space, and that costs money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, supporting and developing this system takes a lot of time. And with support I\u0027d be able to spend more of my time developing this system. As well as other related projects, which I will talk about later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect bags of money here, but, if you like the system, idea, feel free to support me, any help will be much appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003ePlanned features and things I\u0027m thinking about\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMultiple images in fighter profile cards\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite improvements\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBattle system improvements\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore commands for the bot\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImage upload\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProfile editing through the website (still have to figure out how to authenticate this)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTighter integration with f-list\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTracking more details about fights for better leaderboards and roaster\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinisher gallery.
