    "summary": "I\u0027ve been making knives for close to two decades now and I enjoy communicating about the challenge and excitement of this craft. \u00a0In all my videos I try to make sure that you get high quality audio and lots of clear close-up shots of what I do. \u00a0Video instructionals that don\u0027t show you anything are pointless. But to make good videos requires enormous amounts of time, high quality cameras and lenses, microphones, lights, and\u00a0expensive editing software.\u00a0 And also a lot of time. \u00a0Did I mention that before? \u00a0A LOT of time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe time I spend\u00a0in front of the camera\u00a0making a knife is just the tip of the iceberg. \u00a0There\u0027s writing the script, recording the voice-over audio, editing, choosing music, mixing, answering (at least some) of the literally hundreds of emails and comments that I get every week about my videos. \u00a0That\u0027s all time I\u0027m taking away from the work that puts food on my family\u0027s table. \u00a0So the more you can support me, the more videos I can make, the higher quality equipment I can use...and most of all, the more time I can take to make sure you get as much information and enjoyment from each video as possible. \u00a0I hope you\u0027ll help me in this journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got several subscription levels, and each one comes with a cool reward -- stuff that can really help you learn more about knives and knifemaking. \u00a0And each reward level includes all the swag you\u0027d get with the lower pledge levels. \u00a0I\u0027m not suggesting you become a patron of the channel just for the swag. \u00a0Do it because you believe in what we\u0027re doing here. \u00a0But, hey, swag\u0027s good, too."
