    "summary": "Hi Wild Ones, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Throughout our adventure as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wearewildness.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWe Are Wildness\u003c/a\u003e we have gotten to know a number of you as community members, strong supporters and even friends. It\u0027s been an awesome journey so far. In 2018 we\u0027re looking to evolve We Are Wildness in new ways, create new things, and step it up a few notches for fellow nature lovers around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like to know how you\u0027re feeling about the communities and projects we create. We listen to your suggestions and requests, which we learn from, appreciate and take to heart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why we\u0027re creating the We Are Wildness Podcast!!! Time and time again we\u0027ve asked our community members what you\u0027d like to see from us (Thanks if you answered our numerous polls and questions on Facebook BTW!). A Podcast has always come up. We love podcasts and listen to them ourselves, but got admittedly anxious thinking about putting ourselves out there in that way, and committing to such a big project. We\u0027re perfectionists and want to do it right! Our community deserves nothing less than the best we can create with the resources we have. Well...on one cold Winter walk in the forest we started talking about just how awesome creating a podcast would be. Our anxiousness had disappeared and was replaced with excitement. Let\u0027s do this!\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://wearewildness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lui-peng-339918-unsplash1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePODCAST FORMAT PLAN:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe want to create a very dynamic and engaging podcast with a variety of segments to keep it fun. Kind of like a variety show... It wont be a straight up 30 minute to 1 hour long interview (Though we will be interviewing many awesome guests). Our patrons will have access to full interview recordings but we plan on using bits and pieces of guest interviews to weave together an engaging story around a specific episode topic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther segment ideas we\u0027d like to include in addition to special guest interviews are:\u003cbr\u003e wildlife/nature facts, \"identify that bird call\", book/film reviews, tips for rewilding your life, giveaways and contests, Q\u0026amp;A, and \"A Wild Minute\" which will be high quality sound recordings in natural landscapes for you to close your eyes, unwind, and immerse your mind and body in a natural soundscape. Think babbling brooks, ocean side waves, birds, croaking frogs, melting snow in the forest, any anything else that captures our ears during our adventures out in nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have so many ideas so we\u0027ll be trying out many different things \nin the beginning but we aim to keep it fun, engaging, educational, and \nexperiential, and of course...focused on all things natural and wild. We\n know many great people from working on We Are Wildness over the years, \nand we cant wait to bring them on the podcast and share their words with\n you. We\u0027ve got some other fun stuff in mind too, so you\u0027ll just have to wait and listen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003ePatreon is a way to pay your favorite \ncreators for making the stuff you love.  Instead of literally throwing \nmoney at your screen (trust us, that doesn\u2019t work), you can now pledge \n[per month and \u003cstrong\u003ereceive perks\u003c/strong\u003e]. This means the creator gets paid regularly, and you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone who has helped get us to where we are and thanks in advance to you who choose to pledge and support our leap into the world of podcasting. You are amazing and wild and we couldn\u0027t do this without you. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eAlissa and Kevin\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://wearewildness.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWe Are Wildness\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://wearewildness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Kevin-Alissa-Brite-Beach-Hike-Nov-15-rsz-We-Are-Wildness.jpg\" style=\"width: 323px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
