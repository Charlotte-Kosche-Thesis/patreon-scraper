You probably know us best for our song \"\u003cstrong\u003eTeenage Dirtbag\u003c/strong\u003e\" which came out in 2000 and people have really seemed to like. You might have also heard versions of Dirtbag by Dashboard Confessional, Weezer, All Time Low, Girls Aloud, 5 Seconds of Summer, Tokyo Police Club, and One Direction, who have all covered it in recent years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you might not know is that we\u0027re still a consistently active \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003efully independent\u003c/strong\u003e band. We have no record label or management; everything we make is paid for and released directly by the band. We\u0027ve recorded six studio albums to date and are currently in the process of recording album seven. We think this is our best collection of songs to date, and every dollar earned here will go directly towards getting them recorded as quickly and professionally as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWheatus Patrons will be offered tremendous access to the band in a way we have never granted before. \u00a0We will be posting previously unheard \u003cstrong\u003elive versions\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003edemos\u003c/strong\u003e of songs, arranging \u003cstrong\u003eprivate live-stream concerts\u003c/strong\u003e, hosting\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eQ\u0026amp;A sessions\u003c/strong\u003e with band members, sharing \u003cstrong\u003ebehind the scenes footage\u003c/strong\u003e of our recording sessions, and giving our patrons the \u003cstrong\u003every first listen\u003c/strong\u003e to our new album when it\u0027s complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means the world to us, and we will go above and beyond to make sure everyone who contributes gets more than their money\u0027s worth.
