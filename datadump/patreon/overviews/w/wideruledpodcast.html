    "summary": "Thank you so much for checking out \u003cem\u003eWide Ruled\u0027s\u003c/em\u003e Patreon page! \u00a0It means a lot that you would even consider helping to support our work. \u00a0We have a passion for equality, and education is one of the biggest factors either in driving \u0026amp; perpetuating those inequalities, or in working to bridge those divides.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode of \u003cem\u003eWide Ruled\u003c/em\u003e tells a story of struggle or triumph towards a better education system. Stories are then contextualized in the greater historical narrative of the education system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt present, \u003cem\u003eWide Ruled\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is a pure passion project. We\u0027re putting our own time and money into telling these stories because we believe these are important stories to tell. We\u0027re putting everything we can at it...and still we can only get a episode out every 2-weeks. Even so, each hour we spend on it is an hour that we can\u0027t spend at work or on paying client projects. Eventually, when the coffers get low, it makes the quality of these stories suffer. And that sucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eOur main goal\u003c/u\u003e - our unmoving North Star - is to get a place where we can give you a new, powerful story every week that informs you about America\u0027s education system.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we can continue to give these stories and these issues the attention they deserve. With your support, we can give you an episode every week, instead of every 2-weeks. \u00a0With \u003cem\u003eenough\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0support, we won\u0027t even have to interrupt the stories to thank Sponsors for making it possible - we\u0027ll just be thanking \u003cem\u003eyou!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eSo thank you! \u00a0Thanks for listening. Thanks for sharing the podcast to your friends. And thanks for even \u003cem\u003ethinking\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0about sharing a bit of your hard-earned cash with us soft-hearted storytellers."
