It takes place in its own world, and like me many of the primary characters are people of color and queer people of all kinds: people I would like to see represented more in action and fantasy fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I started making a podcast with my friend Esther, we call it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://transmediacrity.podbean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTransmediacrity\u003c/a\u003e. It is a casual podcast focusing on a friendly chat between friends about various pieces of media. As queer folks we try to bring our own under-represented perspective into the world of media through this podcast. We hope you will enjoy our discussions and our jokes and our casual tone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven more recently, we started doing video!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/WyattSalazar/videos\"\u003eCheck out our youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e. Currently, Patreon patrons get exclusively early access to Valkyria Chronicles videos and random other stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eI set up this Patreon to receive support for my creative endeavors, so that anyone who wants to can pay to help keep me afloat while I write. While the rewards aren\u0027t lucrative, I hope that you pledge because you want to support a queer woman of color and burgeoning talent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work a 9-to-5 job to make ends meet, and have been under a lot of financial stress recently. I also suffer from depression. Your Patreon contribution helps me immensely. I want to be able to publish stories accessible to anyone, to make audio and video content that anyone can just enjoy for free. While Patreon patrons have access to exclusive incentives, I try to have all the content end up public and free in some fashion because I believe in creating work people can access. I want this Patreon to be successful so I don\u0027t have to monetize the actual content or try to seek traditional revenue. I think paywalls and publishers are defunct. I\u0027d like to be proven right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now the Patreon is set up so that I charge Patrons whenever I create something Big: either a Chapter of a story, an hour or more of video, or something else equally Major. I do this because I don\u0027t want to charge for Just Any Old Thing, only special stuff. I would like to shift to a monthly payment plan, which is a goal I\u0027ve put on the side there, so I can produce content more freely without worrying about \"hitting a deadline\" to make ends meet. I hope you will help me out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time and attention. I hope you pledge and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
