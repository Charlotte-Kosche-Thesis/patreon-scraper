    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eEDIT: 21 April 2018 - okay, so I am finally getting to the end of the paperwork / visa docs I needed to finish and am moving forward and beginning of May 2018 will have time to start making more regular videos. I also have more of an idea for my long-term project and mentorship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a YouTube content creator, a casual gamer, IT professional, business entrepreneur who has just sold his successful IT business in South Africa as at the 15th January 2018. My business \u003cstrong\u003eKONDURA TECHNOLOGIES CC\u003c/strong\u003e is now sold to Jocote Technologies (Pty) Ltd T/A KONDURA TECHNOLOGIES. I am currently consulting/advising the new owner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEWS UPDATE: \u003c/strong\u003eIf you watched my video, you will know we are now emigrating to New Zealand and starting 18 April 2018, I have started VLOGGING the entire process and talking about my situation, expected difficulties, life history, experiences and the way forward. The VLOGGING allows 1. me to share my experience and give me more material and 2. time to improve my video editing skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor those that have been following my first venture into YouTube, I am also a casual gamer with a passion for RPG type MMO games. I\u0027ve always liked to do content that doesn\u0027t \"expire\" in a few days - content that is useful or informative for at least a few years. This was a good primer to get used to the tools, equipment needed to make a quality content. I just lacked a focus, a real passion. Gaming was not it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to VLOGGING - I want to take my Video content to the next level by instead of using it as a recreational release by actually doing videos that \"matter\" - that add value to the lives of my subscribers, supporters. So my intention is to launch a next-level training site, one-on-one style entrepreneur mentorship site giving you the skills I have acquired over the past 25+ years as a successful business entrepreneur. Many of things will help you lead a better life and allow you to be successful even if you\u0027re employed by someone. It\u0027s about \"life satisfaction\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want you to make the mistakes I made. I want to tell you where I went wrong, what is needed to be successful. I want to mentor via digital media. To put this together will take time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently run a web site WOCKSTER.com as my general blog and just launched the new project, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdel\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eListenWatchLearn.com\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/del\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eACQUIGNOSIS.com\u003c/strong\u003e which is a massive Work In Progress as I still have to do the videos and I want them to be really good, really professional. I may launch them on Vimeo instead of YouTube. Patreons will have access to content regardless which I decide to eventually do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease follow me on twitter, facebook and Instagram. I am trying to move the brand from \"WockyCC\" (this will become recreational/gaming) to \"CravenCoetzee\" and eventually \"AcquiGnosis\", so check out and subscribe to both channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mentorship program is something I intend in getting into, but I think some good productivity skill training would be beneficial to get people interested in my channel and get to know me better. As a professional on Google and Microsoft, I have a specific application suite I will be doing tutorials/training on when it launches later this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to make a collection of training videos, teaching productivity skills This is my project for a sustainable future and give back to my viewers and society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patreon contribution is an investment in me, allowing me to start up this venture giving me more time to get it going faster. Depending on tier you subscribe to, you will get to connect to me, see new content, see the building of a business from the ground up, have me share in my ideas, experience of running a business, get valuable insights into the workings of my plans as they develop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past almost 30 years, I have started three successful businesses, learnt a multitude of strengths, been mentored by other millionaires and billionaires. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now have decades of experience and proven success. Please help me achieving my goal of being an independent content creator making a difference, producing worthwhile, educational content on IT as well as business tips, entrepreneurship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy end goal is launching a full-time career in training, education, consulting and sharing my knowledge. Join me. Learn from me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution goes towards 1. New cameras and equipment (I would like to buy a GH5 and a lens for better wide-angle views and a gimbal to make my content buttery smooth as well as better sound, my Adobe subscription (+/- US$50 per month) and 2. The New Zealand Emigration fund as I am really excited to take photos, do VLOGs on a more regular basis in this beautiful country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope you join me and thank you for your time and consideration to support me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Craven Coetzee (aka \"the Wocky\" on YouTube)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDISCORD is live! Become a Patreon to Join!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
