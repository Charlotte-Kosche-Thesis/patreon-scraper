    "summary": "Firstly, I am a mom and wife. My husband, also our IT Support here at Wool n\u0027 Spinning, and I have two children, who have made appearances on the show: James, 5, and Norah, 3.5.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion lies in the field of fibre arts and making. I love making yarn, talking and chatting about the process, and teaching handspinning. I also have come to love technology, video editing and writing. I\u0027ve always kept a journal and written short stories but now I channel some of those words into essays, blog posts and content here! This has been a welcome surprise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWool n\u0027 Spinning started out as a way to talk about the topics I wanted to talk about and has slowly become about creating community, fellowship and learning opportunities. Most of us are seeking to become better versions of ourselves and it is a pleasure to share that journey with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pleasure of making yarn by hand can not be underestimated! You don\u0027t need a spinning wheel to do it and I love my spindling equally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my Patreons\u0027 support, creating more teaching materials, hosting giveaway and increasingly the time length of the podcast will be attainable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers me the chance to be compensated for the value of the content I produce, while still covering pesky costs like downloads, domain names, software and hardware, and tools to demo with for you. It keeps the YouTube channel ad-free and generates an income for me to be able to be at home, creating for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a Patreon campaign means we can work towards more live streaming opportunities, as well as audio, travelling in the future to teach workshops and retreats, and many other opportunities we haven\u0027t even thought of yet!"

As a family, we spend most of our time outside, camping, walking, hiking, in the water, etc. I love knitting but I \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e spinning. I spend most of my time dreaming about new projects, current projects and creating space for my hobbies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I spin on a Lendrum DT, Majacraft Suzie Pro \u0026amp; Sidekick, and copious spindles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always been surrounded by sewing, textiles and fibre. My grandmothers were amazing knitters, so I\u2019ve been told, and I was taught when I was a child by my Aunt. I came back to textiles, sewing included but mainly knitting, after university and continued to \u2018knit like the wind\u2019 through grad school. After finishing my Masters and having our second child, our daughter, I found I wanted something more meditative and I started spinning again (I had previously spun but not seriously).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I host a weekly video log, \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-wool-n-spinning-podcast/id1044008202\"\u003eWool n\u2019Spinning\u003c/a\u003e, to talk about my process in handspinning. Often we don\u0027t get to see, learn or understand what happens between the gorgeous fibre to the finished, handspun yarn -- here\u0027s where I chat about that \u0027middle part\u0027! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome join us in the Ravelry group, \u003ca href=\"http://www.ravelry.com/groups/the-wool-n-spinning-podcast\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e",
