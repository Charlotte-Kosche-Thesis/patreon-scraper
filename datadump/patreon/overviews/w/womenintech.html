The purpose of the show is for every listener to walk away feeling \u0027If She Can Do It So Can I\u0027. I call it \"actionable empowerment\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn just a year I\u0027ve produced and hosted\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003etech podcasts that shot to the top 5 of Apple\u0027s iTunes New \u0026amp; Noteworthy.

In reality, producing these podcasts takes a ton of time and work. A LOT. \u003cstrong\u003eMost of the production I do on my own\u003c/strong\u003e from interviews to editing to distribution to marketing. IT\u0027S A LOT!

All the shows I produce are startup business related to genuinely save listeners time, money and heartache. The shows I am currently working on are \"WeAreLATech\", \"Hello Customer\" and \"#womenintech Podcast\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJOIN #WOMENINTECH via my Patreon page!

Grew up on Wilshire Blvd in Westwood Village by UCLA. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnew I was an entrepreneur by the time I was 5 years old walking to the movies with my father I would imagine what businesses I would create inside the empty office buildings as we passed them by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first \"business\" book I read was\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"The Alchemist\"\u003c/a\u003e by Paulo Coelho when I was 14 years old, given to me by my friend/mentor Aaron. The story taught me that if I believed in something with all my heart and soul the entire universe would work toward making my dreams come to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarted my first company in my late teens, a scuba diving accessory e-commerce business when having an online business was a rarity. It was HARD to figure out. I was working as a yacht stewardess at the time and bought the company for a couple thousand dollars from a yacht broker who no longer had an interest in running it. Lacking a passion for the diving industry (I\u0027d never even been scuba diving!) I turned to an industry I did love, action sports; skateboarding, motocross, snowboarding and reinvented my company to align with my personal interests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I grew that company, along with other startups experiencing many insanely exciting ups and super low downs; attracting an incredible team to help build \u0027our\u0027 brand, making sales, spending all my savings to fund growing, working with celebrity athletics, forming partnerships with the coolest brands, meeting top business owners, raising money. It\u0027s been a tough journey and I don\u0027t recommend it to everyone, but if you feel it boiling in your blood then you have no choice, but to go after it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of tips and advice from conferences, events, meeting people, advisors I\u0027ve learned there is one ultimate truth - your intuition is your oracle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersonal site,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://espreedevora.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEspreeDevora.com\u003c/a\u003e",
