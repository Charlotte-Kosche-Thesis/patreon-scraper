    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eHey There\u003c/em\u003e, my name is \u003cstrong\u003eWildCamperVanMan\u003c/strong\u003e (Ant). I have a Ex Ambulance which i have converted into a camper van, I Have a channel on YouTube where i do regular vlogs and travel videos as well as other videos. I am a Part Timer that travels with my 14 year old daughter around the UK and soon to be Europe towards the end of 2018 if things go to plan. \u003cbr\u003eBack in January 2017 I started making videos about my \ndaily life building my camper, Which turned into videos of trips away.\u00a0 People started to enjoy my videos as i put them out quite regular,\u00a0 Then i started to make a daily Vlog where id walk around the countryside talking about all sorts as well as getting lost along the way.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eThis seemed to catch on but i didn\u0027t like the fact the subscribers were seeing me as a man who moaned and swore lots.\u00a0 \u003cem\u003e(It wasn\u0027t really child friendly was it now)\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now its 2018 and my channel is doing very well for a channel that\u0027s almost 1 year old and I \nhave redone how i will make my YouTube videos from now on.\u00a0 Instead of quantity, i am going to focus on getting you all quality footage which means less videos but 1080p 50..\u00a0 I do plan to make between 2-4 videos a week if i can do this and if i have the time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously by becoming a patron you will get Photos \u0026amp; Videos straight from my mobile phone or any other devices i use. This will be between creating the videos i am shooting for YouTube, No-one else will get to see this, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eONLY YOU! \u003c/strong\u003e( behind the scenes ).\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also made friends along the way and met some awesome people. I actually enjoy making videos very much. \u003cbr\u003eBut I had noticed other YouTubers were using this website and i think that it is an excellent way to show support for video and website creators. I don\u0027t really agree with the begging side of it any more, but i actually made a vlog about patreon and begging, There are different ways to Patreon i think. \u003cbr\u003eSome do it because they can and others do it to fund their channels and to create an exclusive community.\u00a0 ( i fall into the Community one )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the videos i create and you get value from them, and appreciate the time that I \nput into editing them maybe think about joining my \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eexclusive community\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\nMy videos on YouTube will always be free. But if you would like to \njoin my exclusive community once per month by spending the same amount you would\n for a cuppa or a beer it would be much appreciated!.\u003cbr\u003eI am not begging for loads of money, but id like to create My very own exclusive community where members get perks that others wouldn\u0027t really get.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If i want to do videos of awesome places and travel loads more than i have been then something has to give.\u00a0 I have a business that i need to keep running to survive and if that goes and i do Van Life Full Time, i need to get money from somewhere. There is a myth that\u0027s going around that people who create YouTube videos make hundreds of \u00a3\u0027s a month and this is wrong,\u00a0 its more like \u00a32.00 a week if you are lucky. \u003cbr\u003eOnly the Creators with millions of subscribers make good money. Running my business limits how long i go away for which is kind of annoying,\u00a0 the most i can go away for is 4-5 days maximum,\u00a0 so if i can get the channel to grow and get your support to drive me forward you get more from this as well as i do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at the perks i offer and if there is something you would like to add then feel free to contact me and i will upgrade that for you.\u00a0 I offer a Lower, Middle \u0026amp; Elite.\u00a0 Each tier offers different things.\u00a0 I \u003cstrong\u003eDON\u0027T\u003c/strong\u003e want you to do this if you are on a low wage or you struggle to find money, that\u0027s not what i\u0027m all about.\u00a0 \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eONLY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e do this if you really want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStay Safe\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u0026amp;\u003cbr\u003eAv A Gud Un.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
