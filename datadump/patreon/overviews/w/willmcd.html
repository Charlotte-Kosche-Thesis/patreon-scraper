    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eRight! So cards on the table!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m a small scale YouTuber with no budget. \u003cstrong\u003eI absolutely adore film making!\u003c/strong\u003e However anything I make I have to fund myself, which is fine because it\u0027s just a hobby at the moment, but this means my films are limited considerably due to a \u003cstrong\u003elack of revenue\u003c/strong\u003e. I have plenty of scripts and film ideas that I\u0027ve had to put on hold due to their scale just being a bit too ambitious: They may contain expensive props or need me to pay for better locations or actors etc. and that\u0027s before I even consider the fact that my camera and audio equipment is in desperate need of an upgrade (and film equipment and editing software is soooo damn expensive). Basically my aim is for my\u003cstrong\u003e films to increase consistently in quality\u003c/strong\u003e and scope and I just can\u0027t afford to do it all myself. I want my finished films to look as great as they do in my head! I want them to be as good as they can be, so everyone else can enjoy them as well. I want to be able to deliver great content to all you lovely chaps, lady chaps and everyone in between and beyond!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon and you guys come in! \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m not too\u00a0big to admit I need help. I can\u0027t make films as well or as frequently as I\u0027d like (and I hope as you\u0027d like) without the added helping hand. And sure I\u0027d love to get to the stage where I can do this for a living (I\u0027ve put that as a milestone... hint hint..), so I can \u003cstrong\u003eproduce films much more frequently\u003c/strong\u003e, but in the meantime I just want to make spiffing videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo If you don\u0027t know, the way Patreon works is that you \u003cstrong\u003edonate to one project at a time\u003c/strong\u003e. So you would specify an amount and every time I release a video that amount is donated. You can also put a monthly cap on spending, so if I were to release too many videos a month (unlikely) then you\u0027d reach your donation limit and you wouldn\u0027t spend more than you wanted to. Now that\u0027s only a donation when a video on my main channel is released, not anything else on my second channel. Also you don\u0027t have to live in the USA to donate in dollars (if you didn\u0027t know $1 is about the equivalent to 60 pence in the UK....HINT!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you are \u003cstrong\u003eamazingly generous\u003c/strong\u003e enough to support me then just know that you will be a part of helping to create these daft and ridiculous video jobbies and hopefully you\u0027ll also become more of a part of the videos themselves. I want to \u003cstrong\u003einclude you in the process\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0as a thank you and so you guys can help give me a bit of feedback as well. Plus, just think, if you pledge to support my videos then you never need to feel guilty about using that adblock on YouTube ever again! Well when watching my stuff that is...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll stuff my Patreon feed full of saucy little extra bits and bobs\u003c/strong\u003e that I won\u0027t upload anywhere else and will be \u003cstrong\u003eexclusively for your eyes\u003c/strong\u003e. Things like \u003cstrong\u003ebehind the scenes images\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eproduction shots\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, concept sketches/doodles, pre-release videos,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eupdates\u003c/strong\u003e on my comings and goings and \u003cstrong\u003enew projects\u003c/strong\u003e on the way as well as\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003edraft scripts\u003c/strong\u003e to gain your feedback and input. I\u0027ll also endeavour to pop my \u003cstrong\u003efinished videos\u003c/strong\u003e up ahead of public viewing so you guys will get \u003cstrong\u003eearly peeking rights\u003c/strong\u003e (they could be up anywhere between a few hours to a couple of days, but they\u0027ll be early!). \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonating as little as $1 per video gives \u003cstrong\u003eyou access to my Patreon feed,\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ea mention at the end of my next video\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eand access to a private little discord chat group \u003c/strong\u003ewhere I can keep you updated on all things video,\u00a0but there are also those\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eextra little incentives\u003c/strong\u003e for varying levels of pledges that I\u0027ve put together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t have the money to donate then that\u0027s obviously fine, I\u0027m grateful for anyone who just watches one of my videos, but if you are able to then you will make a nerdy film making loser very happy. \u003cstrong\u003eEvery little extra helps me out\u003c/strong\u003e!!"
