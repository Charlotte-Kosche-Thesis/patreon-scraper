Sheet music for the things I\u2019m teaching, multiple camera angles, professional video, professional sound, midi versions of the notes so you can see them visually, bringing in famous pianists to show you how they do their unique style\u2026the list goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019d also like to do them more than weekly. I have a lot of ideas to share and I\u2019d like to get them all out before I die\u2026which\u2026who knows\u2026I\u2019m an artist in my 30s\u2026so could be any time? (just kidding).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I\u2019ve decided to make a patreon campaign. There is a studio in LA who is willing to take on the feat of creating these videos, but it\u2019s going to take some support. Any amount will help, but reaching our highest goal will give us the tools to turn this into a massive operation with all the personnel we need to make each video professionally produced to the highest level, with all the bells and whistles that will make it easier for you to learn what I\u2019m trying to teach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry - I know the goal is lofty - but I love making these videos for you, and I\u2019ll continue in my own simple way no matter what.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- Weekly Piano\u003cbr\u003e"
