    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eCreepy, Cute and Very much ODD.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi Everyone, fancy meet and welcome to my Patreon. I\u0027m an artist known by White Stag and very much in love with creating and furthering my talent so much so... I never normally take a day off. I enjoy creating my bitter sweet world and I never seem to have enough time to paint all the things I plan on... And at the same time I have so many new exciting projects going on (like my current coloring book series, Misfits A coloring book for adults and Odd Children, an oracle deck and several painting series and art books). I stream my art creation live on Twitch and also have timelapsed painting videos (and soon tutorials) on youtube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1783/1743/files/15876890_207567792981639_7916882894247690240_n_large.jpg?v=1487193691\" style=\"width: 118px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAbout White Stag.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStag specializes primarily in acrylic paints and has a strong passion for black and white art. After a hand injury Stag was unable to do any traditional ink work for a time. While occasionally dabbling in small inked pieces she has been working more digitally inking coloring pages and recently more refined pieces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStag\u0027s art blends elements of innocence with darker situations often humorous and creepy cute. With Gothic, horror, fantasy, occult, or whimsically quirky childish themes she creates an other-worldy dystopia filled with transient princesses, morbidly obese cats, living teddy bears, prolific zombie girls, young girls that clearly need adult supervision, cosmic witchery and strange beasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStag deems herself a collector of stripey socks(preferably black and white) and tees with neat and or dark art. Her music is loud and often \"angry\" and she has found lots of inspiration since childhood from comics, anime and video games.  She is and avid Horror fan pretty much rejecting any other genre of movie and a collector of baubles, Asian style ball joint dolls, crystals, and other neat things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStag will inevitably become a collector of cats... or other critters. She currently resides as a recluse in Pennsylvania with her Husband, Daughter and Cat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1783/1743/files/alien_banner_1024x.jpg?v=1487106559\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinks:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my website at:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.LowbrowMisfits.com\"\u003ewww.LowbrowMisfits.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a YouTube filled with time lapsed videos of painting, past live streams, vlogs and tutorials. \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DanceOfWhiteStag\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/DanceOfWhiteStag\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can catch me streaming LIVE on twitch several times a week come chat and hang out: \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/hvitstag\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitch.tv/hvitstag\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e You can also find me on facebook: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/terrafantasyart\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/terrafantasyart\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also on instagram: \u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/whitestagart\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://instagram.com/whitestagart\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Rewards \u0026amp; Misfit Medley Club\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI currently have many reward Tiers to choose from with massive savings compared to if you would order from my website. Rewards are shipped out at the end of the following month and are carefully curated featuring current works, normally from the month you subbed. The Club packs can feature anything from original works to prints and various products sometimes one offs just for subscribers or early access new products with a possibility of buttons, stickers and so much more. As we hit new goals expect to see new additional tiers as well as monthly giveaways and more diverse products.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
