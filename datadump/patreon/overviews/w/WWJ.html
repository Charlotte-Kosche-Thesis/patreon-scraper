    "summary": "Hey! it\u0027s Ian, from Wheelers Weekend Jams. I wanted to tell you a little bit about a really\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003eawesome Patreon campaign we have that revolutionizes the way we make our content. Not only does this campaign maximize the content we can provide, but it also helps us produce quality entertainment efficiently for our audience. Gunther, Lauren and I love\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003ewhat we do, and Patreon is empowering us to do it on a whole new level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know what Patreon is, it\u0027s a really cool platform where our subscribers\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003eand other viewers can make donations for as little as one dollar every month. These donations, in addition to our own contributions, will allow us to extend our reach to a larger array of established musicians. Our goal at Weeler\u0027s Weekend Jams is to broadcast new high quality content; converging a variety of insights into the lives of your favorite artists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Patreon supporters are the backbone of the entirety of our work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOur origin stems back to a little radio show called Wheeler\u0027s Afternoon Jams. When it was moved to the weekend hour slot, our name\u0027s fate was sealed. Eventually, we decided to continue the legacy into a full fledged broadcast to be shared with the masses. Our fantastic following of viewers and Patreon supporters have allowed our recent expansion into the iTune\u0027s podcasting community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Our main objective is to make this show our primary focus. Once our crew can maintain this channel full time, our broadcast will have room to truly thrive. When this level is achieved, we can provide more consistent content from your favorite bands, keeping you updated and informed on the faces behind the masks. A hurdle in the path has been copyright claims from various agencies, which is strongly enforced on YouTube. Even with permission from the musicians, we are not allowed to post any of their licensed music necessary for your enjoyment. As a group, we have realized that our success is urgently dependent upon music licensing permission. Once this is obtained, the depth and scope of our interviews will evolve for your direct benefit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom here, we are seeking dramatic expansion. Our vision involves\u00a0bigger rewards for our patrons, hosting unique giveaways, and giving back much more to our community, and the community at large. At this level we would also seek philanthropy through charities such as Buckle Up for Chi. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe were ecstatic to announce earlier this year that Wheeler\u0027s Jam Nation will be the first music festival coordinated completely by the WWJ crew. We hope with your continued support, the band and vendor selection available to us will increase and expand annually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor as little as dollar a month, we can eventually become the music television of the digital age. Thank you so much for watching, checking out our Patreon page, and\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ebeing a part of the music with us. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
