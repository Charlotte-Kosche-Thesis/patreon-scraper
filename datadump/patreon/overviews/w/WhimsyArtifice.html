During the live stream sessions, Patreon patrons were able to vote weekly on Plot Twist Polls, help us explore the world through Getting To Know You questions, and more. Although at this time the live stream is on extended hiatus for Warda, we hope to return to that weekly activity in the future. Patreon can help us get that equipment, pay our performers, and finagle fees for other necessary logistics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, the podcast is following all of our previous storylines and one-shots. In April, Winds of Change will take over as the primary storyline (although it was played first in real world time, the story takes place ten years \u003cem\u003eafter\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Curiosities!). We intend to create and cast a NEW storyline to follow Winds of Change in the fall of 2018 if possible. Even if we aren\u0027t able to do live streams with it right away, we want to have a new campaign on the podcast by then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are also working on creating original game mechanics and a world book to publish and sell. Many people have approached us about wanting to play their own games in Warda - and we want to bring that to \u003cem\u003eall of you\u003c/em\u003e. Although Fate has worked well for the previous games, we want to find our own path and create a totally new roleplaying experience not just with the world, but with the way you play in it. We intend to bring the game to playtest at Gen Con 2018, and your support will help get us there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy jumping in here to help us \u003cstrong\u003ecreate\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eproduce\u003c/strong\u003e, you will be making a massive difference in both the outcome of these projects and our real life - so for that, we thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAly \u0026amp; Drew\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSocial Media links:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAly:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/authorgrauer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook.com/AuthorGrauer\u003c/a\u003e (book of faces!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.dreamstobecome.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.dreamstobecome.com/\u003c/a\u003e (blawg!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/dreamstobecome\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@dreamstobecome\u003c/a\u003e (tweeter and insta-graham!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDrew:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/worldstoforge\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@worldstoforge\u003c/a\u003e (tweeter)\u003cbr\u003e@drewjetski (insta-graham)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome To Warda:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.welcometowarda.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.welcometowarda.com/\u003c/a\u003e (website and blog)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook.com/WelcomeToWarda\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/welcometowarda\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@welcometowarda\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
