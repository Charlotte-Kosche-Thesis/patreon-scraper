You produce gaming podcasts based on a game or at least RPGs, so what is Patreon ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a monthly crowd funding site, similar to a Kickstarter. The main difference is that a Patreon page is tailor made for creatives that do a bunch of small things, while Kickstarter is better suited for somebody doing a single, larger-scale project. Some folks like to think of it as a giant \"tip jar\" that you come back to each time when we produce stuff for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, great.. we know whom you are, and what you do.. but.. what do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, first things first, the main shows on the network are free to download and listen to on any device, anytime and as many times as you\u0027d like to listen. Some of the shows on the network have agreed to put out special \"thank you\" content for their listeners to help raise funds for the network. We\u0027ve highlighted each reward level below and have clearly stated which podcasts will do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are these milestone things I see on the left, and do I have to donate that much to get it?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNO, not at all. Milestones are these goals that affect everyone because if they are reached we\u0027ll be able to do even more each month and everybody gets to benefit, regardless of individual pledges!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for as little as a $1 a month you can help support the network, and the shows you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003eVincent\u003cbr\u003eFounder - WGP, LLC\u003cbr\u003e"
