    "summary": "Okay, I was going to do a video type thing but I tried it and it felt really, really awkward. If I find a way of doing a non awkward patreon video in the future then I shall do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, let me quicky give you a story on why I am deciding to do this...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically, I was looking around for a new mouse to buy, my trusty Zowie AM was on its last legs and there was only so much time I could use it as an excuse for me throwing CSGO and TF2 games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch like how I find out about various PC parts using the YouTubes I started to do the same for some PC mice, specifically the Logitech G303, I went through a few videos and was just getting no real information that I needed from the reviews, most of them were just feature listing, their testing methods were shocking (testing performance in BF4 and Dying Light) and a few weren\u0027t really giving a solid opinion, like they were reluctant to give any real criticism to the mouse in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom further digging in relation to keyboards, headsets etc. this was a recurring theme for many, many channels, there obviously are loads of good ones that are catering to a more casual environment but there seemed to be very little that would go a bit deeper and actually help yourself make a decision on a purchase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I aim to do with my reviews is to give a more informative and entertaining video that is targeted for competitive gamers. I have years of experience in competitive games ranging from CS 1.6/Source/Global Offensive, TF2, Day of Defeat, Quake, Reflex etc. I am an insane keyboard fanatic, follow e-sports more than I think is actually healthy and really have a strong unrelenting enthusiasm with anything that involves my cat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome FAQ\u0027s\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I going to do with your $$$?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuite simply the majority of the money will go towards the cost of peripherals, naturally some will range from \u00a330 - \u00a3150, obviously I will be trying to make this as cost efficient as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also be heavily investing in improving the quality of said reviews, at the moment I have a good camera, but a somewhat mediocre and difficult recording and sound set up, so this would contribute to that cause as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll extra funds will be dependant on where I want to take this adventure, depending on how much this generates I have a various amount of options I\u0027d want to explore, but that the moment in time, this is mainly to just soften the financial hit that I suffer from buying the gear myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need our money your nerd?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNice question, friend. At the moment I\u0027ve had to drop my hours to part time due to a unfortunate anxiety/stress/depression issue. From around a year ago I was off work for 2 months due to this, there were points when I couldn\u0027t even go to the toilet as I was in such a shit state. I\u0027m seeing a therapist and getting better but it was recommended that I drop my hours to help relieve some of the work related stresses. This means I have less $$$ which is why I am asking for some assistance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate: I\u0027m unemployed now :(\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy don\u0027t you approach the companies to give you review samples?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was something I was considering to pursue first. However, the downsides of this is that from the various research that I\u0027ve been doing it can make things a bit more difficult, there will be some companies that will stop sending gear if I give them negative reviews (this is obviously assuming they give a shit in the first place), it also makes me feel uncomfortable depending on manufacturers directly and I feel better knowing that I am doing this to serve people that are somewhat giving me money to do it. It would soften the financial hit from me buying my own products but I feel I\u0027d try to be to safe so then I wouldn\u0027t upset anyone and burn bridges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are thinking of supporting me I would be incredibly thankful for your hard earned dollar dollar bills. I will not let you down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
