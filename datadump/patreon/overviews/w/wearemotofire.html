    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWe started Motofire.com with one mission and one mission only; we wanted to prove that with a little hard work, effort, dedication and above all \u003cem\u003epassion\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that it was possible to build a motorcycling destination online that people would not only visit, but one that they\u0027d also enjoy.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen we first sat down to discuss what Motofire could really be, both of us [Ian and Steve] were in pretty dark places personally and financially. We\u0027d lost our jobs at what is considered the world\u0027s oldest motorcycling newspaper, after spending years trying to persuade our dyed-in-the-wool publisher that things could - and \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e - be done differently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs motorcycle \u0027consumers\u0027 ourselves, we believed that we knew instinctively what an online audience should be getting when visiting a motorcycling \u0027destination\u0027 online, and as motorcycle publishing professionals we were pretty darn sure that what was out there currently - \u003cem\u003eespecially from within the UK\u003c/em\u003e - wasn\u0027t it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e18 months later and we\u0027re well on the way towards our goal. And we couldn\u0027t have done that without you - our readers, fans, followers and (let\u0027s be honest) consumers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eWe don\u0027t honestly expect anyone to contribute any more to our little corner of the motorcycling universe by doing anything more than reading, watching, viewing and engaging with our work - and for that we can\u0027t thank you enough.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(If you\u0027re one of those people who\u0027ve turned off their ad-blocker for your Motofire.com visits we appreciate that even more! ;p)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut... Producing a website that is updated multiple times a day, running a social media presence, creating weekly live videos and managing YouTube costs more than just time. And if you - our loyal and dedicated audience member - could see yourselves to donating us just $2 of your hard-earned cash a month, we promise that every penny of it will go towards providing you with even greater, more in-depth and more frequent coverage of the passion that brought us all here - the love of everything motorcycles!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening, and thanks for helping us to #fireitup!\u003cbr\u003e"
