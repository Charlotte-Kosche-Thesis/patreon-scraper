    "summary": "Two burlesque performers, Tiffy Twister and myself (Brandy Snifter), have created the production and comedy team of Slut Ambience. \u00a0Together we produce a show that is unique to Los Angeles. \u00a0It\u0027s a burlesque and variety show that aims to give a truly \"What the fuck just happened, and why am I turned on?\" experience for our audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are the most messy, tarptastic show in Los Angeles. \u00a0We\u0027ve had a performer pee onstage. \u00a0We\u0027ve had jello wrestling. \u00a0We\u0027ve eaten razor blades and stapled things to people. \u00a0We\u0027ve had pie fights. \u00a0We\u0027ve had sploshing. \u00a0We\u0027ve had rabies. We\u0027ve had Lambchop and Shari Lewis sing about their love of penises. \u00a0We\u0027ve had Rappin\u0027 Julie Andrews. \u00a0We\u0027ve had dancing chickens, singing turkeys, and all manner of foul and fowl things occurring on our stage. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe aim to produce the most fun, laid-back and entertaining environment to be found in Bum-Fuck, Reseda. \u00a0We want our show to feel like home ... like Cheers, but for people with Tourette\u0027s Syndrome. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, Tiffy and I are both working low-paying jobs and most of the time we not only can\u0027t afford to pay our performers what they deserve, but we pay to perform and put on the show rather than making any profit or even breaking even. \u00a0We charge a low admission price, and don\u0027t want to change that, but we want to keep having a jam-packed show. \u00a0Here\u0027s where your pledges can really help! They can allow us to keep booking as many uber-talented people as we currently do for each show. \u00a0They can help us afford more tarps, buy things like a digital projector, and do things like buy milk and cookies for everyone in the audience. \u00a0Really. \u00a0We\u0027ll also be able to pay ourselves and not have to live on ramen for the week after the show. \u00a0Really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you dig the weird, and want to keep out-there art alive in Los Angeles, you\u0027d do well to pledge here!"
