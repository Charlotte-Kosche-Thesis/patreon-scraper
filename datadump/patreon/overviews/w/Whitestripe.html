    "summary": "Hello there everyone and welcome to my humble page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting has been a long loved passion of mine, and it\u0027s my dream to create amazing stories for my fans to read and enjoy. Here on Patreon, I\u0027m asking for help and support in bringing not only my short stories, but my novels into to the world. I\u0027m just a single person though, I\u0027m nothing without all of you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo then, why should you even consider throwing your hard earned money at me? Well, I\u0027m glad you asked. \u003cbr\u003eBy becoming one of my patrons, you\u0027ll gain access to a wide variety of diffrent rewards. Some of which include the ability to vote on a list of topics each week that you want to see made into a story. Each week when I stream, being able to decide what story I\u0027ll be working on, as well as the ability to gain extra votes for the weekly tales so you can see the stories you enjoy more often. And being able to see your characters in all of the diffrent little universe\u0027s that I\u0027ve brewed up. But of course, we save the best for last. I\u0027ll also be offering free commissions and stories for some of my higher tier rewards, so if you want a story or two a month, that might be the choice to make, plus gaining access to all of the rewards below them as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is one more reward though that I want to specifically mention. For my highest reward tier, you can see a version of your character in a \u003cbr\u003epublished novel. I\u0027ve published a trilogy of novels and am preparing\u00a0 to begin my second series, I\u0027m more then willing to work with you to bring your character to life as a main character for my series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, now that we\u0027ve talked about what you get if you follow, I suppose I should let you all know where your money is going too. Your money would be going to two different places. The first is to my hungry hungry wallet who is constantly at the gate fending off the likes of bills, evil collage payments, and otherwise the unavoidable costs of living. I\u0027m a poor collage student trying to make his way in the world and every little bit helps me. \u003cbr\u003eThe second half of where all your money goes towards helping me to make not only my novels better, such as being able to get an actual editor, work on marketing and promotional materials, and otherwise try and become a succesful author, but the money would also go towards my short stories as well. Some of the things I\u0027ve always wanted to see is artwork for the Lunar Academy, for awhile I\u0027ve had the idea of a big banner picture featuring all the characters within the school in one picture. But art like that would be expensive. But that gives you the idea. I\u0027d want to get artwork done for the stories that you all feel so strongly about, to really bring the story to life in another form for all of you to experience.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone for reading this and giving me a minute of your time, and I look forward to writing some awesome stories for all of you. \u003cbr\u003e"
