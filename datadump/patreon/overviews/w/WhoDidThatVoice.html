    "summary": "Who Did That Voice was established on August 5th, 2016. The show concept and name came from a question I used to ask my parents as a kid, \"Who Did That Voice?\". I was always aware and curious of voices. Especially when they changed a characters voice say from The first movie to the second, etc. So from a very young age this show concept was brewing in my mind long before I even knew what the term voiceover meant. This podcast takes you the listeners behind the scenes of the voiceover pros, newbies, and more and into their lives, careers, advice and more. This show gives you a look at the actors and professionals either behind the mic or behind the glass, such as: script writers, directors, producers and more. I hope you all enjoy this unique look into the world of \"All\" things voiceover. We touch on topics such as: animation, movies, commercials, the voice of Siri for iPhone, and so much more. Our world is full of voiceover in almost everything we do. So join me in discovering more about the world of voiceover and learn just exactly, Who Did That Voice!! I look forward to partnering with you and growing our Who Did That Voice family.\u003cbr\u003e"
