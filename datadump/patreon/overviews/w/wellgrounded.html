    "summary": "Welcome, Beautiful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Lisa Grace Byrne ~ founder of WellGrounded Life...teacher, researcher, wife, mom to three...science-minded, nature-loving, fierce mama-advocate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 10 years ago, I found myself in a hard space along the journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a young toddler son, infant girl and third child on the way, I descended into a dark post-partum depression and felt disconnected to myself and the joy-filled, grateful life I wanted so badly to be living. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe intensity of early motherhood left me stretched thin and drained dry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd from this low place, WellGrounded Life was born. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI figured if I was feeling this way, maybe another woman out there felt something similar. And if I stretched out my hand, we could help each other forward one step at a time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurns out, when I stretched out my hand- thousands of women stretched out theirs-- and our worldwide community began. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWellGrounded Life believes that \u003cstrong\u003eevery woman should have deep anchors of nourishment and self-care \u003c/strong\u003ewoven into the fabric of their lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also believe we were \u003cem\u003edesigned for well-being\u003c/em\u003e. So understanding that design \u003cstrong\u003ehelps us work \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e ourselves and gives us the keys to how to best nurture ourselves in the first place\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I took my undergrad background in Biochemistry, Nutrition and Metabolism, graduate work in Social and Behavioral Public Health and reams of personal experience feeling exhausted, stressed beyond my limits and diminished well-being... and decided to do something about it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat something turned into resources like articles, audio classes, podcasts and videos\u003cstrong\u003e exploring the full spectrum of what truly restores, replenishes and protects a woman and mother\u0027s well-being and vitality.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e Not to mention the incredible grace-filled, supportive community that explored, learned and grew together in these courses and programs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron here- at whatever support level you can- \u003cstrong\u003eyou are standing with the vision that you, as well as every other woman and mother in the world, deserve to live a life full of healthy, calm and energized well-being.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile WellGrounded Life offers various longer-term programs, like our incredible year-long course called Replenish 365 and the WellGrounded Institute\u0027s professional training for Women\u0027s Wellness Educators who want to do this kind of wellness work themselves... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWellGrounded Life Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e is the core community of patrons (the inner circle supporters) who want to be part of the evolution of what we explore and topics we dive deeper into together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support here means the world to me.\u003c/strong\u003e Truly. My gratitude just overflows for the incredible women who have been part of the decade journey so far and who will join for the decades in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of the WellGrounded Life Patreon you can expect first access to podcasts, audio classes, personal journey reflections, articles, videos, meditations, book reviews, guest interviews and more to enrich your own well-being and self-care journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll also have lively discussions, polls, and times to engage together to get to know each other and inform where we go in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuilding a core \"inner circle\" of support via a Patreon community also means I can allow my own rhythm of content creation to happen without the pressure or guilt to always \"produce\" on a schedule. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge per \"thing\" you are only supporting me when I release a resource -- and you can always \"cap\" your monthly support amount so you are never paying more per month than you are comfortable with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to see you \"inside\", get to know your better and do this life-giving work of nurturing our well-being together! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNitty Gritty Details\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. What exactly is Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that allows people (creators, artists, teachers, musicians, etc) to share their gifts with those who believe in them, their vision and their mission. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s essentially a way for a community of people to support work that they care about and benefit from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou become part of the Patreon by \"supporting\" at a certain tier level. Whether that is $1 per thing or $10 per thing- each tier level has certain rewards those patrons have access to... and anyone can cap how many \"things\" they will contribute toward per month- so you never go over the budget you are comfortable with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. How do I know what I\u0027ll be charged per month? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you sign up for a certain tier- you have the choice to choose how many \"things\" per month you want to be charged for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGenerally speaking, I\u0027ll never release more than 4 \"things\" per month- and it will likely be more like 2 a month on average. But if you want to be sure you don\u0027t go over a certain amount per month simply cap the number of things you\u0027ll contribute toward each month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry- regardless of any caps- when you sign up for a tier you get all the resources I release for that tier. We don\u0027t keep score around here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eANY and all support is incredibly generous and hugely appreciated!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. What if I want to cancel? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem- and easy to do within your Patreon account settings. You can simply change your level of support, cancel, or rejoin in the future at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.
