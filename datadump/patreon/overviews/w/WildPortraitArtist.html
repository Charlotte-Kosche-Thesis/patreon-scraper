    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u0027m Monique, the Wild Portrait Artist!\u003c/strong\u003e I love sharing my knowledge about techniques and materials with other artists. It\u0027s for this reason that I started making art tutorials on Youtube! This is something I have wanted to do for years and it is so fulfilling to teach other people and share my experiences while creating artwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I am quickly discovering that this is a very expensive endeavor. Factor in the costs of art supplies, running a website, recording equipment, video editing software, storage space and field trips and it all starts adding up. I want to be able to keep teaching and growing my Youtube channel, but I can\u0027t do that without your help. Supporting me on Patreon would help me to stay afloat and continue producing high quality art tutorials and art product reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s in it for you guys? Perhaps the most obvious thing would be exclusive Patreon content including monthly slowed-down tutorial videos, royalty-free reference photos taken by me for you to use in your art, and occasional bonus content! In addition, I would also be able to make huge upgrades to my computer setup and internet speed, meaning better production value, livestreams, plus far more regular content on Youtube and on Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t spare any money, I just want to say a massive thank you to everyone who watches my Youtube videos and follows me on social media. Be sure to come back every month for one FREE reference photo to download! Your support means the world to me. :)"
