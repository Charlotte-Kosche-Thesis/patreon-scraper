To put the $10 into comparison, If you were to take one of the college classes I taught you would pay approximately $2,300/class and currently our clients pay $125/hour for executive coaching and/or business consulting.  So my offer to you is worth every penny and my webcasts will pack a powerful punch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first webcasts series is called:  Work with Meaning - Tools for Personal Empowerment and Mindfulness. This series will contain approximately 24 different videos/podcasts ranging in length from 10 minutes to 30 minutes.  I plan to run this series for one year with the first episode starting on April 16th 2018, delivering you and other patrons 2 insightful videos per month for an entire year.  The content of the first webcast series is centered around helping you learn key principles to be more successful while simultaneously increasing the fulfillment and meaning you experience in your life and work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second series is called:  Work with Meaning - Tools for Sustainable Business Development. This series will also contain approximately 24 different videos and will run for one year starting April 15th, 2019.  The content of this series will center around key business tools and concepts which help create sustainable success and conscious organizational culture, steeped in meaning and fulfillment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are committed to learning, being successful in your life and creating fulfilling and meaningful experiences in this precious life you live, then please join me and trust me as your online teacher and coach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow if you do not know me personally, you might be thinking \"Why should I follow Ryan Pickens and what validates him as a professional who I should listen to?\" \u00a0So, let me take a quick moment to share some of my experience and background. \u00a0Highlights include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have 2 unique degrees in Human and Organizational Development/Transformation - my undergraduate is from Vanderbilt University and my Masters Degree is from the California Institute of Integral Studies.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI taught emotional/social intelligence, organizational development, decision making, marketing and management classes for 10 years in Higher Education at Mars Hill University.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have worked with numerous individuals and business clients as an executive coach and organizational consultant for approximately 15 years.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI worked for the State of North Carolina for 2 years as a Strategy and Organizational Development Specialist helping small and medium sized businesses across Western North Carolina.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have invested, got real dirty and have overseen 14 successful real estate projects in Asheville and Western North Carolina.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI co-authored The Definitive Guide to Disc Golf - published by Triumph Books in 2016 and I am a professionally rated disc golf player.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have extensive Not for Profit work under my belt, serving on numerous boards and being a dedicated volunteer all throughout my life.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have been ordained as a reverend through the Alliance of Divine Love.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI am happily married with two kids who are 6 years old and 18 months old\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few other things I think are worth mentioning about the Work With Meaning Patreon Page and the webcasts videos I will create:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you are a new Patron to my site and it is after the launch of my first video, I encourage you to watch the videos from the beginning and follow them as a series. I have intentionally created an order of how I am delivering the content and you will get more out of each video if you have already seen and processed the proceeding videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlease, Please, Please do not take it personally if you reach out to me via email or social media and you do not hear back from me.  I am practicing what I preach - drawing boundaries is critical for all of us and sacrifice is important during busy times.  So, I am intentionally not returning these types of messages and or responding to social media posts to focus my energy on content delivery and creating powerful videos for you to watch.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFollowing a business principle from the 60s called K.I.S.S. (keep it stupid simple), I plan to create very simple videos which will not have special effects, many graphics or other bells and whistles.  I realize and acknowledge my videos are amateur.  My plan is too not be concerned about making the videos perfect and instead stay focused on delivering powerful content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe content will be useful for anybody that is over the age of 13 and possibly those younger who happen to have extreme gifts of intelligence. \u00a0The concepts I will cover are not rocket science, while at the same time will make a huge difference in your experience on Earth regardless of what stage you are at in your life/work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e I highly encourage you to buy a notebook where you can track the things you learn in each of my videos.  I will offer important take a ways and activities that you can do on your own to accelerate your learning.  As with most things in life, the more you put into it the more you will get out of it. \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe rewards I am offering are embedded in the videos that you are watching and I am committed to keeping my price at the rock bottom price of $10/month.  For me to hit my revenue goals and to launch the redeveloped \u003ca href=\"http://www.workwithmeaning.com/\"\u003ewww.workwithmeaning.com\u003c/a\u003e website I envision over 1000 Patrons following me here on Patreon for at least two years, so please spread the word to your network.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor more information about my business and services we offer, please visit my Work With Meaning website.\u00a0 We soon will be offering specialized retreats for individuals and businesses in Black Mountain, North Carolina.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am truly grateful for your engagement and presence!\u00a0 Regardless of whether you follow me for an entire two years or you come and go, please stay focused on manifesting Love, Learning and Laughter throughout your life\u0027s work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your Support!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRyan Pickens\u003cbr\u003e"
