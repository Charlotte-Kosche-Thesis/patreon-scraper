    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eMaking records in the modern age is a thrilling proposition. Never before have we had access to so many amazing tools to create with, as well as delivery systems to get new music to the listeners instantly. With modern music fans possessing such broad musical tastes, and instant access to their favorite material, creating engaging music has never been more important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all these amazing tools, many artists are split between working with a more traditional Producer/Engineer in the studio, or just learning to do it themselves. While there are advantages to both approaches, I believe that making music in a vacuum is not where most great music comes from, and that learning from those with experience can make a very long journey much more successful and enjoyable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe goal of this Patreon is to facilitate the creation of high quality recorded music, whether it be in the studio or the bedroom.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Colin Christian (also known as Wires \u0026amp; Noise). I am a life-long musician and, for the last 12 years, have dedicated my life to the art of making records. More specifically, helping bands and artists make the best records they can, in whatever ways they deem necessary.\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I have operated a number of small, self-financed recording studios as well as freelancing at various commercial studios in Northern Nevada \u0026amp; California. I am currently the head engineer of The Sound Saloon in Reno, Nevada. I have also spent my fair share of time working in bedrooms, garages, warehouses, and other assorted spaces, learning how to make my own records and teaching others to do the same by sharing my experience and knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this new music world, along with all the new tools and options for content delivery, we have run in to a few economic issue: \u003cbr\u003eStudios and studio time are expensive. \u003cbr\u003eFinding time to consult, pro-bono, with budding artist/engineers can be difficult\u003cbr\u003eThe weight of funding albums falls on the bands now more than ever.\u003cbr\u003eThe general public no longer buys music as they once did.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s what we\u0027re doing-\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e Artists/Bands\u003c/strong\u003e - Interested in working with me at The Sound Saloon (or elsewhere)? You can\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0purchase \"Studio Blocks\" on a monthly basis to help fund your project over time, instead of trying to come up with large deposits/payments. Find the monthly rate that works for you, and when you\u0027ve accrued the appropriate number of Blocks, you can schedule your Recording/Mix sessions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eArtists/Engineers\u003c/strong\u003e - Need help with your ongoing project? Whether it be designing your own recording space, recording or mixing records for yourself or others, I would be happy to help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e Simply choose the level of consultation you feel you will need, sign up or the monthly fee, and I\u0027m all yours. \u003cem\u003eIf you\u0027re not sure how much help you\u0027ll need, contact me directly and we can discuss your situation.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Fans/Patrons -\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Whether you are a fan, a musician/engineer yourself, or you simply want to help keep music, recording studios, and studio culture, alive, then I could always use your help. Your monthly contribution will go a long way to help insure the health and longevity of both The Sound Saloon as a place for musicians to gather and create, and to my own ability to work with musicians in all capacities. Over time I will be creating live in-studio streams and videos, exclusive content and early access to new releases from the artists I work with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf there are enough contributions in this form, I will offer free recording time to a band/artist\u00a0\u003cem\u003ewhen there is down time at the studio.\u003c/em\u003e (all contributing Patrons will be allowed to nominate artists and vote for who is selected)\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eIs there a band or artist you\u0027d like to help?\u003c/strong\u003e Choose a monthly plan to purchase \"Studio Blocks\" that will go towards helping them complete their project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully all of these ideas combined can help foster a more productive and communal music scene and facilitate a lot more great art.
