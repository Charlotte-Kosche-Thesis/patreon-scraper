Help take The Wampa\u0027s Lair Podcast to the next level!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past 5 years, The Wampa\u0027s Lair Podcast has provided Star Wars fans from the far reaches of Tatoonie to the inner rim of Coruscant, a fun and engaging show where we have delved deep into the Star Wars universe!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://share-fastly.picmonkey.com/prod/photo_posts/g0G72kt7JXW_14150667.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Wampa\u0027s Lair Podcast was conceived when Karl LaClair and Jason Hunt first met at Star Wars Fan Days in October of 2011. Their immediate camaraderie and passion for Star Wars led them to creating a fun show with the simple intention of talking about anything and everything Star Wars on a weekly basis. And that is exactly what the show has done consistently over the past many years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile there are a great number of Star Wars podcasts out there, what sets The Wampa\u0027s Lair apart is its insistence of looking a bit deeper into the saga. Rather than only focusing on the news, The Wampa\u0027s Lair provides regular in-depth discussions surrounding the characters, themes, mythology, psychology, and spirituality contained within this epic saga. The Wampa\u0027s Lair is also dedicated to engaging all the amazing listeners through fun online polls and matchups as well as regularly fun Top 5 Episodes where they explore some of their favorite aspects of the films and tv shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast will continue, and always will be free. However, creating a regular weekly show is both taxing on time and resources. While Karl and Jason are both busy with full-time jobs, they wish to create a better show with improved sound and recording equipment which is where we turn to YOU!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcrj8d0o0M1r8pxv5o3_500.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis time we\u0027ll do it TOGETHER!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal with Patreon is to offset the many costs of producing a higher quality show by putting your investment right back into the show! We plan to upgrade our audio quality with your support as well as provide more regular contests and give-aways to make for an even more fun and engaging show! And of course, our patrons will be rewarded with bonus episodes, opportunities to be on the show, and for online hangouts with the hosts!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe cannot thank you enough for your support of the show and we certainly appreciate any further support you can provide through your patronage here! And as always, May the Force be with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
