I\u0027m a Youtuber, with a channel name that\u0027s a representation of me and the life I endure on a daily basis. At birth I was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, a neurological disorder that fails to send messages from the brain to my limbs, particularly my legs. Anyway, long story short, I\u0027m wheelchair bound for life. More on that after a few paragraphs on my Youtube channel.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout The Channel:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWheelie Goood showcases a variety of interests from Apple tech tutorials to unboxings, as well as lifestyle vlogs, and Let\u0027s Plays. Apple is featured quite a lot on the channel as I troubleshoot common problems with MacOS and iOS.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy unboxing videos consists of reviews of pop culture goodies to collaborative taste tests. I share my honest opinion on the box contents and its value. Unboxing for me is an experience. It offers an element of surprise and there\u0027s nothing more exciting to me than sharing the experience with you, \u003cstrong\u003ey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eou never know what\u0027s in the box.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m an avid gamer, I love gaming, the art, the aesthetics, the storyline, it can be so immersive. As of right now I only have games from Naughty Dog available to watch in my portfolio, but I\u0027m so eager to explore and delve deeper into gaming in the future. The point I\u0027m trying to make: there\u0027s something for everyone on Wheelie Goood and I\u0027m here to put a smile on your face. \u00a0As a patron, you will be rewarded with merch from my Teespring store, which makes up a few of the perks on this page, along with other awesome rewards you\u0027ll enjoy!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWait!\u00a0There\u2019s more,\u00a0I\u0027m also offering my skills in tech troubleshooting and as an editor in some of the higher priced tiers. \u003cstrong\u003eFeel free to specify your preferences for merch, tech support, and post production briefing.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere YOUR money will go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I\u0027m wheelchair bound, I need a Youtube setup that\u0027s not only practical but simple and unfussy - shoot and go. Your money will go towards updating my current setup, making it as stress free as possible, allowing me to continue uploading content you\u2019ll enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may already know, I\u0027m currently in the process of funding for a replacement wheelchair. The long term goal of this page is to raise money for a new wheelchair. Your \u00a0pledge will get me one step closer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look around. I look forward to welcoming you to my exclusive community. The only place you\u2019ll have access to awesome perks and bonus never before seen content!\u003cbr\u003e"

The truth is I\u0027ve been using Tom\u0027s video camera to record all my videos. Tom (channel co-host) is going to be recording his own series of videos for his channel in the near future, which means I don\u0027t have a practical camera to record my videos with. My Youtube setup is very simple, one camera and a mic, that being said I prefer my setup to be easily accessible, and offers me full control over my content. After doing extensive research, I\u0027ve got my heart set on the \u003cstrong\u003eCanon SL2 (200D) \u003c/strong\u003ewith a \u003cstrong\u003eRode external mic.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s practical and compact, exactly what I need to continue to produce content you\u0027ll enjoy. I\u0027ve got so many content ideas I\u0027m eager to explore, and this setup is the perfect way for me to do just that! An external mic means I don\u0027t have to worry about audio desynchronising, because it\u0027s all on one track. I often have to take my time in post production when I\u0027m recording with the Yeti mic, the audio track is separate from the video feed, this causes a delay and a lack of consistency.\u00a0I only want to present quality videos that you\u0027ll enjoy and having this equipment will make my life so much easier! \u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/dyt8jt.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/14m5d7c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/104mi5z.jpg\"\u003e",
