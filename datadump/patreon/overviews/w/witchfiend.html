    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my\nPatreon Page. My name is Witchfiend and I specialise in turning cute girls into\nother species, especially ones that don\u0027t get enough love in the transformation\ncommunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can find the\nmajority of my finished work on Furaffinity and Pixiv, but by donating monthly\nhere you will be able to see my works in progress and the sketches of TF ideas\nwhich may one day become a finished piece. You can see these for as little as $1\na month.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut that\u0027s not all\nyou can do here. By joining the $3 and $9 tiers you can help influence what art\nI produce through monthly community commissions. The size of these community\ncommissions will depend on how much money has been raised in that month.\u003cbr\u003e\n---\u003cbr\u003e\nHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Every month I\u0027ll be\n     suggesting a theme, and people in the $9 tier can send in their suggestion (via our new handy google form) telling me their suggestion for a picture\n     relating to the theme. People have 5 days from the announcement of the\n     theme to send in their suggestion.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;--Suggestions\nfollow all the regulations of what I will and will not do for commission work.\nIf your suggestion is rejected you will have the chance to put in a new one.\nAll patrons are limited to one suggestion per month--\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. These suggestions will then\n     be compiled into a poll and people in the $3 and $9 tiers will be able to\n     vote on what will be the community commission for that month. The results\n     of this poll will be collected 7 days after the poll is released at 8pm\n     GMT\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3.I will then produce a\n     commission in following couple of weeks. The size of the final product will depend on the monthly total (i.e.a 1 part sequence at $40+, a 2 part sequence at $80, a 3 part sequence at $100). Updates of it will appear here on\n     Patreon and once completed it will appear here on Patreon one week before\n     it makes it debut on FA!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAuthor\u0027s Notes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis is a brand new system\n     for me, and it may have a few teething issues at the start. My hope is to\n     get it running smoothly in the first few months.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ll do my best to deliver\n     the finished picture, but in case of any delays I\u0027ll be posting alerts on\n     here. I certainly don\u0027t want to build up a backlog of work and I also\n     don\u0027t want it to delay other commissions and projects.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf I find the system gets\n     abused I may be forced to make drastic changes. This is ofc the worst case\n     scenario.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis page will\ncontinue to be updated over time. Thank you guys for supporting me. I hope\nyou\u0027ll enjoy the updates that are to come.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
