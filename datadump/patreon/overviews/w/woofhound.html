As a patron, you will have early access to my work and have access to my essays and pictures of my artistic creations, many designed just for patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sat one evening chatting with my friend Gavin Hurley catching up on old times. He\u0027s about 20 years younger than I am. He majored in computer sciences in college, so we had a lot in common. As I was sharing pieces of my life story, he commented on how many times I found myself involved with the very pivotal events which were defining the era that we were in. the\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_love\"\u003e\u00a0free love 60\u0027s 70\u0027s and 80\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_the_United_States\"\u003e AIDS crisis\u003c/a\u003e, the dawning of the\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age\"\u003e\u00a0Computer Age\u003c/a\u003e, The\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative\"\u003e \"Star Wars\" US missile defense system\u003c/a\u003e, and the boom and bust of the\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble\"\u003e\u00a0dot-com era\u003c/a\u003e. I remembered that I\u0027d begun an autobiography several years before, and had somehow put it aside as just an act of vanity. When I looked at it again, I realized Gavin was right. Maybe there was something worth being said here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eIf you are offended by frank portrayal of a gay person\u0027s life and times, you will probably be shocked by my writing\u003c/span\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebut If you\u0027ve ever wondered what one person\u0027s life might be like, growing up with an angry alcoholic father, a dysfunctional family, realizing that you\u0027re gay, having your first sexual experiences, finding your first love, experimenting with drugs and all the things that make us human, become a Patron and read on.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing late in the year 2000. So many troubling things were happening in my life at that time. My boyfriend told me that I should write things down. He was afraid that I would forget about the tough resolutions I\u0027d made on one day when faced with the emotional issues of the next. I agreed with him, and as the need to write grew, I found that writing helped me move on. When I first started, I was sure I was going to write about recent events, but when I began to put the first words down, I somehow knew I had to start from the beginning; from my earliest memories. As the words began to flow I felt such a feeling of cathartic relief. I knew it might take years to get to the things that happened during 2000, but once I began there was no turning back. The first 14 chapters became reality during 2000 and 2001. Life issues took precedence for a few years, and it wasn\u0027t until 2003 that I started writing again. I have written close to forty chapters just to get to the year 2000 and with the help of you, my patrons, I will reward you with many many more essays on topics that you will help decide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe early chapters will be open to the public. As we get deeper into things, only Patrons will be able to read new works. This will become an interactive journey for you my Patrons and readers. This life that has been unfolding for sixty years now will continue to grow, blossom and expand.\u003cbr\u003e"
