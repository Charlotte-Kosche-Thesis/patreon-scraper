Last summer I visited a hospital that treats a variety of mental hardships, in particular, PTSD. I focused with the military unit of the hospital. My objective was to interview some of the patients that were experiencing PTSD due to experiences at war. All the stories were emotional and very intriguing but there was one in particular I really connected with. It came from an ex-navy seal. He was seeking treatment from a head injury resulting from a bombing attack. This attack was his story that I connected with the most. He told it with so much passion and emotion that I knew that I wanted to partner with him to create illustrated short stories based off his real life experiences in war. Currently we have partnered up to create these stories. Our first writing project is called \u0027TRAPPED\u0027. With some support from you we can successfully create and publish these stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you appreciate our work and would like to support us, $1 a month on Patreon is the best way.
