For it is through reading a writer grows. And I\u0027ve read a lot. My head is always full of ideas and thoughts. Ideas I can use to help pen you a story if you would like. I\u0027m often open for commission. But there are other ways you can get into a story. Pledging comes with benefits and I\u0027m no exception to that rule. For each milestone of pledges I reach, I will be opening regular free commission slots, plus discounted commissions for regular supporters."
