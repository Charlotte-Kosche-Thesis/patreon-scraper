We\u0027ve had numerous writers and contributors come in and out over the years, but what has prevailed is a distinct voice in the Cleveland sports media landscape. Across multiple platforms including podcasting, video, and of course the written word, WFNY has maintained a consistent standard in a noisy sports opinion world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site is basically a volunteer operation. Nobody has ever had WFNY as their full-time job. Nobody has ever been able to count on WFNY to be as beneficial to their financial world as they would a pizza delivery job. That\u0027s not us complaining as much as it is explaining the reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike NPR or PBS, WFNY is pretty much a non-profit that relies on readers, listeners, and watchers for support. This Patreon page has become a really great way for WFNY to keep the lights on and continue to pay for hosting, a little bit of technical support, some occasional graphic design, and have a little bit left over to give some money back to the people who create the content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you appreciate an independent voice in the Cleveland sports scene that gives away its content for free, please consider supporting our mission to keep doing that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
