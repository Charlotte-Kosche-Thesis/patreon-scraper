    "summary": "First of all, thank you for even stopping by..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe name \u0027We\u0027re Not Wizards\u0027 came about after Richard confessed at work that he was going to a BoardGame Club (The Wonderful DWARF) on Friday nights. \u003cbr\u003eAfter several weeks of being continually asked if he was fighting dragons with spells and had a pointy hat and a staff, he proclaimed in a loud voice that they never played Dungeons and Dragons and he played many games but was NOT A WIZARD. \u003cbr\u003eFor some reason that planted a seed that culminated in him and Colin recording their first ever podcast in February 2016. \u003cbr\u003eNow over a year on, with too many episodes done for it to be claimed to be an accident, the show comes in a couple of different formats.\u003cbr\u003eColin and Richard have their own episodes where they talk about games they\u0027ve been playing. Games they would like to play and Kickstarters they noticed that might be fun. \u003cbr\u003eThen there is Work in Progress, where they interview people from the industry about their involvement in the hobby, and any current projects they have running. \u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve had some amazing guests on so far and it looks like 2017 will be just as great. \u003cbr\u003eFriends of the show invites on people that they know, that love all things table top to have a chat about. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s all wrapped up in nonsense and tangents and Richard trying to be funny and rolling a Nat 1. \u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to hear some of the episodes then please check out our website \u003ca href=\"http://www.werenotwizards.com\"\u003ewww.werenotwizards.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would kind of like to do a bit more, and putting on the show costs money, and games cost money and we would like to get some better equipment. Most of all, we would love to be able to travel to some of the events and cover them officially. Which is why we\u0027ve pitched our tent here to see if any adventurers would like to join us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything that we get will go on making more We\u0027re Not Wizards episodes, making it grow and reach more people. We would be delighted if you would join us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, that we are many things but We\u0027re Not Wizards.."
