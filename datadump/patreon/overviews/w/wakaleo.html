    "summary": "Hey I\u0027m Adam!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWAKALEO stems from a passion and love of animals. Both domestic and wild. With a background in wildlife \u0026amp; television I started this channel to highlight unique species, animal relationships and also the individuals and groups who have made a pledge to assist animals in their own lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether it is spending some time with the much maligned bats, a trip to visit tree kangaroos in a tropical rainforest or filming the challenges facing pets with disabilities, \u00a0I\u0027m committed to producing interesting animal content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the style of content I produce it can take anywhere from 2 days to over a month to put together a video. The easiest is raw footage where I will film natural behaviours and leave the editing to simple cuts. This can be fascinating footage if I capture something unique. I also create short docu like features which include people working in the field, voice overs, graphics, and if following a journey, could be filmed over several weeks or months. When it comes to what I put together, I go with my intuition.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a passion project. As a qualified shooter/producer there is a lot more money to be made as a freelancer doing tv gigs, corporates \u0026amp; weddings however that is not my interest and neither is working for an animal TV program as I\u0027ve done in the past. \u00a0I currently see the format as restrictive. The internet allows me to give others a voice who otherwise would not have the capacity to hire a film or TV crew.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the general cost of living my biggest expense is travel costs \u0026amp; upgrading equipment (a new lens for example can set you back a few grand). \u00a0That said, for now I am surviving.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interesting in supporting the WAKALEO ANIMAL CHANNEL I would be incredibly thankful and inspired to create more content than ever before! In the future I would love to use WAKALEO to help fund important conservation and animal welfare projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
