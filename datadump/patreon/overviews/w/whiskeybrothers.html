     "about": "The Whiskey Brothers is a weekly podcast available via RSS feed, by visiting iTunes, or by downloading the Android application, and, like the rest of the world, they are also on Facebook and Twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Whiskey Brothers... Rob Mungle, Slade Ham, and Sam Demaris.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s simply nothing to compare it to. In a comedy scene full of rehashed premises, tired punchlines, and a monotonous point of view, The Whiskey Brothers crash through the gate like a S.W.A.T. team, bringing fresh ideas and killer writing to an industry that\u2019s starving for it. With a combined fifty years of stage time between the four of them, they developed in the same scene that spawned Bill Hicks, Sam Kinison, and the original Outlaw Comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing is safe, sacred, or untouched. Where other comedy ensembles automatically pull the emergency brake, The Whiskey Brothers slam down on the accelerator. And if a group of Southern comics drinking whiskey sounds like something that might have a \u201ccountry\u201d slant, you couldn\u2019t be more wrong. It\u2019s more of the \u201cshot of Jameson in the back of a rock club\u201d sort of thing. It\u2019s the eighties outside CBGB. It\u2019s a been-there-done-that attitude. Sit back and shut up and enjoy it - these guys crush audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd they\u2019re ripping through the 18-40 year old demographic with a sledgehammer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s dirty. The cuss, they drink, and they start where other comedians draw the line\u2026 and it works every single time. They come at topics from four different angles, each one of them a headlining comedian with a unique point of view, and then they rip them to shreds.",
