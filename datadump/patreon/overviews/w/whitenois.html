    "summary": "White Noise is the sound you hear until something real happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is an awkward comedy about conversations people have trouble discussing because sometimes it gets a little too personal. It is a comedy on racial commentary \u2013 an effort to dissect the micro and macro nuance of racism that exists within Canada, particularly between Indigenous and non-Indigenous folks. \u201cThrough comedy, I hope to explore the layered racism that exist within ourselves and to witness it in others\u201d. The intention is not to hit any one person or peoples over the head, rather, to make room for growth while having a good time while doing it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on this project is a massive honour and I am highly appreciative of your initiative to make the world a little less racist and a lot more fun."
