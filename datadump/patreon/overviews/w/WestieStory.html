    "summary": "Johan Toivo here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the official Westie Story Patreon! Here you can read the full chapters of Westie Story as they\u0027re released. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may be wondering what this is all about? Let me explain...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine yourself and hundreds of friends from around the world taking over a hotel for a weekend. Imagine dancing past dawn, partying in hotel rooms, hanging out in lobbies and hallways and stairwells through the wee hours of the night. Now imagine a dance that anyone can learn, a language for communicating with a partner to create a spontaneous and shared interpretation of a song.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if I told you that there exists a largely unknown niche community that spans the globe. Tight knit and connected through technology, its members meet weekly in local branches, and a core group gathers regularly at large scale weekend events. Even the most fringe individuals watch videos of the community\u2019s idols online, and a global competitive ranking system sanctioned by the World Swing Dance Council establishes a social structure based largely on skill. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the West Coast Swing dancers. An unlikely group of engineers and programmers, entrepreneurs and therapists, regular people like you and I from all walks of life, tied together across the globe by a shared, often near-fanatical passion for the dance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is their story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact it\u0027s an epic love story about pursuing dreams, knowing yourself and finding your happiness. It spans years and crosses continents.\u00a0My deep and sincere hope for Westie Story is that you would\u00a0\u003cem\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in your bones how connected our world is--that there\u2019s so much mystery and wonder in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWest Coast Swing has an amazing global community which has affected my life in immensely positive ways. My dream is to share this dance I love with others through this story, with the long term goal of making it into a movie to reach an even wider audience. This is in the works: but the first step is to get the story written. I\u0027m using this method of publishing through Patreon to help fund my work, and because in all honesty, it\u0027s a huge project and I need some motivation to keep at it till the end.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m immensely\u00a0excited to embark on this journey with you all!! Please check out my various Patron reward tiers and consider supporting the project. The more this project is financed the more I can have time to work on it! Pledges are done per month, so your account will not be charged till the beginning of the next month. My goal is to get 30+ Patrons for the Chapter 1 launch. Till then, I\u0027m posting various behind-the-scenes goodies and pre-releases in the Patron feed. My $10+ tier involves some collaboration on the story, which I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll have some fun with. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, back to the writing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohan\u003cbr\u003e"
