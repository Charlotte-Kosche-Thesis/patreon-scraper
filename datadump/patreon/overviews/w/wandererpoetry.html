    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWe believe in poetry.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We also believe that the people who do the work of writing poetry deserve to be paid for the emotional and intellectual labor of doing so. We \u003cem\u003ealso \u003c/em\u003ebelieve that there are many people in the creative writing community\u2014authors, editors, and readers alike\u2014feel just like we do, but aren\u0027t able to make that happen as individuals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePoetry is a communal art\u003c/strong\u003e, and what \u003cem\u003eThe Wanderer\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0seeks to accomplish upon launching this year is to create a community that supports its poets. We launched in April 2016 as part of \u003cem\u003eHarlot Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, with the idea of paying our poets $25 upon publication and giving them a platform on a large, intersectional feminist website. \u003cem\u003eHarlot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is changing formats and \u003cem\u003eThe Wanderer\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is setting out on its own. We\u0027re still paying our poets, we just think we can do better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is a weekly Patreon\u00a0campaign\u003c/strong\u003e, but supporting it is not a prerequisite for enjoying and supporting the work that goes up on \u003cem\u003eThe Wanderer \u003c/em\u003eevery week. \u00a0The money this campaign makes will go directly to the week\u0027s featured poet, and, if this project grows enough, might provide a small stipend for our contributing editors and art director, who are currently working on a volunteer basis. Our team right now consists of founding editor Colette Arrand, contributing editors Ginger Ko and Sara June Woods, art director Sarah Schmitt, and social media editor A.A. Balaskovits. Our poets are diverse and incredibly talented\u2014we\u0027re proud to publish their work and thrilled to support it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur goals are as follows:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$25:\u003c/strong\u003e Our featured poet is paid $25 upon publication.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$50:\u003c/strong\u003e Our featured poet is paid $50 upon publication.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$75:\u003c/strong\u003e Our editors (Sara, Ginger, Sarah, and A.A.) will receive a monthly honorarium for their work.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$100:\u003c/strong\u003e Our featured poet is paid $75 upon publication.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Wanderer\u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand we look forward to seeing you soon.\u003cbr\u003e"
