Ever wondered if you could write a mystery, or what it takes to make an epic death scene? Wordplay helps out and tries to take the edge off of starting something new and unknown. Plus, it gets you writing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Nika, an independent author and I created Wordplay to encourage people to write more often. Because... well, it\u2019s fun. Whether for a hobby, a job, a creative outlet or really impressive love letters, the benefits of writing are exponential. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first season, comprised of sixteen episodes, was hosted on Geek \u0026amp; Sundry vlogs channel and ranged from topics like iambic meter and fanfic all the way to writing a good cover letter. It was an amazing project and I missed it too much to go on without it. Luckily, I don\u2019t have to. My notebook of Wordplay topics and content is cracked open once again, and we\u2019re gonna get scribblin\u2019!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thisiswordplay.com/images/splitter.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my goal of two episodes a month, that is a huge time investment (I do the show myself and it takes me about 20 hours to research, write, film and edit each episode) but your support means Wordplay can be my focus, dedicating time and attention to making each episode stellar, like I\u2019ve always wanted it to be. Even more content, examples, and opportunities to cultivate your writing and support others as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019ve been slammed by the dastardly writer\u2019s block, or if you want to break the mold of your current writing, then check out \u003ca href=\"http://thisiswordplay.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ThisIsWordplay.com\u003c/a\u003e and see if it helps get those words flying. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much and remember to support your local writer!
