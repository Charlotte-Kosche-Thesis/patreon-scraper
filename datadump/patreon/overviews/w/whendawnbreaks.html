What if the toxic ideas about \u201clove\u201d that are fed to us by books, movies, and TV shows become so wildly popular that unintended consequences erupt? What happens when people try to emulate the abusive relationships found in the media? What if every woman who consumed these things took their ideas to their logical conclusions? Considering the blockbuster nature of popular media, it wouldn\u2019t be pleasant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic features\u00a0Emily, a fictionalized version of the cartoonist, and her experiences working in the\u003cem\u003e Devorah\u0027s Shield\u003c/em\u003e Women\u0027s Shelter. Emily sees wants to take action against it all, but what can be done to fight back against something so culturally pervasive? Baffled and confused, she turns to her friends and coworkers for guidance. They all put their heads together and decide it isn\u2019t enough to provide shelter at Devorah\u2019s Shield \u2013\npositive action must be taken, starting at the grass roots level. The next generation is at stake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e***\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMany of the characters in the comic are people of color, some are LGBTQ, and most are women. Being a queer woman myself, it\u2019s important to me that these kinds of characters get a bigger space in the comics world \u2013 and that our stories are told.\u003cbr\u003e"
