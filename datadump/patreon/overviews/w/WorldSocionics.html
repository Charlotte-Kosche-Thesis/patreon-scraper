The course is expected to take the form of short, approx. 10 minute videos, building up the theory in terms of IM Elements, Model A and the Quadras, then going on to teaching how to type people. Throughout, Jack Oliver Aaron will present, making use of video examples, and a few diagrams. We\u00a0hope to make videos of a semi-professional quality, using the best video and sound-recording equipment within budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther goals include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReal-life, Face-to-face, Offline Meetups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://meetup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emeetup.com\u003c/a\u003e is a website which allows anyone to schedule and host meetups which are listed publicly in a database searched by millions of people every day. \u003ca href=\"http://meetup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emeetup.com\u003c/a\u003e costs $15/month per set of three groups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will go directly to expenses of hosting chapters for local WSS meetup groups on \u003ca href=\"http://meetup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emeetup.com\u003c/a\u003e that we would not otherwise be able to support from the organizers\u0027 disposable income. The more support we receive, the more meetup groups we will be able to fund directly around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is worthwhile to note that, if we do not receive funding to host groups on \u003ca href=\"http://meetup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emeetup.com\u003c/a\u003e, we will still be holding meetups, in as many locations as we can. They merely will not be hosted on \u003ca href=\"http://meetup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emeetup.com.\u003c/a\u003e Because of the widespread presence of \u003ca href=\"http://meetup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emeetup.com\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s listings, we believe that it is important to maintain a public listing to serve as an invitation to newcomers who have never encountered Socionics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, 12 meetup groups are run with your support in the United Kingdom (London and Birmingham), United States of America (Washington D. C., New York City, Atlanta, Buffalo, Boston, Minneapolis, Seattle and San Francisco), Canada (Montreal) and Spain (Santiago de Compostela).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe order of our given milestones are liable to change depending on the feasibility of each meetup group being successful.
