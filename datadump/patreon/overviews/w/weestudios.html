    "summary": "Hey everybody, WEE Studios is now on Patreon! WEE Studios is the home to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.weepodcast.com/?category=Worst+Episode+Ever\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorst Episode Ever\u003c/a\u003e (A Simpsons Podcast), the comedy podcast\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.weepodcast.com/?category=90s+Percentile\"\u003e90s Percentile\u003c/a\u003e, and commentary track series\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/worstepisodeever\"\u003eSync Points\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorst Episode Ever is\u00a0a podcast for people who love The Simpsons, by people who love The Simpsons, about how much we hate The Simpsons. We\u0027re here trying to find which is THE worst episode ever by watching Simpsons episodes from Seasons 9 and beyond.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn each episode of Worst Episode Ever, we break down newer episodes of The Simpsons scene by scene and discuss why they work (or don\u0027t), especially compared to the classic episodes we grew up with. After each discussion, we rank the episode in our definitive, totally non-binding list of Worst Episodes Ever. After 100+ episodes, we may have lost a little bit of our sanity, but we\u0027ve gained some friends from the Bus Stop down the street....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e90s Percentile is a podcast talking everything 90s, and maybe also everything before and after. With sixty minutes on the clock, we launch an unedited conversation based on randomly selected topics from our listeners. Usually we\u0027re joined by guests, including actors, writers, comedians, bloggers, directors, podcasters, sound engineers, and rock stars/bestselling memoirists... or sometimes we go it alone and struggle not to lose our minds after a long day of work at our day jobs. This podcast doesn\u0027t avoid tangents, it actively leans into them and follows them wherever they may lead, whether it\u0027s obscure parts of Wikipedia, the darkest corners of Internet fanfiction, or sack lunches of bologna sandwiches \u0026amp; Crystal Pepsi.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSync Points is a DVD commentary track series, without the DVDs. Rather than talk about noteworthy films, TV shows, or other interesting videos after the fact, we invite you to join us as we watch them in real time, usually with a guest or two. We\u0027ve talked over the best parts of movies like Home Alone 2, Batman, Superman Returns, and The Simpsons Movie, and have plenty of other selections in store.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs WEE Studios founders and hosts, Dan Mulhall \u0026amp; Jack Picone have been featured as New \u0026amp; Noteworthy podcasters on iTunes in both the Comedy and TV \u0026amp; Film genres, been on CBC national radio (twice!), interviewed by the Village Voice, and featured on The AV Club\u0027s Podmass column.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.weepodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can find more information about us and our shows at our official website\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why a Patreon? We\u0027d do our shows completely pro bono if we could, but we both already work full-time jobs and what started out as a larf has become a serious commitment to content creation for our awesome, imaginative fanbase. (Hey, thanks for listening by the way!) We\u0027d rather not advertise for SquareBox, or Bonobosper Men\u0027s Fitted Mattreses, or Audiblart, so we\u0027re turning to our listeners to help support us and keep the banter flowing from WEE Studios. Please help however you can! Or don\u0027t! The show is still free either way. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese rewards and goals might change at any time. We\u0027ve got a lot of cool ideas that we\u0027d like to try depending on how well this goes and we may add new tiers and goals. If you have a suggestion for a milestone goal or anything else really,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:worstepisodepod@gmail.com\"\u003eemail us\u003c/a\u003e!"
