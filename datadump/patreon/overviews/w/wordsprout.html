Well, just like it sounds, it\u0027s stories, poems, rants, slams, edutainment lectures all performed in front of live audiences! It\u0027s part writing, and part performance, and anything can happen!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://wordsprout.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWord Sprout\u003c/a\u003e produces about 8 monthly shows in Minneapolis. Poetry SlamMN! is one of the most competitively successful poetry slams in the country. We have placed in the Top 10 3 of the last 4 year years at the national competition. Story SlamMN! is a competitive night of Moth-like storytelling and is the longest running story slam in Minnesota. We have other amazing shows like OUTspoken! Queer Open Mic, The New Sh!t Show (all world premiers, all the time) and the Encyclopedia Show (A monthly nerd-core vaudevillian variety show on a topic).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THIS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003epatreon is like a Kickstarter,but it\u2019s not based on one big project. You will make a pledge to support us each month for the work we are creating. You pick your level, your reward, and you can stop at any time. We hope that this will let us do smaller fundraisers each year instead of basing our entire season off of one fundraiser. This will also allow us to know where we are at as we are growing more events to entertain you!

I\u0027d like to use my patreon page to keep up and keep growing the production side of my business, but also to support having the ability (and compensated time) to provide high quality videos and start a local television show! Our next steps involve that, adding two more festivals and bringing poetry into the high schools in the Twin Cities. I dream of doing this full time someday, and have ideas oozing out of my head that I\u0027d like to have time to implement-so your help here can make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like your patronage earmarked for strictly prize money, or other things, feel free to let us know and we will do that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals are to the left, and the rewards are down below.
