Whilst this is (admittedly) a bold statement, we have tried to separate ourselves from other YouTube wrestling Channels, by looking at topics which are not usually covered by most. Be it the topics are normally highly controversial, we extensively look into wrestling\u0027s (normally WWE\u0027s) dark side. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Content Do We Post?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are incidents that (especially) the WWE would never approach on television and neatly dust under the proverbial rug. We are of course talking about our \"Behind the Titantron\" series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CjAGfwPg_jg?list=PLMeSnscTzFClRzv3XEJIy0yj291s-Z6YP\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may already be familiar with the topics that have been covered including but not limited to:-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. The WWE (Formally WWF) Steroid Trial and Controversy in 1992 \u003cbr\u003e2. The Mass Transit Incident\u003cbr\u003e3.\u00a0The WWF Ringboy/Sex Scandal \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e4. The Murder Of Bruiser Brody\u003cbr\u003e5. The Death Of Owen Hart\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e6. The Murder/Suicide Of Chris Benoit\u003cbr\u003e7. The Real Story Of Wrestlemania\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e8. The Plane Ride from Hell\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are however some videos that are not as controversial but information regarding the incident is not very well known, unless it\u0027s researched in depth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are still plenty of upcoming topics to choose from! As a reward, Patreon\u0027s will be able to view the upcoming video BEFORE IT\u0027S RELEASE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSchedule\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, we (both myself and researcher) have doubled our video uploads from having almost three a week to an exhaustive five a week. The schedule includes from Monday to Friday (at 10pm) :-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne Behind The Titantron Episode per week (usually Wednesday\u0027s) and four list videos which range from Top 10\u0027s to Top 15\u0027s, on random facts generating from WWE/ECW \u0026amp; WCW history. Like so:-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-XtETMWgX0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Are We Asking For Support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe assumed the increase in video production would generate a considerable amount of channel revenue, thus supporting the channel long term.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, due to the recent controversy surrounding YouTube and it\u0027s invested advertisers completely pulling out. YouTube creators, such as ourselves have foudn it increasingly difficult to maintain a weekly schedule, as our channel revenue has decreased as much as 60%!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is with the added fact that some videos, those deemed as controversial by YouTube\u0027s narrow and vague guidelines, will automatically be demonetised, hence no revenue will be accounted. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly with your support can we continue covering the costs of the channel, including my researchers weekly salary ($210), hardware and software (Microphone, PC Equipment, Photoshop \u0026amp; Recording Software). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is extremely important to note that this Patreon is not a direct payment for the channel itself to post videos. Videos will still come out as scheduled and none of the regular content will be withheld from those who either can\u0027t, or don\u0027t wish to, contribute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome will be able to give a little, some will be able to give much more. Every dollar counts and goes directly to supporting the production of the channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI personally (Wrestlelamia) want to thank every viewer and subscriber to the channel and anybody who is willing to invest in a growing and (hopefully) unique wrestling channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
