    "summary": "If you made it here, it\u0027s because you like my work. For that, I thank you. If you\u0027re interested in joining me to create even more stories for my new website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wewentfast.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewewentfast.com\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0027d be most grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love story telling and if it involves a set of wheels, I\u0027m in. My typical approach is to produce stories that people didn\u0027t even know they wanted to read. Enthusiasts expect event coverage, results, analysis and a lively debate over something that happened on the track. That\u0027s not me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I write is a bonus, a memorable reprieve in a very noisy world of content.\u00a0If you\u0027ve picked up a copy of Racer X, Dirt Rider, META, Motorcyclist or BIKE magazines lately you\u0027ve read my stuff (byline: Brett Smith).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, my dad handed me a box of photos he took in the 1980s and 1990s when I raced motocross in the Midwest.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wewentfast\"\u003e@wewentfast\u003c/a\u003e became the place to share those memories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurns out, a lot of other people have similar memories of riding and racing and I know more will in future decades. But I want to give my followers and readers more than short anecdotes from my own racing \u0027career\u0027. I want to write about our heroes, past and present, the stories behind the great photographs we used to see in the magazines (and unearth the ones that didn\u0027t) and experiment with ideas I haven\u0027t found a home for yet. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS IT? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe Went Fast\u00a0is for students of the sport. Focusing on history and current personalities, these are evergreen stories that teach, entertain and stick, thoroughly researched nonfiction that will leave a lasting impression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest complaints I hear is that riders don\u0027t have personalities; they\u0027re just sponsor-thanking robots. I want to challenge that. It\u0027s unrealistic to expect every rider to speak with the fire and honesty of Bob Hannah and Damon Bradshaw but there are some interesting athletes on wheels and my goal is to bring them to you by spending real time with them, at and away from the race tracks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn Example: \u003c/strong\u003eI recently\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.wewentfast.com/2018/04/05/chad-reed-against-the-current/\"\u003epublished an article on Chad Reed\u003c/a\u003e and I took a trip down to Tampa to spend a couple of days with him and his wife, to earn their trust to let me into intimate details of their life.\u00a0This type of coverage costs money. Jump in with me and you\u0027re going to like the return. Through small monthly financial contributions (as little as a buck!)\u00a0you have a chance to help me build it. So, in a way, you\u0027ll own a piece of a publication, too and I might even rely on you for ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live in a hyper give-it-to-me-now world but remember: I\u0027m producing content you didn\u0027t even know you wanted. And when you read it, hear it, see it, you\u0027ll wished you\u0027d had it sooner.\u00a0This website is a one-man band. It\u0027s a tall order to expect posts every day. Probably not going to happen for a while. But you won\u0027t want to miss what I will be providing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have some fun projects in the works for 2018. Get on board.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
