    "summary": "Hello and Welcome!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe put our businesses on hold, sold our house and nearly every item we could not fit into our Toyota Corolla and moved aboard a 35 foot Hinterhoeller, Niagara 35 sailboat. She is a solid beaut in all of her 1980\u0027s glam.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are\u00a0Lyndon and Tiffany Walde and we will be celebrating 8 years of marriage this year and have been itching for some adventure for about 7 of those. The travel bug hit us hard after we returned home from a 9 week backpacking trip in 2011. That trip took us though parts of Ireland, the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Greece. Since then, life has taken us over many ups and downs and has currently landed us on a sailboat in the Gulf Islands in the Pacific Northwest - what??!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHaving extremely little/no sailing experience (does sailing a 14 foot boat on a lake count as experience??!!) we moved on board Aug 1st of 2017 with the goal of heading south to warmer waters come the end of September. Our plans took a turn when we were too far behind on outfitting the boat and feeling slightly inadequate in rougher waters that we decided to postpone our trip until this summer, 2018.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a BUMMER of a decision to make - but ultimately, we hope that in this coming season, we will be able to get our floating home to where she needs to be to take us down the coast safely and also improve our knowledge and understanding of sailing and navigating the seas. From the beginning, we have been documenting this adventure through weekly episodes posted on our YouTube channel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrdUSl6lP6Q\u0026amp;list=PLgViqArTsm04v0pE75PfRE-gqIQtT7HJp\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWalde Sailing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon? The quick version is that Patreon is a site that allows you to support content/ people (like us!) that you love by giving a little or a lot financially on a regular basis. Our page is set up for a per episode pledge of virtually any dollar amount that suits you with the option of setting a monthly limit. When you become a patron of ours, you are granted early access to episode releases, exclusive content along with other great rewards! Not to mention you help us with our day-to-day expenses like food, heat (it\u0027s currently winter where we are - brrr), fuel and also with more exciting things like outfitting our boat for the offshore travels we have planned!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are in awe of the support that we have already received from our viewers and we hope that you would now consider becoming part of our Patreon crew!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***We are set up for a per episode pledge and because of that, we commit to putting out no more than 1 pledged episode a week*** Anything more then that is bonus content!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTiffany and Lyndon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
