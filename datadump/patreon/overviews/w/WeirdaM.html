Not an identity I use to hide behind a mask of being someone I\u0027m not, but my reflection of someone who wants to share its thoughts and knowledge, mainly through the passion to wildlife and especially prehistory- I often get into shoes of my OC Weirda Mirrart to do so.\u003cbr\u003eAs a Pokemon maniac, I share all I want to say about my view of the Pokemon World.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTired of reading already?\u003cbr\u003eYou can take a look at my Deviantart page, where I post my art since years, so there\u0027s a lot to look at :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://weirda-s-m-art.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttps://weirda-s-m-art.deviantart.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-- About me and why I made Patreon --\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always loved biology in school, but I understood my real passion is to be an artist. \u003cbr\u003eI wish to realize my dream to earn money from my passion, but with my lack of self confidence and right portfolio it\u0027s nearbly impossible, because in my country we have outdated view on artists- an illustrator and someone who doesn\u0027t draw portaits seems like a mythical being...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over 3 years I\u0027ve been trying to get a job and the best I\u0027ve got is working at McDonald\u0027s which tends to make me exhausted, so even if I have free days, I cannot focus on creating art or handcraft- or my productivity is really low and slow... If you could help, I could switch to part time job and make much more art having better hours and more quality sleep.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m best at intellectual work and I don\u0027t want my talent and personality die under some unfortunate circumstances in the reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will mean to me more than you think! It will really brighten my day even since I wake up and get my first thoughts in my head :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-- as you can see I like lines, except deadlines! -- ;)"
