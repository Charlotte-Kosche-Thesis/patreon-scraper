Unfortunately it can be a bit difficult to keep doing it due to work, and without any definite success in the future sometimes it can be a bit depressing. But then I found Patreon, and it gave me new hope. I have plans to (hopefully) release a few novels, a book of short stories, and a book of poetry. And that\u0027s just my current plans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you can do is to become a patron on my page, and pledge however much you want to keep me going with this. Your pledges would help with the cost of living, and would enable me to get and use newer, better software to write with, and it would also give me the motivation to write again. I enjoy writing, but sometimes I get too bogged down with the fear that it might never go anywhere, but with my patrons at my side I think I can succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoss\u003cbr\u003e"
