    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI became an artist because I want \u003cstrong\u003eto make the world a better place\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThere are so many things that could and should be changed: we become suspicious and don\u0027t trust strangers, we become super fragile due to the high rhythm of life and overflow of information and turn into working robots that occasionally\u00a0allow themselves to enjoy life. I don\u0027t think this is the way a human being should be.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo, I am not going to ride a white horse and fight on the barricades\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIn my opinion, fighting against an idea is not the way to solve any issue. You need to have a new solution in the first place. Destroying something does not create anything. Besides, my own character is not that of a fighter. If I have a fight, even if I am sure I am right, I will be thinking about it over and over again for hours or days and won\u0027t be able to do anything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo, I am not going to change the whole world in an instant\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI mean, I would love to, if only it were possible. But I don\u0027t think it is. I don\u0027t think there is such an option of making a change that will make it \u0027good\u0027 for everybody. To think of it: if you somehow divide all the money equally among all the Earth\u0027s inhabitants, that won\u0027t really make everybody happy. Not only would the rich people get upset but in rural areas with no access to clean water, you might just not be able to spend this money. I might be wrong, however, but the idea of gathering all the money is quite unrealistic in the first place and doesn\u0027t take into account such things as the years of employment, the pension system and simply the absence of reason to take somebody\u0027s property simply because someone else needs it more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo, I am not even rushing to help out people in rural areas I mention in the previous paragraph\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe reason for this is that my own experience, knowledge and social capital are not relevant in those areas. I am 28, I have studied law, I\u0027ve been working in the Russian prosecution office, in a print shop, in a supermarket, in a marketing agency, I am currently giving language lessons, working as a guide and a translator, ..., the list can be continued but the sole point of it is to show that I \u2014 at the current position of my life \u2014 am more useful where I am now and not in the rural areas where people are struggling without food and fresh water. Perhaps, in the future, it will become my reality and then I will put my shoulder to the wheel there. But not now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do I actually then? And what does it have to do with art?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWell, I work around social realities, such as the inequality between men and women, the stigma against psychiatric patients, the exclusion of people of lower social status from cultural life, group identity, the development of\u00a0social withdrawal, or freedom of movement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e More specifically, I work on projects. Some of them fall into the category of \u0027participatory art projects\u0027. They are aimed at engaging many different people, regardless of their age, gender, race, mental health, incomes etc. in the co-creative process. I facilitate frameworks where everyone present is equally welcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThese projects have a social and an artistic aspect. On one side, these projects lead to new meetings and social connections, especially between people belonging to different social statuses. The low threshold is secured by zero cost to participants, by no skill requirements, and by food provision. So, even if someone doesn\u0027t have money and is hungry, even if they don\u0027t feel secure about their own abilities, they are still very welcome. Everyone, literally everyone, has a creative view deep inside; this is what is at the core of everyone\u0027s identity. Discovering and developing it is essential for anyone, I am sure.\u003cbr\u003eThe artistic aspect of these participatory projects is what differentiates them from social work. They exist within the artistic context. For example, in the discourse of legitimization of participatory art, the key question is whether it is in principle possible to produce a work of art with a group of people who are not recognized as artists by the community. The goal is that the participants become aware of what art is (especially contemporary art), and realize what role art and creativity can play in their and other people\u0027s lives.\u003cbr\u003eI also mentioned other projects, which don\u0027t fall into the category of \u0027participatory projects\u0027. They too are aimed at social reality and at raising awareness of certain situations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What brought me to Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI hope to find support here for my ideas and practices.\u00a0Patreon is very simple: you become a patron of the project, \u003cstrong\u003efor a monthly amount of your choosing\u003c/strong\u003e and with your help, I can further work on my projects.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
