    "summary": "A young man strives to become a member of an elite band of\nwarriors and then risks all of his success to prevent a war and bring peace. His\nmentor and trainer, a ruthless, obsessed, bigoted taskmaster allows hate to\nturn him against his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. A young girl with a special ability to see a\ngolden path, and you \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e do not\nwant to piss her off. An ancient vampire, tired of the life and death and\nhunger that drives him on. Zombies fighting as gladiators in the coliseum in\nRome. Demons take over everyone\u2019s favorite teacher.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHi everyone! I\u2019m Will Granger, and these are the characters\nand ideas readers can find in my novels and short stories. Before I explain\nwhere I hope to go with my writing, I want to explain what I plan to provide\nfor my generous patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to electronic files of all of my stories.\nI will give this to all of my patrons at every donation level, even $1 per\nmonth.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eMonthly messages with tips, advice, and\nsuggestions to help patrons become better writers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eDraft chapters, notes, and story ideas for\neverything I am working on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eProofreading of patrons\u2019 writing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eSkype sessions and Google hangouts\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eSigned copies of my books.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eHand-made tokens that I will cut and decorate\nand initial with wood burning tools.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon to gain your support so I can write and create during the summers. As a middle school English teacher, I usually have to teach summer school or take some other job, when I really want to write and carve wood, and make automatons, and do woodburning crafts. Your help will give me the freedom to spend my summer creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlong with my fiction, I have written for newspapers in the\nU.S. and Korea and have taught English and writing courses at the university\nlevel. I have also taught advanced placement English courses at the high school\nlevel and currently teach sixth grade English at a top middle school in Florida.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn short, I know how to help you become a better writer and\nwill use many of my rewards to do just that. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI should also mention what I plan to do thanks to the\ngenerosity of my patrons. More than anything, I plan to write more stories.\nWith a bit of your help, I won\u2019t need to teach Summer School, which will give\nthe time to work on my stories. I also plan to have my website professionally\nproduced and hire an artist to create my covers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI currently have drafts and notes on a third book in my\nAnabar trilogy about a young hero who seeks peace. I have also started a novel\nabout a lawyer, a killer, and a depressed young girl who are linked in\nsurprising ways. Another story, and one I know will be controversial, is a\nstartling response to abortion. I trust other creative people will respect my\nright to present this story my way. I also have ideas for short horror stories about\na zombie tourism area in Florida, an alien plot to take over the world with our\ncell phones, and something dark found in a small patch of woods near my house.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you again for visiting my page. I invite you to join\nme in creating good writing. I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWill\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
