    "summary": "Welcome to the Patreon page for The Wangers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, Christian Ruvalcaba, Cody Hall, and Brian Perez started recording themselves talking and the rest was history. Their hour-ish long podcast, known as \u201cThe Wanger Show\u201d, quickly became and continues to be the #1 podcast (according to us) on the Schmoes Know iTunes feed. Their popularity has skyrocketed but their egos have been kept in check. Well, except for Brian. That guy\u2019s out of control. Together, the guys continued to collaborate on various short films and sketches while remaining the BEST of friends. Maybe not the best of friends. They\u2019re friends. Well, they\u2019re more acquaintances. In fact, they kind of just tolerate each other OKAY SCREW IT THEY\u2019RE THE BEST OF FRIENDS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why are we here? Why did you get asked to partake in another damn Patreon? Well here\u2019s the thing. Recording the show and making stuff together is our favorite thing to do. We love hanging out and being collaborative, and starting a Patreon is a good way of forcing ourselves to keep doing that. Its a ton of fun, and we want YOU to be in on that fun! That\u2019s right! YOU! Random person reading this sentence! We are talking to YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019d like to join us on this adventure and be one of our awesome patrons, then welcome to the party! We want to keep all of you involved as much as possible, no matter what tier you decide to go with. We\u2019re going to be making more shows, more short films, more sketches, and even some awesome surprises along the way, and it wouldn\u2019t be possible without you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page will hopefully allow us to spend more time doing what we love and if you decide to help us accomplish that, then we can\u2019t thank you enough. We\u2019ll try to. You\u2019ll probably get tired of our thanks and appreciation. You might even get so annoyed that you\u2019ll have to awkwardly avoid us at all costs but you will be THANKED, damn it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
