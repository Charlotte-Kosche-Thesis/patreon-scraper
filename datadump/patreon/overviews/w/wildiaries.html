     "description": "It may seem like a lot of money but budget films cost about $2,000 a minute to produce. It may take us two or three months to raise enough funds to finish this first film. Wildlife filming is done on a 60:1 shooting ratio. In other words, we create two and a half hours of video to deliver you one film. While we can sometimes make a film in a day, it often takes two or three days to get all the content ... you know how long you can sit waiting for animals to behave! We generally need more than two people in the field, then when we get back, there is a couple of days of editing, we have to pay for data storage and licence music - it\u0027s very important our musicians get paid. We budget about $7,000 a film. A few hundred supporters is all we probably need to reach this target. Once we have the fun really begins, as we can start a new film with you straight away!",
