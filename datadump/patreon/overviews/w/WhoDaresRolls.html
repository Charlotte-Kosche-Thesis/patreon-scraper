    "summary": "Hey now Greg\u0027s, unbelievably we\u0027ve been producing the podcast and website content for over three years, literally saturating it with our \u003cdel\u003eblood, sweat and tears\u003c/del\u003e... we put a lot into it. We\u0027ve glanced murmurs of interest from the real world slowly at first but there is certainly the blossoms of progress somewhere at the back of the sock drawer and we want to grow with our audience, here\u0027s the rub, it ain\u0027t cheap.\u003cbr\u003eSo far the site hosting, equipment, mics, cables, computers and all the other technical doodads needed to keep a top flight production such as ourselves running has come out of our pockets. With your help we\u0027d like to take the next step, we\u0027d love to do more shows, video reviews and get to more conventions, maybe even create some cool swag. But we are lowly underpaid drones and only have a limited amount of spare change every month, \u00a0keeping up with the latest games is an expense that we have to keep hidden from our significant others better than Batman\u0027s secret identity.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way to not only keep producing the content we put out but even to improve it (OK we could probably busk with a broken harmonica and cover funds to improve our content but you get the idea) we could invest in better equipment and even cover Mike\u0027s tea budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYonder are just some of the milestones we\u0027d love to achieve and with your support we could do this, we\u0027re not looking to change the world but we\u0027d like to do what ever it is that we do, do? better. And maybe, just maybe, be able to create some of the crazy cool content that we really want to produce.\u003cbr\u003eSo the time for remaining as just one of the nameless Gregg masses has passed, step forward into the light let yourself be known... Oh and if you could throw us a dime or two that would be really, really great."
