    "summary": "The Winged Wheel Podcast is a hockey podcast started by three Detroit Red Wings fans: Brad Krysko, Ryan Hana, and Evan Lobsinger. In addition to covering the Red Wings, the three talking heads come together once a week to talk about the NHL and the rest of the hockey world as a whole. It should be noted that the podcast hosts a healthy mix of off-topic tangents, mildly-to-significantly inappropriate banter, and far too much of Brad\u0027s voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast is hosted, supported, and paid for completely by the three hosts, and unfortunately that does not come free. Despite the recent partnership to appear on Wings Nation, all aspects of the podcast are funded by the hosts, which adds up over time (equipment, hosting fees, time spent, etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and every contribution is massively appreciated, as it enables us to continue doing this show as a fun hobby catered toward the incredible fans and listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the podcast on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/wingedwheelpodcast,\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/wingedwheelpodcast,\u003c/a\u003e or as it\u0027s hosted weekly on WingsNation.com."
