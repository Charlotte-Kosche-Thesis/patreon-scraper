    "summary": "In the age of wolfing down TV shows in great, lupine gulps, it makes perfect sense to roll back decades of convention and make the few remaining readers on the planet wait patiently for installments of a novel they could, in all likelihood, read in one leisurely weekend. Or it makes \u003cem\u003eno sense whatsoever\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you google \"Dickens on serialized novels,\" you don\u0027t get much insight from Boz himself, and you also signal to the intelligence community that you\u0027re a colossal nerd. You also see what other questions people ask about Dickens, including \"Why is Charles Dickens so well known?\" The answer, ostensibly, is that he wrote\u00a0\u003cem\u003eOliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e Great Expectations, \u003c/em\u003eyou gigantic know-nothing \u003cem\u003eboob\u003c/em\u003e. But the real answer is that he gave the masses the ability to essentially buy novels\u2014which were terrifically expensive at the time, relatively speaking\u2014on a payment plan. Every week or month, he\u0027d publish another chapter\u2014the man was obsessed with writing 20-chapter-long novels\u2014and for a shilling, you could follow the adventures of David Copperfield and Phillip Pirip or\u2014god help you\u2014the legal machinations of Jarndynce \u0026amp; Jarndyce. This kept Dickens in cash \u003cem\u003ewhile\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0working on a novel, not waiting until \u003cem\u003eafter\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0it was all writ and done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve hit a wall redrafting another novel, so, in the meantime, I started something else, something more immediate to my life as it is now and our country as it is post-election. And because gimmicky structures and playful genre fiction are what gets me out of bed in the morning, I\u0027ve decided to serialize the novel\u2014you know, really force each chapter to live or die on its own and hold every chapter thereafter accountable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, selling people an automobile part-by-part and then sending them the fully-built thing when it\u0027s finished anyway could potentially let me finish the \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0goddamn novel and start the next one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe novel starts the day after the 2016 election and ends\u2014at least for the moment\u2014on Inauguration Day. What\u0027s it about? Well, it\u0027s about us, generally, and how awful we can be, specifically. The left-shoulder devils of our collective conscience, the vampires we are in all sorts of relationships, the werewolves we become when the night stretches out alongside our bar tabs, the Mr. Hydes we try to Jeckyll out of existence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s called \u003cem\u003eWe Are Monsters\u003c/em\u003e. The\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://monsters.atavist.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efirst chapter is right here\u003c/a\u003e."
