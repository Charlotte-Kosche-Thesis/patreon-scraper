We weren\u0027t expecting to be well known or popular. We weren\u0027t expecting to be role models or a voice for Asian Americans in media. We weren\u0027t even expecting to get paid!\u003cbr\u003eA lot has changed since those simple days in the mid-2000s. Most for the better! We\u0027ve created hundreds of videos that have touched millions of peoples\u0027 lives around the world. We\u0027ve worked with countless talented and good-hearted creators. We even made a movie! It\u0027s been an amazing ride that we\u0027re infinitely grateful for.\u003cbr\u003eBut a lot has also changed to make things harder for channels like us to exist. Many creators on the space are just trying to shock and click-bait their way to popularity to make millions of dollars from ads. Big corporations and even celebrities have crossed into the YouTube space, and smaller channels like us have been pushed aside.\u003cbr\u003eThankfully we\u0027ve been able to adapt, and with the support of our fans, we\u0027ve continued to be the channel you know and love, putting quality before quantity, story before sensation, through all these obstacles. And for the most part, we can continue to do this, the same way. But we want to do so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/a25aebe1e112d1f550cf6e04cfeb8757/tumblr_p43y10ByrJ1qein3eo2_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to venture beyond just making a sketch here and there, and maybe one big series/project a year. We want to venture outside telling just our stories from within Wong Fu. We want to venture into the future by bringing up new talent from a new generation. We want to be more than the channel we currently are by adding these new ventures. Add Ventures will lead to Adventures! So we are starting a special division called Wong Fu Ventures!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNEW multi-episodic series! Similar to \"Just Another Nice Guy\" last summer, we want to build out full shows and not just one a year. Imagine a Wong Fu Channel with multiple shows you love, like browsing Netflix!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNEW pilots developed with other creators! We will expand outside of WF and use the money from Patreon to enable other creators voices and ideas. An actor/writer/director who needs help in developing, we can work with them to make their stories come to life!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNEW series on our 2nd channel! We want to dive deeper into \"More Wong Fu\" with content like mini-docs and travel shows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommunity YOUTH OUTREACH PROGRAMS! We will work with local schools to host workshops and events to enable and inspire the youth to pursue the arts. We want to invest in the Future!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDEVELOP NEW TALENT! We will put resources into reaching out and finding rising talent. Whether it\u0027s an actor/vlogger/musician/filmmaker, we know that progress for representation doesn\u0027t end with us. There are so many amazing creators out there and we want to share our platform!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/71e0035b944d602e6f049d6ee28256b6/tumblr_p43y10ByrJ1qein3eo3_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have all these goals! Why can\u0027t we just do them now??\u003cbr\u003eWong Fu already works around the clock JUST to keep the channel going as it has been the past 10 years. One sketch a month, maybe one series a year, a weekly Lunch Break, and that\u0027s it. That\u0027s all we can do with the team, crews, and bills we\u0027re paying. That\u0027s all we can do with the money we\u0027re generating through sporadic brand deals and an unpredictable Adsense payment.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon would allow us to rely less on those revenue streams, and give us more to work with\u00a0so that\u00a0we can take on these new ventures!\u003cbr\u003eIf you have the means to contribute, that\u0027s great; we\u0027d love for you to join our community. And anytime you feel like you want to pause/end your membership, no worries! Everything will help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/a8777230c477cbf1bf6b84c145801c62/tumblr_p43y10ByrJ1qein3eo4_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike all new big ventures that need public support, there are \"shareholders\". But in our case, instead of each contributor possessing a share, they possess \"care\". You care about seeing Wong Fu continue and expand. You care about Wong Fu being a part of your life and other people\u0027s lives. Now we want to show you we care about you by making the best possible content with your contribution. Thank you for your generosity, your confidence, and your care! We won\u0027t let you down!"
