In addition to feature development I take care of most incoming bug reports. In the last years I have spend around 4 hours per week on WeakAuras.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat makes developing bigger features almost impossible. The templates feature was developed while I was between two jobs and had lots of free time. I\u0027d estimate it took around 100 hours to develop, which is basically impossible by investing only a few hours per week. I think I could develop several bigger new features, if I had more time. This Patreon, if succesful, would allow me to do that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m aiming to make this Patreon a monthly payment after reaching the $500 goal, which would allow me to switch to part time work on my main job and easily double or triple the amount of stuff I can get done in WeakAuras. Do note, that I won\u0027t take any money until I reach the $500 dollar \"Part Time\" goal. (No one has to pay me to use my free time on WeakAura. The Patreon is simply to offset the less pay I would get by working part time at my current job.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eClosing thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\nWeakAuras isn\u0027t a one man show. While I\u0027m certainly the most active member of the development team for the last years, the majority of WeakAuras development was done by others. Thus I have been standing on the shoulders of giants and I do plan to share a bit of the money coming in with my fellow developers.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
