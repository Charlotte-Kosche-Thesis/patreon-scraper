What happens when you can\u0027t shake your wanderlust, and your life isn\u0027t quite what you want it to be? What happens when you want more, and you\u0027re in a position to go get it for yourself?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, we\u0027re Kelly and Kari \u2013 besties and colleagues who work on the internet box (we work in digital marketing). On January 1st, 2017 we gave away our cats, put our stuff into storage and became full-time digital nomads on Workation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this experiment is to live as intentionally as possible, optimize our lives and become the best versions of ourselves through our travel experience. Sometimes this is easier said than done, but we bring the realness regardless. And we\u0027ve been making a lot of progress!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, we\u0027ve made it to 10 countries on 4 continents. We\u0027ve lost over 100 pounds, cage dived with sharks, swam in a bio bay, played tejo in Medellin, partied with Steve Forbes in Vegas, almost died in Acapulco...and too many other things to list. We\u0027re strategically attacking our bucket lists, which is one of the most fun aspects of living intentionally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve also been\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://workationing.com/womens-health-fast-co-bustle-oh-workationing-featured-22-outlets-far/\"\u003efeatured in media outlets\u003c/a\u003e ranging from Women\u0027s Health, Fast Company, NBC News, Glamour, Bustle and more. The Huffington Post even named Workationing as one of the up-and-coming podcasts of 2017!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout this journey, we\u0027re documenting our adventures on \u003ca href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-workationing-podcast/id1196572748\"\u003eThe Workationing Podcast\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://workationing.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.
