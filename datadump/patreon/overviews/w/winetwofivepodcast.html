     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Wine Two Five?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWine Two Five is more than just a play on words that may or may not insinuate we drink from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Despite the fact that some of our friends may believe we do just that, we truly do not.  However, we both believe strongly in the following:\u003cbr\u003e1) Wine with lunch? Yes, please.  We do not see a problem with it, and encourage it (in moderation, of course).\u003cbr\u003e2) That whole \u201cFive o\u2019clock somewhere\u201d thing is hooey.  We do not believe that a clock should determine when we pull a cork.  We are all big girls and boys and if we\u2019re having Tapas for lunch at 11 a.m. and there\u2019s Sherry nearby?  Yes, please.  A glass of Chardonnay with chicken salad at noon?  Don\u2019t mind if we do.\u003cbr\u003eDo we believe in getting tanked at lunch and then returning to work in an attempt to be productive?  Absolutely not!  Again, moderation and discerning your situation for imbibing during the day is incumbent on you, but again, not the clock itself.\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, Val \u0026amp; Steph live at either end of Interstate 25 in Colorado.  In order to get together to study, taste or collaborate in person there is about a 2.5-hour drive involved for one or the other.  Hence, Wine Two Five was born.  We affectionately shorten it to W25 or #W25.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Mission Statement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur mission is primarily to entertain our listeners, but also to educate and even empower the consumer with fun and useful information about wine, wine tasting, wine buying, or wine culture.  The world of wine can sometimes be perceived as snobby and intimidating, so we want to help answer those burning wine questions, misconceptions or make sense of current topics.  We strive to take the often touted \u201crules\u201d and help turn them into \u201ctools\u201d the listener can use to further enhance their enjoyment of wine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Vision\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur vision is to provide listeners with a resource for getting facts and having fun with wine.  We aim to help you get out of wine ruts, finding new favorites or entertaining options, highlight products, or spotlight special events or venues across the country, to include educational opportunities, books, or videos.  Most importantly, our vision is that every time you pour a glass and hear that jazzy intro \u0026amp; silky \u201cIt\u2019s not 5 o\u2019clock \u2026 and they don\u2019t care!\u201d you smile, relax and sip your way to a better wine tomorrow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can you get your weekly dose of Wine Two Five love?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribe.
