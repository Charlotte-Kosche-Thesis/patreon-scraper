I\u0027m Randy \"Tex\" Hill and I\u0027ve been producing and hosting the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.westernswingtime.com\"\u003eWestern Swing Time Radio Show\u003c/a\u003e on the air now for over six years. I started in radio back in 1997 on a talk show in Austin, Texas. Since that time I have been honored in the Pacific Northwest Western Swing Hall of Fame; I\u0027ve been named in a list of the \"Top 10 DJ\u0027s\" by the Academy of Western Artists and in 2016 I was named \"DJ Of The Year\" by the Cowtown Society of Western Music out of Ft. Worth, Texas. My love for Western Swing music began when I was a kid on a farm in central Texas where I was raised. My family had a stack of old 78 rpm records that belonged to my grandfather. Gene Autry was in the stack. So was Lefty Frizzell and Bobby Lord. I can\u0027t leave out B.B. King and Smiley Lewis. I eventually went on to learn how to play drums when I was 13 and I played in a Texas Swing band (among many other bands) for years. I still have a band called The\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.oregonvalleyboys.com\"\u003eOregon Valley Boys\u003c/a\u003e. We play western swing. Yep.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYFJm0dpDW4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Western Swing Time Radio Show\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI started the Western Swing Time Radio Show in 2011 on KCKX radio in Woodburn, Oregon. From there, the show was picked up by KMUZ FM community radio in Salem, Oregon - then by KYAC FM community in Mill City, Oregon. Now the show is on a total of 6 stations (both terrestrial and internet) around the world...with more to come. I send a new 53 minute (or so) show out to all of the stations each Monday morning.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003eWhy Do I Do The Show?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI love music and I am particularly in love with Western and Texas swing music. I have a lot of childhood memories wrapped around the music. Western Swing is the State Music of Texas. It\u0027s also a very small niche that few people are promoting on the radio anymore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Else Do You Do?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am one of those people who never get bored and I always have a ton of things going on. When I\u0027m not creating the radio show I publish a bi-monthly regional magazine called, \"Willamette Valley Life Magazine.\" I am also a graphic designer and as I mentioned earlier, I play in a band. Oh yeah, and I also create fine and assemblage art, but I rarely seem to have time to do those these days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003eThank You!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your support as a patron.
