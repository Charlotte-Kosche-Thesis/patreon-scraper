At first I wanted to share the work of women illustrators only because as an aspiring illustrator watching the work of other people and especially women helps me to stay motivated and inspires me a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/6367495453.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIllustration is the main \"theme\" of Women With Pencils\u0027 page, but as weeks passed I felt the need to share more than illustrations, I also wanted to share the work of women embroiderers, photographers, poets, ceramists, fanzine makers... So I decided to create a little space for them on my Instagram Stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I didn\u0027t knew that Women With Pencils would grow so fast, and very soon we reached more than 10.000, 15.000 followers !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince Art is my passion, and after many (many) years of struggle with what I wanted to do of my life, today is the first time ever I feel truly motivated, and I want to do a lot more with Women With Pencils.\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of my dear friend\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/josephine_lilium\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJos\u00e9phine Onteniente\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which is (after being an amazing person and illustrator) now my partner in this adventure, I now know that we could really do something of Women With Pencils.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what future for Women With Pencils ?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFirst, we just opened our\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.womenwithpencils.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, Instagram is a really good and easy way to share the work of artists and we\u0027ll keep posting every day, but we felt the need to have a special space. We want to interview the artists, to share more of their works with more pictures, text, links and/or videos, and first of all we want the website to be about all kinds of women artists and not only illustrators. We would also like to have a little shop corner, with badges, stickers, prints... !\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/221535jyghj.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eOne of our big dream is to create a self-published magazine that people could buy online and receive digitally (PDF) or on real paper, at home.
