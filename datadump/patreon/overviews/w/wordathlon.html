    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Heather and I\u0027m the woman behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thegrantidote.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Grantidote\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn no particular order, I\u0027m a writer, a mum, a wife, an aunt and a friend.  At intersections between these labels and experience-led passions for bettering mental ill-health, cyclical toxic relationships and living with fierce positive intent, I create stories, conversations, poetry and commentary.  I relate hugely to the assertion that \u003cstrong\u003ethe domestic is the political\u003c/strong\u003e and, in one way or the other, all of my work, parenting and adventures relate back to sharing that concept with as much joy, connection, peace and laughter as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWay back before I had kids eighteen years ago, I worked for an American tech company creating comms materials for their UK clients and audiences and, while I bloody loved that job and will be eternally grateful for the people who took a chance on an unqualified young woman with a foul mouth and a gutsy work ethic, tech writing isn\u0027t where I\u0027m at anymore. \u00a0At 42, my forte and passion is hearing and telling women\u0027s stories, including my own, to create change by making sure women\u0027s experiences are taken into priority account when we consider understanding ourselves and each other in how we build communities on and offline. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you distilled down who I am, you\u0027d find at my essence a belief that true stories are essential for creating a good, learning world and, without stories, we can\u0027t make change or\u00a0meaningful\u00a0connections.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Mid-distillation, you\u0027d also find cinnamon swirls, a lot of really good coffee and a cracking view of the west highlands from a really comfy bed but we\u0027re moving into the realms of fantasy now and I\u0027m trying hard to stay on inspirational message so behave yourself. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I want to create more subversive, life-affirming content to send the message about work that centres women\u0027s experiences even farther into the world. \u00a0In doing so, I\u0027ll be able to gather and share more women\u0027s stories and continue creating web spaces and conversations that are not only non-toxic, but also actively creating social empathy and improving visitor\u0027s sense of self, privilege and impact. \u00a0I also want to create content and merchandise to affirm and deepen the bonds of the people already investing time and love into The Grantidote community, often making significant shake-ups in their own identities to speak up about supporting a project that\u0027s come to mean so much to them, as well as me. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePut simply, in a world that often seems crazier than ever before, where progress and reason clash too often with negativity, ignorance, ego and greed, telling women\u0027s stories is a positive intervention asking what we want to be individually and signposting how, collectively, with the slightest of recalibrations, we can make significant changes for a better world. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith support from patrons like yourself, I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more time and positive energy to creating women-centering content, working\u00a0with like-minded folks to amplify the impact of each other\u0027s work through collaboration while building up my own published archive of spoken word and creative prose. \u00a0Patronage means I\u0027ll also be able to work with more people who are held back from sharing their stories and gifts because of shyness, poverty, language barriers, mental ill-health or a lack of belief in their relevance and importance. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the case of The Grantidote, some contributors are super confident in their abilities and need little more than an email address to get their story to me. \u00a0Other contributors get to know the project without the same ease; it\u0027s those contributors I want to be most accessible to, because though \u003cem\u003eevery\u003c/em\u003e story is critical and precious, \u003cstrong\u003estories from people who\u0027re up against life in anyway are the ones I want to especially make sure find a way to work with me that feels good.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0If I can\u0027t do this, the sum of The Grantidote\u0027s parts will not add up to a place where everyone can share in finding and losing themselves in stories. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m grateful for the time you took to read this and for your interest in my work. \u00a0Keep an eye on what I\u0027m up to on Twitter\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/betamother\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@betamother\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/thegrantidote\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@TheGrantidote\u003c/a\u003e, or on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thegrantidote/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e and on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheGrantidote/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0Don\u0027t forget to holler on one of those platforms or here and tell me a bit about you and how what you\u0027re passionate about connects with what I do too. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eH x\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
