I have been drawing ever since I was able to pick up a pencil, and starting writing my own stories a few more years later. Since those faithful days, writing and drawing have been two of my most passionate hobbies.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve discovered my passion for writing when I was six, folding a large wad of plain paper and drawing pictures with a sentence or two alongside. A lot of it was based on \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eCrash Bandicoot\u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, as I was infatuated with his games back then, and I had too much fun with them. It wasn\u0027t until I was 12 that I began to write more seriously, feeling confident in my writing-skills and fell in love with Microsoft Word, and it is a companion to me to this very day. A lot of my writing are fan-fictions based on things I adore, as I usually do this for fun (and sometimes as collaboration stories with other friends\u0027 fan-fictions). Although I do intend in writing an original story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of original stories, I am working on a small personal project called\u00a0\u003cem\u003eInto the Knight\u003c/em\u003e, a story about self-recovery with a woman and her Super-Car, based on personal emotions and my favorite show, Knight Rider. The story was triggered when I was going through a very awful time, and the only way for me to recover from it was to write this. While this is a personal story for myself, I hope one day it will become something in the future. We may never know~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love making new friends, and love to express my emotions through writing and art, cheering people up with my randomness, and encouraging others to embrace their creativity.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e*\uff0a\u273f\u2740 What do you do? \u2740\u273f\uff0a*\u003c/h3\u003eI mostly create fan-art for my own amusement depending on my moods, including Character Designs, Illustrations, Comics, and more. Sometimes I will create my own creations. I also love to write fan-fictions, as well as original stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eCurrent Project:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am incredibly interested in working on a fan-fiction based on the amazing show \u003cem\u003eRick and Morty\u003c/em\u003e. An emotional-turbulent drama between two friends, Rick Sanchez(KR-982) and Sallie Knight (KR-982). You get to witness their friendship from the very day they met, right up to the current moment of their life. When Rick Sanchez vanishes suddenly, Sallie is forced to become the person she never thought she would ever become. Determined to find him, she searches for him, meeting new faces, and many familiar ones too. It is different compared to my usual work, as I wanted something that was deep and emotional. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, this story will be 18+ due to its mature nature, and while chapters will be uploaded to the likes of DeviantART, ArchiveofOurOwn, and Fanfiction, \u003cstrong\u003emature chapters will be exclusively uploaded here\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am also available for Commissions too.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e*\uff0a\u273f\u2740 Why Patreon? \u2740\u273f\uff0a*\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003eNot only have a load of my friends and family encouraged me to start a Patreon, but I have also considered it myself. For a while I have been searching for a place to upload my work to, drawing and writing, particularly those of a NSFW-nature.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, the last few years my confidence as a writer and an artist had been beaten down, and I haven\u0027t been in such a distressing pit before. I\u0027m somewhat struggling to feel motivated enough to keep my passion going, which is heartbreaking as it is what had helped me get through some of the hardest moments of my life. I do not wish for this passion to die, and so Patreon came into light then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have grown more content with drawing/writing mature-related work, commissioned-based and for myself, but I was concerned with where to put it, and who gets to see it. I don\u0027t want to force that sort of work down anyone\u0027s throats, and I wanted to make sure that people saw that kind of content because they \u003cem\u003ewanted\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to. Patreon seemed to be the best option for this problem. Plus, I do want to become more confident in myself again. I want that fiery passion back and wish to improve myself and my work. Improvement means getting newer equipment compared to what I have, and Patreon will certainly be an amazing encouragement. Plus, after uploading my work on the internet for 12 years, I want to reward my watchers, followers, friends and fans for their endless support, their encouraging words and their golden friendships. Never would I have thought I\u0027d be this person who I am today, and its genuinely all thanks to those who have helped me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to support other artists who I greatly admire, and Patreon is the place everyone seems to go. So, here I am!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e*\uff0a\u273f\u2740 Where else can I find you? \u2740\u273f\uff0a*\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wario-girl.deviantart.com/ \" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDEVIANTART\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u00a0[MOST ACTIVE]\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been on this site for 12 years, jumping from different accounts and now I have settled with \u0027Wario-Girl\u0027. The username, which I am \u003cdel\u003einfamously\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0known for, was picked due to my love for the Mario Franchise, mostly towards the Wario Bros, Wario and Waluigi. Originally, I was going to be Waluigi-Girl as he was my most favorite character, but the username on DevianART was taken, and therefore I had decided Wario-Girl, and the rest is history. I have seen this site change so many times, for better and worse, but that does not matter to me much. What matters most is that this site, with its flaws and best quirks, has taught me many lessons, from art, stories, to friendships and socializing to others who share the same interest. I have met the most amazing people on this site, met them personally too, and wish to continue this. I may have been a little inactive on the site recently, mostly due to personal reasons and my current motivation, but I know it will change. Every creator go through it, and I know its a phase that will pass. Feel free to check it out.

I found this website by mistake when I was about 13 after looking at \u003cem\u003eOddworld \u003c/em\u003estories, and fell in love with it. I have found some amazing friends there, inspiration writers and it had also helped me as a writer to work hard on my own. It has been a long time since I\u0027ve used it again, as I had tend to upload my writing on DeviantART, but I do want to use it again, particually for my currently story-planning with the \u003cem\u003eRick and Morty\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Fan-Fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/WarioGirl/profile\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eARCHIVE OF OUR OWN\u003c/a\u003e:\u00a0[HIATUS]\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA friend suggested this website to me ages ago, and I had utterly no idea this beautiful place existed. As you can see, it\u0027s not currently active as I am a terrible person and forgot about it! But also because I wasn\u0027t too sure whether it would be the best platform.
