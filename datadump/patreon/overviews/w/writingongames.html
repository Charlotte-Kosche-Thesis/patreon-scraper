    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m Hamish and welcome to Writing on Games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhit\u0027s this aw aboot then?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting on Games is a YouTube channel I run, on which I upload videos of me talking. Wait, wait, wait, don\u0027t throw your money at the screen just yet - there\u0027s more! These videos take the form of essays that I\u0027ve written going in-depth on game design and narrative, usually over footage of the game being played, sometimes using the footage to illustrate my point. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOccasionally I do reviews, but more often than not I\u0027ll focus on one specific area of a game\u0027s design or narrative and go deep on it; implementing context from other forms of media but also trying to make these ideas as accessible to people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvTGmRedBqQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHmmm, that sounds kind of cool I guess - but why do you want my hard-earned cash you swine?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst off, I don\u0027t expect people\u0027s money, I don\u0027t expect any money at all, I do this because I love it and that\u0027s that. In an ideal world, yes, I would be able to rely purely on ad revenue from YouTube and the world would be just dandy. That\u0027s not the case though, and I\u0027m fine with that!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fact is, however that this area of content creation is niche - thanks to YouTube\u0027s algorithm, it\u0027s hard to get this stuff out there. These videos require a lot of research, time spent analysing the games and writing the scripts, making the music, recording and editing audio, capturing gameplay footage and editing the final product. I\u0027m not complaining about this, far from it - I\u0027d do it regardless of money. What I will say, though, is that as a result of the inevitable slower rate at which the channel has grown, each new subscriber genuinely means so much more to me than they might do with some dude who has 1000000000 subscribers. You guys have genuinely given me such a sense of purpose that I cannot thank you enough - you guys get me out of bed in the morning and allow me to feel like I\u0027m going somewhere with my life. I guess I (perhaps naively) hope that my videos might mean as much to you someday as you mean to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short - the support I\u0027ve received on Patreon significantly affects the amount of time I\u0027m able to spend making these videos. Of course I\u0027m realistic and I\u0027m not expecting anything; YouTube ain\u0027t exactly a steady platform and I am \u003cem\u003ecertainly \u003c/em\u003enot above getting another job\u00a0should things suddenly collapse from under creators. But hey, a buck or two definitely goes a long way in helping me make the videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_yfA94EpeqM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t want to pay, ya dingus?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s totally understandable and also 1000000% fine! Like I say, money is not why I do this and my subscribers mean the world to me whether they financially contribute or not. With that in mind, you will certainly never be judged for enjoying the content for free - I\u0027m just happy you\u0027re watching. Also, if you need to pull out at any time, please don\u0027t feel like you need to justify it to me or whatever. Make sure your financial situation is in order first and don\u0027t worry about me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOK doofus, you\u0027ve convinced me. What do I get in return?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMY ETERNAL GRATITUDE. For real though, a bunch of stuff! Your name in the end scroll of each episode, access to soundtracks/scripts for the episodes (I make all the music myself) or even early access to the episodes themselves! I\u0027m open to ideas regarding things I could do for patrons that wouldn\u0027t exclude people who can\u0027t pay, so lemme know if you\u0027ve got anything in mind. With this I am beholden only to you, and I plan to proceed with the channel as such.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hcAfHlIlY8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou know what? You\u0027re alright. How often will I be paying you though?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs often as you like! This is a per-creation Patreon because should anything happen that hinders my ability to produce content, it would feel wrong to receive money for that. Given the time it takes to create these things, it\u0027s extremely rare that I\u0027ll be able to produce over two videos a month. On the off-chance that I can produce more than that, however, don\u0027t worry - \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027ll only be charged for max two videos a month. \u003c/strong\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to be charged for two videos, however, feel free to set a monthly limit on how much you pledge in your settings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be clear, you\u0027re only being charged for normal, full-blown video essays; never any thank you videos or vlogs or whatever (sounds obvious but I\u0027m just making it 100% clear). I\u0027m just thankful for any support, so I\u0027m certainly not going to risk that by betraying your trust in any way. Any changes will be relayed to you in good time so you can make any changes you need to your funding plan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill you be receiving any supplementary income/any disclosure-y type stuff?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I receive a small portion of ad revenue every month. It\u0027s a fraction of the Patreon, however, which will always be the main source of the channel\u0027s income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Sponsored content ain\u0027t really my thing because I don\u0027t know how that could possibly link in with the tone of the channel. On the off-chance I ever do receive money to make a video, however, I\u0027ll be sure to be upfront with you about it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Occasionally I receive press copies of games, meaning I don\u0027t have to pay for them. Again, you\u0027ll always be informed of that in any videos I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Like I talked about previously, I believe Patreon is 100% built on trust and transparency between creators and patrons. You guys have trusted me with your support\u2014I wouldn\u0027t dream of betraying that. Any changes to anything to do with the Patreon or the channel will be run past you guys first and you have my word on that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ktW7QIrw1GE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhew...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo there you have it - my case for why I\u0027m on Patreon. I hope I\u0027ve answered any questions you have but if you have anything else you want to know before you get involved, feel free to get in touch! I\u0027m easily reached on Twitter @writingongames or leave a YouTube comment or whatever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot emphasise this enough - you people give me the energy to do this regardless of whether you pay or not. You have given me a sense of purpose that I haven\u0027t felt in a long time. I can only hope my videos someday mean as much to you - if you can\u0027t pay, that\u0027s 1000% cool.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHamish\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting on Games\u003cbr\u003e"
