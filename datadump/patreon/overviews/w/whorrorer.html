    "summary": "Helloo, folks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for stopping by, reading my rambling, and possibly even considering becoming a supporter of me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Emmy, (also known as Whorrorer,) your local depressed queerdo and compulsive good-deed do\u0027er. You may know me mostly from the Magic: The Gathering community, or maybe you\u0027re one of the few who\u0027ve seen my older writing projects and somehow stuck around. You may even be someone I left an impact on elsewhere in life, as is often my goal, a new reader, or someone who loves when I stream. Giveaways, emotional support, overwhelming kindness, cheerleading, advice, educating, or even just an ear when needed are just a few of my complimentary services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eServices may be the wrong word, really. All my life has been about protecting, helping, and teaching others. It\u0027s even my daily job, for about fourteen hours a day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I am here to convince you to pay me, and I am a terrible saleswoman... Especially when it comes to myself. Hope you\u0027re buckled in, because by the end of this, I bet you\u0027ll be as confused as I was at age 8!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start off, I mostly write. Less than I\u0027d like, because I really do not have much time between an extremely busy work schedule and soul crushingly difficult life. Beyond writing, though, I also do mediocre digital art, and stream various games on Twitch (Magic, PUBG, Hearthstone, and Rimworld among others.) These are all things I am very passionate about, but time is limited when money is so tight, and so I\u0027ve never felt I produced enough content to ask anyone for anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI provide access to all of that content, and myself, for free. No matter how draining it is, or how rarely something is streamed, or posted, it was never in me to ask for monetary support or otherwise. I never felt I created anything worthwhile, nor was I worth the time or effort of anyone. In that regard, just having you read this far through my Patreon means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, though, I was convinced to set this up, to set a new streaming schedule (Saturday nights and Sunday, with some impromptu streams throughout the week,) to update my WordPress and put in effort decorating my Twitch. The encouragement came from people I barely knew - who\u0027d never once met me in person but saw some worth in what I do, what I stand for, and who I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings us here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you may know (or maybe not,) I am going through a major transition and difficult time in my life. I\u0027d say it\u0027s about as challenging as exiting the Infantry and coming out as a woman seven or so years ago, honestly. I am struggling, and monetizing my content creation - or trying to - is less just a dream, and now a simple necessity. While I detailed this far more on my WordPress/Twitter, the simple fact is that my life is crumbling a fair bit with the exit of my partner, whom was with me about eight years. From the crumbling debris though, I am attempting to rise and - ultimately - end up in a better place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention that with help from others, I can in-turn worry less about my own woes, and focus more on helping others. That\u0027s really important to me, as being a good person who is empathetic, kind, and giving is nothing short of my life\u0027s goal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know me all ready, and think I am worth even a few bucks a month, this is the place to do it. If you aren\u0027t sure, I encourage you to wait a week or so, catch one of my (unfortunately video-less,) streams, or read the things I post on my WordPress (listed below) and Twitter before deciding. I will never be upset at those who choose not to contribute - but on the opposite end of the spectrum, if you do, you are doing so much for me that my gratitude will be endless. You\u0027re supporting me doing the things I want, instead of just working multiple jobs and surviving, and to put it simply: \u003cstrong\u003eYou are making my dreams and passions possible to pursue, my life better than it ever has been, and my depression lesser.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I truly hope I am able to earn your support, and if not, that\u0027s all on me. Rest assured any supporter donations will be used for life/content creation costs, providing Patron rewards, and generally in ways that allow me to more easily create content, or for helping others. No luxury needed, here, but if it happens, I\u0027ll be thankful as a rescued honeybee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much again for being here, for being in my life, even if digitally or temporarily, and I am so glad I can be there for anyone who wants me to be, as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s some relevant links for ease of access, too:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mightofamouse.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlog\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/whorrorer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
