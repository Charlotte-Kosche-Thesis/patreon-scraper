    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Jessica! I\u0027m a working mother and a lapsed artist with a degree in Illustration and Graphic Design. I spend most of my free creative time designing invitations and greeting cards or writing fan-fiction. I\u0027m always looking for new techniques to try, having dabbled in painting, drawing, digital illustration, digital design, glass mosaics, stained glass, and now DIY crafts for entertaining.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only thing I\u0027ve never been able to do? Make a living with my art! I won\u0027t bore you with a sob story, but suffice it to say, I missed the boat after college. And then I went into retail. And then I went into office work. And then I went into tax preparation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I looked around and wept because I hadn\u0027t picked up a brush or designed anything in years. So I started trying to remedy the situation, small step by small step. I want to show my little boy that you can pursue your dreams with hard work and determination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMidlife is looming and I am determined to pursue my true love, art and design. I\u0027m starting out easy with my new line of Quirky Cards. Our goal is to design those kinds of weird greeting cards that you can\u0027t find in the stores. My goal is to design at least 2 cards for the following occasions in the next 12 months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eValentine\u0027s Day/Sweetest Day\u003cbr\u003eMother\u0027s Day\u003cbr\u003eFather\u0027s Day\u003cbr\u003eHoliday Seasonal (You know, xmas, winter, yule, etc...)\u003cbr\u003eFriendship\u003cbr\u003eCongratulations\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is about 1 card per month, which may not seem like a lot, but since I work 60 hours a week and have a toddler, believe me.....it\u0027s plenty. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreeting cards may seem cheesy, but imagine if you could send a card to your friend when she (or he) broke up with that guy you ALL knew was trouble. (\"Congratulations on losing the dead weight! Looks like you\u0027ve improved your personal brand with a strategic reorganization!\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow about a valentine\u0027s card for that couple that shouldn\u0027t work but does, like the vegetarian with the carnivore?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you like to send a special greeting for Martin Luther King, Jr day?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, these will be NON-Traditional, weird, unique, unexpected, off-the-wall, and possibly a little disturbing. I\u0027m not designing Hallmark here, folks! I\u0027m designing QuirkyCards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
