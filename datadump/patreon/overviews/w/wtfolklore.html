    "summary": "We are \"What the Folklore?\", a podcast that aims to make sense of senseless tales. Every week, we examine a folk or fairy tale from somewhere around the globe, typically one that people are less familiar with. \u00a0Our reader tells the story (through much heckling), and then we discuss its many plot holes, wonder about its spread and staying power, attempt to connect themes to other tales, and often cast it as a major motion picture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast airs for free every Tuesday (with bonus Ramblecasts most Sundays). \u00a0It will always be free, but it does cost us money to host and produce. \u00a0We\u0027d love to be able to cover our costs and even have some left over to improve our show quality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we\u0027ll be able to\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay our hosting providers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImprove our recording equipment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHoard folklore books like a specifically-literate squirrel\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExpand our guest heckler list\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStart work on some of the crazy projects we come up with during recording\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo more art\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFood?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThank you for listening to our show and supporting the continued madness!"
