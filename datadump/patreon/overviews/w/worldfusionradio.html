World Fusion Radio is the oldest and largest radio station dedicated to world fusion music featuring\n                    a wide variety of artists (over 5,000) from many countries. Sometimes called \"World\n                    Beat,\" world fusion is music that blends rhythms, melodies, instruments, and\n                    styles of multiple cultures. There are many flavors of world fusion music as the\n                    possible combinations are infinite. This is music far beyond the mainstream. You won\u0027t hear these artists anywhere else, and once you\u0027ve heard them,\n                    you\u0027ll wonder why. World Fusion Radio is different but it is all great\n                    music from quality, innovative artists who just don\u0027t receive the exposure they deserve from\n                    corporate mainstream radio.\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://WorldFusionRadio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWorldFusionRadio.com\u003c/a\u003e has two streams: Global Chillout where you can hear mellow chill, lounge, and groove, and World Revolutions where you can hear upbeat dance and techno.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, what do you need us for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, more than anything, I want you to enjoy the music from all of these great artists, but it costs a lot of money to run an independent Internet radio station and\n because I do not play mainstream music, I do not attract corporate \nadvertising revenue. I have never made a profit running the station.\u00a0Because I am currently a PhD student in political philosophy, I don\u0027t have a lot of money. I \nreceive some donations from my small but dedicated audience and have absorbed the station costs for years but things have changed and I need \nto raise some steady revenue to maintain the station. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat changed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2016, the \u003ca href=\"http://www.radioworld.com/article/crb-ruling-is-%E2%80%9Ccrushingly-bad-news%E2%80%9D-for-microcasters/277856\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emusic corporations raised licensing fees for Internet Radio stations\u003c/a\u003e by 265%, and then another 20% in January 2017. I suspect their reason is that the recording industry wants to kill \noff independent Internet Radio stations so they can control what music \ngets played, which they can if all that remains are the corporate music Web sites. I have heard that some independent stations shut down already \nbecause they cannot afford to continue. It is sad. I want to keep going if I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what does the future hold?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLicensing rates might increase again soon, because the music industry is still looking for ways to squeeze out independent operators. But I remain optimistic about the future. \u003ca href=\"http://WorldFusionRadio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWorldFusionRadio.com\u003c/a\u003e has survived for nearly 13 years and I want to continue this labor of love. If I can just get some \nsteady financial backing for the station I can not only stop worrying about money but I can look to making some long needed improvements. I would like to finally hire someone to design a professional-looking Web site. I would like to finally add a third stream of world fusion ambient music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping World Fusion Radio keep the music alive. Your \nsupport helps pay the artists and lets their beautiful music reach new \nlisteners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
