    "summary": "Hello beautiful Patrons! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a independent artist, carving out a little nest in the entertainment jungle that is Los Angeles. I\u0027ve toured the west coast and played festivals such as Lightning in a Bottle and SXSW and even participated as a contestant on Season 2 of \"The Voice\".\u00a0I am super excited to start this journey with \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, a new social media platform through which I can connect with you and share brand new (unreleased) music, videos and photos, and other arty things I create.\u00a0Patreon has given artists a way to create an online community where fans can have a first look at this material and support the creative process of an artist they love.\u00a0I don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute to my craft other than simply listening and sharing my music and watching my videos. We appreciate that by itself! But if you feel like contributing more, it will all go back into creating more stuff I would love to share with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron is easy! All you have to do is:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e1)\u003c/strong\u003e Pick the amount you\u0027d like to give, every time I release a song or video,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e)\u003c/strong\u003e enter your payment information. You\u0027ll only be charged when I release a creation\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e)\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Sit back, relax and I\u0027ll do the rest! You\u0027ll automatically be notified every time I upload something new. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note,\u00a0Patreon is not kickstarter. \u003cstrong\u003eUnlike kickstarter,\u003c/strong\u003e where pledgers give large amounts of money for big projects (such albums and tours,) a Patron can pledge smaller amounts (such as \u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003e$3\u003c/strong\u003e) every time I create a song, video. You can also set a limit for how much you want to spend, incase I get a huge wave of unstoppable inspiration and create 500 songs in a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on releasing 1 or 2 creations a month, but you can put a cap on the amount you\u0027d like to spend. You can also change the amount of your patronage or cancel it all together at anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT NOTE!!!\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon isn\u0027t really set up for one-time donations (sorry....) But if you would like to make a one-time donation, here\u0027s what I\u0027d recommend:- if you want to pledge \u003cstrong\u003e$10\u003c/strong\u003e, select that reward\u003cbr\u003e- while checking out, input \u003cstrong\u003e$10\u003c/strong\u003e as your \"monthly max\"\u003cbr\u003e- wait a month to change or delete your pledge (cards are charged on the last day of every month.)\u003cbr\u003eI really wish I could recommend a better solution but that\u0027s all I can think of right now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be absolutely ecstatic and filled with gratitude if you decide to participate! But please don\u2019t feel obligated to pledge. I\u0027m grateful for every fan, in all forms.\u00a0Contrary to popular\nbelief, music is a group activity. Artists make music to connect with people\nand to communicate an idea or beautiful/important experience. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove, Light and other luminous Things,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhitney\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
