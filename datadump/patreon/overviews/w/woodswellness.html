    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eHey, it\u0027s Wood!\u003c/h2\u003e\nI\u0027m a \u003cstrong\u003eFeedist\u003c/strong\u003e! A Feedist is someone who is a part of the Feedism community, practices Feedism (the fetish of sexual gratification from \u003cstrong\u003eFood\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eFat\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eFeeding\u003c/strong\u003e, and occasionally \u003cstrong\u003eWeight Gain\u003c/strong\u003e) and may enjoy gaining weight as a part of their liftestyle -- like me! I\u0027m both a Feeder and a Feedee, meaning not only do I like to eat and gain weight as a part of my sexuality (Feedee) but I also like to feed other people and help them get fatter as well! (Feeder)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, I\u0027ve put myself out there a lot -- attempting to balance a HUGE (pun intended) kink alongside my hookups and relationships and either failing or succeeding. Not to mention wrestling with my sexuality and gender identity alongside exploring the fetish and actively gaining weight. I\u0027ve made a lot of progress from where I started out at: super confused about my identity in so many ways and thinking I could never truly indulge in a fetish that I felt was intrinsically a part of who I am. So I\u00a0would like to offer up advice, musings/writings, blog posts, art, interviews, podcasts, and conversations about \u003cstrong\u003eFeedism, Relationships, Sexuality/Gender, and Wellness.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Wellness?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eHaving a fetish that ties so closely with your own or someone else\u0027s body -- one that dictates how your\u00a0attraction works and affects your lifestyle --\u00a0requires trial and error and then a lot of adjustment. Sometimes it can feel like a juggling act and like there are certain aspects of yourself that just don\u0027t mesh together. Sometimes it\u0027s easy to think you\u0027ll never be able to live out the fantasy scenarios in your head, let alone find a partner or friend that can understand the complexities of your attraction. And it\u0027s really easy to spiral into negative thoughts, wondering why you are even like this in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just want to help people feel seen and heard, give them a space and community that\u0027s not judgmental and open for people to vent about how being a Feedist affects their life. There are people going through the same things you are and you are definitely not alone. \u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re down to look inside yourself and ask why you like the things you do, how you can adapt it to your lifestyle, and how you can practice your kink in the safest and sanest way you can, then I got you covered!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI really want to quash the misconceptions about the fetish and open an avenue for sincere and realistic discussion\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eabout living with it! There\u0027s so much to talk about and so much to learn about ourselves and each other!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s talk about how we can be practical hedonists who practice sustainable gluttony! \u003c/strong\u003e(And YES, this is just as nerdy as it sounds lol)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really appreciate your interest, and hope you choose to pledge to learn even more about yourself and the fetish! Check out my tiers for different affordable options to learn more and interact with other Feedists! ^_^ If you\u0027d like a little taste before pledging, be sure to check out my monthly public podcast! It\u0027s completely free and will give you an idea of the type of stuff I like to talk about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again!\u003cbr\u003e- Wood"
