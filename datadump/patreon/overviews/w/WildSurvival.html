    "summary": "After dedicating the past 20 years to studying, researching, teaching and testing methods of survival in different environments throughout the world, I decided to share these skills online. \u00a0Wilderness Survival and Indigenous Skills are my passion-- and what I spend the majority of my free time doing and thinking about. \u00a0While overly dramatized, negative and fake TV shows have been created around the subject, the videos I am creating are designed to show how incredible living off the land is--if you know what you\u0027re doing. \u00a0While I would love to do nothing else but fly back to the Amazon to hunt with my \u0027tribal\u0027 Huaorani friends, or film the pottery techniques of the Tarahumara Indians, making these videos takes time--and the travel can be expensive. This has limited how much I can create. \u00a0If you like what Im doing, and feel like its worth pitching in, Im more then happy to make more. \u00a0If this gets rolling, I hope to get to a place where I create instructional videos just for my Patreon contributors. \u00a0Thank you for your contribution...hopefully I\u0027ll have Australia outback, California and the Amazon on deck in future videos, along with bow making, pottery, wigwam shelters and much, much more!"

     "about": "Tom McElroy has taught Survival and Primitive Skills to more than 15,000 students worldwide over the past 20 years.  During his twenties Tom spent an entire year living \u0027off the land\u0027.  He built and lived in a shelter made from forest material, rubbed sticks together to make fire, purified water naturally and hunted, fished and gathered all of his own food.  Subsequently, Tom went on to become one of a small handful of instructors to teach at the world-renowned Tracker Inc--Tom Brown\u0027s Wilderness Survival, Awareness and Tracking School. \u003cbr\u003e  Tom has taught everyone, ranging from young children to avid hunters, outdoor enthusiast and elite military groups such as  Seal Team Six.  He has consulted for numerous News programs, Hollywood movies and was featured on the Discovery Channel.  Tom holds a BA degree in Anthropology and Geography from Rutgers University and a Masters in International Policy related to Indigenous Peoples from the University of Connecticut.  During his course of study Tom was fortunate enough to travel the world learning the old-ways from a myriad of remote indigenous communities.  He hunted with blowguns in the Amazon with the Huaorani tribe, ran through Copper Canyon with the Tarahumara (Raramuri), lived with a tribal shaman in a palm thatched hut a hundred miles off the coast of Sumatra, trekked through the Baliem Valley of Papua New Guinea, the Andes of Peru, Sumba Indonesia , Indian Himalayas and the Costa Rican Jungles.  Throughout all of these experiences Tom has developed a different way of living, a different perspective of the land and the realization that experiencing survival-living changes the way people approach their entire lives.",
