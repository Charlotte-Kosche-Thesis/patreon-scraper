For those who don\u0027t know me: I\u0027m Zuzu, I\u0027m brazilian, cosplayer since 2010 and livestreamer since 2015. I\u0027m very passionate about what I do and I\u0027m very happy that my art is appreciated! If you like what I do and want to help me improve and bring new things more and more, all help is welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dxbH6wk.jpg\" style=\"float: right; width: 212px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWHAT IS THIS \"PATREON\" FOR?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003ePatreon is a platform that helps us creators on the internet to improve our work and implement new things with the help of donations from people who enjoy this content and would like to collaborate to get it going forward. In addition to supporting my work as a streamer, where at Twitch you can also make donations that help me a lot, I decided to find a way for people to also support my work as a cosplayer, which is a relatively expensive hobby to keep. So, on this platform here, there are options for you to help me continue to evolve in the cosplays I love and also receive things in return!\u003cbr\u003eI decided to open a Patreon to expand the ways to support my work in international ways. I also have an account on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://padrim.com.br/Zuzu\"\u003ePadrim\u003c/a\u003e for brazilian supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eHOW DO REWARD LEVELS AND GOALS WORK?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI put several options at reward levels according to an average price estimate for each, so that I have the condition to produce the particular photoshoot or cosplay and still get to give a nice thanks to each one!\u003cbr\u003eThe goals will be executed according to the fulfillment of the same ones monthly. Example: When meeting the goal of $300, a new cosplay will be made, but if the month is closed below this amount, no new cosplay will be made, unfortunately :( I need these values also to pay for some of the rewards.\u003cbr\u003eThere are also several options for you to be able to choose one that best suits your financial condition. I really enjoy having your support, but I also worry about each other\u0027s situation! Even if you can not donate, your messages of affection motivate me the most. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eTHERE ARE JUST COSPLAY THINGS HERE? AND ABOUT THE LIVESTREAMS?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI preferred to leave the donations of the stream with Twitch and bring the focus of cosplay donations to Patreon, but nothing stops you from making any special requests for the stream. I will always listen to suggestions and from time to time I will bring contents of the stream for you to vote and help me choose! In addition to being a Patron, you will have access to the same benefits (external to Twitch) that I give to my Subscribers. :3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eCONCLUDING...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThank you all initially for all the affection and support of all that I receive daily. Without you, I would not be the person I am today! I hope to meet everyone\u0027s expectations as much as possible!\u003cbr\u003eAny amount already helps me a lot to keep bringing new cosplays and photos to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eIF YOU APPRECIATE MY JOB, BECOME A PATRON NOW! \u2665\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eF.A.Q. - READ EVERYTHING PLEASE!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0IuINE1JU8L2X72/giphy.gif\" style=\"float: right; width: 265px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eHOW DO I BECOME A PATRON?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eTo become a Patron, simply go to the rewards panel, choose the level that pleases you and make the payment! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eHOW IS THE CONTENT OF THE PHOTOSHOOTS?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThe photoshoots are all cosplay, can be Boudoir or full cosplay. The Boudoir rehearsals are with a cosplay feature with a lingerie, with the look and atmosphere geared towards a more sensual side. BUT, they are not usually provocative (the famous \"lewds\") and DO NOT HAVE NUDE, being considered 16+, not 18+.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWHEN WILL I RECEIVE THE REWARDS?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eRewards are generally sent individually by e-mail early next month after I receive all payments from the sites I work with (usually it\u0027s the 1st business day) to avoid fraud and headaches. Also it gives me some time to prepare the rewards!\u003cbr\u003eHowever, once the payment is confirmed by the site, I can already accept the new Patrons in the Facebook group so they can start to see the exclusive livestreams and news I post there. So, if you want to advance this process, it helps a lot to send a photo of the payment receipt to my email (zuzucosplay@gmail.com) \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eI WANT TO SEND YOU A GIFT. HOW DO I PROCEED?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eIn addition to sponsorship and donations, another way to help me continue my work is by sending me gifts. Besides I like it very much, who doesn\u0027t like to receive gifts? \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eIf you want me to do a certain cosplay and prefer to buy it for myself directly, or want to help me improve the quality of the stream by giving me some piece or peripheral, or just want to send me something random that you thought I would like, will also be very welcome! As I do not yet have a mailbox, to talk about sending gifts, just send me an email to \u003cstrong\u003ezuzucosplay@gmail.com\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eI WANT TO ACQUIRE ONE OF THE PREVIOUS PHOTOSHOOTS. HOW DO I PROCEED?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThe previous photoshoots will be available in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wzuia.loja2.com.br\"\u003emy store\u003c/a\u003e (BRL prices only)\u00a02 months after being released in Patreon \u0026amp; Padrim, however with a higher value according to the complexity and quantity of pictures of each set. If you have missed any photoshoots and would like to purchase them, it is now possible! However, I really appreciate that you continue to support me monthly and so do not miss any more rewards \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eAlso, all Patrons can enjoy a unique code that guarantees a 15% discount on any store item. Just become a Patron, join the Facebook group and find it out \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
