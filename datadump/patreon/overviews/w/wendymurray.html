My name is Wendy Murray and I am a career journalist, essayist,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wendy-Murray/e/B001JSE7HY/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1503081325\u0026amp;sr=1-2-ent\"\u003e author\u003c/a\u003e, interviewer and Christian. Over the many years I worked as a journalist, I reported on countless stories of people who faced difficult and often dire circumstances but whose faith sustained them. In my personal life, I too, have faced many trials over the years, and have scratched out thoughts on paper as I\u0027ve sought to perceive God\u0027s nearness in the midst of them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon account, for those who subscribe, consolidates years of reading, seeking, praying and reflection as I have sought God in the midst of life\u0027s joys and trials. It is an exercise in spiritual formation through day-to-day reflection. Such reflection can be deemed a \u201cspiritual practice.\u201d And spiritual practice has been an integral aspect of Christian spiritual development since the dawn of the church. I have certainly found it to be so in my own life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\t\u003cdiv\u003e\t\tThe early Christians--those who lived in the centuries immediately following the life and death and resurrection of Jesus -- developed concrete practices of the faith that have helped shaped contemporary models of the faith practices, things such as contemplation, literary expression, and journaling.\u00a0The exploration that I offer here, I hope will challenge seekers and believers to dig deeply and to linger, to encourage interior reflection and also concrete expression. The weekly readings facilitate a kind of \u201cexercise regimen\u201d to strengthen your soul, heal your mind, and deepen your understanding of God and possibly spur you to begin to express the deep thoughts and longings of your soul.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Illustrations and most photos are my own or in the public domain unless otherwise noted.)\u003cdiv\u003e\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eMonday:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I will post a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\"Short Devotion\"\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e-- a brief collection of short verses, prayers, words from writers and thinkers, and my own reflections;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eWednesday:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I will post \u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\"Gleanings\" \u003c/strong\u003e--a short reflective essay from my journals coupled with meaningful quotes from writers and saints who\u0027ve expressed their own thoughts on the human journey;\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFriday:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0another \u003cstrong\u003e\"Short Devotion\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t\t\tI offer these systematic devotional readings and reflections as one who has walked a long road with unexpected blessings and sometimes difficult turns, as I am sure is also true of most of you.
