    "summary": "Hey guys, Welsknight here! I am a Youtuber, and have been creating family-friendly gaming videos on a daily basis since September 2014. I am also a veteran and husband to my beautiful and supportive wife. I focus primarily on Minecraft and indie games, although I may occasionally branch out into other things as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn November 25, 2016 \u00a0I went full-time Youtube. While this is an incredible thing, it also comes with a great deal of financial stress, as Youtube is anything but predictable. I am the primary provider for my family, and my family\u0027s monthly expenses are roughly $3000-$3500 per month. Ad revenue on Youtube fluctuates from month-to-month. Right now my ad revenue lands me right on the borderline of being able to pay all of my monthly bills. However, taxes, emergency expenses, business expenses (like keeping my computer updated), and other things can cause money to vanish quickly if things go wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you guys come in: with your support on a website like Patreon, I can rest easy knowing that my family is taken care of. I don\u0027t want to have to go find a second job in addition to Youtube, as Youtube already consumes vast amounts of my time, but if that\u0027s what it takes to support myself and my wife, that\u0027s what I\u0027ll have to do. Your help lets me focus on what I want to focus on: creating content for you guys to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: \u00a0Patreon processes payments beginning on the 1st of every month, and I handle all rewards once a month shortly after they finish processing.\u003cbr\u003e"
