Having relocated to southern California for college, I have worked as an educator for the past 18 years in and around my adopted hometown of Los Angeles. Throughout that time, I have enjoyed the opportunity to travel abroad on numerous occasions, and to explore the natural beauty of the Pacific Coast and American southwest, journeys which each have reformed the contour of my thoughts, refined my written voice and deepened my appreciation for the freedom of the unexpected life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy this new platform?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I have engaged my own creative response to\nthe world and the challenge of living in it, I have been in the habit, for some\ntime, of posting snippets of my writing, some more polished, but\noften raw and \"in process,\" on various forms of social media.
