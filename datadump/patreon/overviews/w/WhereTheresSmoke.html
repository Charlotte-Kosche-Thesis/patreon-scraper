It\u0027s a weekly process that we simply love to undertake - it\u0027s fast-paced, it\u0027s rewarding, it\u0027s terrifying, it\u0027s challenging, it\u0027s... great!

Each episode tackles a concept (curiosity, procrastination, hustle) and then wriggles around through research, interviews, pop culture homages, unique stories - whatever it takes to understand these topics in new ways. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp us say \"YES\" to \u003cem\u003eWhere There\u0027s Smoke\u003c/em\u003e!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode takes hours of research, writing, editing, and we\u0027ve learned there\u0027s simply no shortcut to making the show we want to share with you. At the moment, we\u0027ve found a way to balance our professional lives with this passion project, but as the show grows, it\u0027s becoming harder and harder to balance everything. By asking you for support, our goal is to say \"no\" to other projects so that we can say \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_th4LsV9kE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYES, A THOUSAND TIMES, YES!\u003c/a\u003e\" to \u003cem\u003eWhere There\u0027s Smoke\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_th4LsV9kE\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBasically, we want to keep making \u003cem\u003eWhere There\u0027s Smoke\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal isn\u0027t to rake in money, become eccentric billionaires, and then start a colony on the moon.
