    "summary": "Hi guys, it\u0027s CD here and I love making dumb videos. I never planned to do it, but I was up one night and decided to throw one together and put it up on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat one wasn\u0027t successful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few videos later I made the Hopscotch Pilgrim \"Review\" for Destiny, and I was blown away by the support! Well, I want to keep making those videos because you guys want them, along with expanding into other games as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m coming to you because without you, these videos wouldn\u0027t matter and I want to give you more quality content each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat would your money do? Well, first thing is buying a stupid P-shield for my mic, do you know how tough it is to stop the mic from picking up bad audio without that? Geez. It would allow me to expand into new games,\u00a0and if we get to a certain milestone, even play with the majority of folk out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would also help to expand the website, which at the moment is basically a place to put youtube videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, with some extra cash, it would afford me the time to create more than 1-2 videos a week. I would love to have more for you guys, but time restraints prevent that at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can donate a $1 or more, that\u0027s awesome...if you can\u0027t afford to donate but still enjoy the videos, I love you just the same."
