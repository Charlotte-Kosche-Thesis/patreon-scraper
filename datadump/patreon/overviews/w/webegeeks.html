All we have is 4 microphones and some weekly dose of geek culture that we like to refer to as the Geek Revolution to offer you! Oh yeah, also the occasional guest or 2 as well. \u00a0If for some reason you\u0027ve subscribed to the OFFICIAL voice of the Geek Revolution via your podcatcher of choice, then perhaps you\u0027d like to buy some Geek Bonds to help support the revolution? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e All kidding aside. This is something that can help all of us! It keeps you, the listener, well informed and entertained during your day, week, month, on your commute, run/walk, at work...where ever it is that you listen to podcasts. Know that your support means CITIZENSHIP! Ok really it means we can continue podcasting. \u00a0Pledge what you can! Check between the couch cushions, check the back seat of your car, the back seat of your friend\u0027s car. Hey, even check your friend\u0027s pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  If you find our shows entertaining or educational or you learn something new (insert School of Rock drop, \"It will test you mind, your head and your brain\" here) then consider becoming a patron. You can give as much or as little as you\u0027d like. Anything will help us out. We will be thankful for your help and support. So thankful, we\u0027ll be sure to share it on future episodes!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIMPORTANT: Patreon is simply for the listeners who \u003cstrong\u003eWANT\u003c/strong\u003e to lend a helping hand.
