    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003eHello! you\u0027ve found your way to this Patreon campaign, so chances are high that you\u0027ve got an interest in either \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e or art. Or possibly both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that case, you\u0027ve come to the right place, because you\u0027ll find both of those things here and then some. Every single week, I produce a design based around one of the many\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e stories that make up its 50 year history. And then I post them here for you lot to look at.\u00a0Actually, if I\u0027m honest,\u00a0I post these images all over the place - from \u003ca href=\"http://willbrooks1989.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, to \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/willbrooksfreelance\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/willbrooks1989\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what makes posting them \u003cem\u003ehere\u003c/em\u003e special? It\u0027s the fact that the people who get to see the designs here have helped to create them by pledging to the campaign each month - helping me to free up the time needed to create these designs each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t have to pledge totally selflessly, though. It\u0027s only right that you should get something in return for handing over your hard-earned dosh! Rewards for pledging range from getting to see a \u003cstrong\u003eweekly gif which shows the latest design coming together\u003c/strong\u003e (along with a bit of waffling commentary from me, in which I attempt to explain what I was aiming for, and leave it to you to judge how successful or otherwise I\u0027ve been...), getting the opportunity to \u003cstrong\u003evote each month for some of the stories you want to see\u003c/strong\u003e coming up sooner rather than later, and \u003cstrong\u003eprints and postcards\u003c/strong\u003e of the designs delivered to your door each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at the various pledge levels, and if you fancy any (or all!) of these rewards, please do join in with us. \u003cem\u003eEvery single dollar\u003c/em\u003e pledged helps me to find the time in my work schedule to produce these designs, and I love making them as much as you (hopefully) like seeing them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(In case you were wondering, hello, my name is Will. I\u0027m a freelance designer based in Cardiff Bay - literally five minutes from the TARDIS set - who spends a lot of his time making \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e nonsense in Photoshop. I\u0027ve produced covers for Big Finish, products for the \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e Experience, and am currently the resident artist on the photo covers for Titan Comics\u0027 various \u003cem\u003eWho\u003c/em\u003e ranges.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
