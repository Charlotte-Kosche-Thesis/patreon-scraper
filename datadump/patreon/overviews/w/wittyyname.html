I have consistent work, but with how I have to balance it with my actual passion, fanworks and original writing, I don\u0027t do nearly enough to actually support full time pay. I don\u0027t want to have to take on more work projects because it\u0027s honestly very draining to my creative motivation, and that ends up taking away time from the things I actually like to write. By supporting me here on patreon, you\u0027ll take a HUGE weight off my shoulders and make me feel like I can actually write the things I want to guilt-free. I WANT to produce content for my readers, and it\u0027s typically free content, so this is a great way for people who love my writing to give a little bit back to keep that creation going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eHow frequently will you be updating?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI promise to update one of my Main Fics at least once a month, but my goal is to do two major updates a month. This is entirely reliant on things that are happening IRL, and it\u0027s very circumstantial, but basically, if you\u0027ve been keeping an eye on my writing, the update pace will stay fairly consistent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be updating a ~5k word Patreon Exclusive Oneshot each month, prompted by my $35 tier patrons, as well as drabbles and Side-Fic progress as they happen. Details on those can be seen in the corresponding rewards on my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat will you be writing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, my updates will be of my current and future Voltron fanfics.

Have you found it hard to stop reading because you were so invested in the story? When you finished, were you left with that empty feeling? Kind of like when you finish a book you really love? Because, essentially, you DID read a book. Did my work inspire you? Did it make you feel? Did it draw you in and take you on a ride that you find hard to forget? Have you ever recommended my stories to your friends? Have my fics ever made you feel better? Helped you escape when you needed it? Would you like to read more?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do this, I write, because it\u0027s what I love to do.
