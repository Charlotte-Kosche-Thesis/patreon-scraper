    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWTF Just Happened Today\u003c/a\u003e is a newsletter, blog, and community that chronicles\u00a0the daily shock and awe in national politics. It\u0027s produced every morning by hand, updated throughout the day, with a newsletter sent out every afternoon, Monday through Friday.\u00a0More than 200,000 people rely on WTFJHT to bring them the day\u0027s news in a concise and focused recap.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started as a simple side-project has quickly\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/meta/trump-creates-one-new-job/\"\u003egrown into my full-time job\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0027s right. I quit my job. See? \u003cstrong\u003eTrump is creating jobs\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal\u003c/strong\u003e: I do this full-time. While it\u0027s just me running this thing, it\u0027s still quite expensive and it takes its toll. I\u0027m researching, writing, editing, producing, doing my own social media, and web development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile this has been one of the most exciting, fun, and rewarding projects I\u0027ve ever been involved in, the deal is pretty straight-forward: \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll continue to do this as long as the community continues to support me\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want nothing more than for this to keep going until it no longer needs to exist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, how much does this cost to run?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eGlad you asked! I did some back of the napkin math and I came up with ~\u003cstrong\u003e$8,841/month.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s a pretty conservative estimate, tbh. Nobody\u0027s getting rich here and I\u0027m certainly not earning enough to save or grow WTFJHT further. If you\u0027re interested in how I arrived at that number, I\u0027ve outlined the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/faq/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecost of running WTFJHT in the FAQ\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0My goal is to make WTFJHT a sustainable, community-funded media project. This means covering all the hosting costs, email delivery, site search, community forum, web development, \"salary,\" health insurance, and more (did you say 401k?). My current goal is to raise a little bit of money so I can hire a part-time journalist to help me out when I need to take a day off.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCore Values:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransparency\u003c/strong\u003e.
