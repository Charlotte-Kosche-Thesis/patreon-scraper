    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! I\u2019m Fay Onyx and I am a writer, artist, and podcaster. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThere is one thread that runs through all of my work and that is dismantling oppression and centering those people who live at the intersections of oppression. This ethic is at the core of everything I do and it shapes not only the content of my art, but how I create it in the first place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy latest project, Unfamiliar Heroes, is a podcast series in which three disabled, neurodiverse,\nand/or chronically ill players and a game master play story-focused tabletop\nrole-playing games where all of the player characters have disabilities, diverse\nminds, and/or chronic illnesses. In its core values, this project prioritizes participants with intersecting oppressed identities. Unfamiliar\nHeroes is part of the Writing Alchemy Podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also just written Magic Goes Awry: A high fantasy role-playing system that is light on rules and heavy on magical mayhem. My goal in creating this \ngame was to capture the fun of Dungeons and Dragons in a game that was \nfree and accessible to a much wider range of people. I created this game\n to have little math, fewer things to keep track of, and more room for \ncreativity, while still having enough options and detail for people to \ncreate a diverse range of fantastical characters with exciting \nabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other major project I focus on is my fairy tales. These are lively stories with intersectional characters that\ntackle serious topics while maintaining the spirit of whimsy and humor that makes fairy tales so great. These fairy tales are then produced on my podcast,\nWriting Alchemy, where I lovingly enhance them with music, sound effects, and\nthoughtful discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I also write articles on my personal experiences and social justice topics. Currently I am writing The Trope of the Week Series, which is a set of articles about common harmful patterns in the way that disabled characters are represented and how to do things differently.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve gotten tired of the lazy\nway that the majority of books, movies, TV shows, and games recreate the same oppressive\npatterns over and over again. And sadly most stories that make strides\nin one or two areas, fail make changes in any other, leaving those of us living\nat the intersections of oppression out in the cold. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that it is time\nfor art that steps away from centering cis, straight, white, monogamous,\nable-bodied, middle and upper-class men. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my work I strive to make a new center, rather than just inch away from the old. From the very beginnings of character and world creation I think consciously about each choice and the larger social messages they send. In this I work to\nbe aware of all oppressive patterns, not just the ones that affect me personally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis does\nnot mean that there is no conflict or depictions of oppression in my work, however, just\nthat I want to create conflict and depictions of oppression that does not reinforce oppressive messages. As a human, I know that I will never be able to do this perfectly, but\nthe goal that I am ever striving towards is to create stories that people can enjoy without reservation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will help pay for my costs and give me income\nthat will pay for living expenses so that I can devote more time to this\nproject (rather than needing to earn income in other ways). Thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eImportant Information\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReward Levels:\u003c/strong\u003e Many people in my community struggle economically\nand I don\u2019t want to create system that adds to economic privilege, so I have\ndecided to make the rewards the same for all reward levels. The\ndifferent levels posted on this page are there to fill out the page and act as reminders. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Rewards:\u003c/strong\u003e Most of my energy will be going into creating content for everyone to enjoy, however I also want to make some exciting rewards. Note that I am still figuring these rewards out, so there might be some changes as I go forward. Right now, I am planning on giving all patrons early access to podcast episodes. My podcast release schedule is not yet up to this (I am still finishing them at the last minute), but I hope to get it there soon. Once my page reaches the $200/month level I will start commissioning artists to do illustrations for my fairy tales and the Unfamiliar Heroes games. Patrons will be able to vote on the content for these illustrations. If I reach $500/month I am going to do one bonus episode per year and there will be some voting on the content for these episodes as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave an idea of a reward you\u0027d like? Please let me know!\u003cbr\u003e"
