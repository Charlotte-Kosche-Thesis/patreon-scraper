    "summary": "I\u0027ve alway been a creative person. Back in 1st grade I won a writing contest on the prompt \"What would you do if you had a million dollars?\"\u00a0I told everyone that I would buy 1,000,000 honey buns. This was the first time I remember being rewarded for doing something creative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I lost that creative spark in my high school and college years, thankfully, I found it again. Since 2014 I\u0027ve been making stuff on the internet. Ever since the 2016 election I\u0027ve been thinking of ways that I want to serve what is increasingly becoming a topsy-turvey world. The way I want to do that is taking my own creative pursuits seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to start taking classes to improve my skills (Painting, Writing, and Design) and finding new opportunities to put my work out there (attending conferences, conventions and making a shiny website and perhaps even *gasp advertising*.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a attempt for me the creator to connect my fans and\u00a0provide a place for those fans to support me directly. I\u0027ve putting a lot of emotional energy toward making things that I love but I want to find out new ways diverting that energy towards serving you all.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether it be think-pieces about star wars, digital paintings, video blurbs, songs I\u0027m writing, Ukulele/ Saxophone jams, or snippets of my fiction writing. I\u0027m here because I think I\u0027ve got what it takes to be a contender and I hope you do too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
