The vision of this server has always been to bring the poem of Beowulf, an epic saga, with all its horror, darkness, magic and mythology to the online role-playing community that could be found in ARK: Survival Evolved, creating  a mix of man, monster and myths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo this end the server has undergone some changes and growing pains, and has entered into what I call a \u201cstasis of productive evolution\u201d.  What this is means is that we are not actively advertising or recruiting players because we are focused on the process of productive evolution of changing the server from what it is now into what it was always meant to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis server was always meant to be a living breathing virtual role-playing experience in a 8th century Scandinavian setting filled with mythology,  magic, darkness, and monsters..  Depending on mod makers to keep their works up-to-date, with minimal bugs or world breaking balance issues we have learned is impossible.  Therefore we have decided to make our own series of \u201cModules\u201d that will bring to \u2018reality\u2019 the World of Beowulf in Ark: Survival Evolved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorld of Beowulf in Ark will be an immersive experience with classes, races, in-depth crafting and tiered tools, weapons, armours and other crafts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current implemented changes are as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eFantasy Races:  You can be smaller in stature than a foundation or as tall as two wall tiles, and many things in between both wide and thin, big or small\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNude avatar for realism\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBats spawn in the mountains, and outdoor ruins\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpiders spawn in the forest\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDung Beetles for sure spawn in the swamps\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTitanboas are tamable\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eScorpions are resistant to poison; and can be farmed to produce narcotics.
