In turn, your contribution allows us to create and grow, and do more incredible things for you, and to further the projects, art, and mission we both love. The best part is, that we\u0027re doing it Together, and you will receive exclusive thank you gifts along the way. I try really hard to make sure that the gifts I give you back cover your monthly donation and then some! Because your contribution is indescribably, immensely, truly valuable to me, I want to make it worth your time, and I can\u0027t thank you enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO WHITNEY JAYNE SUPPORTS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u2019ll find that the heart of each art piece and project, and truthfully my drive as an artist, is fueled by one simple word . . . CONNECTION . . . because connection is the precursor to caring, and caring is the precursor to action.\u00a0 I believe we must fight against hate, fear and discrimination, by fighting for love, inclusion, and connection. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve chosen to use my art to help foster connections to each other, animals, and the environment, and to empower, raise awareness, and donate a portion of all proceeds to causes that do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are currently 3 main projects (and oh so many more on the way) that I do this through, and that your contribution will help foster and support.

Because after crunching numbers for a while now, reaching $1500 a month means that I can finally set up the perfect studio.\u00a0 This may not sound like a huge deal, but if you\u0027re an artist, you know that trying to work out of your guest room or storage room, or kitchen (because that\u0027s where the best light is), or family room floor with all the dog hair (because that\u0027s the only space big enough) is not just frustrating, but super inefficient and limiting. there are some projects that just can\u0027t happen without the right space, efficiency and atmosphere. My own studio would mean I can work every day in a space that allows me to focus on giving back to the world instead of focusing on my own survival. It means that I can produce more work, better work, faster work. It means I can put in more heart, with more energy, and more freedom. It means I can focus on\u00a0 creating awesome art and prizes for YOU! It means that I can dedicate my whole day to making a difference with the skillset I was born with, the purpose I feel called to fulfill, and the passion that is constantly bursting out of my soul and begging for time and attention. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt ultimately means that my vision and mission to use art as a tool to bring the world closer together...\u00a0 to use art to build\u00a0 connections to people, animals and the environment ... to join forces with you, and use art to be the change we wish to see in the world becomes a whole lot easier and a whole lot more effective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis goal is a big deal, and I like to celebrate big deals. So... when we reach our goal, it only seems fitting that we celebrate by creating, and have a virtual wine and paint party!!! You just gather your favorite people, treats, and wine together, I\u0027ll create and send you some doodles and/or paint-by-numbers, and I\u0027ll do live video showing you how to turn them in to your own wall art, wine stoppers, or ornaments!\u00a0 I CAN\u0027T WAIT!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003e$6500 MEANS THINGS CAN REALLY START TO GET FUN, and YOU START GETTING MUSIC WITH YOUR ART TOO!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose that know me, know I love to sing and create music. Those that don\u0027t know me . . . \"Hi. I\u0027m Whitney, and I love to sing and create music.\" :) (a sample recording is below!) A great deal of my artistic inspiration actually comes from songs and lyrics (sometimes even my own), and I often see vivid imagery that become my next painting when I write or listen to songs.\u00a0 Music is extremely powerful, and just as visual art can speak to you in ways nothing else can, music can do the same thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eso.. what am I getting at? I have long been dreaming of ways I can incorporate my own music in to my paintings... to delve that much deeper in to the meanings and stories behind each one, and to share them in both a visual and musical language that may resonate differently or more powerfully to each individual.\u00a0 This could easily be done for example,  with a musical download that accompanies the corresponding paintings/prints. The only glitch has been, that while I understand the musical world and performing,\u00a0 I don\u0027t know the first thing about recording and equipment, which means I\u0027d have to pay people that can help in that department.\u00a0There\u0027s no need for fancy shmancy here, but it would need to be quality, and $6500/mo would allow me to bring these packages to life, and offer a musical/visual story-telling experience the world has not yet seen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a recording and an example of what I mean:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI sang a song called \"Safe Harbors\" (listen to my phone recorded rehearsal version here) for a community event to address homelessness in my local community. This was also during the time Aleppo was getting pummeled, and immigrants and refugees were being turned away at borders and dying at sea. My heart ached for an effective way to help all of these abandoned people. The music in the song was so powerful, and I believed had the power to soften hearts, but only a few people would hear it, so I turned to my art where I knew I could reach a few more people, and painted a candle (see the painting here) in remembrance of all the refugees, both at home and abroad. The inscription that reads \"please remember me\", and I donated the proceeds to the IRC (International Rescue Committee). But I felt like if people could hear the music, the painting would mean so much more. This is where the $5000 milestone comes in. When folks purchase certain pieces, where music was my muse, it would allow me to include a free copy of the song (only recorded professionally instead of on my phone) to communicate a little better what I was feeling, and to give folks another layer to relate to, another layer to bond with, another tool to shine light on new perspectives.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
