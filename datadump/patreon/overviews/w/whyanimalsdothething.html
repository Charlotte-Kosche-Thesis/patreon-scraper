The blog content is comprised of my extensive original work and features content from other animal professionals, as well as the discussions that evolve from those posts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy original content on Why Animals Do The Thing contextualizes animal topics for readers while also teaching critical-thinking and research skills that allow them to learn to accurately assess media for themselves. The specific subject matter covered on the blog varies daily, but frequently touches on subjects such as the fundamentals of ethology, animal cognition, best practices in both domestic and exotic animal management, the effects of anthropomorphism, and animal-related current events. My writing\u00a0utilizes a combination of my professional experiences, extensive research, and interdisciplinary dialogue to create nuanced breakdowns of complex topics that are intentionally accessible to people of all education and experience levels. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr is a unique blogging platform that works beautifully for this sort of educational effort: it allows my posts and the discussions they generate to seamlessly become part of a follower\u0027s feed, and each time a reader shares a post it spreads to the feeds of everyone they interact with on the site. In addition,\u00a0the built-in public messaging system is used to answer reader questions on a wide range of animal related topics, the reblog system allows me to boost educational content from other authors to my readership without having to repost the content, and\u00a0the nested comment mechanic facilitates discussions and collaboration among readers and other animal bloggers. Why Animals Do The Thing is successful because of how much unique expertise is accessible through the dialogues I facilitate there: we frequently count\u00a0scientists, graduate students, animal trainers, dog breeders, zookeepers, animal nutritionists, wildlife rehabilitators and more among those who contribute to the discussions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePosts on Why Animals Do The Thing reach people of all ages and backgrounds - including many demographics that are hard to otherwise target on social media for explicitly educational content. Why Animals Do The Thing is much more than just a resource that people seek out when they want to learn more about animal media; it becomes part of their daily social media experience. My posts draw people in with cute animals and fascinating facts and encourage readers to think critically about what they encounter on the site, ask questions, and get involved in a community of animal-loving peers. It\u0027s an addictive way to learn, and I want to continue to facilitate that for my readers as a full-time job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
