    "summary": "Hi everyone and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Anthony, and I am an aspiring indie game developer. I have always had a deep love for videos games and have always wanted to develop and release my own game. Video games have always been a comfort for me and has always brought joy to my life. I am hoping to be able to bring a little bit of that to everyone through the games I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on a platform shooter game called Punchy: When Food Bites Back. I have been working on the actual production of the game for just a few weeks, but have had the idea for it for a little over a year now. I am really excited about developing this game and even more so to see something that I have imagined come to life before my eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron you will be supporting the development of Punchy: When Food Bite Back and the start of a devlog and Q\u0026amp;A series. Patrons will receive behind the scenes videos and as more money is raised, I will be able to upload more devlogs and other interactive content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will charge you at the start of each month. I will be updating this page throughout the development process and I am looking forward to embarking on this journey with each and every one of you! I appreciate all the support that everyone is giving and I look forward to paying you back with great content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
