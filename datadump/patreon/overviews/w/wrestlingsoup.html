    "summary": "Hey folks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tThis is the part of Patreon where I\u0027m supposed to describe what Wrestling Soup is and what it is we\u0027ll be doing with your hard earned donation, but I\u0027m a bit at a loss for \"what is Wrestling Soup\"?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://wrestlingsoup.com/stuff/p/WS9a.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://wrestlingsoup.com/stuff/p/WS9a.jpg\" style=\"width: 224px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://wrestlingsoup.com/stuff/p/WS11a.jpg\" style=\"width: 290px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eI\u00a0guess in the clear cut definition, \"Wrestling Soup\" is a talk show that is based around professional wrestling but we have never let professional wrestling define what we talk about, or for those familiar with the show \"Wrestling Soup isn\u0027t a wrestling talk show, it\u0027s a show that HAPPENS to talk about wrestling\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what Wrestling Soup really is; is Joe Numbas and Anthony \"Missionary\" Thomas talking about everything and anything else. Music, comedians, viral videos, political topics, theology, football, hockey, etc. etc. whatever comes up. Whatever we find important to talk about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhy?\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://wrestlingsoup.com/stuff/p/WS4a.jpg\" style=\"width: 408px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eBecause Wrestling Soup dares to step outside of the lines of what is deemed a professional sports show and go against \"comfortable\". Because the fans of the show are so much more than just one topic for 2 hours at a time. Because hosting a show like ours isn\u0027t going to get us \"points\" with important people, or special interviews, because we don\u0027t pull punches and we like it that way. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI get the \"encyclopedia\" analysis shows out there. They serve their purpose. Those are fine. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://wrestlingsoup.com/stuff/p/WS17.png\" style=\"width: 306px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://wrestlingsoup.com/stuff/p/WS2.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 227px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eBut if I want an opinion or news, I want to hear the important news and an opentable opinion as the option, not a bunch of fluff topics and yes men all agreeing with each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I guess that\u0027s what Wrestling Soup is. For the last 6+ years it\u0027s the show that doesn\u0027t really care about whether or not it\u003cbr\u003eimpresses somebody in the industry. It\u0027s the show that doesn\u0027t try to be anything more than entertaining and honest. You can find anywhere from 20-50 thousand people listening each week and hundreds of people chatting with us during the shows hopefully laughing their asses off at joey and myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf so? Then we\u0027ve done our job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoey Numbas grew up in Boston pretty much all his life and got into wrestling early. He was trained by Killer Kowalski among other greats and wrestled/ref\u0027d locally for over 15 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a native born Chicagoan who grew up as a wrestling fan and found his niche working in audio engineering, production, and broadcasting in terrestrial radio.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://wrestlingsoup.com/stuff/p/WS1a.jpg\" style=\"width: 136px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://wrestlingsoup.com/stuff/p/WS16.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 258px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eSo why do we need your donations? Because everything costs money, and we would like to know that the hours we give is entertaining enough for some people to want to give back and help out the cost of running the show.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAny amount is humbly appreciated and we look forward to giving the donators something special in return. From The Soup Kitchen (archive shows) to paraphernalia and much more. We\u0027re working on plenty of new ideas in order to help the show thrive and grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo that\u0027s it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nLike when Tommy got whacked on Goodfellas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have any questions or w/e get ahold of us on the twitter, the facebook, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nWe look forward to hearing from you and most of all thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for listening to \"Wrestling Soup\" Motherf*ckers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Mish"
