If not,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://johnswritersblock.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethen I encourage you to read my blog\u003c/a\u003e, because that will give you a better idea of what you\u0027re supporting. Here\u0027s the short version:\u00a0I love stories and I love writing them. Years ago I began a blog with the purpose of analyzing and reviewing stories, mostly so I could better understand stories myself and get better at writing them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve gotten very good at reviewing the storytelling of other writers. Mostly I focus on video games, such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://johnswritersblock.com/2012/03/22/all-that-matters-is-the-ending-part-2-mass-effect-3/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMass Effect 3\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://johnswritersblock.com/2014/12/02/ending-dragonage-inquisition/\"\u003eDragon Age Inquisition\u003c/a\u003e, but I also delve into movies and TV shows every now and then. Unfortunately I have to do this all out of my own pocket, and while movies and TV shows aren\u0027t a huge hit, video games tend to be a pretty pricey investment. So I appreciate any help in helping to offset the cost.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to help me make more storytelling reviews, and stories, I\u0027d appreciate any help you can afford to give! Thanks, and I hope you keep reading my blog, even if you can\u0027t contribute.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
