    "summary": "Hello everybody!\nThanks for taking the time to read about my Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve thought about\nsetting up an account a few times but never really felt I had anything to offer\nworthwhile. But after putting some serious thought into it I think I\u0027ve come up\nwith something that everybody would benefit from. I love sewing mouse pads and\nwallets and phone wallets and Field Notes covers out of leather. I have some\nfantastic embroidery software in Wilcom e3 that allows me to make any design I\nwant that can be embroidered into leather. Using aplique techniques and some\nmodern design approach I think I can really make some pieces for people that\nwill not only last for years but look fantastic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLeather is a media\nthat can be tough to work with, you don\u0027t get second chances when you sew with\nit. Once you blast a needle into leather, the hole is there to say, no\nmulligans. I try and get as much used leather as I can and upcycle it into\nsomething a new owner can use. I go to many different sources to gather unique\nand relatively low priced pieces of leather that others have discarded. Giving\nnew life to things is a great feeling, I love the whole process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy idea for my\nPatreon is if you subscribe you\u0027ll be put into a category\nthat I take names from and randomly select a person and send them something\nI\u0027ve created. Be it a mousepad or a wallet or whatever, I\u0027m fine if people wish\nto be put into categories so it helps increase the % of you getting something\nyou want and will actually use. I love creating things, useful things, so this\nis what I\u0027m driven to do. If you like leather made items then this Patreon is\ndefinitely something you want to keep an eye on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been sewing for\nonly a few years but I have the equipment to pretty much make whatever I want,\nI am not the best at it and I have a ton to learn but I enjoy sharing the\nprocess. I\u0027m going to be releasing videos on YouTube and hopefully people find\nthem interesting and most importantly helpful in case they are trying to make\nsomething themselves. I\u0027m going to make mistakes, things are going to break,\nnot everything is going to go well. But I\u0027ll make the end product work, I won\u0027t\nproduce garbage. It might not be what I set out to fully create, but it\u0027ll get\nclose. The more I work and produce things the better I\u0027ll definitely get.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo this behind the\nscenes access will be where I share the bad cuts of videos and the other\nmistakes and horrible language that I use when I\u0027m measuring, cutting and\nsewing. I know the item I am making isn\u0027t going to be the last thing I do, so I\nam okay taking a failed project and thinking \u0027well that was a great six hours\nspent making this broken piece of shit\u0027 and setting it aside and moving to the\nnext project or idea or different approach to the problem I\u0027m trying to solve\nand then sew together.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe bottom line is,\nif you stick with me on this Patreon and you like what I make and you like the\nstyle of the items I\u0027m making, eventually you\u0027re going to have one shipped to\nyou, from me.\u003cbr\u003e"
