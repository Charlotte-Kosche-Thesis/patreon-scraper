    "summary": "My name is Will Franken and I am best known for my satirical and psychedelic multi-character one-man shows which vacillate at breakneck speed from the irreverent to the scathing. For nearly twenty years, my unique comedic style has been praised across two continents in publications as diverse as The New York Times, The Times of London, Spiked, and The Guardian -- as well as lauded by entertainment fixtures such as Matt Lucas, Stewart Lee, and the late Robin Williams.\u003cbr\u003eDespite this critical pedigree, I have recently come up against the proverbial brick wall in terms of\u003cbr\u003ebreaking through to a level of modest financial stability. And as BBC commissioners and club\u003cbr\u003ebookers retreat from artistic experimentation into commercial safety, shunning creative merit in\u003cbr\u003efavour of diversity quotas, the situation has become even more dire. Largely because I take risks,\u003cbr\u003eartistically and vocationally, that others who claim to be creative do not, I find myself too often these days, talent notwithstanding, in the cliched role of the starving artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost recently, in 2016, I incurred the wrath of the comedy industry \u2013 and a subsequent blacklisting by it \u2013 for presenting the \u201cDefining the Norm Awards\u201d at the Edinburgh Fringe, a mock ceremony ridiculing the banality and identity politics of the current stand-up scene as well as the predatory financial greed of the PR machinery that fuels its ongoing monotony. This was an overt act of satire, an art form steeped in an age-old literary tradition and one currently facing extinction thanks to the confluence of an industry crippled by political correctness and a glut of middle-of- the-road performers content to work within its extremely narrow creative parameters. For my efforts to sound the alarm bell at the demise of the comedic arts, I have since been frozen out by its gatekeepers, deprived of a livelihood which, were talent and ability, rather than networking and box-ticking, the prerequisites for entry, I would have succeeded tenfold by now. Instead, the satirist\u2019s ongoing dilemma of reconciling \u201cwhat is\u201d with \u201cwhat should be\u201d is perpetuated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor anyone who appreciates the need for comedic subversion in an age of mind-numbing mediocrity and bland inoffensiveness, for anyone who questions why they should pay a licence fee to an organisation that has flagrantly waived their sacred duty to preserve artistic standards, for anyone who relishes the singular visionary geniuses of Jonathan Swift, Lenny Bruce, Peter Cook, and Chris Morris -- fortunately, there is an another time-honoured tradition which, thanks to modern technology, is making a comeback: The patronage system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe behemoth of the old entertainment industry, along with the tired tropes of stand-up comedy, are without question dying. Although many, perhaps even those reading this, lament that they are not dying quickly enough. To this effect, I call upon my friends, supporters, and fans to act as patrons in order that I and my work do not die out as well. And, moreover, that I may live on to create even more works of hilarity, profundity, and originality. Let a light shine in our current dark age where it is now most needed \u2013 throughout the neglected landscapes of culture and art. And may the first revitalising spark be ignited in the field of satirical subversion."
