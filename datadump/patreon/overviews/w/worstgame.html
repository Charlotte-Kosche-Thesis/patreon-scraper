I\u0027m in the process of starting but probably not finishing my life long dream of making the worst fighting game in history:\u00a0\n\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorst Game: Crucible Harvest\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027m going to skip useless things like story and art direction for now because we all know that\u0027s nonsense. What makes a fighting game good or (very VERY bad) are its mechanics, so let\u0027s get right into it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nCORE GAMEPLAY\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eUser Interface:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe believe that user experience is ruined first and foremost by how bad the game looks visually when you first get your hands on it. Rather than take the low road with extremely dated graphics, we\u0027ve decided to put considerable effort into making an unacceptably distracting and intrusive user interface.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe pride ourselves on being able to inhibit the player\u0027s ability to receive important information from the HUD. We pledge to never use clear and obvious thought patterns when approaching this game\u0027s UI.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eFirst Person Fighter\u003c/u\u003e - WG:CH is played in first person from the player character\u0027s perspective on a 2 dimensional plane.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eCharacter Specific Interface\u003c/u\u003e - Each character has an interface designed in respect to his or her own culture, style and language. (i.e. Chin the Chinese\u0027s HUD is in Portugese because he was born in Brazil, Ulysses the Blind\u0027s screen is black but he can see brail notifications on the screen, possible guest character Pyro from Team Fortress 2 sees in pyrovision, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eObscure Hot/Cold Life Orb\u003c/u\u003e - Rather than a traditional life bar, an orb appears above each character\u0027s head indicating how close they are to KO with a bluer orb meaning higher health and a redder orb meaning lower. Characters whose favorite color correspond to their current health status gain buffs! Characters whose favorite color is green get shafted. Nerds.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eX-treme Combo Counter\u003c/u\u003e - Combo counters appear in the middle of the screen, get bigger as the combo goes longer and persist for a full second after the combo is done. Combos of 5 hits or more set the combo counter on fire!!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMechanics:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe second thing we are passionate about is ruining the way the player is rewarded for playing correctly or in a way that is most certain to win. It would be elementary and pedestrian to add random elements to alter the outcome of every match. This has been done before and we believe that you deserve far worse a fate than simple RNG.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo, rather than that, we plan on introducing so many different variables to the formula that winning consistently becomes an impossible task for anyone but those who possess an indomitable spirit and dubious sanity. We want to replicate the real world tension of having to worry about whether or not you can afford your son\u0027s braces while a group of hyenas attacks your best friend as best we can. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the end, victory won\u0027t be decided by who is better but by who has sacrificed more...\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eStyle Points\u003c/u\u003e - Rounds are decided in traditional 3 round, first-to-2-wins style. However, players who lose 2 rounds that perform admirably may be rewarded the win anyways if they get enough style points which are earned by performing actions such as taunts in game and by purchasing official WG:CH memorabilia outside of the game. QR codes are displayed prominently on the back of every commemorative stamp. Make sure to not to lick before you redeem it or the ink will wash off!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eWeather\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0- Stage weather affects the damage and frame data of every character\u0027s moves in different ways. Weather is determined by stage and the current season. Cheshire, the Smiling Werecat becomes a different character during full moon phases.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eMomentum Based Damage\u003c/u\u003e - Characters can move during most attacks and gain increased damage depending on how fast they\u0027re moving toward the opponent. The opponent\u0027s momentum is applied to counter hits. Moving backwards decreases damage and loses you style points if done too much because turtling is lame.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003eControls:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eLastly, we want to severely reduce the player\u0027s ability to play the game correctly. This is a difficult task, given that gamers are very good at finding ways to circumvent bad controls.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe came to the conclusion that we needed to change the way the player interacted with the game at a fundamental level rather than just making it unintuitive. This required some very deep thought and after several minutes of research, we settled with a set of controls that we believe are impossible to overcome in any significant way.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eAttacking\u003c/u\u003e - WG:CH uses a 13 button control scheme; 3 button strengths for each limb + 1 block button.\u00a0This set up creates a very large barrier to entry, as the controller wouldn\u0027t work on any other game! We\u0027ll call that a happy accident.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eCommand Blocking\u003c/u\u003e - Characters block by pressing the corresponding button of the opponent\u0027s attack + the block button within a 5-8 frame window depending on the strength of the attack. Incorrect button presses result in counter hits. Blocking specials (such as projectiles) depends on the strength of the button used in the attack (fierce fireballs blocked with fierce + block). Blocking also loses you style points because turtling is lame.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eMovement\u003c/u\u003e - Movement is performed by using each character\u0027s corresponding movement buttons. These are the light kick buttons (one for forward, one for backward) for everyone except Yambam No-Feet whose movement buttons are the light punch buttons. Forward and backward are determined by whether your character is left or right handed. Jumping is performed by pressing both movement buttons at once; jumping forward/backward by leaning with the control stick. This is the only motion control feature in the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nNOT GAMEPLAY\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFluff:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGameplay is extremely important, to be sure. There are other ways, however, of crippling a game\u0027s success that don\u0027t involve the player playing at all!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ll explore these further moving forward, as ravaging gameplay in a way that scarcely allows WG:CH to be defined as a\u00a0fighting game is currently the priority. We hope these additional unimportant features inconvenience you greatly!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eCustom Voice Acting\u003c/u\u003e* - \u00a0In addition to the default Polish, Urdu and Swahili voice actors, you can choose to voice act your own character. Provide your own sound bites and make your character scream whatever profanity you want online in head-to-head combat! Not only is this potentially toxic, but it also substantially increases the pre-fight loading screen time by adding extra sound files to a download queue before the game starts! These files will be downloaded from other players\u0027 game files and added to your own with no opportunity to opt out, so you can rest assured that the\u00a0already sub-optimally optimized online experience will be made much worse by this feature\u0027s inclusion!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eFloppy Disks\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0- The entirety of WG:CH will not be available for digital download in any form for as long as our lawyers can manage. Physical installation of the game will take place on 1,737 2.88MB\u00a0floppy disks to discourage you from ever installing the game in the first place. This obviously takes place at great cost to us but we\u0027re confident this is the correct direction to take the game in. Floppy is the Fluture! Good luck!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eConsole Distribution\u003c/u\u003e - Since the game is going to be on floppy disks, distribution will be limited to PCs with floppy disk drives, the Nintendo 64DD, the Nintendo Famicom Disk System, and the Sega Saturn FDD. Thanks to my friend,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/browncoyote\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJustin Brown\u003c/a\u003e, for asking this question!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eArcade Cabinets\u003c/u\u003e - Supporting the dying arcade industry is of vital importance to us. In addition to the floppy disks, we will also be creating arcade cabinets to appeal to people with bad money management skills. Since the arcade stick requires motion controls to jump forward or backwards and the sticks are attached to the cabinet, this means you have to tip the entire cabinet. This, of course, also means a player cannot jump forward while the other jumps backward. We think the luxury and authenticity of a cabinet more than make up for the lack of functionality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003ePR:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis really is our failsafe. If this game develops a core audience of die-hard fans despite our best efforts, we have only one recourse: destroying the brand\u0027s image in such a controversial way that it becomes morally irresponsible to support the company that produces it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are really trying our best. If, after these irredeemable acts, you still choose to play this game the bloodguiltiness shall rest entirely on your soul and not ours.

By supporting us, you announce to the world that you\u0027re down with that kind of activity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eSupport Only Some Education\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0- 50% of the Box Tops For Education from the Pop-Tarts we buy as tax-deductible business meals will be cut out and mailed somewhere for charity or something. The remaining 50% will be burned out of spite. By supporting us, you support half of children.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eSupport My Addictions\u003c/u\u003e - Full disclosure; I have a serious and debilitating addiction to prescription strength Crunchy Cheetos. It has negatively impacted my health and destroyed my marriage. I simply won\u0027t be able to prevent myself from diverting Patreon funds away from the game to purchase Cheetos. By supporting us, you support the terrible self-destruction of my life, those around me and the very game you support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThese are just SOME of the more than THOUSANDS*** of other mechanics I have planned (but haven\u0027t thought of yet) that will make for the worst fighting game experience of all time.
