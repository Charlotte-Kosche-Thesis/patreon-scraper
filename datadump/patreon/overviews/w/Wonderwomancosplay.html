And I am a woman of many traits on this epic journey called life.\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.wonderwomancosplay.me/about\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn and raised Floridian traveling back and forth between Tampa and Orlando for what ever event work I can find at any moment. But my dreams are not here anymore sadly. And not from lack of trying. Though Florida is my home and has been a huge base for my skills I have learned and perfected over the years, I still have that beat in my heart for more. So the past few years I have been trying to make the big brave move to California! So here\u0027s a little bit about me to show you why I have outgrown my roots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know that side of your brain that is the \"nothing but artistic side\" as people used to call it? That\u0027s where you can find me....I am that side mixed with love, fighting combat, and a bit of common sense lol!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was younger I was the toothpick of the group. The only thing that changed about that when growing up is I finally filled out in the fun lady parts ;) In my mind when I grew the stereotypical body that all men and boys seemed to love it was either I could be mad forever about it, or be happy for being appreciated in some way and also comfortable to show enough confidence in myself. Now before anyone gets all \"no no that\u0027s not right\" on me, relax. I made these decisions on my own. I am telling you this so you better understand why I am comfortable in my own skin, and proud of it because it took me years to feel this good.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnyhoo, aside from body self discovery, I was always super talented. I was blessed with the abilities to do many artistic things with ease. But cursed forever with the lack of know how or control to apply myself lol! Figures right lol! But what this meant is I was always performing. Since I was in school you could always find me up on that stage doing anything from the schools musical theater show that year, or playing piano with the band, or singing with the choir! I loved every minute of it. But because of my size, costuming was ALWAYS an issue!!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEverything I wore I looked like I was wearing a potato sack! So you would find me in my room as a kid always drawing, or hand sewing some costume so it looked a little better on me. When I started doing this clothing just fascinated me immediately! I wanted to know how everything was put together, because looking at it with my brain, it just looked like puzzle pieces you stitched together. I just needed to learn the right shapes! After that I always made my costumes. Back then all you could find was basic stuff at party city on Halloween. And that just would not do for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso this was the time I started noticing and liking more movies coming out with amazing costumes involved. And I wanted to get on that level!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLong story made short, I was on a very long path of self taught research to figure out how to make these costumes as well as some of my own design.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly I was super late to the cosplay game. I didn\u0027t learn about them until around 2011. But when I went to my first one in a costume and saw everyone else dressed up having fun that was it for me! I never looked back. Then after going to the cons and photo shoots, I started competing. Then after competing I started judging. But the best thing that ever happened to me because of cosplay, was when my friends started telling me about the charity events they were a part of and wanted me to join! When I learned I could give back to my community with my art it seemed too good to be true. My first ever charities I did were as Wonder Woman. And the smiles on the faces in front of me, child and adult, it felt so good to see people so happy. Even though we were no where near the movie and not everyone knew who I was yet lol! These things also lead to booking character birthday parties, which were always so fun. Being a part of many many shows due to my costuming skills like Viking fight shows, and the Bay Area Renaissance Festival, Metrocon fire spinning and Masquerade Show, Etc! Then also to filming in short films and videos. Which merged my love of acting into the mix. Hence my wanting to move to Cali ;) I\u0027ve been invited to so many photo shoots, which again merged with my many many years of experience modeling. Somehow costuming brought everything I loved into one big melting pot that many people in my life told me I could not do them all. So I learned it was never what can costuming do for me, it was what can I do next with costuming to get to this next level to give back more! Entertainment wise, or just smiles on the face of a sick child in a hospital.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, I was told about Patreon through a couple of dear friends of mine who know I have been having a hard time with all my art. The gigs just sort of fizzled out lately. I keep getting stuck in commission loop holes, where I am making many things for other people that pay some of the bills. But while the building process is happening their is not as much show income in between to balance me out anymore. And the tutorial video ideas on youtube take a long time to build up so I still haven\u0027t reached that plateau either. But I will not quit!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThen Patreon comes along. And I see better ways to share information I have accumulated and have any kind of benefit from it. Large or small. Because anything is appreciated! The more wonderful support I keep getting from all my friends, helps me share more and do more for others. Because the biggest goal at the end of this big broad tunnel of mine, is I would like to be that inspiration to the people like my younger self. I love to share how I do it, then share how I do it on a budget! So more can get involved and share in that happiness we all so desperately need right now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am blessed that my life is one huge adventure!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd not only do I get to share my craft with you, I can share anything! My latest projects, projects others ask me to help them with, my latest photo shoots (even some I can\u0027t share on facebook....ohhhh), behind the scenes on sets,\u00a0and so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if there is more you want to see, please don\u0027t hesitate to ask!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI work with many tools, many materials, and do many crazy things that people just go.....\"How the heck do you do that?\" lol! I will share how I do these crazy things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can never thank everyone enough for the support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut I thank you anyway!
