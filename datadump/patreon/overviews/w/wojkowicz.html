    "summary": "Thank you so much for coming to my Patreon page. I have a really big goal and I cannot success without a lot of God\u0027s blessing - and without help from people like you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is to illustrate the whole Bible by abstract paintings.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://wojkowicz.com/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/Following-Jesus-1024x1024.jpg\" style=\"width: 150px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eIn the end, there will be Bible editions (in multiple languages and translations) with an abstract illustration every 4th - 8th page. That is 300-500 paintings in the final stage and because not all my paintings are good enough to be part of the Bible, I need to paint even more. The paintings will be also available for free download for non-commercial use.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://wojkowicz.com/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/Man-Of-Sorrows.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 150px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eI paint on a computer using graphic vector software. However, nothing is generated automatically as I refuse to make use of any but the most basic of drawing tools within the software. I prefer that every shape and every line is painstakingly drawn by hand, which of course means it can take many days to complete a single work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://wojkowicz.com/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/Bishops-Family-768x768.jpg\" style=\"width: 150px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eThere is always some symbolism, biblical theology and even mathematics behind every one of my images. The paintings themselves are made using a method that I invented and are the result of the blending of at least seven similar (or dissimilar) images.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://wojkowicz.com/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/Logos-768x768.jpg\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eWhy do I need your help? Since I started to paint abstract Bible illustrations, I was never short of inspiration. I could paint more, maybe much more, but I spend nearly all my spare time painting and necessary studying Bible and biblical theology already. To paint more I need to spend less time by work to support my family and myself. So to finish my goal earlier (or to finish it at all), I need help and I need prayers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

Most Christians know the biblical verse \"you did not choose me, but I chose you\" (Jn 15, 16), but only a few of them have a personal experience with it. I am one of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a master degree in theology but no formal art education. Despite that, more than 25 years after my baptism, I began to paint abstract illustrations of Bible. I had never a single day without an inspiration since I started to paint. Every time I finish a painting, I know what I will paint next.\u003cbr\u003e",
