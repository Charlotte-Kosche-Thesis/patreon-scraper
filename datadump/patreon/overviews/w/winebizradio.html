    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eOnce upon a time...\u003c/h2\u003e...Kaz used to do a radio show called \"Wine Biz\" in the sleepy hamlet of Sonoma, California. It was run from a community radio station with about 1/20 of a watt (perhaps even less!) and all was good in the world.\u00a0Along comes 2007, Randy showed up and helped move the show to a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://winebizradio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eradio/podcast hybrid\u003c/a\u003e, and thus \"Wine Biz Radio\" was born in form that everyone knows it today. Together, they interviewed many thought leaders and industry people, they attended conferences and events and brought an audio recorder with them. No corner of the wine industry was safe.\u00a0Finally, in 2010, X (also known as Christophe) came on board, and the team was complete. Together, Wine Biz Radio soared to new heights (or depths, depending on how much wine was consumed). The threesome were entertaining, informative, and charismatic, with on-air chemistry to rival the largest radio personalities on the airwaves!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBut something was missing...\u003c/h2\u003eBy\u00a02012, Randy was moving toward becoming a full-time filmmaker and producer. Producing Wine Biz Radio was an act of love, but was taking too much of his time, time that had to be spent building his business. And so WBR was put on hiatus in October 2012, and since then, only one new episode was posted just before the end of the year in 2013, to keep the show from really going stale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAnd time passed. Seasons came and went.\u003c/h2\u003eThere was consistent teeth-gnashing and hand-wringing done by both the hosts and the audience. There was an itch that wasn\u0027t being scratched, and everyone knew it. The answer, really, is that the show must go on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, \u003cstrong\u003eWine Biz Radio will return once again\u003c/strong\u003e to claim its place as \u003cem\u003eTHE Wine Leaders\u2122\u003c/em\u003e. This time around, the show will be distributed as a podcast only. To do that, we need the best audience in all of wine radio mediadom to help us make this possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our recent (i.e. just the other night) discussions to restart the program, we figured that we would sell ads on the program (much like we did for the podcast previously), but only for businesses that we hand-select and feel strongly about ourselves, and that we think our audience might like too. And largely that model can work for us, though we\u0027ve hit snags in our programming where sponsors would get upset about some of what we were doing because it wasn\u0027t helping \u003cem\u003e*their*\u003c/em\u003e brands, despite that it felt like the right thing for us to talk about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAnd you know what? There is another way...\u003c/h2\u003eIf each of our listeners pitched in a couple bucks for each episode, we could make the show completely ad-free and focus solely on serving YOU guys, rather than being concerned about what sponsors want us to focus on (or not focus on, depending). We can be purely entertaining for its own sake, beholden to no one but you guys, the people we love and who love us in return. And we\u0027re not talking about fleecing you so we can go to the Bahamas (though wouldn\u0027t you like a few episodes about the wines of the Caribbean? I know we would!), but rather just paying us for the time and energy we put in to making the most awesome and authentic wine radio program on Earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you say? Shall we see how this experiment goes? We\u0027re dying to throw off the bonds of sponsorship and advertisers in order to provide you with the wine radio program that you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make it happen together. Love you all!"
