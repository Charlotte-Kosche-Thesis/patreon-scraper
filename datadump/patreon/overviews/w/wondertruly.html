You\u0027ve probably never heard of him. \u003cstrong\u003eBut have you heard of Willy Shakespeare?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Heck right you have. Henry Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton, was Shakespeare\u0027s most famous patron. There\u0027s that word--just like the word Patreon, but missing an e. Back when people like Shakespeare and Michelangelo and Tyler Durden were just walking the earth creating art unsupervised, they were sponsored (translation: kept from starvation) by people who wanted to have a hand in the arts by supporting the endeavors of artists. Which means that, by proxy, the Earl of Southampton is part of the reason we have so many sonnets and tragedies (he also got some sonnets written \u003cem\u003eabout him...\u003c/em\u003elucky bastard).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, Patreon is bringing the Renaissance back around, allowing artists to leave their towers of mystery and isolation, to throw open the doors of artistic process and stand with hands open in imploring and invitation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f034dee4b086c417468fa9/550696f7e4b052040efe7173/58abec51725e255f9335817f/1487662164020/12829375_972358776186898_8996997271711511930_o.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve been to my concerts, you know I\u00a0offer my music for donation. It is my joy and my desire to be able to \u003cem\u003elet \u003c/em\u003epeople pay for my art, rather than \u003cem\u003emake\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0them. In order to make this possible, I create and package all my art myself. I do as much of the music production on my own as I can, recording on a tiny USB microphone and a little keyboard in whatever room is available to me (I\u0027ve recorded in the hulls of cruise ships, in family dining rooms, coat closets, and most recently in my aunt\u0027s laundry room). I buy the raw materials for CDs off Amazon and stamp the front and back of each CD cover and CD label. I burn CDs one by one on my MacBook that\u0027s so old it still has a CD burner. When I had shirts available for purchase, I bought old T-shirts from thrift stores and spray painted them with stencils I cut myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile it\u0027s cool to have my literal fingerprints on every piece of merchandise I have, there are drawbacks. The shirts faded pretty fast, the stamps sometimes don\u0027t print clearly, and the CDs don\u0027t retain their data--when you put them into your car CD player, they display as \"Track 1 -Untitled.\" I don\u0027t feel comfortable taking people\u0027s money, in any quantity, without being able to give the highest quality product I can offer. But I\u0027ve been at an impasse the last year or so where product is moving faster than I can keep up with, yet the profit margin isn\u0027t enough to pay for higher quality merchandise without taking away from what I need to put toward my existing expenses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could fix this by setting a price on my CDs instead of offering them for donation. But I\u0027ve been to enough concerts where I felt guilty and ashamed at not being able to afford $10 for my friend\u0027s CD. I never want a price wall to come between my art and someone who needs it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA quick fix I\u0027ve found for this is through Kickstarter campaigns. In the last four years, I\u0027ve had three successful Kickstarters, one of which was a desperate emergency when my car was totaled in a hit-and-run, after which my community rallied together with such love and force that I was held aloft, expenses paid, and was able to leave on tour the following month with a new car.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween purchasing the promised materials the fundraiser was purposed for, as well as fulfilling backers\u0027 rewards, Kickstarter funds evaporate quickly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRather than invest the energy into draining my community dry with a Kickstarter campaign every time I want to release an album or go on tour, I\u0027m trying Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f034dee4b086c417468fa9/550696f7e4b052040efe7173/58abec9e893fc0e092fb5728/1487662242727/Wonder-8198.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA new album is set to release in autumn. As of June, I\u0027m back on the road, touring indefinitely! \u00a0And, as much as I love trust-falling into my community to couchsurf like I have been for nearly a year now, I can\u0027t even begin to describe the level of stability that would come with being able to afford my own living space.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know me, you know I hustle. I take pride in putting my head down and doing the work necessary for making these dreams happen. I am incredibly fortunate to have a phenomenal community of fans, friends, and family behind me, all of whom have operated as a safety net too many times to count. I am privileged to even be in a position where I can ask for support in exchange for what I have to offer. But luck and privilege only get you so far, just like hustling on your own only gets you so far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know me, you know I\u0027ll continue to make art no matter what happens. Whether I get $1 pledged per month, or $5000, I\u0027ll keep writing my songs and making my videos, asking questions, offering a safe space and platform for people to gather and feel together, and seeking deep connections wherever I go. But, as has been the case consistently through my life and career, I can\u0027t do it alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd hey--I know lots of people in my community are just as broke as I am.
