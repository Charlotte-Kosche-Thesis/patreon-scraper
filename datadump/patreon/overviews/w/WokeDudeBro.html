The second thing I do is get an argument over it. Was it actually that bad or good? Is that what the Director, Writer, or Actor was \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003eup too? I think that motif, present throughout the film was interesting wasn\u0027t it? Further more, It\u0027s not that I\u0027m dragging them to the latest blockbuster that often, I\u0027m talking about movies older than the hills, forigen films, cult classics, and then yuppie arthouse fair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy friends and family are tired of it, but I was hoping you just might be interested in them. I\u0027d be offering medium posts (and maybe if there is interest beyond that, video or podcast meditations) on nerd and geek culture leaning or classic films. Especially Horror, though I\u0027d like to avoid visiting the graveyard with everyone of pieces if you don\u0027t mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be keeping pledges low. I\u0027m not doing this for a living and I don\u0027t think anyone should break the bank just so you could hear my thoughts on Nightbreed. Especially in this economy.\u003cbr\u003e"
