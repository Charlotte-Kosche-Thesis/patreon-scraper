The ad-supported model is the default, and we want to avoid that approach.. For ever. We also want to keep our content as pure as possible, meaning with your support we can keep out from under the shadow of the influences of corporate sponsorship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week, we work tirelessly to bring you top-notch, passion-fueled, and useful content. We live for this stuff - it\u0027s both our jobs and our way of life. We\u0027d like to invest ourselves in Why We Do What We Do as much as humanly possible. That\u0027s where you come in: if you chip in a couple bucks per month, we can expand the operation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRest assured that the show will always remain free, but if we receive enough financial support each month, then we\u0027ll have the means to create more merch, produce extra episodes, and create bonus content. It\u0027s our dream that we can work towards a model that allows us to connect with each and every one of you personally as we build this project into its full potential.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe built Why We Do What We Do so that we can provide an easily consumable psychology resource. Your subscription on Patreon gets you access to Patron-only content, sneak peeks, personal shout outs on social or in our videos, much more personal interaction with us on the Patreon stream/comments, and -- if you want -- some merch, but the bigger story is how much it gives us.\u00a0Know that everything we do is not only for you but *because* of you. Your support here on Patreon makes everything we do possible. Reward tiers are to the right, whichever you can support is perfect. If you choose not to, that\u0027s totally OK too - you\u0027ll still get our weekly content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDisclaimer:\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eLet\u0027s be super honest with each other - we will not always say things you agree with. That may be opposing views on, or we love/hate a view that you hate/love, etc. We will likely philosophically clash at some point, and that\u0027s perfectly okay! Some people take disagreement more personally and angrily, but that\u0027s not how we roll (you\u0027ll notice that in our content). If you choose to fund our efforts, please be aware that our personal opinion is, well, our personal opinion, and that we will share it even if you aren\u0027t too fond of it. With that said, we\u0027re pretty damn approachable and we listen. So keep the dialogue open, and civil. It\u0027s a lot easier on everyone. =)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn behalf of the Why We Do What We Do Crew,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRYANO\u003cbr\u003e"
