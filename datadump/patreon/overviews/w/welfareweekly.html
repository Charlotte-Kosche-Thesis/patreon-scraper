We can all fall upon hard times at any moment. Very few people are completely immune from hardship and possible destitution. It is a unifying system that has the power to bring people together for the common good, when managed properly and portrayed in a positive light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelfare in Britain is at a cross-roads and threatened by private companies seeking to make a quick buck off the backs of our poor and vulnerable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where Welfare Weekly comes in. We aim to keep our fans and readers updated on issues that matter to them. We do so in a way that does not judge people in receipt of social security benefits and other welfare services. And we will always promote Britain\u2019s welfare state and seek to act as a voice for those who rely upon it for their very survival.\u003cbr\u003e"
