Signal will always be free and will never have commercials, but you and your fellow listeners get to decide the future growth and improvement of the podcast with very small amounts of cash. Your support will not only keep the Wow! Signal on the air, but allow us to do more - maybe much more - that\u0027s up to you. We want to attend conferences and interview the top futurists, thinkers and scientists working on the cutting edge topics that keep you listening to the Podcast from the Future. No contribution is too small. Please see our funding goals if you want to know what we would do with your money besides meeting our basic operating costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReally, no donation is too small. Just 20 cents per episode from all subscribers would cover our costs with a little breathing room. If you pledge $1 per episode, I will thank you on air. For $5 per episode, I will send you a T-shirt or whatever other swag you want from Cafepress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note we will not hit up our Patrons for the new Wow! Signal Bursts. Just the full length episodes.\u003cbr\u003e"
