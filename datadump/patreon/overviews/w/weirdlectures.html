I mean alien-time traveling-robotic-Illuminati built-Bigfoot-ghosts that live inside our spaceship moon weird stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, that type of weird stuff is what I have been researching, lecturing and writing about for over 25 years. Truth be told I\u0027m closing in on 30 years of investigating all manner of high-strangeness. \u003cbr\u003eOver the years I\u0027ve worked on TV shows, (Unsolved Mysteries, Ghost Stalkers, Real Scary Stories, etc.), produced numerous podcasts, (The Oddist, Realm of the Weird, Top Tenneys, etc.), and published some books, (Bad Luck Chuck, Ghosties, Haunts and Conjures, Sky People etc.) all of these creations have come mostly out of my own pocket. Well now you can help me make more weird stuff and you can claim some amount of responsibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of the funds donated through Patreon will be used to create new episodes of different podcasts including my podcasts Reel Lost and Realm of the Weird\u00a0\u2014 but I\u0027m pretty frugal so you\u0027ll also be helping to create new video projects, new music projects, books, comic books, paintings and all sorts of bizarre nonsense which will help create a diverse and open-minded community of weirdos. Also, these funds help to making sure I can continue to travel around the country offering free lectures to schools and libraries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of 2017 I will also be finishing and releasing some new books. Everyone that donates here will have their name included on a \"Thanks\" page in the back of one of those books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s get weird shall we?\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re already a weirdo.\u003cbr\u003eMake it official.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "I have four goals I would like to achieve through this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e1. More free lectures all year long.\u003cbr\u003e2. More episodes of Realm of the Weird and other podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e3. Write more books and comic books\u003cbr\u003e4. Help more people think more honestly and deeply about weird phenomena and how incredible it is to be a weirdo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealm of the Weird is an award winning podcast that was created in 2011. So far there are 13 episodes, available on iTunes, Google Play, etc. This year will also see the release of many other podcasts including Reel Lost.\u00a0 All podcasts have so far been paid for and created by me. I don\u0027t change for any of them but now you can help me make more! A lot goes into each episode such as contacting the clients and getting them to release themselves from their non-disclosure agreements, editing, recording, etc. The time alone it took to produce episodes was sometimes nightmarish. If this goal could be reached it would help take the burden off some of the aspects of creating more new episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will have access to unseen, and unreleased videos and audio files as well as full PDF copies of previously published books. Starting in August of 2017 there will also be a weekly Patron only podcast meant to keep everyone informed on what I\u0027ve been doing and how different projects are coming along.\u003cbr\u003e",
