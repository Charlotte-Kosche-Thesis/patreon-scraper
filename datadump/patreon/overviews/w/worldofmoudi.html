I\u2019m a dedicated World of Warcraft player and I make these\nguides in my spare time because I enjoy making them and also because it\nconnects me with other players like you on another level. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe guides you see on worldofmoudi.com are in a\nway that I would like to see them.  If you enjoy my content and support\nme, it would mean the world to me, and lead to that I can put more time on\nmaking these guides, and even increase the content further with proper YouTube\nvideos and make time to stream as well so I can connect with you even further. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis homepage has been ongoing since 2014 and the guides have been growing and growing. The only problem I have with this homepage is funding it. At the beginning, I thought that I don\u2019t care about earning any money having this homepage but it turned out that I put a lot of time on it of my free time and close friends and family get shocked when I say that I don\u2019t earn any money on it. Plus my family is also growing, now when I have two wonderful kids.\u003cbr\u003eSo I started with ads. I have no idea how ppl make money from ads because I have tried so many companies and earn a couple of dollars as best. And now you wonder about viewers of course. Well, on a bad month when nothing happens in wow I have more than 100 000 unique viewers a month. The best month is over a million unique viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next step I did was putting a donate section on the sidebar. Not a single donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFriends told me about Patreon. So, some weeks ago, I made a Patreon page, however, only 1 person subscribed to support my work. So now I made a change and maybe more changes will come.\u003cbr\u003eI will continue with the Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe changes are only to get viewers attention that it is a person on the other side of the screen, sitting and making these guides. Putting a lot of time and effort into doing so.  And if people like my guides, it would be very much appreciated to get some support so I can continue making them.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
