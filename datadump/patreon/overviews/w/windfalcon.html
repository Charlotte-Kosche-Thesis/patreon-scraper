I\u0027m an artist who works primarily in watercolor, and also in acrylic, oils, ink and graphite.

In exchange, I have a lot of content and ideas - sketches, works in progress, unfinished pieces - that I feel Patreon would be a good platform through which to share. My goal isn\u0027t to block current viewers from my work - in fact, a lot of what I will be offering to Patrons will be content that would otherwise just stay hidden in a sketchbook or collect dust. This will be a way for me to show things that I usually don\u0027t show anyway, so consider it bonus material!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of work do you do? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m primarily a wildlife and fantasy artist. Often I combine the two, creating \u0027fantastical nature\u0027 paintings; realistic birds with a touch of the otherworldly, for example. As for my leatherwork, it mirrors my paintings in many ways. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://falconmoon.com/images7/elmpatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the advantage of becoming one of your Patrons? \u003c/strong\u003eYou will have access to work in progresses and sketches that are Patreon-only, and also have a first-look at some of my finished work. In addition, there are physical rewards - many tiers offer prints, sketches, leather jewelry, and even original paintings and full commissions. By helping me with your support, you will also allow me to work on more personal projects and create even more art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://falconmoon.com/images7/chrysoswipfinal.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work? \u003c/strong\u003eIf you would like to support me through Patreon, you can offer a monthly pledge. It doesn\u0027t have to be a lot! Even $1 a month helps me with art supplies, and I appreciate any support you can offer. There are different pledge tiers with different rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are some of your Patreon goals? \u003c/strong\u003eI would like to be able to share more sketches and works that otherwise wouldn\u0027t see the light of day online. The financial support from Patreon will also give me more time to do more sketching, which will result in more content for you and it will help me work on more finished artwork. It may also help me travel to more conventions, where I can show art and do in-person sketchbook and badge commissions.\u00a0 Ultimately, I would love to be able to afford a camera so I can record videos and share process videos, and even stream art content to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://falconmoon.com/images7/auricpatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
