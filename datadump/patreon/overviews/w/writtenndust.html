    "summary": "Hi Guys, I\u0027m a self-taught digital artist who mostly, at the moment, does fanart. I love drawing and I\u0027ve been drawing since I was a little kid waiting for my dad to finish work on a building site. It kept me occupied in the car so I didn\u0027t walk under ladders or fall off a retaining wall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t have the money to go to University, so I haven\u0027t had the 2D animation and Illustration training that I\u0027d so love. However, since growing up and getting my own big-girl job, I\u0027ve managed to work my way through a Graphic Design Diploma. So I\u0027ve broadened my horizons in that regard and managed to work my way through a global shopping centre company, to land a job in Marketing, which is pretty neat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have started to pick up commission work in 2018, working on a full suite of illustrations for a friend\u0027s wedding (invites, save the date, photobooth frame and cake), which has led me to another wedding invitation job. So I guess you could say, I do work on commission for custom wedding illustrations. I also will happily work on bringing characters to life from the pages of fanfiction - because why should published authors have all the illustrative fun?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still learning and growing, and with each new illustration I try to teach myself something new. I hope you\u0027ll go on this journey with me and follow me as I try my hardest to get better and better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo find me on other social media, follow these links.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsite:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hgkb-w.wixsite.com/writtenndust\"\u003ewrittenndust/wix\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwitter:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Writtenndust\"\u003ewrittenndust/twitter\u003c/a\u003e"
