I have an MA in the Humanities -- but, these days, having studied a lot of history and art doesn\u0027t necessarily help you get much income that allows you the time and materials to create. Being able to focus more completely on this creative work would make a big difference for me, and make it possible to create more for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with the funds?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funds from my Patrons would allow me to purchase needed resources such as ingredients and supplies for soda fountain recipe tests, a light box to shoot photos during our dark Seattle winters, or needed recording and video equipment to make music videos and podcasts. With enough funds, it would allow me to focus time on getting the soda fountain book finished even faster, and get it in your hands sooner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil now, these projects are things I\u0027ve done for free, because I love them. And I will still do this, because I still love what I do. I am grateful for your love and enjoyment of my work, whether you are able to contribute or not. But if you enjoy what I do, I\u0027d be thrilled if you are able to contribute. Even a dollar or two per month would make a difference! Thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
