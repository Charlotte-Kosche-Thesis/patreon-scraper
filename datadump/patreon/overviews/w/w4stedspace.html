    "summary": "Hi! My name is Jon, but you know me better as w4stedspace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making YouTube videos in 2013 because I loved gaming, loved watching gaming videos and thought it looked like something that could be fun - I never expected anyone to actually find them interesting. I\u0027m now in the amazing position to be producing multiple videos weekly that people actually enjoy watching and I love every minute of it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing multiple videos a week takes a lot of time, I spend anywhere from 6 hours to 40+ hours on each video to ensure I can produce unique content that hopefully provokes thought, answers questions and maybe even introduces new games, ideas or concepts. Each video requires research, often a lot of building and preparation time, audio and video recording, editing, graphics and thumbnails, rendering and then of course the hassle of uploading and the trouble YouTube itself can cause with failed uploads etc. In addition I love to ensure I\u0027m reading and replying to as many of your comments as I possibly can, something I know people love about my channel. The more I try to continue improving the quality of my content and try to find new and fun things to cover the longer this all takes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m in a lucky position where I\u0027m doing something I love and would love to produce more content, cover more games, run more live streams and grow the channel and community.. To do this though I must approach the tricky question of how to afford to live while also wanting to spend volumes of time normally only reserved for full time jobs producing content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I am asking for your support. Anything you can give will help me continue to produce content without having to worry about making ends meet and allow me to spend less time working freelance and more time working on more videos and content for you to watch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of if you choose to donate I very much love you and appreciate the support I get through the channel. I hope I can continue to grow the community and bring content you enjoy :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJon\u003cbr\u003e"
