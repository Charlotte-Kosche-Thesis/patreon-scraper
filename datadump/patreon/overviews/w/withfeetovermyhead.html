I feel truly fortunate and humbled that they trust me to convey their words to the international audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking for your support. \u00a0I work full time as a school teacher, and attend ceremonies during my weekends, afternoons, and evenings. \u00a0It\u0027s not uncommon for me to be at a ceremony taking notes and also correcting homeworks at the same time. \u00a0All costs come from my own pocket. These include transport to and from ceremonies, ritual offerings, gifts of hospitality, and Mongolian language lessons. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help make this project a reality. \u00a0I will be able to privately share progress through this platform (something I cannot do publicly without risking losing the interest of publishers), and your patronage will allow me to devote more time and energy to this project."
