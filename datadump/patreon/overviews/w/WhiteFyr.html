I\u0027m a YouTube and Twitch content creator whos specializes in Minecraft. I started creating Minecraft content on the Internet in December of 2014 with one goal: to entertain, educate, and form an audience while creating the best Minecraft content I possibly could. At this moment, I can safely say I am absolutely on my way to reaching that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I\u0027M ON PATREON:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you will know, I never imagined I would start a Patreon page. However, after heading off to college, I realized how little I could actually do with the money that I had. In order to improve my content and set-up, I decided that starting a Patreon page was a must. I do not expect anyone to pledge; however, if you do wish to pledge, it would be greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PLEDGE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re someone who enjoys my content, Patreon is the perfect way to go the next step in supporting my content. There are various tiers that can be pledged, including a vanilla Minecraft server tier (the server will be started once the requirement for number of pledges is met). Any and all pledges are appreciated, no matter how much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDON\u0027T FEEL BAD:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you cannot support me, \u003cstrong\u003edon\u0027t feel bad\u003c/strong\u003e. No matter if you pledge or not, the fact that you are watching the content is support enough. People who pledge here are simply going one step further monetarily. It does not mean that they are better fans than you, or that they mean more to me than you. All of those who watch my content and are part of the community mean a lot to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you ever so much for the support and making this possible! Now I\u0027m off to creating...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-WhiteFyr\u003cbr\u003e"
