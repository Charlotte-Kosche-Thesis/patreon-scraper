    "summary": "I love miniature wargames and film/video, two very time-consuming hobbies that happen to pair quite well together. I\u0027ve managed to grow a wonderful fanbase over the last three years creating highly detailed and polished battle reports on \u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/wargamergirl\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eyoutube.com/wargamergirl\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos take a long time to produce. I enjoy making them (and obviously don\u0027t leave the house much), so it\u0027s not like I\u0027m going anywhere. Patreon would really just help me be able to create my content more often by covering the costs of equipment and all the general stuff that goes into making a battle report.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is set up to pull on a per-upload basis, not monthly. That way, you folks are only patroning videos that have actually been produced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t set up any pledge tiers, the point is to be able to put more work into the videos I am already making, and put them out more often. So pledge tiers that promise additional things would just work to slow me down =)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am extremely thankful for all the fans of my videos. That you take the time to watch my videos and comment/discuss my battle reports really is the biggest contribution I could hope for (you guys/gals are seriously the best!). If you do feel like contributing more, know that it all goes into creating more of the content people want and with even more polish."

     "about": "My name is Miranda. I play table top miniature wargamers and produce battle reports for YouTube.com. I\u0027ve been playing since around 2005 (primarily 40K and Warmachine MKI) but really got back into it around 2011.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe internet is an amazing tool for learning about new games. When I saw people were making battle reports online to explain their battles I realized I could make use of one of my other hobbies, film/video production. Since then I\u0027ve been creating battle reports and other content for YouTube (to indulge my narrative interests) and have partnered up with an awesome computer animator to create some of the best battle reports on the web.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the best (and most patient) fans ever. It\u0027s hard to tell what all goes into a video when you only see the final product, but I can tell you it\u0027s a lot - especially if you happen to be a bit of an obsessive perfectionist. Getting to talk to the community about tabletop gaming and meeting new people at conventions really does a lot to keep me motivated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmachine/Hordes has been my primary game for a long time, but I am expanding out into other systems which I plan to spotlight on my channel in time. \u003cbr\u003e",
