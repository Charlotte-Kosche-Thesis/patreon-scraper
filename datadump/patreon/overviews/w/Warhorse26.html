Animating is a very exciting hobby of mine that will soon turn into a profession and a career. With every new video I make, I hope to learn something new from making it and to become better in my skills as an animator. Currently, I have graduated from college with an associates degree in Digital Art, and very soon to be, a major in 3D Digital Design. I plan to attend a 4-year school in the future, and hopefully with your contribution, can help me get there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will said animations be released?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDo note that animating is not an overnight thing... With videos I put \u003cstrong\u003eA lot\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0of time and effort into, those will take a while. Although they may take a bit to animate, I can promise that they will be well worth it when finished.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make short animations that will NOT\u00a0be counted towards Patreon. Those videos are Just for fun and enjoyment. Only SFM videos that are 30 seconds or longer will be used. (minus any timelapses, tutorials, or recorded content)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAny\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003econtribution is appreciated!
