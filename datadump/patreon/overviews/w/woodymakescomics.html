My name is Woody Arnold and I make indie comics. I\u0027ve been at it for quite a while now and have a number of credits to my name (both for indie publishers and my own independent books). We launched this thing about a year ago (as of this writing) and though it wasn\u0027t a thundering success, the Patreon has performed quite well and made it possible for me to turn out some awesome stuff. I felt it was time to revise some things on the page and bring fans (current and future) up to speed on where we actually are with this daring endeavor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor anyone that is new here though, I wanted to invite you to check out my various books. You will find links to some fun stuff down below. I put out 16 pages(ish) of new material every month (sometimes more) which includes 3 comic series, a fiction story and various back-up stories as they are completed. The support of my beloved patrons has made this possible and I am looking forward to even greater things in the coming year. If all of this looks awesome please consider contributing to the Patreon. My goal is to completely fund all of my books so that they can remain free to read forever. Eventually I do hope to be able to support myself doing what I love but for now all of the money I raise goes entirely towards the services of my valuable collaborators so that I can keep the art coming every week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.conwaytheseries.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5824/29990048860_786813c0dd_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe launched this Patreon with the world premier of my cyberpunk book, Cybersymbiosis. As of this writing, Chapter 2 is only a few weeks away from being completed and I\u0027ve just seen the cover art for Chapter 3. We also have some back-up stories and an ongoing fiction story set in the greater universe. This book is a labor of love for me and is set in an alternate cyberpunk version of my home city of Seattle (just a warning, quite a few of my upcoming books well be set there). The story takes place in 2216 and revolves around a group of professional criminals who get framed for murder when they take the wrong job. It just goes downhill from there but ultimately it will be the bad guys who have to take down the real back guy. Of course things will take some unexpected twists and turns for your \"protagonists\" as they struggle to get to the bottom of the conspiracy that put them in the cross hairs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently the first issue is available for sale our our website and #2 should be showing up there in about 2 months. The book updates with a new page every Tuesday and my goal is to eventually be able to release two a week. The fiction story updates every two weeks or so and we are regularly putting out new short back-up stories (with two new ones coming before the end of the year). I\u0027ve had a ton of fun creating this series (and the story is planned out 50 issues in advance) and I hope everyone has just as much fun reading it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5796/30201139541_5504f7d99a_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE SERIES BEGINS ON NOVEMBER FIRST!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.conwaytheseries.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRead the Cybersymbiosis Web Comic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8575/30201138531_cc6ae08291_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe second book that is planned is called Countermay: War of the God King. This book is actually the prequel story to the feature film, The Gamers: Hands of Fate, which is the third film in The Gamers film series created by \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mattvancil/posts\"\u003eMatt Vancil\u003c/a\u003e. I got involved in this project during the production of Hands of Fate and I\u0027m really excited to be able to do a comicbook adaptation of the story. After several years of development the book is finally ready to be brought to life. The story begins with the Manhattan Project during the final days of WW2. When the first A-Bomb is tested, the explosion tears open a hole in the fabric of reality and deposits an entire US Army military base onto the fantasy world of Countermay. This story will explore the horrors of war, magic \u0026amp; the supernatural and what happens when a more advanced culture moves in on one that is at a lower stage of development (at least technologically). At the core of the story will be the human condition and the people that have to find the will to overcome extraordinary challenges. That and we take on a dragon with a bazooka. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate: As of this writing the first half of Issue 1 is completed and at the colorist. We are on track for a world premier in February. Exacts dates to be announced. Patreon Backers will receive exclusive updates on the progress of this series and can read the pages from the first issues as they are completed. We will be revealing new Backer Rewards as we get closer to the release date however anyone who attends ZOEcon in February will have a chance to get a copy of the complete first issue before anyone else in the world. The first few pages of the series will be released on line however con attendees will be able to get an exclusive limited edition of the first issue with bonus content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wKsX1Kt3NA6vIKXZVxitI1SooOAHydDpjmPskZ4UKTgiZtG1-WliyqcoHPXUFVonOlrHmKO36ZNvQ6OeMG70joO5vrQ_s0ySvY_tjJ3bz-sMF9-crqh4xYlhmvSU5tHbymfW6RwTtaChepTUUyGlDZiLTC6PhCREX94XSQ7JAXoO799Eb40ktixnwPTXmIkqUrgA1q9yGsrkSlb15ymQIIJk4xeldFYYHPk8C6gxLrDr4ti2bzEFWTFWWFxtt4FMdtnLLxySjPUTbwXIDhf9YZijkUTwuIatIbbyXoAB2HTNZFpzGeKc_uUfwvw8wOzflu6dZPsjlFz3VAcO9eGw_SXVc1M_G4XmlsVziwAt9qJYICCasjPSz1GfTeOVrGyhJVUpcLBGmM72IhBsPQebnhXb5pJCfivwXvLwYuUF2Lo_uKf5vORU_o_ngxLjt70NSA_akuL74_6Cj3_8Z0c1OCn_ALWLS1TyLERp--heHhlompQjrTynJTCgmcqqstFa5x6f_ZQzakAfIinQr4wOrbSEf0ykQlmBPM6mDxLY23cAH6GMTDEU3h_xqRHACaPQNW2wobeqc8gNlz9K50cAl5E8LmxVgEzkP9LmyG4k495Gl6j2=w865-h635-no\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thunderfrogtheseries.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5689/30201139701_d1df8dcfa5_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe third book I will be producing is called The Thunderfrog. This is the second full graphic novel that I ever made and I\u0027ll be releasing it as a weekly web comic. This story follows a Frog named Theo who dreams of the simple life out in the country where he can get married, raise a family and tend to his farm. Unfortunately that dream takes a hard left turn when the legendary Hammer of Inoadar is discovered and only he can unlock its tremendous power. With the most powerful artifact in history now in his possession, Theo finds himself on an adventure he could never have predicted. This book is already completed and has enough content to run for over a year but if we can break a thousand dollars monthly I\u0027ll be able to begin production on the second graphic novel in the series (and keep it going for the full 6 book series I originally envisioned). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate: We currently are in the middle of Thunderfrog Chapter 4 and things are rolling along great. We are going back to do a few revisions to the original chapters to get ready for an upcoming graphic novel release. Thanks to the support of our Patrons we are looking at releasing Chapter 1 in full color. This process probably will take much of 2018 (this will take longer partially due to the loss of the original files in a hard drive crash earlier this year) however the second Graphic Novel is going to premier that year and will be in full color. We\u0027ll be updating the existing B\u0026amp;W pages with colors versions as soon as they are completed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8407/29990050540_ab99f64fa0_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thunderfrogtheseries.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRead the Thunderfrog Web Comic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as a special bonus I also have a (mostly) weekly web comic that I\u0027ve been producing for a couple of years now called The Gamers: Alterations.
