This was to have been a temporary situation until a permanent solution could be found. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost a year later... We have come to love these babies who depend in us for their survival. \u00a0Collectively, these kitties consume over 7 pounds of dry cat food a day. \u00a0That\u0027s about $9.00 a day at discounted rates. \u00a0Canned food is a special treat (and used for trapping), traps and trapping supplies, and Spay/Neuter Clinic costs for our TNR (Trap - Neuter - Return) program for those kitties add to the costs. When combined with donations of food that we receive, this fund will help support our efforts for the colony kitties for about a year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
