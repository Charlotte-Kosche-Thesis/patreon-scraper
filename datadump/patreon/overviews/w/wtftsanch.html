    "summary": "Hey, y\u0027all! Thanks for coming by and supporting me. I sincerely appreciate it. It means you really like me! :\u0027)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t already know, I\u0027m Taylor. I\u0027m a young brown woman living in Oklahoma and studying Film and Media Studies at OU. I\u0027m still an undergraduate but I will finally graduate after a 7 year journey in December 2018. I\u0027m not your traditional academic and honestly, I don\u0027t even relate to academia beside doing this theory thing. I identify as Xicana when I feel like calling myself something. I\u0027m from West Michigan, occupied Potowatomi (Anishinaabe) territory. I moved out of Grand Rapids in the midst of gentrification and into Indian Territory two years ago and it has further developed my vision for decolonization. I\u0027ve been many places in the United States and met a lot of people. I\u0027ve become concerned with the ways we live with/care for/relate to each other inside/outside colonial borders.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an artist. I grew up doing performing arts-- singing, dancing, acting-- but now I\u0027m behind the brush, behind the camera, and behind the pen. I like to use my hands to build and what I build is shaped by the worlds that I think are worth creating. What you\u0027ll find here will vary because I think it is important to balance theory with praxis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will be supporting:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE KNOWN WORLD\u003cbr\u003eThis is a publication I have already begun to work on. I am hoping to create a magazine as well as a corresponding blog with extra features and content. The Known World magazine will contain columns and photographs regarding the topic of settler colonialism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBLOGS/THEORY\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t write essays often because I prefer conversation. But I do have some ideas I would like to develop. You will find I use the term \"settlerism\" as opposed to settler colonialism to describe the ways that bodies function in relation to each other and the codes that are written onto bodies that shape such relations. I am working from a background that includes various decolonial theories, native and black feminisms, black and native marxist theories, psychoanalysis and semiotics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will also write film theory. I consider film an important avenue to analyze codes of power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePHOTOGRAPHY SERIES\u003cbr\u003eI am developing various series of photography regarding decolonial visions. These will include post-apocalyptic native women, natural landscapes and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFILMS/VLOGS\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned under the Blog/Theory section, conversation is important. Here you will gain access to the conversations that other local radical leftists and I have over food and drinks in my Dinner and Theory series.\u003cbr\u003eOther vlog topics and short films will be announced.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
