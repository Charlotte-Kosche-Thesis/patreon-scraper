We are nurse researchers who are committed to improving the sexual and reproductive health of women by advancing how providers communicate with patients. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn our podcast, W-CHAT, the official podcast of Woman Centered Health (WCH), we see ourselves as pioneers of changing how research and expertise is put into the hands of those on the front lines of delivering healthcare, you. We understand that you struggle with short appointment times, busy schedules, and administrative demands. All of this competes with your time to read research and your desire to provide the best possible care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where our podcast comes in. No need to stop and read, just plug-in and listen while you are on the go. We interview providers including (but not limited to) OB/Gyns, family practice doctors, nurse practitioners, midwives, and researchers, who are experts in communicating issues of women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health. We will also occasionally feature women with stories that provide valuable learning opportunities.   We know that you are the  clinical experts, but sometimes communicating clinical knowledge can be tricky, so let us help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT first, we need your help. We launched WCH in 2017 and right now our sole focus is providing you with valuable, easily accessible, and free information. However, to provide you with this *free* information we need your support.  Our podcast depends on finding experts in the field of sexual and reproductive health and communication. This means that we have to network while paying for all of the platforms and services that support our website, podcast, and traveling.  We would also love attend conferences and create educational materials and CEUs. However, we need your help so that we can make this happen, help us by becoming a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, we appreciate your commitment to improving communication with your patients, because we believe how we communicate impacts health outcomes. But words cannot express how appreciative we are and would be for your support so that we can deliver premium interviews and content directly to you! Connect with patients by connecting with us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind us online at \u003ca href=\"http://www.womancenteredhealth.com\"\u003ewww.womancenteredhealth.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFind us on Facebook at: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/womancenteredhealth\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/womancenteredhealth\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter at: Woman_Centered\u003cbr\u003e"
