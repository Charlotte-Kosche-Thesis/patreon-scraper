Over the past few months I have taken active steps to ramp up support of Shroud of the Avatar through coordinating media events, building a twitch.tv presence for SotA, promoting charity campaigns within the community and hosting giveaways and events aimed at bringing in new players to the game and give existing players a sense of excitement to keep them in the game. Up to this point I have done all of this work on my own time and with my own money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am more than willing to continue using my own funds and my own time - alone if i have to - to continue to support all of these efforts. I have been blessed to have the unwavering support of so many amazing avatars who have supported my efforts in the past. There are no words that I can say to thank those who have supported my efforts thus far with the Phoenix Republic, Charity Efforts, Twitch campaigns and community building.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have now entered into a new world, however. I am now also taking on the mantle of maintaining Avatars Circle, the most popular Shroud of the Avatar fan site to date. Avatars Circle is a staple of the community, and I want to make sure I do this right and handle this fairly and professionally to live up to the reputation Duke Violation has built for Avatars Circle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the recommendation and request of many people I am now opening a Patreon page to help gather patron support to maintain the hosting and infrastructure, provide a source of funding to help promote Shroud of the Avatar to both new players and veterans, and continue to use SotA to promote good deeds in charities around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no illussions that this will be an easy endeavor, nor do I have any reservations in continuing to do these things on my own dime if need be - but any amount of funding support to help keep Avatars Circle alive while continuing the grassroots community development push would be appreciated.\u00a0"
