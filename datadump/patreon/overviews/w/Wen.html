It spoke to me, made me feel special, and opened my eyes to a world beyond our reality. I began to explore art myself, and put my own ideas and imagination down on paper as I worked hard to hone my craft. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may not have gone to an art school or anything of that nature, but I spend my days watching tutorials, reading other artist\u0027s pages, and practicing every single chance I get. I\u0027ve learned so much not just on my own, but from my friends and peers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter all this time, I\u0027ve realized this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I want to express not only my own ideas, but help others express theirs as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was this realization that has brought me to this road today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make this dream of mine a reality, I work hard everyday helping others, and taking commissions for those who enjoy my work. But sadly, sometimes it\u0027s not enough to do what you love and still make a living. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I need your help. To my followers and those who just happened to stumble upon my page for yourselves, If you enjoy what I do and want to support me, please give my page here a look over, and see if you would like to donate anything to help me pursue my passion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I am not asking for a hand out. If you help support me, I will also be doing special bonuses for those that pledge a certain amount each month. So if you\u0027d like to support me and also get some previews, headshots, and even commissions in the process, it would mean the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps, and I am grateful for anything you maybe able to donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryday I strive to be better and better. And with your help, I hope to never stop improving for not just me, but for YOU as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all my love,\u003cbr\u003e-Wen\u003cbr\u003e"
