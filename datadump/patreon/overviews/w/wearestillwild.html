Further, who are able to create true community, deep friendships, explore self care and find hopeful outlets in this often confusing, overstimulating and hurtful world. These oral histories are my small attempt to showcase women who I hope inspire other highly sensitive people to look toward interconnection, finding their own hopeful outlets and relief in their suffering by resonating with similar stories to their own.\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cbr\u003eIn a time when it\u0027s easy to feel powerless and defeated, I feel it\u0027s so important to promote interconnection, holistic healing, connecting with the natural world and being true to our highest selves. I\u0027m just one person sending a small cry into the abyss, but I\u0027m determined to channel my fear of chaotic hatred into work that inspires and serves as a reminder that we belong to ourselves and to each other.\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cbr\u003eUp until this point I have been able to save my pennies and fund the project myself. However, the connections I have made and ever-growing list of women I\u0027d like to interview is becoming long, exciting... and expensive.
