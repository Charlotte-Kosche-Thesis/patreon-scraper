If we could, we would do nothing but sit and doodle all day, but the real world has a different plan. \u00a0Comic production takes time and money; to get money we have to spend all our time at work.

Doyle is its greatest champion, heralding it as the next great\n religion; Houdini is its greatest foe, viewing it as a swindle \nexploiting the vulnerable.\u00a0 They were two of the most \ninfluential men of their time.  Each led extraordinary lives in their \nown right, but their lives also overlapped in astonishing ways.  Their \nmutual admiration for one another brought them together and the two men \nbecame fast friends, even accompanying one another on family holidays.  \nAnd yet their conflicting beliefs and goals resulted in a heated \nrivalry.
