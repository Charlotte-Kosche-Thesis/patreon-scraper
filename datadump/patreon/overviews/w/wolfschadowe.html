    "summary": "I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to everyone that is pledging support for my project. I am truly humbled by the amount of support that I\u0027ve received so far. Although I\u0027m making the game for fun as a hobby, it is always nice to know the work is appreciated, and your pledge will help motivate me to continue producing episodes for the game through completion of the storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, um...What exactly is Brad\u0027s Erotic Week?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, Brad\u0027s Erotic Week (BEW for short) is an Adult Interactive Fiction game set within a custom universe based on a soon(ish) to be published series of books. In the game we follow Brad Jenkins through a week of his life as he is introduced to the Guild of Schadowes. During the week, Brad finally ends a multi-year dry spell of dating with the option to woo 8 different women over the course of the week. The game is episodic with a planned 3 seasons over the course of the week. Each episode is planned for 200-400 pages in size. Season 1 follows Brad from Wednesday Morning through Friday Morning. Season 2 will follow him from Friday Afternoon through Sunday Afternoon, and finally Season 3 will follow him from Sunday Night through Tuesday Night to finish up the week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGot it, so its a Virtual-Date game?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes...and no. There are some similarities to a V-Date game here, but in BEW, your decisions matter. I mean they really, really matter. As in, there will be over 80 unique \"winning\" endings to the game. You can play a scene, such as going to the Bar on Wednesday night, for five or six replay\u0027s and have a significantly different story each time. Not only that, but when you go to work the next day, those decisions carry over, and combine with your decisions at work, that impact the stories of the next night. The idea is to tell a story that is enhanced by some erotica, with immersive characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I find a current copy of the game?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked. You can download the game from the official forum at \u003ca href=\"https://bew.rocks/forum.\"\u003ehttps://bew.rocks/forum.\u003c/a\u003e Check out the Download and Technical Support category of the forum. While you are there, create a free account and say hello!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I made a pledge but I can\u0027t access my rewards, can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure! All rewards are handled through the forum at https://bew.rocks/forum, but there is no automatic linkage. I have to manually set the permissions on your forum account. All I need you to do create a forum account, and then send a PM to Wolfschadowe (That\u0027s me!) letting me know that you are a Patron, and also tell me what you Patreon handle is so that I can easily verify your account. Once I know both your BEW Forum handle, and your Patreon handle, I can link the accounts in my records and promote your forum account to give you the proper access for your rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I be charged?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon will charge your pledge amount every time I release a new episode. Depending on the size of the episode, that will be once every 3-6 months, with most episodes releasing in the middle of that timeframe. The current target is to release once every 3 months, give or take a month depending on the overall size of the release. If you pledge $1, that may total anywhere from $2-$5 a year, unless you cancel your patronage. I advise setting a monthly maximum to make sure I don\u0027t start spamming the release button! :) Not that I would ever do that, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I give you my money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s a way to say \"Thank you\" for making an enjoyable game. New episodes to Brad\u0027s Erotic Week will always be free, but giving a token amount it\u0027s an easy way to both show your appreciation for the work, and to encourage me to keep making the games. This is my hobby, and it also has costs associated with it. I don\u0027t mind paying those costs myself, because I enjoy making the game, but it sure is appreciated when I get some help from those who enjoy playing my creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I will give various thank you rewards at various levels of patronage. Over time I may add more rewards as I think of them. If you have suggestions for rewards, let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Immediate, First Funding, Second Funding stuff?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt has two purposes. First is to help limit the number of people who make a large pledge, grab all the goodies, and then cancel their pledge before it funds. That\u0027s not fair to those of you who are honestly wanting to support my efforts on the game, and the rewards you are expecting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second purpose is to provide a continuing thank you to those who continue to fund at the highest levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI just missed the last funding, and the next funding is 3 or 4 months away! Do I have to wait that long to get the First Funding perks?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNope. you can make a one-time donation via \u003ca href=\"http://bew.rocks/donate.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://bew.rocks/donate.\u003c/a\u003e Give me enough information to link that donation to your account here, and I\u0027ll credit you a funding! I don\u0027t recommend that you do this close to a new episode releasing though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve been a patron for a while, and funded you several times, but something happened and I\u0027ve hit hard times. If I cancel my pledge, or have to reduce it, will I have to start over on my fundings once times are good again?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI understand that life happens, and we all hit hard times. If you cancel your pledge, or reduce it, your rewards will be reduced as well. \u00a0Your level is based on total dollars supported divided by the total fundings since you first pledged, or the amount of your last pledge level, whichever is greater.\u00a0As an example, if you made 3 successful fundings at the Dinner level ($75 total), but have to reduce, or cancel, you will loose Dinner level access after the first missed funding, but will reduce to the Lunch level because $75/4 is $18.75 per funding which is greater than the lunch level. After 8 fundings you will drop to the coffee level becaust $75/8 fundings = $9.38 per funding, which is below Lunch, but above Coffee. Reducing your pledge works similarly and you will slowly drop to your new pledge level. You will only lose patreon status once your funding drops below $1 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre the rewards finalized?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo. I\u0027m always trying to think of new ways to say thank you for all of you who are supporting the development of the game. If you have cool ideas for new rewards, or new milestone goals, let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Patreon site sucks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I know. Maybe it will get better over time, but just think. The more time I spend trying to make an awesome Patreon site, is less time I spend trying to make an awesome AIF game!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre the images below from the game?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes, and no. All the images below are rendered using iRay which\u003cdel\u003e I can do if we meet the $500 goal\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0is now happening!\u00a0All the images are taken from scenes in the game, both present and future, however All characters were removed, and in some cases a cup of coffee or beer mug was added as appropriate to the pledge level.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

This is an estimation of the quality of images with a shorter render time, although on my current rig, this actually took about 3 times longer to render than the current method. The AWS CUDA Compute service charges by the minute. This is the estimated cost of using that service per release, while potentially increasing the size of each Episode.",

You just won\u0027t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-mindbogglingly big it is. That means that there\u0027s a lot of renders needed in order to produce the images, and I am only one person, working as a hobby, in my free time. I\u0027ve had graphics artists apply to help out, then they see how much work is actually involved, and they run screaming for the hills. Reaching this goal, I can \"pay\" staff for their help with the game, and hopefully bring in some artists to help out with the rendering. It\u0027s not about just pressing a render button. It\u0027s about reading the storyboard, and posing the figures, framing the scene, checking the lighting, and shaders, and textures, and a bunch of other things, and then hitting the render button and waiting a looong time for the render to finish. After 30 minutes to an hour or so of work, that\u0027s one (1) image completed. Only 399 ish to go for the next episode.... My hope is that I can offer an artist up to $200 an episode to help out, depending on their overall productivity. Then I can make the episodes larger. If I can get two or three artists helping out, well, that\u0027s even bigger episodes. The intent is to begin offering at least token payment to maybe convince some poor fools...er....artists to help out. This would allow for about 3 \"paid\" staffers to get the chance to buy themselves a couple nice dinners, coffee and beer.",

By a lot people, I mean one person, but it did get me thinking. This is the threshold for me to go full time, and put out new episodes every two months, staying with the Episodic funding method.\u003cbr\u003eYeah, It\u0027s a lot of money, and I never really expect us to get there, but thought I\u0027d just throw this out there for folks to chew on. This isn\u0027t really a serious goal for me, but if we somehow, miraculously hit this mark...well, I\u0027d have to give it some serious thought at that point. :)\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your outstanding support!",
