(\u003ca href=\"http://www.nwbookbinding.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.nwbookbinding.com \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy books, published through traditional publishers, sell thousands of copies each year and are translated into eight different languages. I have studied Taoist thought for over forty years and have written about it for the past twenty years. My books focus on how to remain peaceful and contented amidst the challenges of modern life: parenting (\u003cem\u003eThe Parent\u2019s Tao Te Ching\u003c/em\u003e); relationships (\u003cem\u003eThe Couple\u2019s Tao Te Ching\u003c/em\u003e); growing older (\u003cem\u003eThe Sage\u2019s Tao Te Ching\u003c/em\u003e); forgiveness (\u003cem\u003eThe Tao of Forgiveness\u003c/em\u003e); caregiving (\u003cem\u003eThe Caregiver\u2019s Tao Te Ching\u003c/em\u003e); and most recently \u003cem\u003eThe Activist\u2019s Tao Te Ching\u003c/em\u003e -\u003cem\u003e Ancient Advice for a Modern Revolution\u003c/em\u003e. These books, and others, are available at all bookstores and on-line stores. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that the Taoist wisdom that emerged 2500 years ago in ancient China is a crucial corrective for our urgent, chaotic, fearful, and deeply unhappy society. I want to keep writing  of this path because I feel my voice is getting stronger as I age. I sense that our world is at multiple tipping points and the future of the human species is hanging in the balance. I don\u2019t have all the answers, but I have lived with the classic \u003cem\u003eTao Te Ching\u003c/em\u003e most of my life and I know the value of its message. I want to keep telling it as long as I am alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy modest success in the publishing field has not afforded us a \u201cliving.\u201d Our life path has followed unconventional directions throughout our lives, Both Nancy and I left traditional careers twenty years ago for the experience of free-lance artisans/writers. So we arrive at our \"elder years\" with a need for some additional support from the people who have found our work valuable over the years.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eNancy and I honestly believe that freedom lies in a simple life. We want our work to make a contribution to the happiness, health, and freedom of as many people as possible. We want to step outside our introverted comfort zone and interact with people in new and authentic ways, giving what is ours to give in any way we can to writers, readers, and friends. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToward this end we are planning on moving from our fairly large, rented house to a \"Tiny House\" of some type located on a small piece of property. We hope to make this move in the summer of 2017. We are asking for patrons to help support us for the next four years as we make this transition and settle into a life of earnest commitment to the crafts of writing and bookbinding. Your monthly support, combined with our earned income, will enable me to write full-time and allow Nancy to make her beautiful custom bindings available to a wider audience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsking for patronage is a new experience for me. At first I was uncomfortable with the concept, but now I see it as a way to affirm that we are all part of One Life - one community of people who care for each other and for the future of our world. We each do what we can, one little step at a time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cThe journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e - from chapter 64 of \u003cem\u003eThe Tao Te Ching.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlessings and thanks to everyone."
