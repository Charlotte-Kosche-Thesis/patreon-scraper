    "summary": "Hi there I like making pictures that make people laugh and you know what helps me do that? The cash monies. Not really, I\u0027d do this for free but every little bit helps me get the content out faster and with better quality. So yeah. Win win. That being said I\u0027m a firm believer in putting out free content for people to enjoy, so I\u0027m doing just that. Even if you don\u0027t support me you will still be able to see every comic and picture and whatever I make, you just get bonus stuff if you do support me. Anyhoo let me really break it down for you now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the hey hey do you make?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell I make comics, are they funny? Well that\u0027s kinda on you to decide. I like it, I hope you do to. These little buggers will range anywhere from 1 to more panels, who knows? Usually in black and white because I suck at coloring, but they might be animated on occasion so that\u0027s cool!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eOK Got it, but how often are these things coming out?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGood question. . . I dunno. I\u0027m still in school so consistency is not my thing. I can guarantee at least one a week though. If that\u0027s too slow, well I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ll do my best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeato seems real super but why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell friend I\u0027d love to just churn out the funnies non stop but I\u0027m only human. I gotta eat and would like to not sleep on the street and pay bills and stuff, and this helps me do that! If you don\u0027t feel like helping me out that\u0027s fine, giving money to a stranger on the internet is pretty weird, but hopefully my comics will help turn that frown upside down! Also, any help you give me, comes right back to you as you would directly be helping me fund better equipment, and you get those patron bonuses I mentioned earlier, which you can see on the right column. And, the more I make here the less I have to make doing something else, which is better for the both of us I think you can agree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhew you made it to the bottom\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo anyways thanks for visiting my page! Hope you like what you see, have a good day, sleep tight don\u0027t let the bed bugs bite etc. Oh yeah before I forget, are facebook or twitter or even instagram more your thing? Because I got those. Also you should check out the real deal Wheat Comics website.\u003cbr\u003e@WheatComics\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WheatComics/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/WheatComics/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/WheatComics\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/WheatComics\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.wheatcomics.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.wheatcomics.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
