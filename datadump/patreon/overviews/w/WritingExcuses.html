    "summary": "Writing Excuses is a weekly podcast for writers and aspiring writers. We are now in our thirteenth season, we\u0027ve won a bunch of awards, and we\u0027ve showcased a phenomenal who\u0027s who of fantasy, science fiction, and horror authors. We\u0027re very proud of what we\u0027ve accomplished, but we are always trying to do better. That\u0027s where this Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting Excuses is currently sponsored by advertisers, which is great, but limiting. We want to move to a new funding system that will allow us to promote a wider range of book-of-the-weeks and authors AND help us to improve our equipment, our interactivity, and the quality of the podcast overall.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowd-funding system that lets you make a monthly pledge of whatever amount you want. What do you get, besides our undying gratitude? Everything from a heartfelt thanks, recipes for pie, ringtones, outtakes, and bonus content, to a behind-the-curtains look at how the show comes together, and even sneak peeks at our books and other projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to be very clear that \u003cstrong\u003ethe podcast will remain free\u003c/strong\u003e. It always has been, and it always will be. We believe very strongly that writing advice and education belong to everybody, not just the people who can pay for it. That\u0027s a big part of why we\u0027re doing this Patreon--so that the people who can kick in a few bucks a month can help keep the the show available for the people who can\u0027t. We\u0027re not doing this to get rich: the funds we raise here will go toward improving the show, upgrading our equipment, paying our guests, and covering the various other expenses that crop up as we move forward. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you just want to say thank you, or you want access to some our cool rewards, this Patreon is for you. Check out our list of pledge rewards and milestones, and help make Writing Excuses even more awesome.\u003cbr\u003e"
