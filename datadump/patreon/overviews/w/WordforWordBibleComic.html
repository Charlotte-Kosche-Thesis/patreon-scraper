We\u0027ve been so blessed by the support of my fans allowing me to take this crazy idea and literally quit my day job. We\u0027ve already completed three books and we\u0027re now creating our fourth which is the big one, The Gospel of Mark.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy two little boys, wife and I live off a very modest income from the\u00a0Kickstarter funding and book sales so this is another way to keep us ticking over.

I realised that unless I had read it for myself I would never have known what was in there. As I am dyslexic the prospect of reading a two thousand page tome was very daunting therefore, I knew there must be so many people (Christian and non-Christian) who\u0027d not read the Bible just because it is so long and they prejudge it as boring or irrelevant. As I love comics I checked out the Bible based comics that are out there and realised they are all highly abridged and sugar coated for kids.\u00a0I found myself hoping someone would create a comic version that told the whole story, unabridged and for an adult audience. It was not long after that I realised, \"Oh, it\u0027s me\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother element I bring to the comics is historical accuracy. I am a live roleplayer and so historical accuracy has always been a passion of mine. I could never settle for the heroes wield \"a sword\", I had to know what kind of sword? what style? This expanded to wanting to make everything just right in the comic. I even ensure minor details are correct, when there is an animal, for example, a dog, it has to be the right breed for the time and the region, not just any old dog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I started drawing again, (I hadn\u0027t focused on this since before college) I developed a style and worked on my consistency. I spent 5 years researching the period, read loads of books, articles, blogs and more on the time of the Judges. Then, I started making a sample to ensure it would really work. It was at that point, I first heard of Kickstarter and straight away I knew this could work for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1MSxVlh_ZyM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 after copious research on running a successful Kickstarter, and preparing the 23-page story of Samson, I launched the first Kickstarter. It had a crazily high goal of \u00a315,000 (about $20,000) and it ran during my 3-month paternity leave from my call-center day job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmazingly in the last few days of the campaign, we smashed through the goal and ended up near \u00a320,000 ($27,000).

This level of detail is intended to immerse the reader in the story, helping to contextualise the world that these people lived in. Also, the range of styles, fashions and traditions give a richness that text alone will lack. Another element is the correct ethnicity of the heroes and their enemies, to help understand the spectrum of people found in the Bible. All too often we see a Western Jesus or expect the characters to act like people of our own culture or nation and forget this is, for the most part, a Middle Eastern account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, maps interspersed into the story help pinpoint the action and also highlight the times that significant events happen on the same turf or nearby to other significant events.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wordforwordbiblecomic.squarespace.com/historical/\"\u003eClick for more info:\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/155/589/3a28c12ec8bbbb4b1dd26ddd72ac119b_original.jpg?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1484309315\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=b3de682b7961e7a0dc6f07188a169e5e\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-weight: inherit;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/613/668/b2879973a02a7aacaa9390529f3d838e_original.gif?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1487859000\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;gif-q=50\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=9f3b2e06f0a6d0947ca58d83fef817ec\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-weight: inherit;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/155/414/217698f88a64bac519caab944bd69713_original.jpg?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1484307992\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=b4d71be97671e4de278751a6bda23311\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-weight: inherit;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike any other comic rendition of the Bible, this one will be completely unabridged. Are you frustrated by film adaptations of your favourite books boiling down the story to nothing and missing out the character development and some of your favourite parts? By keeping all the words and not rushing the story this graphic novel aims to keep the pace, social intricacies, surprises and even humour of the original text.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see from the example images that all the words (even \u201che said\u201d and descriptive elements) are still included into the comic but subtly in the \u0027gutters\u0027. These generally appear as dark grey on medium grey. The intention is that if you are reading it as a comic, you could ignore these bits. However, if you want to read them to see what the Bible text includes they are present and legible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis also means that no parts of the stories are overlooked or avoided. For example, the Levite\u0027s concubine (Judges 19), Jephthah\u0027s sacrifice (Judges 12), or brides for the Benjamites (Judges 21). All parts of the story are important and, in my experience as an illustrator and comic fan, it\u0027s the details that help you understand the full story and characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wordforwordbiblecomic.squarespace.com/unabridged/\"\u003eC\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wordforwordbiblecomic.squarespace.com/unabridged/\"\u003elick for More Info: \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/155/523/4e65139d470395e773a907164d103a32_original.jpg?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1484308844\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=d5d0bf2f5ea24891147059b78d08c446\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-weight: inherit;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis graphic novel will not shy away from any issue the Bible addresses. Unfortunately, due to the corruption of mankind, these issues include violence, kidnapping, cold-blooded murder, even rape and infanticide. This work will not glamorize evil of any kind, nor will it be explicit or dwell on these things, but it will cover all the lessons that the Bible teaches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this fast-paced visual age of instant movies and tv-on-demand, this series intends to grab the attention of those unlikely to sit down and read a dusty old book, let alone the Bible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome people may be surprised to learn, the primary consumers within the exploding comics market today are not children but men aged 27-36 and women aged 17-26 (Comixology survey \u002713). This series targets that market by simply using the multifaceted and often bloody ancient narrative, without simplifying it, watering it down or attempting to repackage it in a child-friendly way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese comics will come with an \u0027age advisory\u0027 notice, or either 15+ or 12+. Parents of younger teens may be happy to give the book to younger readers but this will give a good idea of the content and maybe even encourage rebellious 13 and 14-year-olds to try reading it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wordforwordbiblecomic.squarespace.com/15-certificate/\"\u003eClick for more info: \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wordforwordbiblecomic/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/word4wordbiblecomic/the-gospel-of-mark-word-for-word-bible-comic-book/\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wordforwordbiblecomic.squarespace.com/web-comic/\"\u003eSample Pages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow are sample pages from The Gospel of Mark.\u003cbr\u003eClick here for a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://wordforwordbiblecomic.squarespace.com/config/?frameUrl=%2Fweb-comic%2F\"\u003e15 page Sample\u003c/a\u003e from the Book of Judges\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/727/928/faa40a02f8fe5ab2ec4b2bceb7fbd271_original.jpg?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1488559549\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=9a66d8e0e609164e7eff01b3ec0b9e1c\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-weight: inherit;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/702/910/4709d574df98d4d3e5c3ac93e0d64912_original.jpg?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1488399766\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=cedeb776dc66979f0e66951731aae202\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-weight: inherit;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
