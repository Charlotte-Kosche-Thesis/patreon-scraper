We play music from and inspired by a variety of cultures, past and present. Our music includes songs and instruments from several traditions, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMedieval European\u003cbr\u003eEastern European\u003cbr\u003eRoma (gypsy)\u003cbr\u003eSpanish\u003cbr\u003eSephardic\u003cbr\u003eFrench\u003cbr\u003eGreek \u003cbr\u003eTurkish\u003cbr\u003eMiddle Eastern\u003cbr\u003eScandinavian\u003cbr\u003eCeltic\u003cbr\u003eBalkan\u003cbr\u003eand others\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWine and Alchemy was established in 2008 as a collaborative music project bringing diverse cultural and musical influences together to create a new fusion of sound. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the director and original member of the band, Roxanne Bruscha. I began working on the project from a base in World Fusion Belly Dance. Having performed for several years as a dancer in a traditional dance troupe and then as a music and dance company director, I had a strong background in both Middle Eastern and Balkan music as well as theater staging. I\u0027m currently the singer, dancer and harmonium and hurdy gurdy payer for Wine and Alchemy as well as the manager.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work with a large and growing pool of musicians from several backgrounds. Instruments featured in Wine and Alchemy recordings and/or performances include:\u003cbr\u003e* Hurdy Gurdy\u003cbr\u003e* Lavta\u003cbr\u003e* Harmonium\u003cbr\u003e* Oud\u003cbr\u003e* Violin\u003cbr\u003e* Viola da Gamba\u003cbr\u003e* Accordion\u003cbr\u003e* Sitar\u003cbr\u003e* Portuguese Guitar\u003cbr\u003e* Greek Bouzouki\u003cbr\u003e* Guitar\u003cbr\u003e* Bass\u003cbr\u003e* Middle Eastern Drums\u003cbr\u003e* and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been touring the US since 2008, primarily playing at renaissance festivals. The journey has brought us into contact with some truly fabulous folks and patrons of the arts, for whom we are extremely grateful. We wouldn\u0027t be doing this without them (you). :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the years have gone by we\u0027ve become more and more aware of the growing online, music loving community and the shift in music distribution from live shows and physical CD\u0027s to online access and digital media. We\u0027ve decided to create this account to give our friends and fans a chance to engage more with us, gain access to special jam sessions, and observe some of the creative process outside of our live performances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you enjoy our page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information about the band, news, photos, mp3\u0027s and show dates, please visit our website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.wineandalchemy.com\"\u003ewww.wineandalchemy.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

The journey is just over 612km, that\u0027s 380 miles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many routes to Santiago. We\u0027ve chosen to take the \nPortuguese Way, which was walked in the past by King Sancho II (1244), \nQueen Isabel of Portugal (1326 and\n1335) and painter,\narchitect and humanist Francisco de Holanda (1549), among countless \nothers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been wanting to do this pilgrimage since I first heard about the medieval pilgrimage trail in a college literature class back in 2001. The history behind it, as well as the countries the trail goes through, are potentially rich sources of inspiration for us as music artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere always seems to be a great many reasons why we cannot afford the time or money to take this trip. And right now is no exception. But there are always sensible reasons not to undertake creative or life-changing projects. So, we\u0027re going for it anyway! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve pooled our scant savings (and after the financially devastating winter gig debacle, savings are indeed scant) and booked the tickets. Because booking air travel tickets is the best way we know to commit ourselves to action. As it stands we\u0027ll be close to broke on the trail and even broker when we return. While it\u0027s worth it, we won\u0027t scorn any support we can get. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur plan is to spend the trip seeking inspiration. We will visit historic sites, write and play music, and just imbibe as much of the Portuguese and Galician culture as possible during the entire course of the pilgrimage. This time is much needed to reset our minds, cleanse our souls, and reach out into the universe, both spacial and temporally, to bring more music into our world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all goes well, we hope to compile our compositions from the experience into a full length studio recording later this summer. :-) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
