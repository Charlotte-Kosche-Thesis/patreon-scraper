    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e***INTRO VIDEO COMING SOON, I PROMISE***\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t want to waste your precious time, so for my full bio and my background as an artist (as well as my fav music, TV, and film), you can check out my \"about\" section on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/writersdelite/about/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Facebook page\u003c/a\u003e (which you should like!).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTrying to make it as an artist (without starving) is an uphill climb in general. Add to that the barriers that come with not being white, not being straight, not being a man, being disabled, being poor, and being fat and I\u0027m sure you can imagine that being Black, multiply disabled, poor (and living in the projects), bisexual, fat, AND a woman would make it like...well, some would say damn near impossible for me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I \u003cem\u003edon\u0027t \u003c/em\u003ebelieve it\u0027s impossible. If it were, I would\u0027ve given up a long time ago.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, to make it as a multiply marginalized artist in a capitalist society that doesn\u0027t value art (not really anyway), I need YOUR help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been unemployed (in the traditional sense) for over three years as of mid-April 2017. It\u0027s no secret that traditional employment and hiring discrimination is a systemic thing for all of the marginalized groups to which I belong (especially being disabled) individually; together I\u0027m lucky I\u0027ve ever even had interviews. In addition to that hurdle, there are many barriers to getting help in the interim (which I won\u0027t go into detail about here). I started freelance writing regularly in April 2016 to try to bring in some type of income, but it\u0027s simply not feasible for me to sustain long-term and support myself with that alone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, if you support me, your money will go toward a variety of things, besides the obvious paying a marginalized artist for their labor (this list isn\u0027t exhaustive because I don\u0027t want this overview to be too long):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1)\u00a0paying submission fees for a variety of screenwriting and filmmaking contests as well as related events where I can network and learn\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e2) paying for equipment and folks\u0027 labor (actors, film editors, cinematographers, etc.) in order to make (very) short films (which would be shared here, of course!). I have short and feature film ideas in various genres, including drama, horror, superhero/fantasy, and comedy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e3) paying for travel (planes, trains, hotels/motels, spending money for food) so that I can share my art in other places (when those places don\u0027t cover it) as well as covering those costs when (if??? *sobs*) I get accepted to important screenwriting labs or fellowships, as those things generally aren\u0027t covered\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e4) promotional costs (paying for ads on Facebook and Twitter, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e5) support my various activist work (including my writing, upcoming webinars, panels, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6) I hope to be able to hire a part-time social media manager within the year because, particularly with my disabilities, I can see now that I\u0027m going to need some help if I want my campaigns and online presence to be effective and lucrative. Oh. My. God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel like this is more than long enough already, but I\u0027ll just say this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that as an artist I have a responsibility beyond entertainment, to be a truth teller (as Paul Robeson once said), to reflect the times (as Nina Simone once said), to speak with and for the people, to give marginalized groups the visibility and representation we\u0027ve long deserved, to heal, to love, to liberate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you support *that,* you should support *me* - so that as a multiply marginalized artist I can continue to do that without wondering how I\u0027ll pay my bills every month, without worrying when I\u0027ll be able to finally get my pets fixed, without pacing back and forth about how I\u0027ll pay for the next screenwriting contest fee, without without without.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you have the means and believe in the arts; if you know that there are many barriers to marginalized artists - let alone multiply marginalized artists - breaking into various arts industries; if you believe strongly in supporting artists who are striving to bring a variety of stories to the forefront, who believe in truth telling, then you know what to do - support and share!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for reading!"
