    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eHi, I\u0027m Sam and my cancer was hilarious! It also made me a better person and my friends and I want you to help us make the world better! I\u0027ll tell you about that in a minute. First I want you to laugh at my cancer, that had a kind of Grumpy Cat quality. You didn\u0027t want to kill my cancer as much as post photos of it on the internet with captions like \"I\u0027m in ur flesh, stealin\u0027 ur mojo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/files/patreon/MyCancer.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut with cancer, even when you know you\u0027re safe, there\u0027s always a small part of you that freaks the fuck out! It\u0027s true my cancer was no threat. I had just been slowly letting my soul die, little by little, engineering software for start-up yuppies to sell cars and condos. The cancer reminded me that I still had a soul, and a voice, and damnit, why shouldn\u0027t I do something with it?! Why wasn\u0027t I out there getting in trouble and challenging the status quo?! Why wasn\u0027t I solving real problems and raising consciousness about important issues?! Why wasn\u0027t I telling more dick jokes?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/files/patreon/DickJokes.png\"\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I changed. I \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/2016\"\u003equit my $80/hr engineering job\u003c/a\u003e to make \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/2016Review\"\u003elaughter for a better world!\u003c/a\u003e What do I mean by that? Like many of my inspirations, people like Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, Larry Wilmore, John Oliver, and Adam Conover, my goals are to make you laugh, and also to help raise consciousness about important issues and share solutions to problems we all have. You might call me a philanthro-comedian, a humor-nitarian, or a laugh-tivist! I\u0027m joking it forward!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince 2006, I do most of this on my webcomic, \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com\"\u003eWoohooligan!\u003c/a\u003e So far I\u0027ve made cartoons and articles about \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/205\"\u003ethe meaning of life,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/298\"\u003eStar Wars,\u003c/a\u003e the election of \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/282\"\u003eDonald Trump,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/129\"\u003eStar Trek,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/271\"\u003egender equality,\u003c/a\u003e comic books like \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/272\"\u003eBatMan,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/257\"\u003eracism,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/309\"\u003evideo games,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/310\"\u003eautism,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/118\"\u003ehuman nature\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/285\"\u003efake news,\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/206\"\u003efree speech.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe coolest part of all of this is that you can help! Are you a helpful person? Do you want to create a better world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/205\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/files/patreon/LifeLessons.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are several different ways you can help. One way is by hanging out and talking with us in the comments on the site. You can follow us on \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/datafaucet\"\u003eTwitter,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/woohooligan\"\u003eFacebook,\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://woohooligancomics.tumblr.com\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e (mostly webcomic reviews). You can also join our mailing list \u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com\"\u003eon our site\u003c/a\u003e (just below the comic). It\u0027s often conversations with friends and fans that inspire my work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother way you can help is by sharing the comics with your friends or blogging about them. Personally, I think some of my work would be great for an article on \u003ca href=\"http://www.upworthy.com\"\u003eUpworthy!\u003c/a\u003e If you could \u003ca href=\"https://blog.upworthy.com/how-to-get-your-freelance-story-published-on-upworthy-7a2330b481d4\"\u003ehelp me write that pitch,\u003c/a\u003e that would be fantastic! :D\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/files/patreon/Waldo.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 250px;\"\u003eHere\u0027s another way you can help. My friend Andy shocked me the other day when he volunteered to help me get a new seat and tail-light for our car at the junkyard. If you\u0027ve ever moved, you know most of your friends are harder to find than Waldo, so Andy\u0027s offer to help with repairs was surprising enough. Then he slaps down sixty bucks on the counter before I can get to my wallet! On the way home, he explained that he\u0027d been thinking about my Patreon page, because I asked for advice about how to improve it. I didn\u0027t ask for a pledge, but he said he was thinking about pledging and didn\u0027t have much to spare in his budget. Then he said, \"I thought about pledging a dollar, but it felt really douchey. Hey, you\u0027re a friend, here\u0027s a buck!\" But there he was, explaining why he didn\u0027t pledge, having just given me five YEARS worth of that pledge, because he wanted to help out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I get it, I\u0027d probably feel the same way. Then I realized that I might have a lot of other friends and fans in that same position, wanting to help us make the world a better place, and feeling bad about that dollar pledge. After all, the world is a big place with a lot of problems, how could a dollar really help? Well don\u0027t feel bad! I don\u0027t want our laughtivism to be a burden for anyone, I want it to be affordable. That dollar pledge is only three cents a day, you probably lose that much in your couch cushions! Patreon makes it easy to support your favorite artists every month, with no obligation, cancel at any time. And how cool is it that those pennies support important social change? More gender equality! More GLBT rights! More dick jokes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of my work is free for everyone to enjoy on our website and your three cents helps me pay bills and buy groceries so I can keep joking-it-forward and making the world better. If you\u0027re ready to help support our laughs and a better world, just click on one of the pledge levels on the right. Even for that three cents a day, I\u0027m always looking for ways to reward you for that generosity, with bonus comics, previews, etc. Whether you pledge or not, thank you for being an important part of our cause, a laughtivist, a rebel, a hooligan! Stay awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/comics/298\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.woohooligan.com/files/patreon/StarWars.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003ep.s. If you are a webcomic creator, I\u0027m now offering reviews to help you out, because I know how hard you work and how hard it is to get exposure.
