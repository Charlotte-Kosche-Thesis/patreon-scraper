    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Writer\u0027s Atelier and Who is its Founder?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mission of Writer\u2019s Atelier is to encourage writers to have the confidence to believe in their writing while they also work to improve it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Racquel Henry and I initially started Writer\u2019s Atelier as a project. I\u0027m a writer and editor with an MFA from Fairleigh Dickinson University and wanted to put my passion for writing and editing to good use. It is also imperative that I help other writers succeed. I began editing back in college for free and then slowly progressed to charging for my editorial services. Now I edit everything from books to academic essays, to websites to newsletters, to my own literary magazine (Black Fox Literary Magazine). I\u0027ve always had the vision of expanding Writer\u0027s Atelier into something greater, something more concrete. I wanted it to be a physical space for writers to create, perfect their craft, and meet other writers. I believe that there are many components to being a writer, but there are a few critical ones. You must actually write, you must commit to a lifetime of learning about the craft, and you must surround yourself with other writers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI finally got the opportunity to expand Writer\u0027s Atelier into a physical structure that supports our mission. Writer\u2019s Atelier is now a place writers can visit to associate or network with other writers and improve their craft. The Writer\u2019s Atelier facility is a space where other literary groups can gather, host writing workshops and host other small literary events. Above all, Writer\u2019s Atelier is a safe space. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile I wholeheartedly love running the space, it isn\u0027t quite to the profitable stage. I currently work three jobs to cover operational costs. We need to pay for things like rent, electricity, wireless Internet, website maintenance, the free coffee we give to writers at some of our events. We also have to buy things like toilet paper, paper towels, hand soap. Running the space isn\u0027t cheap, but I believe in the importance of having a place like this for our writing community. In fact, we often host free workshops and events, some of which we broadcast through our FB page. We recognize that many writers don\u0027t have the means to shell out tons of money on insanely priced workshops. If we do charge for a workshop we aim to keep the prices reasonable. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere are some of the services we provide:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Fiction Writers:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort Story Consultation\u003cbr\u003eNovel Consultation\u003cbr\u003eProofreading\u003cbr\u003eCoaching for Fiction Writers\u003cbr\u003eBook Formatting\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEditing and Proofreading for Individuals and Businesses:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigh School \u0026amp; College Essays\u003cbr\u003ePersonal Statements/Essays\u003cbr\u003eDissertations\u003cbr\u003eBrochures/Pamphlets\u003cbr\u003eBlog Posts\u003cbr\u003eArticles\u003cbr\u003eWebsite Content\u003cbr\u003ePrint Books and eBooks\u003cbr\u003eDocuments Produced in Microsoft Word\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiterary Events: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBook Signings/Launches/Releases\u003cbr\u003eWriting Workshops (In person and online, both free and paid)\u003cbr\u003eWriting Groups/Critique Groups\u003cbr\u003eReading Groups/Book Clubs\u003cbr\u003eReadings\u003cbr\u003eOpen Mic Events\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRentals:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConference room for private individual writing sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe also work closely with other literary organizations across central Florida. Organizations who have used our facility or have worked with us on events include The Jack Kerouac Project, Bookmark It Orlando, Burrow Press, The Drunken Odyssey with John King Podcast, Central Florida Romance Writers of America, Florida SCBWI, UCF MFA Creative Writing Program, Orange County Library System and more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen we host paid workshops, we\u0027re also providing income for other writers. Writer\u0027s Atelier instructors who teach paid workshops receive 65% of the profit. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We\u0027re Starting a Membership on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m juggling too many balls. I must work multiple jobs to keep the space going, but I\u0027d love to free up more time to invest in helping writers achieve their writing goals. I\u0027d love to reach more writers and have the business grow into an authoritative voice for writing. The thing is, that takes time and money. We have recently had a few volunteers step up to the plate, but we\u0027d like to pay them. If there was more consistent cash flow coming into the space, we could not only pay volunteers, but we could host more free and low cost events and workshops. We could produce more content and pay the folks who help us do so. We could make the space itself more comfortable. We\u0027d also eventually like to move into a space that\u0027s a bit more spacious and permanent (we currently rent). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Can Do to Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSign up for any level of our membership.
