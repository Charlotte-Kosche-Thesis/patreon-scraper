An awesome site that allows fans of the music, to become part of the music. It\u0027s actually even more than that. You become the engine that drives every aspect of the music, moving forward, always improving it and what can be achieved. Each dollar gets me closer to being able to make a covers album! I will always bring you the best quality music and videos I can physically give. I will be releasing a video creation every month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tWhere your money will go:\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make a covers album for you guys as a few people have said they\u0027d buy it if I had one! So that\u0027s the mission. If you\u0027re low on money (I know what that\u0027s all about!) don\u0027t feel obligated to become a Patron. I will continue to make music whether you donate or not, but of course if you do I can make more music, more frequently and get closer to my goal. Here\u0027s my first ever collaboration video with Sina, a drummer from Germany, all made possible by this site and the support of my amazing patrons.

     "about": "Wings of Pegasus, a hard rock band formed in 2009 from just outside London in England. Inspired by rock bands from the 80\u0027s such as Aerosmith, Def Leppard, Van Halen, Bon Jovi, but also aiming to have their own sound. The first album entitled \u0027Persistence\u0027 is self written, produced and released and can be found in the \u0027Store\u0027 section, as well as being available for download from iTunes and Amazon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started out playing gigs regularly in and around London and saving what we could to record our first E.P. Annoyingly, the general public aren\u0027t as interested in seeing unsigned live bands like they used to be. So after 2 years of gigging regularly to a guy with a dog in the pub, I decided it was time to broaden our horizons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 I recorded, produced and released all the songs we had been playing live. The result of this is the debut album, called \u0027Persistence\u0027,  as that\u0027s exactly what I personally think is the most important attribute to have in today\u0027s music industry. I started recording videos of myself performing covers on Youtube and promoting the band wherever and whenever I could through social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince adapting to a new approach, I have amassed over 13,000 likes on Facebook and a Twitter following of over 95,000. I\u0027ve sold albums and t-shirt from Brazil to Russia and are regularly asked when we are touring various countries. Sometimes I think people don\u0027t realize we do this part time, and like them, work during the day and rock out out at night! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope one day to be able to write and play music full time, but until then I\u0027ll continue to persist and do everything I can to reach our ultimate goal. Wings of Pegasus is a band like no other. If you message the band on Facebook or Twitter, I will reply to you, guaranteed. There are no \u0027invisible walls\u0027 between fans and the band and that\u0027s the way it should be. God knows we\u0027ve hit countless \u0027invisible walls\u0027 on our journey through the music industry, but I believe if we keep going and doing what we do, somethings going to give. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the 19th March 2016 we performed our first ever \u0027online\u0027 gig called \u0027Shock to the System\u0027, the video of which can be found in the store section of the website. Since this gig we\u0027re now rated the \u0027No.1 Indie Rock Band\u0027 in the country by Reverbnation.com which is pretty cool! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have amazing fans that contact us regularly on Facebook and Twitter. The following we have is as good, if not better, than some similar \u0027signed\u0027 bands. So maybe being \u0027signed\u0027 isn\u0027t all it\u0027s cracked up to be? Who knows, all I know is I love chatting to people who like our music and I\u0027ll always keep pushing forward and replying to anyone who is interested in us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn August 2016 I remixed the debut album and had it remastered by Fluid mastering, the difference to the original tracks is phenomenal! These new versions of the track will replace the old \u0027demo\u0027s\u0027 as I am now calling them! Head over to the store section to get your hands on an album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to come and say hi on Facebook or Twitter and join the Wings of Pegasus army! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFil\u003cbr\u003eWings of Pegasus",
