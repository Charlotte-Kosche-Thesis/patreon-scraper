    "summary": "My name is Lucy, and I am an artist.\u003cbr\u003eCorsetry is my chosen art form - dressmaking is all too often overlooked as an art form, until recently it was something your grandma did, and certainly not \"proper\" art like painting or sculpture.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am here to change that perception.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do, and other people seem to love it too. I am very proud of the fact a number of people within the corset making world have told me I was their inspiration for starting, or that they are in love with my work. I am also really honoured to have a fan base of more than 13000 fans on Facebook. I want to be able to dedicate time to creating things to share with you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough this page I aim to raise the funds to justify creating show stopping pieces, and collaborate with other artists to showcase them. I want you to have the chance to see how my work is born - from concept to creation. I want to share with you my skill set, the progress I am making learning new techniques, and the projects I have lined up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart for considering helping me on my journey as an artist. To know that other people like what I am doing and want to see more of my work in the future is a very special feeling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me but cannot justify\u00a0 monthly donation, please consider contributing to my Ko-Fi at http://ko-fi.com/waisted\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
