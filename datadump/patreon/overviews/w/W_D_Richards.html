    "summary": "I am William D. Richards, author of \u003cem\u003eAggadeh Chronicles\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and a few more stories that are waiting in the wings to be completed and launched. Aggadeh Chronicles is an epic fantasy series that follows Nem Aster\u0027s adventures as he travels through the Aggadeh Empire. Is he the one who will save the world? Or destroy it? The first book in the series,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.williamdrichards.com/titles.html#nobody\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNobody\u003c/a\u003e, is available as an ebook on all major platforms. \u003cem\u003eDragon\u003c/em\u003e will be released soon as an ebook, and both titles will be released in print as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I also have a number of hard science fiction titles in the wings. A space opera called \u003cem\u003ePrivateer\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and another entitled \u003cem\u003eThe Stars Within My Grasp\u003c/em\u003e. I just started work on a new series, \u003cem\u003eThe Science of Magic\u003c/em\u003e, which takes a more modern look at magic through the eyes of Martin, an unwitting apprentice in the world of magic. \u003cem\u003eTSOM\u003c/em\u003e seems to lend itself well to being serialized novellas. This means quick writing and high throughput due to shorter stories. It\u0027s episodic nature might also lend itself well to other media adaptations.\u00a0For an indication of the some of the work to come, I created a page on my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.williamdrichards.com/manuscripts.html\"\u003elisting the current manuscripts\u003c/a\u003e I am developing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to open a Patreon page because I found that not only was part time work not paying the bills, it was sapping time and energy away from writing the stories my readers want to read. It\u0027s time to make a change so I can put more energy into writing instead of worthless endeavor. I have too many stories I want to have written and not enough time to get it all done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach dollar donated increases the time I can devote to bringing all these worlds to life for you to read!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things I enjoy doing is riding motorcycles. Not to induce an adrenaline rush, but because I find it meditative and relaxing. Clearing my mind as I ride is a good way to open the mind to new story ideas. So, enjoy the above video! (The music is \"\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/holding-hands/id289192230?i=289192231\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHolding Hands\u003c/a\u003e\" by Ryan Farish on his Wonderfall album."
