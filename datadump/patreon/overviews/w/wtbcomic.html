    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u0027m Neal\u003c/strong\u003e, and I haven\u0027t had a boss in four years!  (Hi, Neal!)  I\u0027d like to keep it that way.  Currently I make the bulk of my living from my tutoring company, but I would like to shift that balance over to my other business, my webcomic, \"With the Band.\"  At its core, \"With the Band\" is about a group of four musicians trying to navigate the independent music scene, such as it is these days, but WtB also satirizes politics, education, pop culture, and whatever else catches my attention deficit at any given time.  Oh, and squirrels.  \"With the Band\" is also about squirrels.  Lots and lots of squirrels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often does \"With the Band\" post?\u003c/strong\u003e  That\u0027s an excellent question I anticipated!  WtB posts new tracks every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, fifty weeks out of the year (I take two weeks off to party, but I always post something even on my vacation days). \u00a0That\u0027s a fraction over twelve strips per month, 150 tracks per year. \u00a0WtB is and will remain free, but if you like what you read, be a mensch and pay a bit for it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your patronage will mean to me\u003c/strong\u003e: First and foremost it will allow me to remain clothed, housed, and fed, all of which are quite valuable to me!  It will also allow me to make more awesome WtB merchandise, such as more t-shirts, print comics, books, stuffed squirrels, and maybe even albums of the band\u0027s music!  Did I mention squirrels?  Of the stuffed variety?  Those too!  Eventually, your patronage will allow me to expand wtbcomic.com to include postings of classic \"With the Band\" strips from its original incarnation in a local New Hampshire print magazine in the 90s, weekly reviews of books, movies, television shows, comics, and games, spin off comics about Super Squirrels, Josh and Mo, or a comic illustrated Bible, and even some possible animated shorts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Squirrelverine!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0He\u0027s the best there is at what he chews, but what he chews isn\u0027t very nice. \u00a0Our next Milestone Goal at $100/month is a spin-off webcomic: \"Squirrelverine!\" \u00a0A panel-by-panel, page-by-page tribute to the Clairmont/Miller \"Wolverine\" limited series comic, \"Squirrelverine will post one page a week each Saturday for the full run of the comic (approximately 104 pages plus four covers).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Milestone Goals:\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0At $200/month, we\u0027ll add a T-Shirt of the Whenever--whenever Groupie Squirrel Tees creates a new t-shirt, all Patrons at the $5+ level will get a shirt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards:\u003c/strong\u003e  For $2/month ($0.17/strip), you\u0027ll get my undying thanks and your name (and a link to your website, if you so wish) on wtbcomic.com\u0027s Patrons of the Arts page.  For $5/month ($0.42/strip), we\u0027ll send you a postcard with the Squirrel-of-the-Month on it, plus the previous reward.  For $10/month ($0.83/strip), we\u0027ll send you a sticker with the Squirrel-of-the-Month on it, plus the first reward.  For $25/month ($2.08/strip), we\u0027ll send you a Lute Crate each month, filled with random items of squirrelly goodness, including, but not limited to, the postcards-of-the-month, the stickers-of-the-month, your name and website on our Patrons page, a book/CD/DVD/game from our extensive collection, and other things that strike our fancy, with more and better Rewards to come as Milestones are reached (such as the T-Shirt-of-the-Whenever, which will, eventually, become the T-Shirt-of-the-Month!)."
