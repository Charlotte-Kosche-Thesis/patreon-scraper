There\u0027s just something about people in tights wailing on each other that just speaks to the heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWaiting for the Trade is a comic that comes out three times a week, taking a look at the odd continuity quirks of our favorite cape books. Whether it\u0027s detangling the Maximoff family tree or finding out out why Kitty Pryde has quite so many Gal Pals, Waiting for the Trade is a fun time for any fan of the Big Two."
