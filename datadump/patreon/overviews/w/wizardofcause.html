At present, the meager income from the two jobs I work is not actually enough to keep me afloat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince initially launching this campaign, I have since expanded to claiming 4 or 5 occupations, depending on how you look at it. I\u0027d really like to move on from, or at least scale back at my day job so I can focus on creating content and you, wondrous, brilliant people are part and parcel with that plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you will see, I have laid out a broad array of sustainer rewards and look forward to fulfilling said promises for those who contribute as we move forward. Short of that however, thank you for your consideration and I hope you enjoy my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003e(PS: If the video hosted here is banned in your country, you\u0027re probably from Germany.
