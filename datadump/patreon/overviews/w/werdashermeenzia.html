    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EwycT1m.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a Pakistani woman born and based in Lahore, Pakistan who started writing poetry to cope with being an empath and of course, to sort through my own emotions. I am a Fulbright Scholar, an NYU alumna, a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/werdashermeenzia\"\u003epoetess\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://servicemarket.com/en/blog/author/werda\"\u003ea blog content writer\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EkS5MzY.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore 2014, I had never shared any of my poems. Trauma at the end of 2014 made me weirdly reckless and I created and started sharing my work on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/werdashermeenzia\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Facebook page\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0The feedback, quite surprisingly, was overwhelmingly positive. It made me realize that sharing my own experiences and observations through poetry helped me connect with people the world over. It also made me realize that I wanted to write full-time. Taking time out to write, unfortunately, has gotten harder ever since I returned back from graduate school in New York.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePakistan isn\u0027t a place where women live alone. Yet after returning from New York, I realized I wanted to be completely independent. I did what no woman that I personally know of in Pakistan has done: I moved out of my parents home while living in the same city (sure, some women move out if they have to work somewhere far away, but even that is pretty rare). I started working in the digital marketing industry as a senior content writer and started to find myself with a serious lack of time or energy for poetry writing, specifically editing poetry and designing poetry images for posting on Facebook. When you churn out articles on topics such as plumbing, interior decor, cleaning, etc. you face a lot of hurdles such as exhaustion and lack of motivation for getting your stuff out there when you return home. And then there is the added stress of making ends meet as I struggle my way to becoming a strong, independent woman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStumbling upon Patreon, however, has given me hope. If I get paid to make art, I can worry less about living expenses, I can switch to freelance work and focus on writing on topics I love to write on and eventually I can (hopefully) switch to writing poetry full-time. I\u00a0definitely do not want to move back in with my parents. I love them, but I love my freedom and breaking stereotypes as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I post poems intermittently. I have no schedule and sometimes I lose all motivation to continue maintaining my Facebook page. Yet I write. I write everyday. Whether in a notebook, or on a tissue paper, or in the notepad on my laptop or on my cell phone. I have so, so much material that I want to refine and put out there. However clich\u00e9d it sounds, I think I have found my calling and I\u0027d like to give it the time it deserves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vAZLcqC.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis brings me to the Roses Are Black Project (BRP). That is the name of my first poetry book. Why this name, you might be wondering. My mother named me Werda because she read in a baby names book that it meant black rose. Name meanings are important in Pakistan. I was bullied about the meaning as a child. I came to dislike my name. Now, though, I have come to love it and I embrace all its meanings that I ever come across. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the book, I\u00a0would like to have the manuscript ready by August 2018. Why August? August 2014 was when the trauma happened and I think it will be a nice flash of lightening to show the world how far I have come and how strong I have become. Don\u0027t worry though, my poetry isn\u0027t just black. It has many shades, emotions and back stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides poetry, the book will have hand drawn sketches of my favorite flowers. And no, it won\u0027t just be roses. I will leave the sketches as a surprise, but I will be sharing parts of the manuscript building process with you depending on your level of support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will start with posting 3 poems a month for all Patrons and if I seem to get closer to my goal of working from home as a freelancer or writing for myself full-time, I will increase the number of poems that I share each month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider this a Patreon with a purpose. If I do not have a manuscript ready by August 2018 and the book self-published within three months of achieving my second goal on Patreon, I will shut it down. It would mean I have failed you and myself. However, I will strive to make sure that that doesn\u0027t happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tw8kGiV.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you will get digital access to my work. You will get sneak peeks into the BRP, micropoems, poems and even short stories as rewards at various backers and milestone levels. While anything from the BRP will be something for your eyes only till the book gets published, other work might reappear elsewhere. As a backer, though, you will get to read it long before anyone else does.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work will always be of varying lengths and on varying topics. I write on human emotions, real life events, current affairs, preternatural and supernatural beings and nature. I can guarantee that you will never be bored of anything I send you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes, depending on how well this Patreon does, you will get physical rewards. But because this Patreon is about helping me make it as a full-time writer while living independently in Pakistan, the physical rewards will be few and far between. Shipping worldwide is expensive folks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know my potential. I know I will keep writing. You can get my writing out faster, and you can help me keep breaking stereotypes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
