    "summary": "Welcome to Weapon of Choice Podcast, a show where creatives across mediums give us insight into the weaponry of their art. Each episode you\u0027ll be hearing an interview with an artist who uses their art as a \"weapon of choice\" for (but not limited to) social change and disruption, visibility and justice, cultural critique resistance, among other things that ignite social consciousness and community action. \u003cbr\u003eThese artists will tell us about their journey, the battles they are fighting, how they design, sharpen, and develop their artistic weapons to strike a blow against injustice in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDID YOU KNOW that 95% of people appreciate art but only 27% of people appreciate the artists themselves? One of our main focuses on Weapon of Choice is to bridge that astronomical gap!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe enjoy hosting robust discussions that explore different perspectives. Through these conversations we are creating a repository of stories, a historical archive. Your support goes a long way in getting us to that goal, and your dollars will make us that much stronger in building a lasting Weapon of Choice community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to continue to produce and publish new episodes \u003cstrong\u003eweekly\u003c/strong\u003e. It takes money to make this show. Your support, your pitching in with fellow listeners is our most important source of funding. With your help we can reliably plan and grow, and continue to improve the quality of this work and have more reach.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
