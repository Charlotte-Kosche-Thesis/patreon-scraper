Presumably, you\u0027re here from one of my gallery pages, but if not; Hi! I\u0027m Wolfblade. I\u0027ve been active in the Furry Fandom for over 15 years now, and have been sharing my scribbles for just as long, and hope to keep doing so into the future! I\u0027ve been working full-time on personal commission work for the past several years, but doing so leaves very little time to really show my appreciation for ALL my watchers/fans/followers, not just the ones who can afford to commission me. Being dependent solely on personal commission work also doesn\u0027t leave room for more general-appeal projects and offerings I\u0027d like to do for everyone\u0027s enjoyment, things like folios, comics, games, and just more finished art to share. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183,221,232); color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eWhat is this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is like a never-ending kickstarter. Rather than fund a single specific project, fans of content creators\u0027 work can contribute as much or as little as they want, to keep us free to work on the content you all enjoy. For me personally, paying the bills depends on personal commission work, drawing for individuals, producing the content they each want to see. The more support this Patreon page generates, the more I\u0027ll be able to afford spending my\u00a0 time working on my own projects and ideas that (I hope) will be of more general interest to my broader audience. I\u0027ll also be able to put more time into interacting with you guys, through more public streams, as well as patron-exclusive streams and chats where I may sometimes take free sketch requests and whatever other goodies I can come up with to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183,221,232);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183,221,232);\"\u003eHow This Works:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183,221,232);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, you can pledge to contribute a certain amount per month to keep me working on projects I think many people will enjoy. I\u0027m doing a per-month model rather than per-release because I\u0027ll be sharing a fairly steady stream of content, and don\u0027t want to nickel and dime you guys to pieces. You can change your pledge amount or cancel entirely at any time, but please remember that Patreon collects initial pledge payments at the time you make your pledge, and then charges on the 1st of every month after that. So keep in mind, if you pledge at the end of the month, you\u0027ll be charged again on the first - or be sure to cancel before the first if you just want to make a one-time contribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting more regularly to my public galleries, but I\u0027ll be releasing new and old unposted work on a monthly basis to contributors first, as well as things like patron-only stream or Q\u0026amp;A chat sessions, free sketch giveaways, all the stuff listed in the Reward section below, plus whatever else I can think of (and I\u0027m open to suggestions!) to make this fun for you and me, and worth your while. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183,221,232);\"\u003eMost Importantly!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than anything else, this thing is about saying \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(146,205,220);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(146,205,220);\"\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Appreciation is the key. I wouldn\u0027t still be doing this without the support and encouragement - and I mean words and well-wishing too, not just money - of countless fans, watchers, and friends over the years. While I don\u0027t want to dismiss or diminish in any way the appreciation I have for the people who\u0027ve kept me employed with commission work recently, I feel I\u0027ve fallen way behind on showing adequate appreciation for all of you out there supporting me in ways other than stuffing bills into my proverbial briefs. It\u0027s my hope that this will help me show my appreciation for more of my audience by being able to make more work that more of you can enjoy, and hopefully, appreciate in return. \u003cbr\u003e"

To my furry little brain, they just looked better that way. I was the only weird \u0027kid who draws dog-people\u0027 that I knew of till I was nearly done with high school, first found the internet, and very quickly stumbled onto Furry fandom. 15 years later, and now drawing these dog-people doing dog-people things pays my rent and puts food in my belly. I like drawing. I like food. Help keep me doing both! :3\u003cbr\u003e",
