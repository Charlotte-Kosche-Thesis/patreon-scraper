To say we had no idea what we were doing would be an understatement. But we had a need to share our love of all things horror in a way that was important and relevant to us as feminists. We had a need to share the conversations we\u0027d had between the two of us with the world. But mostly, we had the need to see if we could pull it off. And we did. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with your help, we can do more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause horror is amazing. No \"genre\" of entertainment can be so many things: sci fi, historical, western, family, LGBTQIA, and still scare the hell out of us. And make us cry. And cheer. And laugh. No other genre transcends media the way horror can: podcasts, television shows, video games, comics, and of course, movies. And no other genre has given us as many years of enjoyment as horror has. Let\u0027s face it, horror is fun. It\u0027s great to get scared. And now you can get scared with us."
