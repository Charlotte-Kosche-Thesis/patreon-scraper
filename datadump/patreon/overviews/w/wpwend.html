After we were hacked in December of 2014, I have had to manually add everything back because the backups my provider were making turned out to be corrupt. This has been a long haul to do.I already work a time/stress/energy intensive job, so any money coming in helps me to be able to devote more time to the archive and, frankly, pay the bills. I have done this website without charge or complaint since 2007 and I was really hessitent to even post this, but I believe content creators doing DIY work outside of the mainstream deserve patronage.\u00a0"
