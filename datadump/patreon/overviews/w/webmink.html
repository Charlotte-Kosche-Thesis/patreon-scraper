You may remember me from my days at large computer companies like IBM and Sun, but these days I\u0027m independent. I still write as often as I can, breaking news and providing comment on what\u0027s happening in open source, digital rights and free culture. During 2014 for example I was frequently first with the independent analysis of happenings like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/2847372/open-source-software/microsoft-must-finish-opening-net.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMicrosoft\u0027s opening of .Net\u003c/a\u003e, Google\u0027s support for ODF (a story I\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.computerworlduk.com/in-depth/applications/3590196/is-google-coming-back-open-community-on-document-formats/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebroke\u003c/a\u003e) and various \"fauxpen source\" startup strategies. Before that, I was the origin of useful ideas in open source like \"\u003ca href=\"http://webmink.com/essays/freedom-to-leave\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe freedom to leave\u003c/a\u003e is the reason to stay\", of various\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://webmink.com/essays/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewritten resources\u003c/a\u003e like a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://webmink.com/essays/#Value\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eseries of papers\u003c/a\u003e explaining open source to businesses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of what I spend my time on is voluntary work, such as serving on the boards of the Open Rights Group and The Document Foundation.
