Classical beauty and the sublime I love but so too the often overlooked, more mundane, even commonplace, I find, can be fascinating. What attracts me to a subject matter for painting material is difficult to describe except to say that something clicks within me and I know in an instant that I\u2019ve found something worthy of my sustained attention. Painting for me is really \u201cgetting into the zone\u201d; it\u2019s a meditative state \u2013 a spiritual, religious experience. My ultimate goal in creating a painting, in creating a work of art, besides creating something beautiful, is to portray a mood and have the viewer share an emotional experience. Leonardo said it best: \u201cPainting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen.\u201d",
