    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, fellow podcast listener! \u003c/strong\u003eIt means so much to me that you\u0027re here, even if just to look!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince March 2017, I have been writing podcast news, reviews, and musings at wilwilliams.reviews (formerly podcastproblems.wordpress.com). My recurring features include weekly roundups called This Week in Podcasts, in-depth recommendations called You Should Be Listening To, and tips on how to avoid common mistakes called Podcast Problems. Since October 2017, I\u0027ve also been running a weekly newsletter with even more information and analysis on the podcast industry, currently reaching over 120 subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince starting the site, I\u0027ve written over 150 posts, attended PodCon 2017, registered for Podcast Movement 2018, visited the PRX Podcast Garage, gotten myself a mic for recording interviews (and maybe future podcasts . . . who knows?), surpassed 35,000 siteviews, and looked into enrolling in audio production courses just to give better advice to creators . . . all while \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e working 40 hours a week in my day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron means that you\u0027ll get access to my planning and chat blog, where you can weigh in on (and see sneak previews of) upcoming posts. You\u0027ll get curated playlists of recommended podcasts based on the things you love. You\u0027ll be able to request reviews of podcasts, and even request articles I haven\u0027t thought of yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting thoughtful, honest podcast critiques with a focus on indie shows and audio dramas has become much more than a hobby for me, and with your help, I\u0027ll be able to invest in the future of podcast writing. Here are some things you\u0027ll be helping me cover:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore reviews, news, and musings, of course!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBetween listening, doing research, following up on emails, staying current, and trying to connect with the community, podcast writing takes \u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e. I listen to over 40 hours of podcasts in a week--about as much as my day job. With your help, I\u0027ll be able to write more columns and treat my writing with just as much care and attention as my day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore conferences, conventions, live shows, and other events!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen I went to PodCon 2017, registered for Podcast Movement 2018, and attended live tapings of podcasts, it\u0027s been completely funded on my own. This means that there have been \u003cem\u003eseveral\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0live podcast tapings I\u0027ve had to miss due to other expenses. With your help, I\u0027ll be able to cover more live shows, attend more events, and be able to travel to events more easily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore new columns!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are \u003cem\u003eso many\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0new columns I\u0027ve wanted to start but been unable to because they\u0027d be so costly. Whether it\u0027s a column about production, more reviews of common podcast sponsors like Casper, or interviews with more podcast creators, with your help, I\u0027ll be able to bring more and more new columns while improving the existing ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore coffee!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eY\u0027all I just . . . I just need a lot of coffee. Y\u0027all please, I just--I just need another cup of coffee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most of all, you\u0027ll be helping me talk up with beautiful, diverse, expansive new medium. You\u0027ll be helping small podcasts get more press and attention.\u00a0So thank you, (hopefully) new patron. With your help, we can grow this beautiful community even more together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e--Wil\u003c/div\u003e"
