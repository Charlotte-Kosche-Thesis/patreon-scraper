    "summary": "Hello everyone! This is Wonyumi Productions, but you can call me\nYumi. I create costumes and props, or how most people like to call it: Cosplays!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBu-ivTXYAE5dko.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m doing this since January 2014.\u00a0As\nsoon as I get home from work I rush right to my workbench to create whatever I\ncan think of. Creating costumes and props makes me happy and that is also where\nmy head note comes from: \u201eI build stuff.\u201c Because that\u2019s literally what I do.\nAnd you guys are the greatest support I can wish for: Because you share, like\nand comment my work, tell me your opinion about it and suggest new costumes to\ntackle.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy now I even started accepting commissions to refinance my\nprojects, which is helping me a lot to plan even bigger and crazier armors. So\nnow you are probably wondering:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nThen why did you create a Patreon page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI already started this page some time ago and even created \u201epatron-only\u201c\ncontent for it back then since I wanted to have something to offer for everyone\nwho spends money to support me. Of course I still had to take care of my\nYouTube channel, my Twitch stream, my projects, comissions and- surprise!- my\nreal life which contains a full time job. It was just too much work to do it\nall properly, so I decided to pause Patreon, YouTube and Twitch because I wasn\u2019t\nhappy with my content there any longer. My focus shifted in the course of time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u2019s why I decided to focus on my costumes- there is still\nso much to learn!-, my appearances at conventions, my workshops I hold as often\nas possible and social media.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I decided that everyone should be able to see whatever\ncontent I create, you can see\u00a0this page as my tip jar from now on. You want to support me\nwith a Dollar or two? Awesome, thank you so much! You don\u2019t want to and just\nfollow my work on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram? Still awesome because you won\u2019t\nmiss any content!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will also share all the updates from my work here- publicly, of\ncourse- so that everyone can see what\u2019s going on at the moment. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0Thank you so much for taking your time to read this.\u00a0Happy crafting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd last but not least: The photos above were taken by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.simply-photographs.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e~ simply photographs ~\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e"
