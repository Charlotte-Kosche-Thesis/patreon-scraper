He has a penchant for good single-malts, inept\nfootball teams, big daft dogs and the diary of Mr. Samuel Pepys. Abducted by\npirates at the age of twelve he quickly rose to captain the feared privateer \u2018\u003cem\u003eThe Mrs. Nesbitt\u003c/em\u003e\u2019 and terrorised the\nSkull Coast throughout his early twenties. Narrowly escaping the Revenue men by\ndressing as a burlesque dancer, he went on to work successively and\nsuccessfully as a burlesque dancer, a forester, a busker, and a magic carpet\nsalesman. The fact that he was once one of that forgotten company, the bus\nconductors, will immediately tell you that he is as old as the hills in which\nhe lives. Nowadays he spends his time writing, telling tall tales in his bio,\nand pretending to take good photographs. You can have a good laugh at his \u003ca href=\"http://cubicscats.wordpress.com/\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://wombat37.wordpress.com/\"\u003ehis photographs\u003c/a\u003e, but most of all\nplease go and mock him mercilessly on \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/wombat37\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\nor \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/wombatauthor\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e.

At the end of your first year at this level we\u0027ll get together (either online or in real life if that\u0027s feasible) and work out genre, plot, characters and so on. I will do all the writing, but you will be fully involved in the development and direction of the book, and be credited as co-author when it is published. If you then continue to support me at this level, the same will apply the following year (plus all the stuff from earlier tiers).\u003c/div\u003e",
